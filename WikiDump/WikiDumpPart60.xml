In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded.

== [[GarageBand‎]] ==

I notice in [[GarageBand‎]] that pages belonging to the book are disconnected with the rest of the book. I've went ahead and fixed them and moved pages that have already been created. For future reference [[WB:NEW]] and [[WB:NP]] provide information on how pages should be named in relatation to the rest of book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:59, 2 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

Reading your profile and your philosophy of education was so enlightening.  I find that in my journay to become a teacher most of my classes are filled with people wanting to become English teachers so I am really happy to have another prospective history teacher in one of my classes.  I actually could tell from what you wrote that you have a passion for life and for your family based on the way that you were writing your introduction.  Based on that I think that you will be an amazing teacher.  Teachers have to have passion to continue doing what they do every day and with your passion that you already have you should have no problems in my opinion.  
I also liked your pictures that you incorporated into your page.[[User:Sthur002|Sthur002]] ([[User talk:Sthur002|talk]]) 23:58, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi Elizabeth! I just wanted to tell you that I think you have a great teaching philosophy.  My mom is a high school biology teacher and all of her students consider her to be the best teacher they've ever had because she knows so much about her subject, is passionate about it, and connects to her students on a personal level. I think as teachers it is important for us to be able to connect with our students and for them to be comfortable around us in order for them to be able to enjoy their learning experience and comprehend the information taught  in our classrooms. I think in order to be a great teacher you need to be passionate about your job and the subjects you are teaching in order for your students to succeed.  Good luck in your path to becoming a teacher and have a great summer!

Hi Elizabeth,
Thank you for reviewing the article on homeschooling and including the specific areas where you found the author should make some improvements. I was a little confused by your ratings section. The bolded comments didn't match the ratings you listed underneath. For this section, it would be most helpful to your classmates if you either list the ratings and write a few sentences explaining why you gave the ratings you did OR if you make bold the parts of the rubric that you thought applied to the article. I think you may have just left bolded the parts of the rubric I bolded as an example. This may be confusing to the author. Maybe you can change it? I'd also take another look at the MC questions. I wouldn't agree with you that they all assessed application. You'll be asked to make this destinction on quizzes and exams and of course when preparing assessments for your future students so it may be worth your while to have a second glance.

== Cookbook ==

G'day Serafim, nice to see another new contributor to the Cookbook. You should probably read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page, and you might be interested in talking to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]].

Please don't add cooking temperatures to the time part of the recipe summary, however. Temperatures vary, may be specified in multiple ways (°C, °F, gas mark, etc.) and one recipe can have several temperatures throughout its procedure. Leave the temperature to the procedure, and just let the recipe summary give an indication of how long it takes to get to the final product. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:49, 4 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

      <comment>/* Autofilter examples */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MSFTOC}}

Metasploit provides functionality to automate exploitation via the '''''autopwn''''' command[http://blog.metasploit.com/2006/09/metasploit-30-automated-exploitation.html]. When you write a module, there are certain requirements for it to be used within the autopwn routine.

# Use a universal return address. Or
# Set a DefaultTarget. Or
# Define a method called &quot;autofilter&quot; within your module:

The method must return true or false.

This method is responsible for determining the correct target when used for automated exploitation. In the future, this method will be able to query the 
database to look for target-specific information about the target. The 
autofilter method can set the TARGET datastore value along with any other 
common parameters. As long as the final return value is true, the module 
will be executed as part of autopwn.

== Autofilter examples ==

&lt;pre&gt;
	def autofilter
		false
	end
&lt;/pre&gt;

... will prevent your module from being executed in autopwn. Should MSF one day be able to determine the target host via other means, autopwn will determine the target automatically.

&lt;pre&gt;

	def autofilter
		# Common vulnerability scanning tools report port 445/139
		# due to how they test for the vulnerability. Remap this
		# back to 2103 for automated exploitation
		
		rport = datastore['RPORT'].to_i
		if ( rport == 139 or rport == 445 )
			datastore['RPORT'] = 2103
		end
		
		# The NetBIOS hostname is required to exploit this bug reliably.
		if (not datastore['HNAME'])
			# XXX automatically determine the hostname
			return false
		end
		
		true
	end

&lt;/pre&gt;

... is an example where the module contains its own detection mechanisim.</text>

*'''Delete'''. DMOZ is not GFDL, and so we should not be making decisions to keep or delete content here based on the contents of that website.

* '''Delete''' Though I agree the information is valuable, I think that a simple link to even a non-GFDL website isn't a bad thing by any means, especially if that website is devoted to keeping a larger, better-maintained repository of exactly this information. IMO the textbook medium isn't the best for rapidly-changing information, this is one actual legitimate reason that textbook publishers need to make so many editions of some books (besides a wish to make money by shuffling question order, lets not go there).

This looks like utter garbage to me with zero educational value. For reference, this is step-by-step instructions to performing a &quot;dance&quot; from one episode of a discontinued television show. The performer of this dance was neither known for his dancing nor choreography abilities, which makes me doubt that there is any value to this material.  --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:17, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

*'''Weak Delete''' - While this page (it is hard to even call this a stub of a book) is an interesting example of ASCII art, there really isn't much substance here at all.  The last meaningful edit was in April 2006... and even that could be considered a dubious edit as it was just one relatively line of text.  The only defense I have of this book is that it isn't &quot;zero educational value&quot;, as this does depict some popular culture.  Crazy dances like this do get created from time to time, and it may be of some value to preserve even the idea that stuff like this does happen.  I just don't think this is necessarily the best way to preserve this sort of knowledge... as a small page stub that will likely never be read except during a VfD discussion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:10, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Testing the Connection on Linux or Mac OS X */ Image has been deleted</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">SwisTrack acts as a TCP server (default port: 3000) and can therefore easily be connected to other programs for further processing of the results. The text-based NMEA 0183 protocol (with optional checksum) is used to encode the data.

== Testing the Connection on Linux or Mac OS X ==

If you have &lt;i&gt;netcat&lt;/i&gt; installed on your system, type
&lt;pre&gt;nc HOSTNAME 3000&lt;/pre&gt;
to open a TCP connection to SwisTrack. Netcat will print messages from SwisTrack on your terminal, and send everything you type back to SwisTrack. (You could use &lt;i&gt;telnet&lt;/i&gt; as well, although telnet does more than just opening a TCP connection.) 

If you are using a recent version of bash, you can also type
&lt;pre&gt;cat &lt; /dev/tcp/HOSTNAME/3000&lt;/pre&gt;
on your bash shell to read all messages from SwisTrack. Note that this just prints messages from SwisTrack on your terminal, but doesn't send what you type.

== Testing the Connection on Windows ==

To connect to SwisTrack, launch HyperTerminal and select &quot;TCP / IP Winsock&quot; in the &quot;Connect To&quot; dialog. Set the host address to &quot;localhost&quot;, or the hostname / IP address of the computer SwisTrack is running on, and port number to 3000. When you click OK, HyperTerminal will establish a connection to SwisTrack. (Note that SwisTrack currently doesn't show whether a connection is open or not.)

[[Image:HyperTerminalConfiguration.png||HyperTerminal's configuration screen]]

If you are connecting from another computer, you may have to configure the firewall on the computer SwisTrack is running on to allow incoming connections on port 3000.

If you perform a step in SwisTrack now, with at least one output component (e.g. the [[SwisTrack/ComponentList/OutputParticles|Output Particles]] component) active, you will see a couple of lines appearing in the HyperTerminal window.

[[Image:HyperTerminalOutput.png||HyperTerminal with output from SwisTrack (two manual steps)]]

== Message Format ==

SwisTrack uses NMEA 0183 messages to exchange data with other programs. (Note that NMEA 0183 is more than just a message format, but SwisTrack does not use the other parts of the protocol.) Such messages look as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;$MESSAGE_TYPE,FIELD1,FIELD2,...FIELDn*XX&lt;/pre&gt;

where XX denotes the checksum, obtained by xor'ing all bytes between $ and *, and writing the result as two-digit hex number. SwisTrack always adds a checksum to outgoing messages, but doesn't require a checksum on incoming messages. Messages without a checksum or with a correct checksum are accepted, while messages with an incorrect checksum are discarded.

All messages start with a $ sign, and end with a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; (char 13 or 0xD, followed by char 10 or 0xA). The data fields are comma separated, and fractional numbers are written with a dot. The message type is a case-insensitive string of any length (as opposed to the standard which limits it to 5 characters).

=== Sample Code ===

Sample code for parsing NMEA messages in various programming languages is available in the [[SwisTrack/Examples/OutputProcessing|Examples/OutputProcessing]] folder of the SwisTrack SVN tree.

== Message Types ==

Output components are free to define their own message types. The documentation of these types is available on the corresponding [[SwisTrack/Components|output component description]].

Additionally, SwisTrack provides some built-in message types:

; SUBSCRIBE
: Tells SwisTrack to only send messages of a certain type, instead of all messages. For example, to receive only STEP_START and STEP_STOP messages, send the following message to SwisTrack:
: &lt;pre&gt;$SUBSCRIBE,STEP_START,STEP_STOP&lt;/pre&gt;
: To receive all messages again, send
: &lt;pre&gt;$SUBSCRIBE&lt;/pre&gt;
; STEP
: Executes a step, as if you had clicked on the &lt;i&gt;Step&lt;/i&gt; button in the toolbar. Example:
: &lt;pre&gt;$STEP&lt;/pre&gt;
; RUN
: Sets the running mode. Examples:
: &lt;pre&gt;$RUN,true          or          $RUN,false&lt;/pre&gt;
; START
: Starts the pipeline in testing or production mode mode. Examples
: &lt;pre&gt;$START          or          $START,production&lt;/pre&gt;
; STOP
: Stops the pipeline. Example: 
: &lt;pre&gt;$STOP&lt;/pre&gt;
; RELOADCONFIGURATION
: Reloads the configuration. Example: 
: &lt;pre&gt;$RELOADCONFIGURATION&lt;/pre&gt;
; BROADCAST
: Broadcasts a message to all SwisTrack clients. The first argument becomes the message type of the broadcasted message. This is useful if you want to insert information (e.g. state information) from another program. For example, your main experiment control program may broadcast the start of an experiment with
: &lt;pre&gt;$BROADCAST,EXPERIMENT_START,some_parameters&lt;/pre&gt;

== Interfacing SwisTrack from Linux or Mac OS X ==

The simplest way to log or process data from SwisTrack is to pipe the output into a [[w:Perl|Perl]] or a [[w:Python|Python]] script (or any other script language you like). If your version of bash supports /dev/tcp, then you could write
&lt;pre&gt;./my-filter-script.pl &lt; /dev/tcp/HOSTNAME/3000&lt;/pre&gt;
You can use &lt;i&gt;netcat&lt;/i&gt; as well:
&lt;pre&gt;nc HOSTNAME 3000 | ./my-filter-script.pl&lt;/pre&gt;
Sometimes, it is useful to write all data into a log file at the same time. To do this, you can sqeeze in &lt;i&gt;tee&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;nc HOSTNAME 3000 | tee mylogfile.txt | ./my-filter-script.pl&lt;/pre&gt;

If you also need to send commands to SwisTrack, then you have to open your own TCP connection from your script.

Sample scripts are available in the [[SwisTrack/Examples/OutputProcessing|Examples/OutputProcessing]] folder of the SwisTrack SVN tree.

== Interfacing SwisTrack from Windows ==

On Windows, you have to write a dedicated program which opens a TCP connection to SwisTrack. Sample code for parsing NMEA messages is available in the [[SwisTrack/Examples/OutputProcessing|Examples/OutputProcessing]] folder of the SwisTrack SVN tree.

== Cry for help answered ==

Yeah that looks great on the honor of marine invertabrates. I went through the honor and simplified some of the answers.

== Parallel Spectral Numerical Methods ==

Thanks for your help with the wikibook [[Parallel Spectral Numerical Methods]]. Have finished uploading most of the initial material. Any suggestions on formatting would be appreciated.

== Wrong: Table 1 - Atmospheric attenuation coefficient  (dB/km) at selected frequencies at 1 atm ==

Even at &quot;Engineering Acoustics/Outdoor Sound Propagation&quot;: At low temperatures are wrong figures. [[Special:Contributions/77.186.26.192|77.186.26.192]] ([[User talk:77.186.26.192|discuss]]) 08:23, 3 September 2013 (UTC)

== Counter vandalism bots ==

Dear Jomegat,
This is just a quick follow up from the folks working with the [[The_Devonshire_Manuscript]]. We were so glad of your help before, and are hoping you will point us in the right direction. We are hoping to ensure the longevity of the book and are looking for a way to keep on top of vandalism. We are all in favour of contributions and amendments to the text, but want to keep an eye out for destructive changes (ie wholesale deletions, profanity, and the like).  One of our team members, [[user:Cultures4]], has been looking into using bots -- do you have any advice on which ones we should consult and the kind of admin status we would need to use them? [[User:Cultures92|Cultures92]] ([[User talk:Cultures92|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cultures92|contribs]]) 16:58, 22 November 2013 (UTC)
:This would be better to post in a general discussion board, simply because I am not an expert on bots (and there are those here who are).  You can run a bot without any special permissions, but it is best to make small test runs first.  There is a bot flag which requires community approval, but all that does is flag the edit as having been made by a bot, and some people (many?) suppress bot edits when they view the recent changes page.  That said, it's probably not necessary to run your bot.  The people who patrol recent changes are almost certain to notice the kinds of vandalism you describe and revert it manually.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 21:26, 22 November 2013 (UTC)

== Help with article about Pathfinder ==

Hello Jomegat, okay? I request your help to adjust and correct the entry &quot;[[w:en:Pathfinders (Seventh-day Adventist)|Pathfinders (Seventh-day Adventist)]]&quot; of the English Wikipedia. Looking for your help, because you have declared &quot;Master Guide&quot; in Pathfinder, and the great work what you accomplished here at Wikibooks. I am also a &quot;Master Guide&quot; on Pathfinder, but I am Brazilian and I have little knowledge of English, which makes my job that entry. I thank you. [[User:Hallel|Hallel]] ([[User talk:Hallel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hallel|contribs]]) 01:43, 19 March 2014 (UTC)
:The last time I looked at that article, it needed some very serious help.  I will consider working on it if I can find some time. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 01:34, 20 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

==Ingredients==

* 9 New Mexico dry [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chiles]] - washed, with stems and seeds removed
* 3 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s water
* 5 [[Cookbook:pound|pound]]s boneless [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] chuck roast, trimmed of fat
* 1/2 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] kosher [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon black [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 large yellow [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* 2 cups beef [[Cookbook:stock|stock]] or water

==Procedure==

#Place chiles and 3 cups water into a medium stockpot, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and steep for 30 minutes to soften. Strain into a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid. Place the chiles and some of the liquid into a blender, and puree until smooth. Add more liquid as necessary to form a smooth sauce. Pass sauce through a fine mesh strainer to remove any seeds and the tough skins; set aside.
#Cut the roast into 1 to 2 inch chunks. In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge the beef chunks in the seasoned flour; set aside.
#Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté onion until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef chunks a few at a time, so as not to overcrowd the pot, and cook until evenly brown. Remove cooked meat, and continue browning remaining meat. Return reserved cooked meat to the pot. Stir in pureed chile mixture. Add beef stock to just cover beef chunks, or to personal preference. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to lowest setting, and simmer for 3 hours, or until meat is tender. If necessary, adjust with more stock during cooking.

=== Intent ===
* Implementing multiple interfaces without multiple inheritance and yet provide natural looking up-casting.
* Provide multiple implementations of the same interface in a single abstraction.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Signature of a virtual function in two independent interfaces provided by two independent
class libraries may collide. It is a problem especially when a single class has to 
implement both the colliding functions in different ways depending upon the interface you 
consider. For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Base1 /// Provided by Moon
{
  public:
      virtual int open (int) = 0;
      /* virtual */ ~Base1() {}  // No polymorphic deletion allowed
};

class Base2 /// Provided by Jupitor
{
  public:
      virtual int open (int) = 0;
      /* virtual */ ~Base2() {}  // No polymorphic deletion allowed
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2
{
  public:
    virtual int open (int i)
    {
      // Call from which base class?
      return 0;
    }
    /* virtual */ ~Derived () {}
};
&lt;/source&gt;
The inner class idiom can help solve this problem.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Leaving the interface classes, Base1 and Base2 unchanged we can implement
the Derived class as follows.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
class Base1  /// Provided by Moon
    {
 public:
  virtual int open() = 0;
  /* virtual */ ~Base1() {}  // No polymorphic deletion allowed
};

class Base2  /// Provided by Jupitor
    {
 public:
  virtual int open() = 0;
  /* virtual */ ~Base2() {}  // No polymorphic deletion allowed
};

class Derived  // Note no inheritance
    {
  class Base1_Impl;
  friend class Base1_Impl;
  class Base1_Impl : public Base1  // Note public inheritance
                     {
   public:
    Base1_Impl(Derived* p) : parent_(p) {}
    int open() override { return parent_-&gt;base1_open(); }

   private:
    Derived* parent_;
  } base1_obj;  // Note member object here.

  class Base2_Impl;
  friend class Base2_Impl;
  class Base2_Impl : public Base2  // Note public inheritance
                     {
   public:
    Base2_Impl(Derived* p) : parent_(p) {}
    int open() override { return parent_-&gt;base2_open(); }

   private:
    Derived* parent_;
  } base2_obj;  // Note member object here

  int base1_open() { return 111; }  /// implement
  int base2_open() { return 222; }  /// implement

 public:

  Derived() : base1_obj(this), base2_obj(this) {}

  operator Base1&amp;() { return base1_obj; }  /// convert to Base1&amp;
  operator Base2&amp;() { return base2_obj; }  /// convert to Base2&amp;
};                                         /// class Derived

int base1_open(Base1&amp; b1) { return b1.open(); }

int base2_open(Base2&amp; b2) { return b2.open(); }

int main(void) {
  Derived d;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; base1_open(d) &lt;&lt; std::endl;  // Like upcasting in inheritance.
  std::cout &lt;&lt; base2_open(d) &lt;&lt; std::endl;  // Like upcasting in inheritance.
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Note the use of conversion operators in class Derived. (Derived class is really not a derived class!) The conversion operators allow conversion of Derived to Base1 even though they don't share inheritance relationship themselves! Use of member objects base1_obj and base2_obj eliminates the concern of object lifetime. Lifetime of member objects is same as that of the Derived object.

'''SKILLS MEASURED''' 

Foundations skills are not product- or system-specific. They are a combination of minimal technical and non-technical skills and knowledge required for those interested in developing specific Internet skills as a designer, developer or administrator. The exam also requires a basic understanding of essential business practices that relate directly to Internet technologies. The 1D0-510 Domain 1.0 tests the following topics: 

=== Identify job roles ===
'''Identify job roles in the Information Technology (IT) industry, including the responsibilities, tasks and skills they require.'''

May include the following:

*Web Site Designer
*Web Architect
*Web Application Developer
*Web Site Analyst
*Web Site Manager
*Database Administrator
*Server Administrator
*Network Engineer
*Security Manager
*PC Technician
*Help Desk Technician

Additional information may be found at:

*[http://tcc.comptia.org/job_roles.aspx CompTIA Job Roles]
*[http://www.brainbench.com/xml/bb/business/productsservices/products/jobrole.xml BrainBench Job Role Descriptions]

=== Identify Internet infrastructures ===
'''Identify the infrastructure required to access the Internet, including hardware and software components.'''

*'''Backbone''' - The primary Internet structure consisting of high-speed WAN connections, servers, and ISPs.
*'''Network Access Point (NAP)''' - These are service providers with major Internet connection points. Most NAPs are divisions of communication companies.
*'''Internet Service Provider (ISP)''' - High speed connection points that provide dial-up and leased-line access to the Internet.

=== Define important Internet protocols ===
'''Define important Internet communications protocols and their roles in delivering basic Internet services.'''

*'''HTTP''' (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to commands. Uses TCP Port: 80 
*'''HTTPS''' (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer) - HTTPS is a Web protocol that encrypts and decrypts page requests and pages returned by the server. Uses TCP Port: 443 
*'''FTP - Control''' (File Transfer Protocol ) - FTP Control is used to open a connection to the FTP server. Uses TCP Port: 21 
*'''FTP - Data''' (File Transfer Protocol) - FTP Data is used to transfer data from a server or transfer data to a server (e.g., uploading a Web page file to a server). Uses TCP Port: 20 
*'''POP3''' (Post Office Protocol 3) - POP3 is a protocol used to retrieve e-mail from a mail server. Uses TCP Port: 110 
*'''SMTP''' (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - SMTP is a protocol used for sending e-mail messages between servers. Uses Port: 25 
*'''NNTP''' (Network News Transfer Protocol) - Used to post, distribute, and retrieve USENET messages. Uses TCP Port: 119 
*'''LPR''' (Line Printer Protocol) - Used primarily on Unix and Windows NT to send commands to network printers.
*'''LDAP''' (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) - Used for requesting names, locations, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses from network directories.
*'''Telnet''' - A terminal emulation program to remotely control Web servers. Uses TCP Port: 23 
*'''Gopher''' - A system for organizing and displaying files on Internet servers. Uses TCP Port: 70

=== Identify basic DNS principles ===
'''Identify the basic principles of the Domain Name System (DNS).'''

'''Domain Name Services (DNS)''' is a network service that associates and translates an alphanumeric host name with the dotted decimal TCP/IP address of a particular Internet host.

=== Identify basic web browser principles ===
'''Identify the functions of Web browsers, and use them to access the World Wide Web and other computer resources.'''

A '''Web browser''', also called a Web client, is a software application used for submitting requests for internet content to a Web server. These requests are submitted using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

All HTML files can be opened with a Web browser. Appearances may vary depending on the preferences set by the user. Browsers are limited in the number of colors and graphic formats displayed accurately. Browsers will display two text styles consistently: plain text (courier) and the browser default, usually Times Roman, but any default font can be specified in the preferences. Fonts can be scaled in HTML, but users can also select the base size at which fonts are displayed.

The most popular browsers currently in use include Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. They're basically the same technology, and have the following similar features:

* A '''browser window''' is used to display the text and graphics of a Web page.
* An '''Address or Locator bar''' that displays the URL of the current Web page and allows users to request an URL.  
* A '''menu bar and customizable toolbar''' at the top of the screen.
* '''Icons on the toolbar''' that permit the user to return to a pre-selected &quot;Home&quot; page, return to a recently viewed Web page, stop a page from loading, or open a search function.  
* '''Arrow buttons''' for forward or backward movement through a series of Web pages. 
* '''Scroll bars''' for moving the screen vertically and horizontally are located on the right side and bottom of the browser window. 
* A '''status bar''' at the bottom of the screen provides information about the Web page that is loading. 
* Web pages can be saved as '''Bookmarks or Favorites''' to be revisited later.
* '''Browser commands''' display information about the source of a Web page (raw HTML), URLs of the hyperlinks on a page, and the date of publication. 
* '''File management and editing tools''', such as printing, saving, and cut and paste are included in the browser toolbar.
* '''Email''' composition, transmission and management are supported.

=== Identify basic email principals ===
'''Use e-mail clients to send simple messages and files to other Internet users.'''

'''Internet e-mail clients''' are software applications used to communicate with SMTP servers. E-mail clients send mail using the SMTP protocol and download e-mail using theTCP/IP protocols, POP3, POP4, or IMAP.

Standard features of e-mail clients include the following:

* '''Inbox''' - Holds all incoming e-mail
* '''Outbox''' - Holds all e-mail waiting to be sent to the server
* '''Sent items''' - Holds duplicate copies of e-mail that has been sent
* '''Address book''' - A database of frequently used e-mail addresses

=== Define additional services ===
'''Define and use additional networking and Internet services.'''

*'''E-mail Services''' - A system for storing and forwarding messages across electronic communication systems based upon SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
*'''Authentication Services''' - Used for privilege authorization, privacy, and non-repudiation. Users login to an authentication server and receive cryptographic tokens which are used to verify identity. Authentication services use Kerberos, passwords, and public key encryption as authentication algorithms.
*'''Directory Services (DS)''' - Software applications used to store and organize user and resource information of a network. User access is managed by an administrator.
*'''Domain Name System (DNS)''' - A system that associates and translates human-readable hostnames into IP addresses and stores lists of mail exchange servers for specific domains.
*'''Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)''' - A protocol used by communication devices to obtain a unique IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway from a DHCP server.

=== Demonstrate use of Internet technologies ===
'''Demonstrate ways to communicate effectively using Internet technology.'''

*'''Netiquette Guidelines - [http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html RFC 1855]'''
*'''Ethics and the Internet - [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1087.html RFC 1087]'''
*'''Avoiding Harassment'''
**Protection from Internet predators can be as easy as knowing how to spot and handle a situation with a potential predator.
**Helpful tips for using chat, email, and instant messaging are:
***Never give anyone your password. 
***Use screen names that do not suggest gender or age. 
***Block Instant Messenger users that are not in your contact list. 
***Never give out information about name, age, or address.

===Domain 1.9===
'''Identify and configure user customization features in Web browsers, including: preferences, caching, cookies.''' 

===Domain 1.10===
'''Identify security issues related to Internet clients (e.g., Web browsers, e-mail, instant messaging) in the workplace, including: certificates, malware, illicit servers, viruses.''' 

===Domain 1.11===
'''Use different types of Web search engines effectively.'''

===Domain 1.12===
'''Identify and use principles of Personal Information Management (PIM), including: common applications.'''

===Domain 1.13===
'''Efficiently transmit text and binary files using popular Internet services.''' 

===Domain 1.14===
'''Identify security-related ethical and legal issues faced by IT professionals.'''

===Domain 1.15===
'''Relate project management concepts and terms to the IT profession.''' 

===Domain 1.16===
'''Recognize essential database concepts.'''

==The Invention Of Notation==

For scales to be theorized; a system needs to be in place. Whether this system takes the form of oral traditon or written is of great importance. The oral tradition has its problems; in that there is no clear record for each stage of development. Each generation can embellish, add or change the music thus obscuring origins and evolution. So with that in mind we start our study of scale theory with a brief overview of the invention of notation.
 
By the 9th century Western music began to become standardized into a notational form called &lt;i&gt;nuemes&lt;/i&gt;. In the 10th century Guido d'Arezzo set down a form of notation that replaced this earlier system. Guido d'Arrezo's system is regarded as the starting point for modern notation. Nuemes were shapes that represented notes. A single line was used to indicate the middle pitch with nuemes above the line being higher in pitch and the nuemes below the line being lower in pitch. This primitive sytem was more a memory aid rather than a system showing exact pitch and duration. To use nuemes you needed to know the piece of music beforehand. Guido d'Arrezo extended the one line to four lines and therefore set the exact pitch of each nueme. This new invention of the stave (or staff) allowed music to be notated in a way that allowed anyone to play the music without having previously memorized it. 

Today a scholarly approach has been applied to the music of the past in relation to ensuring that the notation is interpreted correctly. An example is baroque music; where modern research into the instruments, techniques and approach of this period has led today's musicians to revise their interpretation and performance of baroque notation. 

During the Renaissance (15th CE) Italian composers tried to recreate the plays of Ancient Greece and their experiments led to the invention of Opera. Musicians have always &lt;i&gt;mined&lt;/i&gt; the music of the past for ideas and maybe some clue as to the roots of contemporary musical practices.  From a musicologist point of view we are living in a Golden Age simply from the fact that mankind for the first time has the ability to record sound. Though we take recorded sound for granted today; it must be said that the future musicologist will find a rich legacy of sound recordings from which to base their research. We can never hear the music of Ancient Greece or the Medieval period; we can only attempt to recreate it. The importance of notation as the only mechanism we had for preserving the music of the past becomes self-evident.

==The Church Modes==

The music up to the baroque period was created from a form of scales known as the Church Modes which took their names from the tribes of Ancient Greece.

* '''Ionian''' (the Greeks who settled on the coast of modern day Turkey)

* '''Dorian''' (the Greeks who settled on Crete, Sparta and Corinth)

* '''Phrygian''' (the Greeks who moved further inland in Turkey to settle Anatolia)

* '''Lydian''' (a Greek tribe also from the Anatolia region of Turkey)

* '''Mixolydian''' (the Mixolydian mode was invented by Sappho, the 7th century B.C. poet and musician)

* '''Aeolian''' (originally Greeks from Thesally who spread to the Greek islands and Asia-minor)

* '''Locrian''' (inhabitants of the ancient region of Locris in Central Greece)

The Ancient Greeks laid the foundation for the study of music and intervals in a way that has defined Western music ever since. They investigated intervals using mathematics and used ratios to describe these intervals. The Church Modes are not scales from Ancient Greece. The Greeks themselves used a scale system based on the idea of tetrachords. However the debt that the Medieval period owes to the Ancient Greeks is reflected in the naming of the Church Modes. The Ancient Greeks also described their modes as Dorian, Lydian, etc. However this shows a continuity of musical theory rather than practice and the Ancient Greeks used their modes in an entirely different manner to the Medieval method. Here is Aristotle's view of the modes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The musical modes differ essentially from one another, and those who hear them are differently affected by each. Some of them make men sad and grave, like the so-called Mixolydian; others enfeeble the mind, like the relaxed modes; another again, produces a moderate and settled temper, which appears to be the peculiar effect of the Dorian; the Phrygian inspires enthusiasm&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above quote is from a work by Aristotle called &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;; a work about government, society and the individual's role in both. As you can imagine this analysis of music must have appealed greatly to the early Church fathers who sought to find the &quot;right&quot; music with which to worship God.

The Church Modes form the basis for Gregorian chant; named after Pope Gregory (590CE to 604CE) who set others to collect all the earlier Christian plainsong for codification. Pope Gregory revised the existing system into a coherent whole and in doing so defined the medieval period's practices. With regards to secular (non-religious) music; from 4CE onwards there is not as much information available as we have on Gregorian chant. The church, filling the vacumn left by the demise of the Roman empire, became the main conduit of information and therefore the musical literature we have available to study is primarily to do with the Christian church's musical practices. We can presume that secular music was played and we can infer that the Church Modes may have been used. If secular music used such modes then we can be sure it was in a less formal way. 

As instruments and forms evolved, some of the Church Modes became redundant as musicians found that those modes did not suffice for their musical needs. A few of the Church Modes went on to form the basis of our &quot;major-minor&quot; system and it is from these modes that baroque musicians created the harmonic theory that has dominated music right up to the twentieth century. The earlier Ionian mode is now called the Major scale.

==The Piano Keyboard==

The keyboard layout of the harpsichord and organ became standardized in the 15th century and the invention of the keyboard played a large part in laying down the foundation of modern tuning practices and theory. Tempered-tuning was adopted as a direct result of these inventions. The earlier system of mean-tuning meant that the errors introduced by the problem of the Pythagorean Comma allowed only a few keys to be played. If a piano was mean-tuned to C major then the player would find that keys further away from this C major center would be unusable. The guitarist can hear this by tuning the guitar in the first postion (first four frets) so that a C major chord is in tune with iself. You will find that the chords in the first postiion are usable but as you further progress up the neck the chords start to sound out of tune. Tempered-tuning spreads the errors introduced by the Pythagorean Comma evenly across the entire range of an instrument. By the time the piano was invented in the 17th century, the tempered C major scale had become the foundation for teaching music theory.

Since the keyboard has been such a dominating force in music, a complete study of scale theory must make some reference to it. Thus, it is best to first look at the piano keyboard and then compare it to the guitar fretboard.

Before you begin it is good idea to familiarise yourself with the notes of the C major scale. Note that it is the convention to use Roman Numerals to label scale degrees

[[Image:Klaviaturoktave.jpg|right|thumb|240px|A piano keyboard showing the C major scale. Note that all the notes of the C major scale are on the white keys.]]

If you play each key on a keyboard ascending from the middle C (diagram on the right), you will have played the 12 tone chromatic scale. These are all the notes available in Western music. The keyboard of a piano is laid out so that when you play the C major scale, you use only the white keys. The C major scale has no sharps (#'s) or flats (b's) which means that no black keys are used. Only the C major and its relative minor have no sharps or flats; all other scales will have a sharp or flat in their notation.

It is important to recognize that the distance between two adjacent keys is always a semitone. On the guitar the same applies to adjacent frets. Looking at the keyboard diagram you will see that between the C and D is a black key which is a semitone above the C and a semitone below the D. Between E and F there is no black key but it is still notated as a semitone interval. There is also no black key between B and C so they are also semitone neighbours. The 12 tone chromatic scale consists of 12 sounds which are all a semitone apart. The C major scale has seven notes which are represented by all the white keys. At this point it is best to remember that adjacents keys are a semitone apart and that a tone describes keys two semitones apart. Therefore C to D is a tone because there are two semitones - C to C# and C# to D. E to F# is also a tone. All instrumentalists start with learning the C major scale. 

As an exercise find the semitones E-F and B-C on the first three frets of the guitar. You'll need the open strings to do this. How many times do these two intervals appear?  

In general the pianist will depress notes to form chords that are derived from the scale of the key. Since we know that the scale of C major uses only white keys it follows that the chords to be played are formed using only the white keys. The most basic chord you can play is a triad which cosists of three notes. The simplicity of the keyboard layout means that a piano student will be asked by their tutor to play the seven triads in the key of C major almost immediately. Once they form the shape of the basic C major triad (C-E-G) on the piano it is only a case of moving the shape up through the scale keeping the same fingering and naming the chords appropiately. This is why guitarists sometimes lag behind pianists in understanding harmony because there is no easy visualization of triads. Another area is the quick location of the E-F and B-C intervals. These intervals are easily located on the keyboard by the absence of a black key. The guitar offers no easy visualization. The best approach would be to learn where all the E-F and B-C intervals are in the first position (first four frets) and then do the same for the fifth position (frets 5 to 8). A beginner on the piano will learn where these intervals are within minutes but a guitarist will have to put in a little more time. 

Below are the triads for the key of C major. Note that for the Dm and Bdim it is recommended that you use your little finger for the lowest note and for the last triad (C major octave) you use your third finger.

==Structure of the Major Scale==

The major scale (derived from the medieval Ionian church mode) is the main scale currently used in music. It is made up of seven notes, plus an eighth which duplicates the first an octave higher. The Italian music system &quot;solfeggio&quot; (a system that has been used for centuries in Italy and is still in use today) where each note is sung using a syllable - &quot;Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, (Do)&quot; may help in illustating this concept. 

The interval pattern for any major scale is:
 
         &lt;b&gt;2-2-1-2-2-2-1&lt;/b&gt; 

meaning that the difference from the first note to the second is 2 frets, from the second to the third is 1 fret, etc. 

The difference in notes can also be called steps, 2 notes being a whole step, and 1 note being a half step. This pattern in steps can be written as:

         &lt;b&gt;w-w-h-w-w-w-h&lt;/b&gt; 

It can also be represented as:

         &lt;b&gt;t-t-s-t-t-t-s&lt;/b&gt; 

with &quot;t&quot; meaning &quot;tone&quot; and &quot;s&quot; meaning &quot;semitone&quot;. The choice is yours as to which of the three descriptors you choose to use. 

The scale below uses the &quot;tone-semitone&quot; method:

[[File:C major scale with tones and semitones shown.png|thumb|none|800px|C major scale]]

Please note that there is a distinction in terminology between American English and UK English. It is common to find the word &quot;tone&quot; used in American English to describe notes whereas in UK English the word &quot;tone&quot; is never used. 

For example:

American English: &quot;The leading-tone is always a semitone below the octave in a major scale&quot;

UK English: &quot;The leading-note is always a semitone below the octave in a major scale&quot;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Major scale in the key of C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C

&lt;/pre&gt;

==Structure of the Minor scale==
===Natural minor===
The natural minor scale (or Aeolian mode) is one of the diatonic scales along with the major scale. The word &quot;diatonic&quot; in a modern sense refers only to the major and natural minor scales. In the key of A minor, the harmonic form would be called &quot;non-diatonic&quot; because the seventh note is sharpened. 

&lt;b&gt;TIP:&lt;/b&gt; Any natural minor scale can be changed into a harmonic minor scale by sharpening the seventh note.

The natural minor scales are all &quot;diatonic&quot; because they consist of the notes from the key they are derived from without any changes. The harmonic and melodic form both contain changes to the original natural minor scale and are therefore &quot;non-diatonic&quot;. 

Natural minor scales can be created for any key using the formula:

           &lt;b&gt;w-h-w-w-h-w-w&lt;/b&gt;

Below is the Am natural (or relative) scale with tones and semitones shown:

&lt;big&gt;'''Endometrial Cancer: Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Surgery==
*'''The Netherlands''' -- total abdominal hysterectomy vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy
**Randomized. 283 patients, 21 hospitals, Stage I endometrioid CA or complex atypical hyperplasia. Arm 1) total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) vs Arm 2) total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Primary outcome major complication rate
**'''2010''' PMID 20638901 -- &quot;Safety of laparoscopy versus laparotomy in early-stage endometrial cancer: a randomised trial.&quot; (Mourits MJ, Lancet Oncol. 2010 Aug;11(8):763-71. Epub 2010 Jul 16.)
***Outcome: major complications TLH 15% vs TAH 15% (NS); minor complications 13% vs 12% (NS). Conversion to laparotomy 11%. TLH significantly less blood loss, pain medication use, hospital LOS and faster recovery; however, procedure took longer
***Conclusion: No difference in complication rate, less pain and better resumption of daily activities with TLH

*'''ILIADE Study, Italy''' (1998-2004) -- extrafascial hysterectomy vs modified radical hysterectomy
**Randomized. 520 patients, clinical Stage I endometrial CA. Arm 1) Standard extrafascial (Class I) hysterectomy vs Arm 2) Modified radical (Class II) hysterectomy. Adjuvant therapy risk adapted: if low risk, observation; if intermediate risk (IC and no PLND, IIIA cytology) +/- EBRT +/- BT; if high risk (IIB, IIIA adnexal mets) doxorubicin/cisplatin + EBRT. No difference in adjuvant therapies between arms. Primary endpoint OS
**'''2009''' PMID 19834767 -- &quot;Modified Radical Hysterectomy Versus Extrafascial Hysterectomy in the Treatment of Stage I Endometrial Cancer: Results From the ILIADE Randomized Study.&quot; (Signorelli M, Ann Surg Oncol. 2009 Oct 16. [Epub ahead of print]) Median F/U 5.8 years
***Outcome: Median length of vagina removed standard 5mm vs. modified radical 15mm (SS); length of parametria 15mm vs 20mm (SS). OR time and blood loss higher for modified radical. 5-year DFS 88% vs. 90% (NS); 5-year OS 89% vs. 92% (NS). Vaginal cuff recurrence 1% vs. 1% (NS), pelvic recurrence 4% vs. 4% (NS), distant recurrence 5% vs. 5% (NS)
***Conclusion: Class II hysterectomy didn't improve LRC or survival for clinical Stage I patients. However, if adequate cuff transection not feasible with Class I, recommend modified radical hysterectomy

==Early Stage==
===Preop BT vs Preop EBRT===
*'''St. Louis/Peoria, Illinois''' (1968-1975) -- Intrauterine BT vs EBRT
**Randomized. 105 patients, adenocarcinoma, FIGO clinical Stage I. Arm 1) Single implant Cs-137 with Heyman capsules and/or T&amp;O 6000-6500 mg-hrs vs Arm 2) EBRT 40/20
**'''1984''' PMID 6360334 -- &quot;Preoperative radiation therapy in Stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma. II. Final report of a clinical trial.&quot; (Weigensberg IJ, Cancer. 1984 Jan 15;53(2):242-7.)
***Outcome: 5-year DFS BT 80% vs EBRT 70%; 10-year DFS 67% vs 59%. Half recurrences in pelvis
***Toxicity: BT 46% vs EBRT 24%
***Conclusion: Intracavitary radiation is superior to EBRT

===Surgery +/- Pelvic EBRT===
*'''PORTEC''' (The Netherlands)(1990-1997)
*Randomized. 715 patients with Stage IB (G2-3) or IC (G1-2), specifically no IC G3. TAH/BSO with washings, not allowed to have lymphadenectomy. Allowed adenocarcinoma and variants (including papillary serous and clear cell).
**Randomized to postoperative EBRT 46 Gy vs no further therapy. Fields: superior border at L5/S1.
**'''5-years, 2000''' PMID 10791524 &amp;mdash; &quot;Surgery and postoperative radiotherapy versus surgery alone for patients with stage-1 endometrial carcinoma: multicentre randomised trial. PORTEC Study Group. Post Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma.&quot; Creutzberg CL et al. Lancet. 2000 Apr 22;355(9213):1404-11. Median F/U 4.3 years
***5-year outcome: LRF: 4% vs 14% (SS); 73% of recurrences in vagina. DM unaffected (7%). OS same (80% vs 84%, NS) with ~50% deaths due to other causes
***Salvage: Most LR salvaged, which may explain why the survival is similar in both arms despite a difference in LR. 3-year OS after vaginal relapse 69% vs. 13% for pelvic or DM. 
***Toxicity: RT 25% vs. 6% (SS); excess of secondary cancers of the GI tract, which is associated with endometrial cancer. 
***Prognostic: Age &gt;60, G3, IC predictive for LR; If 2 of 3 criteria, LR 23% vs. 4% (SS)
***Conclusion: EBRT reduces LR but has no impact on survival. Don't recommend if &lt;60 or if IB G2

***Late complications: RT 26% vs. control 4% (SS). Most grade I (65%). Grade 3-4 complications 3% vs. 0%
***By site: GI 20% (3% severe); GU 8% (no severe); bone 2% (no severe); vagina 1% (no severe)
***Time course: ~50% Grade 1-2 resolved over time (2-3 years), but not in Grade 3-4 complications
***Technique: 4F box lower risk; 4F 21% vs. AP/PA 30% vs. 3F 36% (p=0.06)
***Conclusion: Severe complications 3%, mild complications 20%. RT use requires careful consideration, since no survival benefit
***Comment: Reporting done differently between the 2 arms, special form for acute RT toxicity. Also, surgeons don't report large midline scar as a complication while transient erythema is one

*'''Norwegian Radium Hospital, 1980''' 
**'''9-years, 1980''' (1968-1974) - PMID 6999399 &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative external irradiation and prognostic parameters in stage I endometrial carcinoma: clinical and histopathologic study of 540 patients.&quot;  Aalders J et al. Obstet Gynecol. 1980 Oct;56(4):419-27.
***Randomized. 540 patients with surgical Stage I. All patients had TAH/BSO (no lymphadenectomy) + postoperative brachytherapy 60 Gy to the surface of the vagina (~40 Gy LDR @ 0.5cm and ~ 24 Gy HDR @ 0.5 cm). Then randomized to no further treatment vs pelvic RT  40 Gy (central shielding after 20 Gy)
***9-year outcome: OS BT alone 90% vs BT+EBRT 87% (NS). RT decreased LR (7% vs 2%) but there were more distant mets (5% vs 10%, borderline SS).  Similar recurrence rate in both groups, but more deaths in XRT group. 
***Subset analysis: Improved OS for BT+EBRT in IC Grade 3 (82% vs. 72%); probably due to improved local control (LR 5% vs. 20%) with comparable DM (14% vs. 15%). IC G1-2 had no difference in OS, LR, and DM.
***Poor prognosis: Age &gt;60, Stage IC, Grade 3, LVI+
***Conclusion: No benefit for EBRT after vaginal BT, except for Stage IC G3 patients


===Surgery + Pelvic EBRT vs. Vaginal BT===
*'''PORTEC 2''' (2002-2006) -- Pelvic EBRT 46/23 vs. vaginal BT 21/3
**Randomized. 427 patients, intermediate-high risk endometrial CA. Eligible if: (1) age greater than 60 years and stage 1C grade 1 or 2 disease, or stage 1B grade 3 disease; and (2) stage 2A disease, any age (apart from grade 3 with greater than 50% myometrial invasion). TAH/BSO, PLND not allowed. Excluded papillary serous and clear cell. Arm 1) EBRT 46/23 vs. Arm 2) HDR 21/3 or LDR 30/1. Primary endpoint vaginal relapse.

***Outcome: 3-year vaginal relapse EBRT 2.0% vs. VBT 0.9% (NS), pelvic relapse 0.7% vs. 3.6% (SS), OS 90% vs. 91% (NS)
***Toxicity: Significantly higher rate of diarrhea, persisted &gt;2 years in EBRT group
***Conclusion: Vaginal BT effective in preventing vaginal recurrences, with slightly higher pelvic failure rate, but no impact on RFS or OS. Quality of life better, so should be considered standard for these patients

***Recurrence locations: WAI: recurrence in 54% (pelvic in 13%, abdomen in 16%, distant 22%). For chemo: 50% recurrence (18%,14%,18%)
***Grade 3-4 Toxicity: hematologic RT 14% vs. chemo 88%, GI 13% vs. 20%, cardiac 15% vs. 0%, neurologic 7% vs. 1%
***Conclusion: chemotherapy improves PFS and OS for advanced disease, compared with whole abdomen RT, though with significant toxicity
**Comment: Despite this being a randomized trial, the chemo arm was stage-adjusted during analysis. Argument was that it had worse prognosis patients (presumably the Stage IIIC, however, LN+ was not a prognostic variable in the study itself). The whole abdomen arm also had bad prognosis patients (IIIA with serosal/adnexal mets). The raw OS result are still significantly better for the chemo arm, but raw PFS was comparable in the two arms (38% vs. 42%). The statistical rationale is not justified, and thus questionable

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because of the relative tuning of the strings on a guitar, it is very easy to play a variety of chords that can be moved up and down the neck. The most basic types of movable chords are the [[Guitar/Double-stops and Power Chords|power chord]] and [[Guitar/Barre Chords|barre chord]]. This section deals with chords that, in general, do not use open strings. Once the shape of the chord is memorised, it can be played anywhere on the fretboard.


==Major and Minor shapes==

Movable chords often use the general shapes of [[Guitar/Open Chords|open chords]]. However, not all open chords are easy to play as a movable chord. Note that C major and G major is absent. This is because the shape of the chords, particularly G major, demands of the guitarist an advanced technique. Classical guitarists use a foot-stool and adopt a specific playing posture and hand position when they play and this allows them to form these chords with relative ease. The classical guitar also has nylon strings and these offer hardly any resitance to fretting. That is not to say that the C major and G major shape cannot be played on a steel-string acoustic; its just more difficult because of the string tension. They are slightly easier to play on the electric guitar. After mastering the easier shapes, try learning the C major and G shapes. The D major shape and D minor movable chords (as shown below) are usable but tend not to be used regularly due to the shape being slightly awkward to hold and move to other chords. The easiet shapes to learn are the E major and A minor chords shape. Tip: the more difficult shapes can be broken down into smaller units and they also make ideal arpeggio studies where you can approach them more as a succession of notes in a riff without the need for forming the full chord.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;


If you examine the notes that make up the chords, it becomes clear that the thickest string plays the root note of the chords. Thus, in order to turn these into movable chords, you also have to fret down an extra string to complete the chord. Here are the same chords, but higher up the neck in a movable shape. Notice how the shapes of the chord on the strings you play are exactly the same as the open chords, except with the thickest string now being fretted.

&lt;/font&gt;


===Inversions of Major and Minor===

==&quot;Artist&quot; Chords==
Although these guitarists certainly didn't invent the chords, they made them popular by using them in many of their songs. More often than not, a player will first encounter them trying to learn a famous song. These are loose categorizations, and are easily applicable to more than one artist, so please keep that in mind.

===7/#9 (Hendrix Chords)===
No chord reminds people more of Jimi Hendrix than the 7/#9. These are also used widely by Prince. The voicing for this shape is 1-3-7-#9.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File: B7sharp9 chord for guitar.png|'''B7/#9'''

File: A7sharp9 chord for guitar.png|'''A7/#9'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;



===7/9 and 7/9/13 (James Brown Chords)===
These chords are essential for getting a funk sound. The voicing for this 7/9 shape is 1-3-7-9-5.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File: B9 chord for guitar.png|'''B7/9'''
File: E9 chord for guitar.png|'''E7/9'''
File: A9 chord for guitar.png|'''A7/9'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;


The 7/9/13chord is an easy modification of the 7/9 chord. It was perhaps most famously used in &quot;Sex Machine&quot; by James Brown, as a change between the 7/9 chord. Little changes like that give music some extra texture and they also work particularly well in jazz.

Because the 7/9/13 chord requires five notes, you cannot play it with less than five strings, or else you would be playing a different chord. The voicing for this shape is 1-3-7-9-13.

Although this breakdown of Analysis and Design includes testing (under development) I think Testing is a separate phase in its own right - and including it in development is asking for trouble. Unit test is part of development (programming), as is (probably) link testing, but any further testing should be considered separately! --[[User:Blinford|Benny]] 09:57, 1 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At the accession of Darius III, Persia was gripped by turmoil. Her empire might have been the largest in the whole world, however, Darius III appeared unequal to the task of governing it. As a rresult, the Empire crumbled rapidly, its downfall hastened by the invasion of a monarch from a small province of Greece called Macedonia called Alexander III, who became famous in history as '''Alexander the Great'''.

== Origin of The Macedonian Empire ==

Macedonia was a small principality located in the northern part of modern-day Greece. The Macedonian kingdom had been in existence since the 9th century BC, its first king being '''Karanus''' who ruled upto 778 BC. However, the first king of any note was Philip II who, during the 23 years that he ruled (from 359 BC to 336 BC) conquered the whole of Greece and the Southern Balkans and converted the kingdom into an Empire. During the later years of his reign, he carried his arms into Thrace and was elected to lead an invasion of Persia. But a few months before the supposed invasion was to begin, Philip was assassinated and Greece was gripped by civil war.

== Alexander III ==

On the death of Philip `II, a war of succession broke out amongst his sons. Alexander, a son of Philip emerged victorious and grabbed the throne crowning himself Alexander III. Soon after his accession, Alexander completed the conquest of Byzantium. He had also to deal with the widespread rebellion in Greece and the Southern Balkans which he put down with a firm hand. Having resolved internal problems and disputes in his Empire, Alexander started upon his career of conquests.

Alexander first conquered the Northern Balkans pushing back the Syths and other Northern barbarians and pushing back the frontier. Having secured his northern frontiers, Alexander crossed the Byzantium into Asia with an army of 42,000 and started upon his great Eastern campaign.

Alexander reached up to Lydia virtually unmolested. The Persians gave battle on the banks of the Granicus river. The Greek Light cavalry and infantry charged at the centre of the Persian line. The centre was made of Persian nobles all of whom were killed in the ensuing battle. The Persian cavalry rushed to the aid of the centre thereby allowing the Greeks to enact a breach. The Persians were massacred in large numbers. Total casualties for the Macedonians were between 300 and 400. The Persians had 2,000 infantry captured, which were of the Greek mercenaries who decided to fight on after the Persian retreat; roughly 1,000 cavalry and 3,000 infantry were killed, mostly in the rout.

==4..Nc6==
Here White usually decides to overprotect their center-pawns by playing [[/5. Nf3|5.Nf3]].&lt;br&gt;
In a few games, and for the same purpose, White players have also tried [[/5. Be3|5.Be3]] and [[/5. f4|5.f4]].

==5. Nf3==
Here Black has several options, in the Main Line Black increases the pressure on White's d4 pawn once more, by playing [[/5...Qb6|5...Qb6]]. &lt;br&gt;
[[/5...Bd7|5...Bd7]], is a good alternative move, which was known by Greco as early as 1620, and it's still played frequently today.

Here Black has built up quite some pressure on White's d4-pawn, luckily there are still enough defenders.&lt;br&gt;
White has several options. They can:&lt;br&gt;
(1) Prepare a gambit by playing [[/6. Bd3|6.Bd3]].&lt;br&gt;
(2) Develop their pieces, but without the intention of sacrificing a pawn ([[/6. Be2|6.Be2]])&lt;br&gt;
(3) Prepare an expansion on the queenside ([[/6. a3|6.a3]]).&lt;br&gt;

It may look like black can win a pawn on d4 by cxd4 Nxd4 but white can take the black knight on d4 and a retake by black's queen is not an option because of Bb5+ and black loses a queen.

'''SKILLS MEASURED'''

Foundations skills are not product- or system-specific. They are a combination of minimal technical and non-technical skills and knowledge required for those interested in developing specific Internet skills as a designer, developer or administrator. The exam also requires a basic understanding of essential business practices that relate directly to Internet technologies. The 1D0-510 Domain 2.0 tests the following topics:

=== Demonstrate knowledge required to create web pages ===

HTML documents are ASCII text files with special characters called tags, that are used to indicate how the document and content are formatted.

The basic HTML document consists of the following elements:

*'''Declaration of document type''' - a DOCTYPE statement indicating the HTML specification used.
**''Example:'' &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN&quot;&gt;
*'''&lt;html&gt;''' - An opening tag to indicate the beginning of an HTML document.
*'''&lt;head&gt;''' - The opening tag for header information. Header information may include scripting code and is not displayed in the browser window.
*'''&lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;''' - The opening and closing tags for the title of your document. These tags and the accompanying title are located within the header information. The title is displayed in your browser's caption.
*'''&lt;/head&gt;''' - The closing tag for header information.
*'''&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;''' - The opening and closing tags for the content that will be displayed in your browser.
*'''&lt;/html&gt;''' - A closing tag to indicate the end of an HTML document.

=== Images and graphical formats ===

The introduction of graphic images into web pages requires considerable thought. They can make a lasting positive first impression to a new visitor or they can discourage traffic from returning to the site. Using the wrong type or too large a graphic can cause a page to load at an unbearably slow pace.

The following graphic file formats are commonly used in web design:

*'''GIF''' (Graphics Interchange Format)
*'''JPEG''' (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
*'''PNG''' (Portable Network Graphics)
*'''SVG''' (Scalable Vector Graphics)

=== Design and color principles ===

'''Effective Web design''' often implements a layout style known as &quot;inverted pyramid&quot;. Pages are arranged with the most significant content to the front or top of the publication and the least significant content following. A well structured layout should be consistent throughout the site and may include several of the following components:

*'''Margins''' - Controls whitespace between content and the edge of browser windows.
*'''Borders''' - Provide HTML table and frame borders.
*'''Whitespace''' - Eliminates clutter and separates content.
*'''Color''' - Can be used to define organization.
*'''Headings''' - Organizes content into outline format.
*'''Paragraphs''' - Used to group blocks of text into sections.
*'''Divisions''' - Divides content into large sections.
*'''Framesets''' - Allow the display of multiple pages at once.
*'''Rules''' - Used to divide content.
*'''Tables''' - Presents data in tabular format and positions elements.
*'''Lists''' - Presents content in a list format.
*'''Navigation''' - Assists user movement through a Web site.
*'''Images''' - Attracts attention or used for navigation.

=== Forms that accepts user input ===

HTML forms are a series of user interface elements designed to permit the entry of data by the user. An HTML form may include the following tags:

*'''&lt;form&gt;''' - Opening form tag. Defines the attributes of an HTML form.
*'''&lt;input&gt;''' - Input field tag. Defines the attributes of a field designed for user input.
*'''&lt;button&gt;''' - Button tag. Defines the attributes of a user activated push button.
*'''&lt;select&gt;''' - Selectable list tag. Defines the attributes of a drop-down selection box.
*'''&lt;option&gt;''' - Option tag. Defines the options in a drop-down selection box.
*'''&lt;/form&gt;''' - Closing form tag. Indicates the end of an HTML form element.

=== Create frames ===

=== Define XML and identify its features and appropriate use ===

'''Extensible Markup Language (XML)''' - a general-purpose markup language used to share data on different systems across the Internet. XML allows the use of user-defined markup tags and is recognized as an open standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

A subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), XML is sometimes used as a specification language for other application languages including XHTML, RSS, MathML, GraphML, Scalable Vector Graphics, MusicXML, etc.

=== Identify essential navigation issues and ensure accessibility ===

=== Define and apply essential aspects of the CSS standard ===

=== Use XHTML to create web pages ===

=== Identify technologies for enhancing the user experience ===

=== Demonstrate use of GUI-based HTML editing software ===

=== Test and analyze performance issues ===

=== Identify steps in the planning and development process ===

=== Identify essential issues in developing and maintaining a website ===

=== Plan and deliver oral presentations of your website, during and after site development ===

===Domain 2.16===
'''Define electronic commerce (e-commerce) and related technologies and concepts necessary to develop a secure, useful interface (i.e., storefront).''' 

=== Demonstrate knowledge of common languages used to provide database connectivity ===

=== Identify benefits and drawbacks of running your own web server versus using a service provider ===

=== Identify common strategies for managing an end user's experience and improving site creativity ===

=== Consider copyright and ethical issues ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi StuRat,

Thank you for your comments.  While I'm very new to this whole wiki thing - I did notice that not much had been done with this topic and so I started '''boldly''' editing, not even knowing if previous contributors were planning on ever being active again. I noted that the very first sentence of the page declared that the book was for teachers and parents.  Yet, eventually, I came to the realization that much of the work that had already been done on this topic (at wikibooks) was meant to '''teach''' math.   In my opinion, parents and educators are not interested in a book that ''re''-teaches math.  If they don't ''know'' the math their students/children are learning, they can learn it from the very texts that the children are useing. And a book that teaches elementary/primary mathematical concepts to actual children would have an even smaller audience.  In my career as a grade school math educator, I have yet to meet any grade school age children who were motivated to learn math independently, much less who could parse the language used to teach the subject presented in an on-line format.
 
Regardless, a book that teaches '''how''' to teach math needs to be presented in a much different manner - with entirely different language, even for non-professional educators such as home-schoolers.  So essentially I have had a [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Primary_School_Mathematics copy] of this topic moved to wikiversity for the express purpose of using it as a template for teaching adults how to teach math to the primary grades.  Please read the title page to get a sense of the direction I am taking with the &quot;course&quot;.  I think you will agree that I am taking it in a very different direction than the one here at wiki books. Because I am currently enrolled in a Education of Mathematics (k-8) Master's program, I plan to combine my classroom teaching experience with my formal learning into this course.  In this sense, I expect it to take a few years as I become more aware from my own studies of the pedegogical considerations that apply to each mathematical discipline.

I currently have no intentions of further editing these pages at Wikibooks, so please feel free to revert any work I have done.  I apologize for some of the bolder deletions that I have made.

Over time, I plan to change the format of the &quot;copy&quot; that I am working on at Wikiversity (for instance, I plan to expand the section on connections and manipulatives/modes to separate pages), and possibly change the title of the course as well. It occurs to me that links to the the wikibooks pages would be appropriate for readers who need more specific help with topics, which means people need to do a lot of work on this end as well.  I invite you to edit and contribute to the pages at wikiversity if you are interested.  Even the occasional comment sent to my disscusion page or posted on the discussion page of each section would be appreciated.  I don't log into Wikibooks nearly as much as I do Wikiversity, but my name (Leightwing) is the same there.  Regards, [[User:Leightwing|Leightwing]] 13:36, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

== Link to new location and other stuff ==

StuRat,

I think I put a link in my last missive to you. Check out the word &quot;copy&quot;.  Anyways, the URL is:
http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/School:Mathematics/Primary_School_Mathematics.  While I'm not sure it belongs in the Mathematics School, I think there should be certainly be links from that school.  I'm thinking the portal should be more aligned with the Education School.  But for now it's a work in progress and I need to learn more about wikiversity before I bother the higherups by changing my mind too many times.

Yeah, I'm still trying to streamline the editing process.  On the one hand, I always like to write things in ''Word''. But on the other hand, creating links, equations, images and testing them is much easier if I write right into the Wiki editing box.  One of the drawbacks of this is that I tend to ''save'' the page often to see if these things are working.. but then the process of documenting my work with edit summaries becomes cumbersome.  Nonetheless, I'm making an effort to summarize anything that I think might be significant.  Because a lot of material already on the pages is remedially oriented (I'm talking about the course, not the book), I am trying to delete it as I replace it with material that is more suited to objectives of the project.  I'll start making a habit of cutting and pasteing from these pages back into Word to check spelling with each near completion of the segments I'm working on.

I can see that it might be very important and advantageous for these two projects to be linked quite a bit.  Probably with more links from the ''course'' to the ''book'' than from the ''book'' to the ''course''.  I'm thinking that if (for example) the parent looking over the child's shoulder doesn't understand something even after visiting the ''course'', a link from each section to the corresponding page in the ''wikibook'' will serve to even more deeply cover the basic skills needed to help them to understand what's going on.

If this is the goal, then it makes sense for the writers and editors of each of these entities to be aware of what's going on in the corresponding sister pages.   Especially the writers of the wikibook, because those pages will often be reached via someone who is having trouble understanding something from the course.

Though I said I wasn't planning on writing any more material for the wikibook, it occurs to me that in many cases, as I write material for the course and link it to the book, it might make sense for me to explain in more detail these concepts (in the book).  If I do this, I will make a point of not deleting additional material that already resides there.

I hope this makes sense.  Thanks again for your thoughts, [[User:Leightwing|Leightwing]] 16:46, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

Hi, 

'''&quot;I noticed that the 3 pluses in the answer for the last illustration are not in an oval like the first two; does this have any meaning ?&quot;'''

No, I just forgot to put it there - I don't think it's that critical - unless you think it might be.  If you want, you can import it into your favorite editor and fix it if you like.

In the '''course''', my explanation of '''integer tiles''' starts with may seem like a simple equation, but there are even simpler equations that perhaps should be used to introduce the model on your end.  For instance, those requiring no zero-sum fields.     Don't forget, in the wikiversity course, I will have covered the more complex equation. 2 + (-3) under the assumption that the reader already knows how to add negative numbers.  They just need to see the model used to teach it, so I provide them with one that has several layers of lessons behind it, but I will also provide a link to your work for those who don't quite understand it.  May I suggest that you consider starting with even more simple equations, like -4 + -3, where no zero-sum fields need to be found..  Starting with the graphic I have provided will be very confusing for those who have never seen integer tiles and are just learning how to add negative numbers.

Also, I notice that the [[School of Mathematics:Primary School Mathematics|homepage]] of the wikibook you are working on has a big notice on top (This Page has been Moved).  It was there even before I began editing it.  You may want to make sure it is not scheduled for deletion and have someone take care of the notice.  Also, our two projects have the same name.  This is bound to cause confusion. I suppose I need to change the one on my end.  ;-(

Thanks for your suggestions. I am using the Show Preview button more and I already use most of the keyboard shortcuts.  I will check out your crosslinks soon.  [[User:Leightwing|Leightwing]] 18:09, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

== Welcome ==

Hey Sturat I think I recognize you from the mathematics reference desk. I am certainly glad to see you here, I would just like to point you to our [[WB:NC|Naming policy]] for the subpages of books on the project, we have adopted a naming convention in subpages are named like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt; [[basepagename/subpagename]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;, for example [[Calculus/Functions]]. This makes it so that links back to the main page will automatically show up on the top of the page, and keeps everything consistent across the project (the cookbook is an exception since it has its own namespace).

I've also seen that you've been doing some edits to a wikiversity course on the wikibooks site. The wikiversity pages on this site are outdated because all of the information on them has been moved to its own project (see [[v:Main page|the wikiversity home page]]), so if you are interested in contributing to the wikiversity project, I suggest that you make your edits there! Wikiversity is mostly for lecture outlines, syllabi, and other things that are addenda for classes, as far as I can tell, whereas wikibooks is intended mostly for textbooks (see [[WB:WIW|the page that defines the Wikibooks project goals]]).

If you have any questions about the wikibooks project itself, feel free to ask me. Thank you for your contributions! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:56, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

:1) Thanks, can you give me an example of how I should have named my pages differently ?

:2) We've recently created a content fork between Wikibooks Basic Math (now written for students, whether adult or children) and Wikiversity Basic Math (now written for parents and teachers).  I've tried to add links back and forth where a comparable lesson exists in the other area.  My interest is mainly in writing directly for students (mainly adults), so I primarily contribute to Wikibooks Basic Math. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 03:16, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

::I can give you an example, if you dont mind me butting into the conversation. On the page [[Primary mathematics:Introduction to significant digits]], for instance, you use a colon &quot;:&quot; to separate the name of the book from the name of the page. Instead, you should use a forward-slash &quot;/&quot; to separate them. For example: &quot;Primary mathematics/Introduction to significant digits&quot;. Both the colon &quot;:&quot; and the forward-slash &quot;/&quot; are &quot;special characters&quot;, in that they both perform  special tasks. The colon is used in link-prefixes, such as a namespace or an interwiki link, while the slash is used to separate pages. I hope this helps. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:28, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

:::Ouch, that will require a lot of work to fix.  I just copied the format of the existing lessons, like [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Primary_mathematics:Numbers].  How did they get so messed up ?  Were they copied from Wikiversity (which I'm guessing uses a different convention) ? [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 02:37, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

::::I've fixed the pages names. And no actually, Wikiversity use to be part of Wikibooks before it became a separate project entirely and Wikibooks use to use a different convention. I also removed that misunderstanding from [[Primary mathematics]] which was the result of my renaming ''School of Mathematics:Primary School Mathematics'', because Wikiversity had already imported that page, Wikibooks doesn't have schools and it was being used as a table of contents for the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:02, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

:::::OK, thanks, I'll try to stick with that naming convention. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 18:30, 23 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Network Technology Foundations ==

'''SKILLS MEASURED''' 

Foundations skills are not product- or system-specific. They are a combination of minimal technical and non-technical skills and knowledge required for those interested in developing specific Internet skills as a designer, developer or administrator. The exam also requires a basic understanding of essential business practices that relate directly to Internet technologies. The 1D0-510 Domain 3 tests the following topics:

=== Demonstrate knowledge of basic data communications components, and demonstrate technical knowledge of the Internet ===

The majority of users access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Internet connection points can be established through dial-up service, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), cable modem, proxy service, or dedicated lines (ISDN, T1, etc.). The speed at which you connect determines how fast the website appears. 

Internet Service Providers access the Internet through Network Access Points (NAPs). These NAPs are major Communications Providers connected together by a high speed Wide Area Network (WAN) known as the Internet backbone. These WANs are usually constructed of a high speed fiber optic cable and can handle speeds from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.

=== Identify the role of networking hardware, and configure common hardware for operation ===

A network may consist of two or more computers and can be classified into two main types:

*'''LAN''' (Local Area Network) - Limited to a specific geographical area and often divided into small groups called workgroups.
*'''WAN''' (Wide Area Network) - Crosses much larger geographical boundaries including metropolitan, regional, or national.

Networks are composed of various components, each designed to perform a different function. The following components are likely to be utilized as part of a network:

*'''Workstation''' - Any computer connected to a network and used for a specific purpose.
*'''Server''' - A somewhat more powerful computer used to control specific functions of the network.
*'''NIC''' (Network Interface Card) - An adapter in the computer that provides the physical and electrical connection to the network. May be an expansion board or built into the motherboard. NICs are network specific, Token Ring and Ethernet, and will not inter-communicate between each other.

*'''Network Cable''' - The cabling connecting the network components. In most cases will include any of the following types:
**'''Coaxial''' - Construction includes a copper center conductor with a plastic jacket, surrounded by a braided shield, and covered with a PVC or Teflon outer jacket. Teflon jackets are referred to as [i]plenum-rated[/i]. They do not produce toxic gases when burned and are rated for use within breathable air plenums.
***'''Thin Ethernet'''
***'''Thick Ethernet'''
**'''Twisted-pair'''
***'''UTP''' - Unshielded twisted pair, rated in the following categories:
****'''Category 1'''
****'''Category 2'''
****'''Category 3'''
****'''Category 4'''
****'''Category 5'''
****'''Category 6'''
***'''STP''' - Shielded twisted pair, commonly used for Token Ring installations.
**'''Fiber-optic'''

*'''Hub''' - A central connection point for network devices. Also called a concentrator, a hub will receive input in one port and transmit that information to all other ports.
*'''Switch'''
*'''Bridge''' - Separates a single network into two segments.
*'''Router'''
*'''Firewall'''
*'''Modem'''
*'''Gateway'''

=== Identify the relationship between IP addresses and domain names, including: assignment of IP addresses within a subnet ===
=== Identify the functions and components of servers commonly used on the Internet ===
Often used for specific purposes, servers may include the following:
*'''Web server''' - Holds and distributes Web content.
*'''File server''' - Holds and distributes files.
*'''Print server''' - Controls and manages one or more network printers.
*'''Mail server''' - Holds and distributes e-mail.
*'''Fax server''' - Sends and receives faxes.
*'''Proxy server''' - Performs functions on behalf of other computers.
*'''Telephony server''' - Performs call center and call routing functions.
*'''Remote access server''' - Hosts modems designed for inbound connections to the network.

=== Identify common Internet security and availability issues, including: user-level and enterprise-level concerns ===
=== Identify common performance issues affecting Internet clients, including: analysis, diagnosis ===
=== Perform basic hardware and system maintenance for network-aware systems ===
=== Manage fundamental elements of modern network-based client operating systems ===
=== Configure and troubleshoot wireless networks ===
=== Manage career opportunities in the IT industry ===
=== Represent technical issues to a non-technical audience ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Input components acquire images from various sources (typically cameras or video files) and feed the Input channel with either a grayscale or a color image.

Input components furthermore set acquisition parameters (e.g. frame number, time stamp, ...) in the input channel.

Some input components are trigger at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Input conversion components convert the input image into a grayscale or color image and put it on the corresponding channel for further processing. If the input image has the right type (color or grayscale) already, this is a very fast operation as the input image is simply put (not even copied) on either the color or the grayscale channel.

[[Image:my_photo.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Thinking about the novel circuit procedure...&lt;/center&gt;]]

A month ago, [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] sent to me a link to the EDN's article [http://www.edn.com/archives/1998/030298/05df_05.pdf Single-formula technique keeps it simple] by Dieter Knollman. Initially, I had a look with reluctance at the [http://www.edn.com/archives/1998/030298/05df_05.htm html version] of the article (I don't like calculations and formal presentations). First, I was totally irritated by the typical for EDN awkward article arrangement (a rough text without figures and links pointing to the same pdf file); then, I calmed down when I found out the [http://www.edn.com/archives/1998/030298/05df_05.pdf pdf version]. The material drew my attention because my pursuit is to reveal the secrets behind passive and basic op-amp amplifying and summing circuits.

In the beginning, I was not understanding what the author wanted to say. The material seemed to be a scientific falsification. I was not understanding what a ground resistor is and why there was a need of it, who were these Plato and Daisy, etc. Thus, I took the material as a challenge and began trying to reveal the idea behind the procedure. Doing that, I have spent an almost a month!

:[Djhk] I propose that we change this book from Circuit Fantastic to Circuit Fantasies. New ideas, even bad ones, can be good. Before moving any idea to an unproven level, I propose that the idea be tested via simulation or a breadboard.  The next level would need a formal proof or multiple tests and agreement from all.  For example, I consider Plato's gain formula proven. Daisy's theorem as stated unproven, but proven under special conditions. Much of the discussion here should fall into the Fantasy classification.
:[[User:Djhk|Djhk]] 18:16, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

== Revealing the idea ==

Gradually, I began figuring out the connection between the novel procedure and the &quot;legacy&quot; one; I began seeing the brilliantness of the solution. I even began creating this [[Circuit Idea/Simple Op-amp Summer Design|new circuit story]] where to show the reason of the procedure.
 
'''...Daisy's theorem.''' In the beginning, it seemed quite strange to sum gains; I thought that voltage summers sum voltages. Then, I quessed to assume that the input voltages are equal to 1V. As a result, the summer began summing gains! So, in the common case, this kind of summer (a parallel one) sums actually products of gains and voltages. In case of Gi = 1, it sums voltages; in case of Vi = 1V, it sums gains. By the way, I use similar explanations when my students and I build a DAC. Really, a DAC is just a summer with digital-controlled binary-weighted input voltages (at constant input resistances) or gains (at constant input voltages equal to the reference voltage). 
Thus I began gradually figuring out the role of the ground resistor - to ensure the gains needed in the case when their sum does not constitute 1. It serves actually as a complementing, supplemental resistance that adjusts the overall gain to 1 (in the beginning, I thought that the author has added it to equalize the equivalent input resistances).

:[Djhk] Daisy's theorem is very different from any electronics concept. It applies to linear circuits and voltages. In a linear circuit the voltage at any node is simply the sum of gains times voltage inputs. If ALL gains are included, then the sum is equal to one. This applies to any circuit node. The key is ALL. Electronics rarely considers the gain from ground or power supplies. If you leave these out, the gain sum may not be equal to one.
:[[User:Djhk|Djhk]] 18:35, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
 
'''...Plato's formula.''' Then, I guessed to impose the requirement for equal input resistances (minimal bias-current error) and replaced the term 1 + RF/RI with K; this simplified the formulas for all the circuits. Interesting... imposing a restriction simplifies the formula. I suppose that the author has first managed to see that the particular gains are proportional to the ratio Rf/Ri; then, he has had the good fortune to establish that the coefficient of proportionality is just equal to 1, if we impose the requirement for equal input resistances (or, maybe v.v.?)

'''I think that supplementing the gains and imposing the requirement for equal equivalent input resistances lead to the magic expression Ri = Rf/|Gi|.''' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:26, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

:{Djhk] Plato's formula was derived via circuit analysis. It only applies the the [General Summing amplifier circuit]:[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/General_Summing_Amplifier.html]. Many circuits, but not all, can be analyzed with Plato's gain formula. The equal impedance constraint comes from the analysis technique used. Note that the 1 + RF/RI formula only applies to a non-inverting amplifier. Plato's formula applies to more circuits, but not all.

== What does &quot;the ground resistor R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is not necessary&quot; mean? ==

[[User:Djhk|Djhk]], I have noted your [[Circuit_Idea/Simple_Op-amp_Summer_Design#Op-amp_inverting_amplifier|comment]] about the resistor Rg: ''&quot;Not true. The circuit will not function without Rg. It may be a zero value resistor.&quot;''

Sorry, saying &quot;the ground resistor R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is not necessary&quot; I mean that it may have zero resistance.

Well, let's discuss what the phrase &quot;there is no resistor&quot; means: &quot;the resistance is zero (shorted circuit)&quot; or &quot;the resistance is infinite (open circuit).&quot; What do you think about this? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 15:32, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

Yes, a reader might misinterpret &quot;not necessary&quot; to mean &quot;I don't need to connect anything to the &quot;+&quot; op amp input, I can leave it floating&quot;.
Doing that causes a real op-amp to not merely show &quot;degraded performance&quot;, but to oscillate or show other undesired behavior.
So I changed the text to explicitly state: 0 resistance wire.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 17:55, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

:[Djhk] We need to show complete circuits. This includes inputs. Circuits respond differently if the input is an ideal versus a non-ideal source. To move an idea to not proven, I propose that you test the idea. This will require a complete circuit. Without a complete circuit, any idea remains a Fantasy.

== fully differential op amp ==

TI manufactures several 24-bit ADCs.
All of their data sheets recommend using the OPA1632 &quot;fully differential amplifier&quot;.
(No surprise that it is also manufactured by TI).

A &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#fully_differential_amplifier | fully differential amplifier]]&quot; is very different from a &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#Difference_amplifier | difference amplifier]]&quot; or a &quot;[[w:instrumentation amplifier]]&quot;.

Can Dieter's procedure be applied to a fully differential amplifier?
At first glance, I'm guessing that there's one minor and one major change:
* Use equal feedback resistors Rf, one from the + output to the - input, and one from the - output to the + input. Connect the &quot;common&quot; input to the appropriate voltage source. ''(minor change to the &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#Difference_amplifier | difference amplifier]]&quot; )''
* The sum of the gains = zero in a properly-designed fully differential amplifier circuit. ''(Right? major change)''

:[Djhk] Wrong! Daisy says that the gain sum is equal to one at the +out node, the -out node, or any other node. 
:How can you make the sum of two sets of gain equal to zero, if each set has a sum of one?
:Is 1 + 1 = 0 ?
:[[User:Djhk|Djhk]] 18:46, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

* Calculate resistor values for each input, using Ri = Rf / |desired gain|.
* For inputs with positive gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the + input on the amplifier.
* For inputs with negative gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the - input on the amplifier.
* If all your inputs are differential pairs, then the sum of all the gains is now zero. Done. Otherwise add a ground resistor to bring the total gain to zero.
If that process looks good, please move it to [[Electronics/Op-Amps#fully_differential_amplifier]].
(Should we mention fully differential amplifiers on this [[Circuit Idea/Simple Op-amp Summer Design]] page? )
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 23:15, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

:Don't insult Daisy! For any linear circuit the sum of ALL gains is equal to one.
:You need to analyze the circuit and derive the gain equation.

:''This construction will use some advanced concepts in mathematics and so it is recommended that this chapter be studied only after you are familiar with equivalence classes and embeddings. It can be safely skipped till you study these concepts.''

Until now we have been following the axiomatic approach in our study of real numbers. That is, we have assumed that there exists a set of real numbers with certain [[Real_analysis/The_real_numbers#The_axioms|axioms]]. However in mathematics one tries to make such assumptions as little as possible. At the bare foundations we actually make (without possibly knowing it) some [[Set Theory/Zermelo-Fraenkel Axiomatic Set Theory|assumptions]] regarding sets, and it would be nice if we needn't add any more. In fact using only the assumptions concerning sets it is possible to prove that a set of rationals exist. So our job is to actually construct the reals using the available rationals, in order to prove that the axioms of the real numbers are consistent and exist under ZFC.

We'll begin our construction with a plethora of definitions.
==[[../Sequences|Sequences]]==
These definitions are more thoroughly explored in the sequences section of the book.  The main difference is that the elements of the sequences we describe here are rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; not real numbers&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  
They are repeated here for convenience but for greater detail please refer to the appropriate section.
A ''sequence'' of rational numbers is any function &lt;math&gt;x:\mathbb N\rightarrow\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. 

===Special Sequences===
A sequence of rationals &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a ''null sequence'' if for each rational &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for evey &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|x_n| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

A rational sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant sequence if there is some rational &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n=x&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

===Addition and Multiplication of Sequences===
Now define addition of two sequences &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_n)&lt;/math&gt; to be the sequence &lt;math&gt;((f+g)_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(f+g)_n = f_n + g_n&lt;/math&gt;.
Also define the multiplication of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_n)&lt;/math&gt; as the sequence &lt;math&gt;((fg)_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(fg)_n = f_ng_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Negation ====
Let &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a rational sequence. Then the negation of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;-(f_n)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the rational sequence &lt;math&gt;(-f_n)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the sequence &lt;math&gt;(g_n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_n = -f_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Subtraction ====
Let &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_n)&lt;/math&gt; be two sequences of rational numbers. Then we define the difference of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_n)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;((f-g)_n)&lt;/math&gt;, as the sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_n)+ (-(g_n))&lt;/math&gt;.

===Cauchy Sequences===
A sequence of rational numbers &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is ''Cauchy'' if for each rational &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;n,m \geq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x_m| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of such rational Cauchy sequences.
It is left as an exercise to show that null and constant sequences defined above are Cauchy.
It is an exercise to show that if &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_n)&lt;/math&gt; are Cauchy, then both &lt;math&gt;((f+g)_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;((fg)_n)&lt;/math&gt; are also in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
It is a simple step to further show that &lt;math&gt;((f-g)_n)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equivalence of Sequences===
Define a relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of Cauchy sequences, by &lt;math&gt;f\sim g&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f-g&lt;/math&gt; is a null sequence. 
Now it is a simple exercise to show that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Abstract algebra/Equivalence relations and congruence classes|equivalence relation]].

==The Real Numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;==
We will let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all [[Abstract algebra/Equivalence relations and congruence classes|equivalence classes]] of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Further we let &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; denote the equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  Our goal is to show that this set satisfies all the properties we attributed to the real numbers.  Since our goal is to construct the real numbers it seems reasonable to assign our proposed set the same symbol.  We must now go through all of the basic axioms of the real numbers and show that they are inherent properties of this set.

===Totally Ordered Field===
Now if &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{g}&lt;/math&gt; are members of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; then it can be easily checked that &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}+\overline{g}=\overline{f+g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\overline{g}=\overline{fg}&lt;/math&gt; are well-defined binary operations on Cauchy sequences.
Also the order &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by letting &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\le\overline{g}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is some rational &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;n\ge n_0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f_n \le g_n&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we have a set whose elements we can call as reals. 

===Completeness===

==Remarks==
A real number is thus the equivalence class of a special kind of sequence of rationals. 
Clearly the rational number 1 is not the real number 1. This seemingly counter intuitive issue is resolved by considering an [[Calculus/Functions#One-to-one_Functions|embedding]] F from the rationals to the reals defined by F(r) = &lt;math&gt;\overline{f_r}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f_r(n)=r \forall n\in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;. Under this embedding the rational 1 can be identified with the real F(1) and so the rationals can be considered as a subset of the reals. 

This seems rather a strange way to define reals numbers, but in fact this is mathematically quite sound. A set constructed in this fashion behaves precisely as real numbers should do intuitively and the construction of this set involves absolutely no assumptions on our part beyond those needed for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. 

{{wikipedia|Construction of real numbers}}
There is another way of constructing the reals using an approach given by [[w:Dedekind|Dedekind]]. The above way was given by [[w:Georg Cantor|Georg Cantor]] in 1872. Dedekind also published his technique in the same year. (For those interested, Dedekind's construction has been provided in the [[Real analysis/Dedekind's construction|appendix]]).</text>

\chapter{Choosing the parts}
\chapterlinks{Choosing_the_parts}

The first step to building a computer is acquiring the parts. This guide will start with a quick explanation of essential parts and elaborate on them further on.

A computer is made up of a \textbf{case}, also called a \textbf{chassis}, which houses several internal components, and the external components, including peripherals.

Inside the case go the following internal parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Power Supply}/\textbf{PSU} – \emph{power supply unit}, converts outlet power, which is alternating current (AC), to direct current (DC), which is what the internal components require, as well as providing appropriate voltages and currents for the various internal components.
	\item \textbf{Motherboard}/\textbf{mainboard} – As the name indicates, this is the electronic centerpiece of the computer, everything else connects to the motherboard.
	\item \textbf{Processor}/\textbf{CPU} – \emph{central processing unit}, the ``brain'' of the computer, most actual computation takes place here.
	\item \textbf{RAM} – \emph{random access memory}, the ``short-term memory'' of a computer, used by the CPU to store program instructions and data upon which it is currently operating. Data in RAM is lost when the computer is powered off, thus necessitating a \emph{hard drive}.
	\item \textbf{Hard Drive}/\textbf{Hard Disk} – the ``long-term memory'' of the computer, used for persistent storage – i.e. the things stored on it remain even when the computer is powered down. The operating system, and all your programs and data are stored here.
	\item \textbf{Optical Drive} – device for reading/writing optical disks. May read CDs, DVDs, or other optical media, depending on the type. It is essential for installing many operating systems and programs. It may be able to write some of these discs, as well. Some people like to have two such drives for copying disks.
	\item \textbf{Video Card}/\textbf{Graphics Card}/\textbf{GPU} – does processing relating to video output. Some motherboards have an ``onboard'' GPU built in so you don’t need (but may add) a separate video card. Otherwise, you will need a video card. These plug into a slot on the motherboard and provide a place to connect a monitor to your computer.
\end{itemize}

On top of the internal components listed above, you will also need these external components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Keyboard} – for typing on. Many motherboards won't even boot without a keyboard attached.
	\item \textbf{Mouse} – for pointing and clicking. Unless you chose a text-based operating system, you will likely want one of these.
	\item \textbf{Monitor} – This is where the pretty pictures go. They come in many forms, the most common being \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode\_ray\_tube}{CRT} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lcd}{LCD}.
\end{itemize}

These are the parts that a standard PC will use. We are not considering such esoterica as headless, touchscreen, or voice-controlled systems. You might want to make a check list (perhaps using a spreadsheet) of parts to use as you go about your process of research and selection. That way you won’t find yourself sitting down with a pile of brand new hardware only to find that you forgot an essential component.

Before you jump onto the web and start spending lots of money on expensive computer parts, there are three important questions you should answer which will guide your purchases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What will be the main function of the computer?
	\item What useful parts do you have on hand, from an old computer or otherwise?
	\item How much can you afford to spend on the system?
\end{enumerate}

\section{What operating system am I going to use?}
Before you buy components, be sure that they are supported by the operating system you plan to use. Almost all current, commonly available PC devices have drivers available for current versions of Windows (generally, anything 2000, XP, Vista, or newer); if you want to run an alternative operating system, you'll have to do some research; many alternatives have extensive 'Hardware Compatibility Lists' as well as software comaptibility.

\subsection{Windows hardware support lists}
Windows XP supports most processors and motherboards based on the i386 (x86; 32-bit) or x86\_64 (AMD64/EM64T; 64-bit) architectures. Put simply, all available consumer processors (especially from AMD or Intel) will work with the Windows XP operating system.

For other hardware, see \href{http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx/}{Microsoft's compatibility list}.

\subsection{Linux hardware support lists}

As one of the most popular free operating systems, Linux is a very good alternative. It has versions for many different architectures, including i386, x64 and PowerPC, though i386 versions are much more common. It will also support all kinds of processors, enabling it to be used on Palm PCs and even iPods. There are many different versions of Linux, produced by different companies. These are called 'distributions' or 'distros' for short. For a desktop PC, you should make sure to pick a desktop distro, one where the company/organisation has desktop users in mind, e.g. Ubuntu, SimplyMEPIS or Mandriva. SUSE is also a good choice, and has tools that make it easy to use as a server. Ubuntu has won many awards from PC magazines and is noted for being particularly easy to use (for basic tasks, e.g. web, email, word processing). It should be noted, however, that many popular programs, especially games, are not available for Linux, and the only way to run them is with special compatibility layers or programs like Wine, which may or may not work with a specific program.

All this is important to bear in mind as different distros will support different hardware (generally more 'bleeding-edge' distros will support newer hardware – look at Fedora, SuSE, Ubuntu, but not the stable release of Debian). A good rule of thumb is to buy hardware that is 12 to 18 months old, as it most likely has Linux support with most distros, but won't be too old.

\subsection{BSDs hardware support lists}
\begin{itemize}
	\item DesktopBSD, see \href{http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.4R/hardware-i386.html}{FreeBSD 5.4/i386} and \href{http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.4R/hardware-amd64.html}{FreeBSD 5.4/amd64}
	\item \href{http://wiki.dragonflybsd.org/index.php/Supported\_Hardware}{Dragonfly BSD}
	\item \href{http://www.freebsd.org/platforms/}{FreeBSD}
	\item \href{http://www.netbsd.org/Hardware/}{NetBSD}
	\item \href{http://www.openbsd.org/plat.html}{OpenBSD}
	\item PC-BSD, see \href{http://www.freebsd.org/releases/6.0R/hardware-i386.html}{FreeBSD 6.0/i386}
\end{itemize}

\section{What will be the main function of the computer?}

If you're going to build a computer from scratch for a specific purpose, you'll want to keep that purpose in mind when choosing your components; don't just go to the store or an online shop and start buying. Consider what you want to use the computer for, you may be able to save money by specifying expensive, premium parts only where needed.

Any reasonably configured computer built from current components will offer adequate Internet browsing and word-processing capabilities. For an office computer, this is often all that is needed. As long as you provide enough RAM for your chosen operating system (256 MB to 1 GB for XP or Linux, 2 GB for Vista) any processor you can buy new will provide acceptable performance. If the computer is for gaming, a fast processor, the addition of a high-end graphics accelerator card (or two) and extra RAM will provide a more satisfactory gaming experience. Besides gaming, computers intended for video editing, serious audio work, CAD/CAM, or animation will benefit from beefier components.

Here are some general system categories. Your own needs will probably not fit neatly into one of these, but they are a good way to start thinking about what you are going to use your computer for. With each we’ve indicated the components you should emphasize when building the system.

\subsection{Simple web surfer}

To provide basic functionality to a user who just needs web surfing, a little word processing, and the occasional game of solitaire, it’s important not to go overboard. Such a user has no need for a top of the line processor or 3D graphics card. A modestly configured system with an adequate internet connection will suit this user best and can be assembled quite cheaply.

This usage pattern is not going to stress any particular component, you should be looking at a mid- to low-level processor (historically, and currently, at about the £110 (\$200 approx.) price point or less), enough RAM for the OS and a mother board with built in Ethernet, video and audio. You can use a mid-level case/power supply combo (these components are often sold as a pair).

If you have a little extra money, spend it on a better monitor, mouse/keyboard, and case/power supply in that order.

\subsection{Office computer}
\texttt{}
An office computer can be expected to do word processing, spreadsheet and database work, internet and intranet access (including e-mail) and a little light development of spreadsheets, databases, and presentations. It might also be called on to do page layout work, some 2D graphic creation, and/or terminal emulation.

None of this stresses any particular component either, but since office workers often run several applications at the same time, and because time is money in this space, a strong mid-level processor is suggested. Typically this would be the processor one or two places from the top of the line, the Intel Core 2 Duo 6600 or 6700 would be a good current example. Plenty of RAM will also facilitate multitasking and save time.

You will not need much in the way of 3D graphics but you’ll want to make sure that the video subsystem has it’s own memory rather than using system RAM. Many integrated video systems do this and it can really slow things down. A cheap (sub \$100) (for this and other prices in US dollars see www.xe.com/ucc/ or other currency converter of your choice for conversion into your local currency) video card with 64 meg or more can be a good investment.

You’ll want a sturdy case (computers kept under desks get kicked by users and poked by cleaning staff) with a reliable power supply but nothing fancy. If you plan on keeping the system running nearly all the time, look for a power supply with a good reliability record. Any extra budget after the above should focus on a better monitor, better/more ergonomic mouse/keyboard and more RAM.

\subsection{Server}

A server these days can be anything from a home unit serving MP3's and homework files to the kids, to a machine running a business-critical system for a small business, to a 3u rack mount unit serving up millions of hits a day on the internet.

The thing that most servers have in common is that they are always on and therefore reliability is a key characteristic. Also they serve more than one user while storing and processing important information. For this reason servers are often equipped with redundant systems such as dual power supplies, RAID 5 arrays of four or more hard disks, special server grade processors that require error-correcting memory, multiple high-speed Ethernet connections, etc.

All of this is a little beyond the scope of the current work, but, in general, servers need lots of RAM, fast redundant hard drives, and the most reliable components your budget will allow. On the other hand, since nobody is usually sitting at them, you can get away with the cheapest possible keyboard, mouse and monitor (in fact many servers run ``headless'' with no monitor at all). Graphics are also a very low priority on these machines, and a read only CD/DVD-ROM optical drive (used, infrequently, for installing software and updates) will do just fine.

\subsection{Gaming system}

We’re not talking here about the occasional game of solitaire or a secret late night Zuma obsession. We’re talking about cutting edge 3D gaming – first-person shooters or real-time strategy games with thousands of troops on the screen at the same time, with anisotropic filtering and anti-aliasing and mip-mapped specular reflections and a lot of other confusing terminology that describes visual effects designed to make your system fall down on its knees and cry like a little girl.

So you're going to need the fastest processor you can afford and plenty of RAM, as well as a motherboard to match, since the speed of the motherboard buses can limit high-end components. But even that won't be enough, so you’ll need to offload as much of the work from the processor as you can. The first way you can do this is by adding a video card (or cards) with cutting edge GPU's (Graphic Processing Units). \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI}{ATI} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA}{NVIDIA} have been competing for ``king of the graphics card'' honours for years and the competition is so keen that new cards running on new GPU's are released, it seems, twice a month. So do your research and buy the best current cards you can afford.

The other component which can offload some of the burden from your CPU is a good audio card. The DSP's (Digital Signal Processors) on the audio card can take over a lot of the sound processing and free up the CPU for other tasks. Currently \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Labs}{Creative Labs} pretty much owns this space, but again do your research (partly by reading on) and get the best audio card you can afford.

Finally all of these components are going to require a pretty hefty power supply, particularly if you decide to run two graphics cards in Crossfire (ATI) or SLI (NVIDIA) mode, in which case make sure the power supply is rated for the dual-graphics card mode you choose. Generally a serious gaming rig will require at least a 500 watt supply; units are available up to 1000 watts (1 Kilowatt) and two Kilowatt supplies have been announced. Keep in mind that having a higher-rated power supply will not actually increase the power your computer draws. The rating is the maximum that the power supply is designed to provide. Get the best you can afford.

As you may have noticed, pretty much every component inside the computer needs to be top of the line; the same is true outside the case. You’ll want a big monitor, and a high resolution mouse. There are even gaming keyboards with the keys specially arranged, not to mention joysticks, throttle controllers, driving wheels, etc.

So, given that your budget is not bottomless, how do you prioritize? Well, the processor and video card are the components that will have the most effect on your gaming performance. Next comes the motherboard and RAM. If you use one instead of two video cards, you can also use a less expensive power supply. One of the advantages to building your own computer is that you can get the components you can afford now and plan to upgrade them later.

A note on cases for gaming rigs – it is not necessary to get a case with a side window that reveals glowing blue fans and revolving animated heatsinks. A well-built plain case will do just as well and let you spend more money on the components that matter. But if you have the cash, and that’s your taste, there is lots of bling available these days, so go crazy.

\subsection{Entertainment system/media center}

This is a computer designed to sit in the living room with the rest of your A/V gear. The idea is that it will record and serve audio and video files for replay via your existing television and stereo. The current notion is that this computer should be built in a special case that makes it look more like a stereo component, the size of which can present a challenge when it comes to getting all the necessary parts fitted.

For this system a mid-range processor will be fine, along with a generous amount of RAM. A fast Ethernet connection will facilitate sharing large files. You’ll also want a TV tuner card (or two) to get video in and out of the machine. Many of these also provide \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_video_recorder}{DVR} (digital video recorder) functionality, often without the monthly subscription fees and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_rights_management}{DRM} (digital rights management) restrictions required by companies like Tivo. A wireless keyboard and mouse provide for couch-based use and a separate monitor may be unnecessary as your TV will fill that role.

All components should be as quiet as possible since you'll likely be watching/listening in the same room. For this application it makes sense to trade a little power for passively-cooled (without fans) parts.

\subsection{Workstation}

A workstation was, originally, a single-user computer with more muscle than a PC, intended to support a demanding technical application, like CAD or complicated array-based simulations of real world phenomena. The niche that these computers filled – between high end PC’s and low end minicomputers – has essentially evaporated. The serious scientific applications have migrated to clusters of PC's with near super-computer speeds, and end-user applications, like video editing, music production and CAD, run well on high-end PC's. One sector that still uses large workstation farms from Sun or Silicon Graphics is serious, Pixar-style animation.

For any of the following uses, you will need the fastest processor and the most RAM you can manage.

\subsubsection{Video editing}

Big and fast hard drives are key. 10000 RPM Raptors in Raid 0 as working space with multiple 750 GB drives or 1 terabyte drives for storage is a good target. SATA/300 is highly recommended and SCSI subsystems should also be considered. A large amount of memory (2GB, 3GB, even 4GB) would be beneficial.

\subsubsection{Music production}

Plenty of disk space is important, but a music production (recording and mixing) workstation is chiefly distinguished by specialized external components – studio reference monitors instead of speakers, mixing consoles, microphones, etc. One piece of advice, if you have extra money, get better microphones, even if you have to trade the Bluesmobile.

\subsubsection{CAD/CAM}

More than most, a CAD/CAM workstation tends to be a machine that runs a single application, so choose your software and build the computer to support that. You’re spending a lot of money, usually, for your key app, so get advice from the people who wrote it.

\subsection{Other components}

A worthwhile addition to any computer is a basic printer; printed webpages are portable and can be used when the computer is turned off, whether it be a recipe for use in the kitchen or road directions for use in the car. Also, almost everyone will need to print and send letters at times.

These days, a dial-up (56kbps) modem is no longer adequate for web browsing, since so many sites now have Active-X, Flash, and other content which demands a fast connection (if the user is not to spend a lot of time waiting for pages to download). For anyone who will be using the Internet often, a faster connection (at least 1Mbits per second) is a must.

\section{Do I plan on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overclocking}{overclocking} my computer?}
Overclocking consists of running components at faster internal speeds than they are rated for. If you are serious about \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overclocking}{overclocking} your computer, you need to do extensive research into the components you select, as some parts respond to overclocking better than others. Processors that respond well to heavy overclocking are generally not very expensive (though overclockable memory is), but the price of a component is by no means a guarantee of its overclocking potential. Overclocking usually voids your warranty and is risky (you can destroy your entire computer), so be warned! You need to think hard about cooling the computer as overclocking generates heat. Anything from a few extra fans to a liquid-cooled system may be necessary depending on the nature of your system.

\section{Do I plan on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/underclocking}{underclocking} my computer?}
This can be ideal for always-on entertainment systems. Underclocked parts run cooler, often enabling passive cooling options to be used, which leads to a much quieter system.

The risk here is not destroying your computer, as with overclocking, but possible problems with hard-disk data integrity. It is a good idea to back up your disk data periodically on a non-volatile medium, such as DVD's or tape.

\section{Can I use any of the parts from my old computer?}

This depends on your situation; if your computer is more than four years old, chances are that most of the parts will be too old, slow or incompatible for your new machine. On the other hand, if you are upgrading from a fairly new machine, you may be able to use many of the parts. All of this assumes the old computer will no longer be used. If you, or someone else, is going to continue using your old computer, it's probably best just to leave it intact.

One important point – if you are selling your old computer it's a good idea to erase the hard drive before giving it to it's new owner. Special precautions must be taken to ensure that you are not giving away your sensitive or personal information. Don't forget that a simple 'delete' command does not actually erase the data on your hard drive. The original data will still be present and can later be recovered by someone else using special programs and/or equipment. To avoid this, programs are available that will effectively 'shred' your data, making it unrecoverable. Driver floppies or CD's that come with some hard drives may also have programs to do this, that write 0s or 1s (either way, ``blankness'') to the whole drive. Lower-tech approaches include running a speaker magnet around the hard drive a few times or drilling a few holes in the drive. Obviously, the latter prevents it from being used again.

Since monitor technology moves quite slowly, you can probably keep your current monitor and use it on the new computer if it's of sufficient size and clarity for your work. The same can go for keyboards, as well as mice, printers, scanners, and possibly speaker sets. On the inside, you may be able to take out the floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, and possibly the sound card and hard drive (depending on how good they are, of course). Sometimes so much is used from the old computer, that the line between an upgrade and a new computer can become blurred.

Reusing a hard drive is an easy way to keep data from your old computer. With most Windows operating systems moving a boot drive from one motherboard to another will entail a series of reboots and installation of new drivers. In the case of newer Windows systems, like 2000 and XP, an entire 'refresh install' may be necessary to allow Windows to install a new Hardware Abstraction Layer. Back up your data before trying this.

\section{Where do I find the parts?}

Once you have decided what you’re going to use your computer for, and have reviewed which parts are available for reuse, you should make a list of what components you will need to buy. A few hours of research can save you years of regret, so make sure that the computer you build will do what you need it to do.

Computer terminology can be confusing, so if there are terms you don’t understand, be sure to look them up. Wikipedia is an excellent place to start if, for example, you’re not clear on the difference between, say, DDR and DDR2 memory.

There are several places to buy parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Internet retailers} generally offer the best price for new parts. If a part needs to be returned, you may be stuck for the shipping; check return policies before you purchase.
	\item \textbf{Auction sites} like eBay and several others offer very good prices for used parts. This is especially useful for parts which do not wear out. Returns can be problematic or impossible. Some auctions may not be legitimate. Always check the shipping cost before you bid.
	\item \textbf{Local PC shops}---Their prices are often higher, but they may make up for this by providing a lot of expertise. Get opinions from other sources, however, as they may be eager to sell you parts you don't need.
	\item \textbf{Big local retailers} often lack technical expertise and higher prices, but can be useful because they usually handle returns quickly. Also good if you need something right then.
	\item \textbf{Trade shows} that occur from time to time also provide a good place to shop, as the prices are often significantly reduced.
\end{itemize}

Also, your local town dump may have a special section for computers \&amp; monitors that others have got rid of. These can be more or less brand new computers with trivial problems such as a busted power supply or faulty cables. Of course if the dump does have such a section, you should ask permission of those in charge. They're usually glad to let you go through it, but don't leave a mess. Taking advantage of this can yield incredible finds, with a price tag of nothing or very little.

\subsection{OEM vs retail}

Many hardware manufacturers will sell the same components in both OEM and Retail versions. Retail hardware is intended to be sold to the end-user through retail channels, and will come fully packaged with manuals, accessories, software, etc. OEM stands for ``original equipment manufacturer''; items labeled as such are intended to be sold in bulk for use by firms which integrate the components into their own products.

However, many online stores will offer OEM hardware at cheaper prices than the corresponding retail versions. You will usually receive such an item by itself in an anti-static bag. It may or may not come with a manual or a CD containing drivers. Warranties on OEM parts may often be shorter, and sometimes require you to obtain support through your vendor, rather than the manufacturer. OEM components are also sometimes specified differently than their retail counterparts, parts may be clocked slower, and ports or features may be missing. Again, do your research.

\section{What should affect the choice of any part/peripheral?}

Many things should be taken into account when deciding what parts to buy. Below are some things to consider.

\subsection{Compatibility}
You’ll want to make sure that all the parts you buy work together without problems. The CPU, the motherboard, and the RAM in particular must be compatible with each other. Check the motherboard manufacturer's web site; most will list compatible RAM and processors. Often quality RAM that is not on the approved list (but is of the proper type) will work anyway, but the manufacturers list of processors should be rigidly adhered to.

Again, you’ll also want to make sure that your operating system supports the hardware you choose. Windows is supported by almost everything, though watch out for older components if you're planning on using Vista. If you have any interest in running Linux or another operating system now or in the future, buy parts that are supported by that OS. It is also worth checking around the Internet to make sure there is no history of your chosen components clashing (e.g. certain combinations of hardware causing instability, crashing, etc.)

\subsection{Ergonomics}
Ergonomics is the science of designing things so that they work with the human body. This is obviously important when choosing peripherals such as a keyboard or mouse but should also be considered when selecting a monitor, and especially when setting up the computer for your use. If your wrist hurts or you’re getting a crick in your neck, look at the physical setup of your computer, check your chair height and posture. An ounce of prevention here can avert troublesome repetitive strain injuries.

\subsection{Operating temperature}
Modern components, notably processors, GPU's, RAM, and some elements on the motherboard, are very small and draw a lot of power. A small area doing a lot of work with a lot of power leads to high temperatures. Various factors can cause electronic parts to break down over time and all of these factors are exacerbated by heat. Very high temperatures can burn out chips almost instantly, while running hot can shorten the useful life of a part, so the cooler we can make these parts, the better.

If you are not going to overclock your system, stock air cooling, when paired with a good case with adequate fans, should be enough to keep your system cool. If you want a quiet computer then components designed for passive (fanless) cooling can be paired with very low noise case fans (or a well-vented case). In general, high-end parts will require more attention to cooling.

To keep your system at a proper operating temperature, you can monitor vital components with software (which usually comes with your motherboard). If you are seeing high temps, make sure the interior of your case is dust free, and remember that most cooling solutions can not reduce the temperature of your computer parts below room temperature. Of course, unless you happen to have your computer outdoors in a climate such as the Sahara, room temperature will be well within the thermal limits of any component on your computer.

Which brings us to overclocking. It's specialty cooling solutions that make overclocking possible, a processor that might run stable at a maximum of 3.3 GHz at 60C could hit speeds as high as 5 GHz with specialized cooling systems. A sensible person wanting a 20\% overclock could add a special fan/heatsink to his CPU and some extra case fans. An enthusiast seeking a major overclock might go with a water-cooling solution for the CPU and GPU and sometimes other chips. The real fanatics have been known to use liquid nitrogen or total immersion in pure water or oil. You should not try any of the more extreme solutions unless you \textbf{'really}' know what you are doing.

\subsection{Price}
Today, there are a wide array of hardware components and peripherals tailored to fit every home computing need and budget. With all these options to choose from, it can be a bit overwhelming if you've never bought computer parts before. Shop around and remember to factor in shipping and handling, and taxes. Some places may be priced a bit higher, but offer perks such as free shipping, limited warranties, or 24-hour tech support. Many websites, such as \href{http://www.cnet.com}{CNET} and \href{http://www.zdnet.com}{ZDNet} offer comprehensive reviews, user ratings, and links to stores, including price comparisons.

Since prices for any given part are always falling, it’s tempting to just wait until the part you want goes down in price. Unfortunately the reason prices decline is that better/faster parts are coming out all the time, so the part you want this year that costs \$500 may well be \$200 next year, but by that time you won’t want it any more, you’ll want the new, better part that still costs \$500. At some point you’ve got to get on the bus and ride, even if the prices are still falling.

Usually the best bet is to buy just behind the bleeding edge, where, typically, you can get 90\% of the performance of the top of the line part for 50\% or 60\% of the price. That last 10\% is very expensive and if you don’t need it, you can save a lot of money with the second-tier part.

It may well pay you to think of future upgradeability when selecting some components. While the computer that you are building today may be fine for your current needs you will probably need to upgrade it later. So look for components that support the newest standards and have room for future expansion, like a motherboard that will allow you to fit more memory than you are planning to use, or a case that has room for extra hard drives. If your current machine is maxed out the only possible upgrade is often another new machine.

You may also find that by overspecifing in some areas you can save money on others, e.g. if you don't currently need fantastic sound but you do need IEEE1394 (Firewire, iLink) then you might want to purchase a sound card anyway as some of the higher end sound cards also have a IEEE1394 port.

\subsection{Power}
If money is no object, this is an easy question; just buy the most powerful components you can find. If, like most of us, there are limits to what you can/want to spend, then focus on those areas where more powerful parts will pay off for you and scrimp on others. Always look for that sweet spot on the price/performance curve where you get the most bang for your buck.

\section{Primary components}
These are the components that will be the core of your new computer. It is impractical to put together a PC compatible computer without these components and a bare set of peripherals.

\subsection{Chassis (case) \&amp; power supply}
In earlier eras most cases were beige, and since most components drew far less power than similar components do now, power supplies received little attention. Recently, however, cases for the home market have become considerably more elaborate, with lights, side windows, glow-in-the-dark cables and other shiny/glowing embellishments. Cases now come in a plethora of styles and colors to suit anyone's taste. And as current components require much more power, power supply quality and size is an important issue

If you are only building an office computer, the style of case will be of little concern to you. You might want a inexpensive ATX case (ATX is a specification which refers to the size of the motherboard. Any ATX motherboard, and the parts designed therefore, will fit in any ATX case), and an inexpensive power supply as you won't be running a high-end processor or graphics card. As a guide, you’ll want a power supply with a rating of more than 300 watts; any less won’t reliably power modern components. Most case/PSU bundles are adequate, but tend to feature a lower quality power supply than those that are sold separately from cases. If possible, avoid power supplies with sleeve bearing fans, as these are of considerably lesser quality.

Before purchasing any PSU, make sure that the supplied wattage is sufficient for your components. Power requirements are usually listed in the manuals that came with your components. It is important to note a power supply's total power, and the power at each voltage: 3.3, 5 and 12V. If any of these do not meet your requirements, the rest of the specifications don't matter.

Some companies have calculators to help you determine what your power supply needs are; if you are the type to just plug in the numbers without reading the details, you should buy a power supply that is 1.5 to 2 times the wattage that results from these calculators.

For a quiet system, you can choose a fanless power supply -- more expensive but well worth it if noise is a concern, but be sure to monitor system temperatures to make sure cooling is adequate.

For cases and power supply here are some things to consider:

\subsubsection{Form factor}
Form factor is the specification that provides the physical measurements for the size of components and where mounting devices for them are located.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX}{ATX} is the most common form factor and is the de facto standard. In this form factor the motherboard is (usually) vertically mounted for more space and more efficient cooling than some other standards.
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microATX}{microATX}, or µATX, is smaller than standard ATX, but at the cost of fewer expansion slots. Many cases that support ATX also allow microATX. Flex ATX is even smaller than microATX, but only allows 2 expansion slots.
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTX}{WTX} is intended for workstations and servers.
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTX_(computers)}{BTX} is another formfactor designed for more efficient cooling.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{PicoBTX} 8``x10.5''
		\item \textbf{MicroBTX} up to 10.4``x10.5''
		\item \textbf{BTX} up to 12.8``x10.5''
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-ITX}{Mini-ITX} is even smaller than BTX, at 6.75&quot; square.
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLX}{NLX}
\end{itemize}

Many OEM computers use non-standard form factors. Be sure to choose a motherboard compatible with your case's form factor.

\subsubsection{Number of storage drive spaces}

Internal hard drives/floppy drives (which go in the small 3.5`` bays) and internal CD/DVD drives (which go in the large 5.25'' bays) take up space in the case, so make sure you consider how many drives you will need and what size slot they require. Note that optical drives and floppy drives will need what are called ``external'' slots (meaning they have a hole in the case through which their face can be accessed, while hard drives do not need to be manipulated manually often, so they can usually go into an ``internal'' slot. This is not to be confused with an external drive, which doesn't go into the case at all.

Note that it's possible to buy adapters to fit items that go in small bays (usually hard drives) into large bays. It is, however, not possible to do the reverse.

\subsubsection{Power rating}
The power supply you choose needs to supply enough DC current to run your components. Beyond that it needs to supply stable, accurate voltages, i.e. the 12 volt rail needs to supply 12 volts (within normal tolerances of 10\% or so) steadily under any foreseeable load, likewise the 3 and 5v rails at their respective voltages. Cheap power supplies tend to fall down in these areas. There are several tech-heavy websites that actually throw a multimeter on the PSU in the course of a review, seek these out and make sure you select a quality PSU.

In selecting a power supply, check carefully that it has the power feeds you need, e.g. six-pin PCI power, 20 vs. 24-pin motherboard connectors, etc. If you are planning on running two video cards in SLI (NVIDIA) or Crossfire (ATI) mode, make sure your power supply is approved for that. Both companies have certification programs.

There are several calculators that try to help you select an adequate PSU for your system, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \url{http://web.aanet.com.au/SnooP/psucalc.php}
	\item \url{http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculator.jsp}
\end{itemize}

Choose an efficient PSU. Efficient PSU's run cooler and more quietly and thus do not create as much noise (important if you plan to sleep (or think) in the same room with it or use it as a media center PC).

More informations about this theme can be found in \href{http://www.silentpcreview.com/article28-page1.html}{Silent PC Review}, \href{http://www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power\_Supply\_Unit}{OCAU Wiki}, among others.

\subsubsection{Fans}
Most cases mount one or more case fans, distinct from the fans that may be attached to the power supply, video card and CPU. The purpose of a case mounted fan is to move air through the system and carry excess heat out. This is why some cases may have two or more fans mounted in a push-pull configuration (one fan pulls cool outside air in, the other pushes hot interior air out). The more air these fans can move, the cooler things will generally be.

Fans currently come in two basic sizes, 80mm and 120mm. Cases tend to support either one or the other; in that the case fan mounts can hold that size. The larger 120mm fans spin more slowly while moving a given volume of air, and slower fans are usually quieter fans, so the 120's are generally preferred even though they cost a little more. Good 80mm fans can still be pretty quiet though, so while fan size is a factor, it shouldn’t be a deal-breaker if the case has other features you like.

Make sure the power plug on any case fans is supported by your mother board, 3 and 4-pin Molex connectors are common. Fans can also be powered directly by the PSU, but in that configuration, the motherboard can’t control or report the fan’s speed.

\subsection{CPU (processor)}
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the heart of your computer. It performs nearly all the actual computation that takes place as the computer is used. The choice of a CPU will affect the ultimate speed of the computer more than any other single component.

Before we can explain the differences between CPUs, you must first be familiar with certain CPU properties.

\begin{description}
	\item[Clock speed] Clock speed, measured in Gigahertz (GHz), (or Megahertz (MHz);1 GHz = 1000 MHz) is the number of calculation cycles that your CPU can perform per second. Therefore, a higher clock speed generally indicates a faster processor. But not all CPUs perform an equal quantity of work per cycle, meaning two CPUs at the same clock speed can potentially perform at very different levels.
	\item[IPC] IPC, or instructions per cycle, is the amount of work a CPU can do in a cycle. With modern processors this number is an average.
	\item[Front side bus speed (FSB)] Front side bus speed is the rate at which the CPU communicates with the northbridge chipset component on your motherboard, measured in MHz. A larger FSB value shows that your CPU is able to communicate with other components on the motherboard (and thus your system) faster.
	\item[Interface (Socket/Slot)] CPU’s plug into a socket on the motherboard. It is very important that your CPU is a COMPLETE MATCH to your motherboard CPU socket. Plugging a CPU into the wrong socket will never work and will usually break either the CPU, the socket, or both.
	\item[Bit width] Modern processors are either 32-bit or 64-bit (this is a simplification; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit for details). For our purposes a processor can be called 64-bit if it will support running a 64-bit operating system. The newer chips from Intel and AMD all support this for most 64-bit OS’s. If you have any doubts, check the support materials for the 64-bit OS you are interested in running.
	\item[Hyper-threading (HT)] Hyper-threading is an Intel technology which allows a single core processor to simulate having two cores, giving a performance boost when running several programs at once. It requires motherboards and chipsets supporting Hyper-Threading technology. The advantages of the Hyper-Threading technology have never been breathtaking and Intel has gone back and forth on it's support in multi-core processors.
	\item[Cache] Cache is memory implemented directly on the CPU. Data which is being used in computations is stored in the cache as much as possible and can be retrieved from there much faster than the same data can be pulled through the northbridge from main memory. Generally, the larger the cache, the faster the system will run. Cache comes in (usually) three varieties, L1, L2, and L3. L1 being the smallest and fastest, and L3 being the largest and slowest. Usually only the L2 cache size will be shown, as L3 is rarely used in processor design, and L1 will often stay the same size throughout an entire processor product line.
	\item[Core] The core of the CPU is the heart of the CPU. Often several cores will be marketed under the same name, so look at what core you are buying. It’s a mistake to choose a processor based solely on it’s rated speed in hertz . This number, while easy to understand, does not tell the whole story. The number of cores and the way they communicate will have a big effect, as will the fundamental architecture of the core or cores themselves.
\end{description}

Slower processors are generally preferred for overclocking, as they can often achieve higher overclocking percentages. Retail CPU's come in a package containing a HSF (Heat Sink Fan), instructions, and a warranty, often 3 years. OEM CPUs do not include these.

The current CPU speeds and advantages change frequently, so for up-to-date comparisons, you may want to check a website that specializes in Hardware reviews, such as \href{http://tomshardware.com}{Tom's Hardware Guide} or \href{http://anandtech.com}{Anandtech}. A current (as of 14 February 2006) beginner's explanation can be found at \href{http://www.behardware.com/articles/607-1/a-survey-of-40-intel-and-amd-processors.html}{Behardware}.

\subsubsection{Multiple cores}

\paragraph{Advantages}

Dual-core processors are a fairly new innovation built by both major processor manufacturers (Intel \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Duo}{Core Duo} / \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_2_Duo}{Core 2 Duo} and AMD \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlon_64_X2}{Athlon 64 X2}).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Multitasking: Each processor has two processing centres (cores) for a theoretical maximum of twice the operating power and for better multitasking. Major advantages of dual core processors are evident when doing heavy multitasking, such as encoding video and playing video games at the same time.
	\item Application Support: Newer applications are being written to take advantage of this technology by using a technique known as \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread\_\%28computer\_science\%29}{Multithreading}.
	\item Power Saving: Dual core processors (especially Intel Core Duo) have the ability to turn off one of their cores when application demand is low to save power.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Support: Older programs (with certain notable exceptions) do not support multithreading and may run very slightly slower on dual core CPUs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Multi-core Future?}
Quad core technology is finally here, and more and more programs are being built to take advantage of multiple cores. The large chip makers are discussing CPU's with eight, sixteen, even thirty two cores in the coming years. Only time and experience will tell how the advantages we are seeing with duo and quad core configurations will scale.

\subsubsection{Descriptions}
Often in advertisements (especially for prebuilt systems) a processor will be described briefly, like this:

\indent\indent Pentium 4 at 3.2 GHz

But there’s more to it than that, a more detailed specification would read as follows:

\indent\indent Intel Pentium 4 3.2GHz LGA775 FSB800 HT L2-2MB

Which parses out to:

\indent\indent Model: Intel Pentium 4

\indent\indent Clock Speed: 3.2GHz (=3200MHz)

\indent\indent Interface: Land Grid Array 775

\indent\indent Frontside Bus: 800 Mhz

\indent\indent Other Spec: HyperThreading technology

\indent\indent L2-Cache: 2MB (=2048 kB)

So we can see that while 3.2 GHz is a screaming fast clock speed, this processor might not be as fast as, say, a processor with a 4 megabyte L2 cache, a 1066 Mhz front side bus and two cores, even if that processor runs at a slower clock speed.

\subsubsection{Intel}

Intel classifies its CPUs using a series of numbers. 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 6xx and 7xx of which 7xx denominates the highest end products. Generally, the higher the number, the faster the CPU and the more expensive. Usually, models and ratings correspond.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 3xx Series: Intel Celeron (L2-128KB)
	\item 4xx Series: Intel Celeron D (L2-512KB)
	\item 5xx Series: Intel Pentium 4 / Celeron D (L2-1MB)
	\item 6xx Series: Intel Pentium 4 / Pentium 4 XE (L2-2MB)
	\item 7xx Series: Intel Pentium 4 XE
	\item 8xx Series: Intel Pentium D
	\item 9xx Series: Intel Pentium D
\end{itemize}

The number followed by suffix J signifies XD technology.

\indent E.g. Intel Pentium 4 3.0GHz L2-1MB with HT --&gt; Intel Pentium 4 530J

There is also the Core 2 Duo range out at the moment---it's naming scheme is relatively normal, except for the models ending with 50, they have 1333mhz FSB.

\begin{itemize}
	\item E6300/E6320: 1.86Ghz, 2MB L2 Cache (E6320 has 4MB), 1066MHz FSB
	\item E6400/E6420: 2.13Ghz, same as above
	\item (new) E6540: 2.33Ghz, 4MB L2 Cache, 1333MHZ FSB
	\item (new) E6550: 2.33Ghz, same as above
	\item E6600: 2.4Ghz, 4MB L2 Cache, 1066MHZ FSB
	\item E6700: 2.66Ghz, same as above
	\item (new) E6750: 2.66Ghz, 4MB L2 Cache, 1333MHZ FSB
	\item (new) E6850: 3.0Ghz, same as above
	\item X6800: 2.93Ghz, same as above except multiplier unlocked
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AMD}

AMD CPUs are even more confusing in classification. The AMD Athlon CPU rating are \textbf{not} of the actual clock speed but rather the equivalence bench mark performance corresponding to a comparison to the AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.0Ghz. The conversion Table is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item AMD Athlon 1500+ = Actually runs at 1.33 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 1600+ = Actually runs at 1.40 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 1700+ = Actually runs at 1.47 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 1800+ = Actually runs at 1.53 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 1900+ = Actually runs at 1.60 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2000+ = Actually runs at 1.67 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2100+ = Actually runs at 1.73 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2200+ = Actually runs at 1.80 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2400+ = Actually runs at 1.93 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2500+ = Actually runs at 1.833 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2600+ = Actually runs at 2.133 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2700+ = Actually runs at 2.17 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 2800+ = Actually runs at 2.083 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 3000+ = Actually runs at 2.167 GHz
	\item AMD Athlon 3200+ = Actually runs at 2.20 GHz
\end{itemize}

You may wish to purchase a high end AMD64/EM64T (AMD and Intel, respectively) processor, which provides support for 64-bit operating systems (eg. Windows XP Professional 64-bit Edition). Most 64-bit processors are backwards-compatible with 32-bit operating systems and applications.. Given the huge expansion in addressable memory afforded by the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit (a 32-bit address space tops out at 4 Gigabytes while a 64-bit space encompasses 17,179,869,184 Gigabytes) 64 bit operating systems are the wave of the future. For the time being though, given the enormous quantity of 32-bit software out there, and the limited advantages of 64-bit as of yet, the move is likely to be a slow one.

\subsubsection{CPU cooling}
CPU cooling is very important, a less than average CPU temperature prolongs CPU life (up to more than 10 years). On the other hand, high CPU temperatures can cause unreliable operation, such as computer freezes, or slow operation. Extremely high temperatures can cause immediate CPU destruction by melting the materials in the chip and changing the physical shape of the sensitive transistors on the CPU. Because of this, \textbf{never} switch on the computer if your CPU has no cooling at all. It is an extremely stupid thing to do. Turn your computer on ``just to test whether my CPU works'' and you'll likely find that the CPU fries in less than 5 seconds and you will be off to buy a new one.

Most CPU installations use forced-air cooling, but convection cooling and water cooling are also options. For traditional forced-air cooling, the heat sink and fan (HSF) included with most retail CPUs is usually sufficient to cool the CPU at stock speed. Overclockers might want to use a more powerful aftermarket fan, or even try water cooling to combat the increased heat engendered by overclocking.

Many retail HSF units have a thermal pad installed. These transfer heat from the CPU to the fan, helping to diffuse the heat created by the CPU. This pad is usable only once. If you wish to remove the fan from another CPU so that you can use it on your new one, or need to take it off for some reason, you will need to remove the pad and apply a thermal paste or another thermal pad. Note that some of the cheaper pads can melt in unexpected heat and may cause problems and potentially even damage if you are overclocking. In either case, thermal paste is usually more effective, just harder to apply. If you plan to do any high performance computing, or remove and replace the HSF often, thermal paste is suggested. If you are planning on a long term installation a thermal pad is often best.

Non-conductive thermal pastes made up of silicon are the cheapest and safest, but silver-based thermal pastes sometimes perform better and carbon-based ones perform better still. When applied improperly both can be conductive, causing electrical shorts upon contact with the motherboard. A thin properly-applied layer will usually prevent this problem, although some pastes can become runny when they get hot. Users should also beware that many ``silver'' thermal pastes do not actually contain any silver metal.

For quiet operation, start with a low-heat (low wattage) CPU. Processors made by VIA, such as the VIA C3, tend to produce low amounts of heat, though you will trade off a considerable amount of computing speed. The current generation of duo core processors are more efficient than their predecessors, but give off more heat than the Via processors. You can also underclock your CPU, giving up some unneeded performance for some peace and quiet. Another option is to choose a large copper heat sink with an open fin pattern. However, true fanless operation is difficult to achieve in most case designs. You can position a case fan to blow across the heat sink, or mount a fan on the heat sink. With either choice, a large and slow fan will give better airflow and less noise than a small and fast fan.

Some low-noise CPU cooling fans require special mounting hardware on the motherboard. Be sure that the cooling fan you choose is compatible with your motherboard.

\subsection{Motherboard}
It cannot be over stressed that the motherboard is the MOST important part of your computer. It is worth investing in a decent motherboard rather than a CPU (although if financially acceptable, both) as your motherboard is what connects different parts of the computer together. In addition, the difference between a cheap and a quality motherboard is typically around \$100. A good motherboard allows a modest CPU and RAM to run at maximum efficiency whereas a bad motherboard restricts high-end products to run only at modest levels. A high quality motherboard can go for UKS£100/USD\$200 or more.

There are six things one must consider in choosing a motherboard: CPU interface, Chipset, IDE or SATA support, Expansion slot interfaces, and other connectors. One must also make sure that the motherboard is of a form factor compatible with the case.

\subsubsection{CPU interface}
The CPU interface is the ``plug'' that your processor goes into. For your processor to physically fit in the motherboard, the interface must be an \textbf{exact match} to your processor. Intel currently has two mainstream formats, the older Socket 478 (which is gradually being phased out) and the newer Land Grid Array 775. AMD currently uses three sockets, AM2, 754 and 939. The new AM2 sockets are faster (compatible with DDR II RAM) and more efficient than the older two. Socket 754 was aimed at the value market, while Socket 939 was for performance applications.

Check with the motherboard manufacturer to ensure that the slot on the motherboard will support the CPU you want to use. It is important to know whether the motherboard's bus can support the exact CPU you plan on using.

If the motherboard, CPU, and heatsink/fan are not compatible and installed correctly, you can destroy the CPU and/or the motherboard in a matter of seconds. Most modern processors come with a stock cooling fan which will work well at stock speeds, stick with this if you have any doubts.

\subsubsection{Chipset}
Chipsets are also important as they determine the efficiency of RAM and Expansion slots

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intel 915 supports up to 533MHz PC4200 DDRII RAM
	\item Intel 925 supports up to 600MHz PC4800 DDRII RAM
\end{itemize}

All current and popular AMD formats use DDR RAM, with the standard 400MHz PC3200 being most common. Most Intel socket 478 processors also use the older DDR RAM

The function of BIOS is highly important. Some BIOS features crash proof functions essential for updating the firmware. Other motherboards allow BIOS control of overclocking of CPU, RAM and Graphics card which are much more stable and safer for overclocking. Newer BIOS have temperature controls, and functions that shut down the computer if the temperature gets too high.

\subsubsection{IDE (ATA) or SATA interface}
Most motherboards have two parallel , 44 pin IDE interface connectors. These are used for connecting hard drives (though these PATA (parallel ATA) connections are rapidly being replaced by SATA (Serial ATA) connections for HDs) and optical drives, like CD and DVD drives. Up to two devices can be connected to each IDE port, in a Master/Slave configuration.. A 44 wire ribbon cable is used for this connection with three connectors, one on each end and one in the middle (actually a few inches from one end). One end is plugged into the motherboard connection and the other end is plugged into the first (or only) device. If two devices are connected the second is connected to the middle connection. The device plugged into the end must be configured as a master (usually via a jumper on a set of pins on the device) while the second must be configured as a slave – OR both must be configured as “cable select”.

Two devices connected on the same IDE port will contend for access to the bus, this causes a compromise in the speed of the drives. The newer serial ATA (SATA) interface has four separate slots that allow independent access and this increases the speed at which hard drives work, though, as of yet, there are few SATA optical drives available. The cables are also narrower, improving the flow of air inside the case.

The support for older (PATA) IDE drives is starting to disappear. The new G/Q/P 965 chipset series from Intel completely dropped support for such devices. Nevertheless, all motherboard makers are still including an additional IDE controller on their boards, and it will remain possible to buy an extra PCI IDE controller.

\subsubsection{Expansion slot interfaces}

Old motherboards may have one or more the following slots:
\begin{itemize}
	\item AGP---for graphics cards (ranging from AGP 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x)
	\item PCI---for expansion cards and low end graphics cards
\end{itemize}

ATI still manufactures PCI graphics cards, but for better performance try a card supporting PCI-Express. AGP is not a good idea, because it is a standard that is on it's way out. You may come upon ancient motherboards with neither AGP nor PCI, but please don't waste your time trying to reuse them.

Due to the evolution of new graphics cards on the serial PCI-Express Technology, current newer motherboards have the following connections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{PCI-Express 16x} for mainstream graphics cards (4 times speed of AGP 8x)
	\item \textbf{PCI-Express 1x} for faster expansion cards (replacing older PCI)
	\item \textbf{PCI} for use of old expansion cards (will eventually be phased out)
\end{itemize}

Older AGP 8x graphics cards are generally being discontinued in favor of PCI-Express 16x, as the speed and efficiency is about 4 times that of the AGP 8x technology. Old PCI cards are either now built into the motherboard (for sound cards, LAN cards, IEEE 1394 firewire and USB 2.0 interfaces) or becoming PCI-Express variants.

\subsubsection{Other connectors}

\begin{description}
	\item[USB] In addition to the USB 2.0 ports provided on the back panel, most motherboards will have connectors for additional ports, either on the front of the case or in a panel that fits where a PCI card might otherwise be connected. USB 2.0 ports (and be sure that your chosen motherboard supports the faster 2.0 standard) are used for connecting various peripherals such as printers, external hard drives etc. USB connectors are also used for connecting MP3 players, some cameras and an assortment of less serious devices like fans, nerf missile launchers and drink warmers. Given the growing popularity of USB devices, the more ports your motherboard supports the better.
	\item[Serial (COM) or parallel (printer) ports] Traditional 9-pin serial and parallel ports are much less used than they used to be. Many motherboards have dropped the parallel port (formerly used almost exclusively for connecting printers) altogether, while serial ports, which once numbered as many as four, are now usually solitary. The principal use for serial ports was once connection to either a mouse or an external modem, both of these devices now connect via USB. Unless you are connecting some seriously old peripheral hardware, these ports will be of minimal importance
	\item[IEEE 1394 firewire] Firewire ports are principally used for connecting DV (Digital Video) cameras and external hard drives. This technology got a foothold because it was much faster than USB 1.0 and 1.1. With the near ubiquity of USB 2.0, however, the original (and still the most common) IEE1394 implementation, firewire 400, was actually a little slower. For this reason, and in spite of the existence of a faster but seldom implemented specification, firewire 800, firewire is not as popular as USB. Like USB, most motherboards that support firewire will have one or more external ports on the back panel and the ability to connect one or more additional ports. One or two firewire ports will suffice for most users.
\end{description}

Note that, regardless of the motherboard’s native support, additional ports of all kinds can always be added via a PCI or PCI-E 1 card

\subsection{RAM (random access memory)}
The amount of RAM you use has become a fairly simple choice. Unless you are building on a very restricted budget, you just have to choose between installing one gig or two. One gig of RAM is plenty for most modern operating systems but all of them will run a little faster with two, it really comes down to a financial decision. You might also choose to get one gig of high quality RAM over two gig of lesser quality, especially if you plan to overclock. Some specialized applications may profit from more than two gig of RAM, if you are planning on using such, make sure you check that both your operating system and your motherboard will accommodate the amount of RAM you have in mind.

Another thing to consider when choosing the amount of RAM for your system is your graphics card. Most motherboard-integrated graphics chips and PCI Express graphics cards marketed with the ``Turbo Cache'' feature will use system memory to store information related to rendering graphics; this system memory is generally not available at all to the operating system. On average, these graphics processors will use between 64MB and 512MB of system memory for rendering purposes.

The actual type of RAM you will need depends on the motherboard and chipset you get. Some current motherboards use DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM but the industry is increasingly turning towards DDR2 RAM. Chipsets that use dual-channel memory require you to use two identical (in terms of size and speed) sticks of RAM. Your RAM should usually operate at the same clock speed as the CPU's Front Side Bus (FSB). Your motherboard may not be able to run RAM slower than the FSB, and using RAM faster than the FSB will simply have it run at the same speed as your FSB. Buying low-latency RAM will help with overclocking your FSB, which can be of use to people who want to get more speed from their system.

If you are upgrading from an existing computer, it's best to check if your machine requires specific kinds of RAM. Many computer OEMs, such as Gateway and HP, require custom RAM, and generic RAM available from most computer stores may cause compatibility problems in such systems.

RAM has different bandwidths, ie 400, 533, 600, 733, 800, the current trend is moving from DDR2-400 RAM to DDR2-533 RAM as it is faster. Higher end models are very expensive.

\subsubsection{Labeling of RAM}

RAM is labeled by its Memory Size (In MB) and clock speed (or bandwidth).

SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM) is labeled by its clock speed in megahertz (MHz). For example, PC133 RAM runs at 133MHz. SDRAM is nearly obsolete as nearly all motherboards have withdrawn support for SDRAM. It is now superseded by the more efficient DDR RAM.
\begin{itemize}
	\item 128MB SD-133 = 128MB PC133 RAM
\end{itemize}

DDR RAM can be labeled in two different ways. It can be labeled by approximate bandwidth; as an example, 400MHz-effective DDR RAM has approximately 3.2GB/s of bandwidth, so it is commonly labeled as PC3200. It can also be labeled by its effective clock speed; 400MHz effective DDR RAM is also known as DDR-400. There is also DDR and DDR2 labeled as PC and PC2.
\begin{itemize}
	\item 256MB DDR-400 = 256MB PC 3200 RAM
	\item 256MB DDR2-400 = 256MB PC2 3200 RAM
\end{itemize}

DDR RAM has two versions: DDR (also DDRI) and DDR2 (or DDRII)
\begin{itemize}
	\item DDR supports DDR-200, DDR-266, DDR-333, DDR-400 (mainstream) and DDR-533 (rare)
	\item DDR2 supports DDR-400, DDR-533 (mainstream) and rare/expensive DDR-667, DDR-800, DDR-1066
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hard drive}

Things to consider when shopping for a hard drive:

\begin{description}
	\item[Cache] The cache of a Hard drive is a faster media than the hard drive itself, which is normally 2MB (in low-end), 8MB (standard), or 16MB (large disks only) large. The existence of a cache increases the speeds of retrieving short bursts of information, and also allows prefetching of data. Most modern hard drives have 8MB cache, which gives better performance when compared to 2MB.
	\item[Form factor] 3.5 inch drives are usually used in desktops; 2.5 inch drives are usually used in laptops.
	\item[Capacity] The smallest desktop drives that are widely available hold about 160 gig of data, although the largest drives available on the market can contain 1TB (1000GB). Few people will need disks this large---for most people, somewhere in the range of 160-300GB will be sufficient. The amount of space you will need can depend on many factors, such as how many high-end games and programs you want to install, how many media files you wish to store, or how many high-quality videos you want to render. It is usually better to get a hard drive with a capacity larger than you anticipate using, in case you need more in the future. If you run out of space, you can always add an additional hard drive using any free IDE or Serial ATA connector, or through an external interface, such as USB or FireWire.
	\item[Rotational Speed] The speed at which the hard drives platters spin. Most laptop (2.5 inch) drives spin at 5400 RPM, while common desktop drives come in at 7200. There are PATA and SATA drives that spin at 10,000 RPM and some SCSI drives hit 15,000. However drives above 7,200 RPM usually have limited capacity, and a much higher price than comparable 7,200RPM drives, making drives above 7,200 RPM advisable only when the fastest possible speeds are required.
	\item[Noise and Heat] Modern hard drives are fairly quiet in operation though some people are sensitive to the faint hum and occasional buzz they do make. If your HD is loud, it’s time to think about replacing it.. Some hard drives can also throw a lot of heat and additional cooling may be needed. If your case is not very well ventilated, this is something to be concerned about. There is software available that will allow you to monitor both the health and temperature of your hard drive(s), it’s a good idea to check from time to time.
	\item[Warranty] Many manufactures offer warranties ranging from 30 days (typically OEM) up to five years. It is well worth spending an extra few dollars to get the drive that carries a longer warranty.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Interface}

The interface of a drive is how the hard drive comunicates with the rest of the computer. The following hard drive interfaces are avalible:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Technology_Attachment}{Parrallel IDE} drives}(PATA) use cables that can be distinguished by their wide 40-pin connector, coloured first-pin wire, and usually gray ``ribbon'' style cables. This technology is losing popularity because SATA uses thinner cables, eliminates contention for the IDE bus that can occur when two PATA drives are attached to the same connector, and promises faster drive access.
	\item \textbf{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA}{SATA} drives} have the advantages outlined above. If you want Serial ATA, you will either need to purchase a motherboard that supports it, or purchase a PCI card that will allow you to connect your hard drive. Note that some older motherboards will not allow you to install Windows XP to a Serial ATA hard drive.
	\item \textbf{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI}{SCSI}}, although more expensive and less user friendly, is usually worthwile on high performance workstations and servers. Few consumer desktop motherboards built today support SCSI, and for building a new computer, the work needed to implement it may be outweighed by the relative simplicity and performance of IDE and SATA. SCSI hard drives can reach rotational speeds of up to 15,000 RPM, though these are generaly prohibitively expensive.
	\item \textbf{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB}{USB}} or \textbf{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE1394}{IEEE1394}} can be used for connecting external drives. An external drive enclosure can convert an internal drive to an external drive.
\end{itemize}

\section{Secondary components}
These components are important to your computer, but are not as central and necessary as the Core Components.

\subsection{Video output}

For a computer to use a display for monitoring it will need some form of video card into which a display can be plugged. The majority of home and office computers, which predominatly use 2D graphics for office applications and web surfing can use an 'onboard' or integrated graphic processor which will be included on most low to mid range motherboards. For gaming, or 3D modelling, a good quality graphics card will be needed.

Currently, two companies dominate the 3D graphics accelerator market; nVIDIA and ATI. nVIDIA and ATI build their own graphics products, and license their technologies to other companies. Both companies make a complete line of cards with entries at every price/performance level, and each brand has its own supporters. Video cards have their own RAM, and many of the same rules that dominate the motherboard RAM field apply here: to a point, the more RAM, and the faster it is, the better the performance will be. Most applications require at least 32MB of video RAM, although 256MB is rapidly becoming the new standard. On the other end, 512MB video cards top the consumer end of the video card market. As a rule of thumb, if you want a high end video card, you need a minimum of 128MB of video memory -- preferably 256MB. Don't be fooled, though; memory is only part of the card and the actual video processor is more important than the memory. It is important to understand that an integrated graphics card uses the system's RAM, and relies heavily on your system's CPU. This will mean slow performance for graphic-intensive software, such as games.

It is generally better to choose your video card based on your own research, as everyone has slightly different needs. Many video card and chip makers are known to measure their products' performances in ways that you may not find practical. A good video card is often much more than a robust 3D renderer; be sure to examine what you want and need your card to do, such as digital (DVI) output, TV output, multiple-monitor support, built-in TV tuners and video input. Another reason you need to carefully research is that manufacturers will often use confusing model numbers designed to make a card sound better than it is to sell it better. For example, the Geforce 4 MX series of cards claim to be a ``Geforce 4,'' however, the actual processor is closer to a Geforce 2, only more powerful, meaning that these cards actually lack many features available even to the Geforce 3 series. However, when these cards were first produced, they were considerably cheaper than a real Geforce 4 (the TI series) making them an ideal choice if you were more interested in working on a spreadsheet than in playing games. For this sort of reason, you have to carefully pick your card depending on your needs. TV outputs can easily be adapted to your computer by using a DVI---Component Video cable.

Newer technologies such as SLI and Crossfire allow the use of two video cards to render the same video scene, similar to using two CPUs or a dual-core CPU. These systems tend to be expensive, as only some video cards offer this option, and you'll need two of them. However, it can be a useful upgrade path to consider. A SLI-capable motherboard is usually not much more expensive than the regular model, and will work fine with a single video card. You can use it with one card now, and buy another one in the future (which will probably be much cheaper by then), which means you will take advantage of your old video card too.

\subsubsection{Interface}
There are four different current graphics card interfaces: integrated, PCI, AGP and PCI-Express.

Most retail computers will ship with an integrated graphics card. This means that if you want to play new 3-D games you will need to upgrade. Most motherboards that have integrated graphics will also have one of the other three slot interfaces available so it isn't hard to place a new card to suit your needs if the need ever arises.

Older video cards use the standard PCI slots that are now growing obsolete due to limited speed and memory. These cards are needed for a few rare systems lacking an AGP or PCI-E slot (usually low end desktop systems designed to be cheap.) They are also useful for adding aditonal video cards to a system.

Although the AGP standard has now, by and large, been superseded by PCI-E, the cards are still available as are a few motherboards that support them. There are 4 different speed and bandwidths of AGP, 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x. While 8x is the fastest and most common for high end products, the true performance of your AGP card is limited by the lower AGP value of your graphics card and motherboard. For example, an AGP 8x card on a 4x motherboard can only run at up to 4x. AGP has mostly been phased out and there will not be an AGP 16x due to technical limitations.

The newest trend in graphics card is the PCI-Express (not to be confused with \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-X}{PCI-X}) system that supports up to 16x speeds. Some graphics cards still come in both AGP and PCI-E 16x models but the newest models of graphics cards are often PCI-E 16x only. While most motherboards have only one PCI-E 16x slot, those with two such slots can combine the power of two video cards using technologies known as SLI for NVidia, and CrossFire for ATI. However, you will have to match the video cards to a motherboard supporting the multiple card technology of choice, and use two similar video cards that both support dual video cards.

Keep in mind that to provide best picture quality your graphics card must be capable of displaying the same resolution as your LCD display's native resolution.

\subsection{CD/DVD}
Optical drives have progressed a long way in the past few years, and you can now easily purchase DVD writers that are capable of burning 9GB of data to a disk for an insignificant amount of money. Even if you don't plan on watching or copying DVDs on your computer, it is still worth purchasing a burner for their superior backup capabilities.

When purchasing a DVD writer, you will want one that is capable of burning both the '+' and '-' standards, and it should also be Dual Layer compatible. This will ensure that you can burn to almost all recordable DVDs currently on the market (the other major format, DVD-RAM is almost unused, for the most part, so don't worry about it).

\subsection{Floppy drive}
Though Floppy drives have been made largely obsolete in recent years by devices such as USB ``Thumb Drives'' and CD writers, they are often installed anyway because they are sometimes required for BIOS updates and exchanging small files with older computers. Floppy drives block air movement with wide cables, and can make computers set to check the drive take longer to start (most have an option in their bios to disable this.). One option to overcome the cable problem and to make it easier to install is to buy an external USB floppy drive, these are potentially a little bit faster and can be plugged into a different system (such as a laptop without a floppy drive.) However, not all systems support booting from a USB floppy drive -- most notably older motherboards.

It should be noted that floppy disks are not suitable for long term storage of data, even in a backup role. Never keep your only copy of an important file on a floppy disk.

\subsection{Sound card}
Most motherboards have built-in sound features. These are often adequate for most users. However, you can purchase a good sound card and speakers at relatively low cost---a few dollars at the low end can make an enormous difference in the range and clarity of sound. Also, these onboard systems tend to use more system resources, so you are better off with a real soundcard for gaming.

Sound card quality depends on a few factors. The digital-analog conversion (DAC) is generally the most important stage for general clarity, but this is hard to measure. Reviews, especially those from audiophile sources, are worth consulting for this; but don't go purely by specifications, as many different models with similar specs can produce completely different results. Cards may offer digital (S/PDIF) output, in which case the DAC process is moved from your sound card either to a dedicated receiver or to one built into your speakers.

Sound cards made for gaming or professional music tend to do outstandingly well for their particular purpose. In games various effects are oftentimes applied to the sound in real-time, and a gaming sound card will be able to do this processing on-board, instead of using your CPU for the task. Professional music cards tend to be built both for maximum sound quality and low latency (transmission delay) input and output, and include more and/or different kinds of inputs than those of consumer cards.

\subsection{Modem}
A modem is needed in order to connect to a dial up internet connection. A modem can also be used for faxing. Modems can attach to the computer in different ways, and can have built-in processing or use the computer's CPU for processing.

Modems with built-in processing generally include all modems that connect via a standard serial port, as well as any modems that refer to themselves as ``Hardware Modems''. Software Modems, or modems that rely on the CPU generally include both Internal and USB modems, or have packaging that mentions drivers or requiring a specific CPU to work.

Modems that rely on the CPU are often designed specifically for the current version of Windows only, and will require drivers that are incompatible with future Windows versions, and may be difficult to upgrade. Software Modems are also very difficult to find drivers for non-Windows operating systems. The manufacturer is unlikely to support the hardware with new drivers after it is discontinued, forcing you to buy new hardware. Most such modems are internal or external USB, but this is not always the case.

Modems can be attached via USB, a traditional serial port, or an internal card slot. Internal and USB modems are more easily autodetected by the operating system and less likely to have problems with setup. USB and serial port modems often require an extra power supply block.

Gaming modems are normal modems that default to having a low compression setting to reduce lag, but are generally no longer used by gamers, who prefer broadband connections.

\subsection{Ethernet card}
An ethernet card is required in order to connect to a local area network or a cable or DSL modem. These typically come in speeds of 10Mbps, 100Mbps, or 1000Mbps (gigabit); these are designated as 10Mbps, 10/100Mbps, or 10/100/1000Mbps products. The 10/100 and 10/100/1000 parts are most commonly in use today. In many cases, one or two ethernet adapters will be built into a motherboard. If there are none, you will have to purchase one---these typically are inserted into a PCI slot. To get the full speed of 10/100/1000Mbps ethernet, it's best to get a motherboard with that connector built in.

\section{Peripherals}
Anything outside the case that connects to your computer is considered a peripheral. The keyboard, mouse and monitor are pretty much the bare minimum you can go with and still be able to interact with your computer. Your choice in peripherals depends on personal preference and what you intend to do with your computer.

\subsection{Mouse and keyboard}
There are, broadly, two types of mouse: optical and mechanical. Mechanical mice use a rubber coated ball bearing that contacts the mousepad or other surface and actually rolls around. Optical mice use a bright light and a sensor to track the movement of the mouse.

When choosing a mouse, there is generally no reason not to choose an optical mouse. They are considerably lighter (and as such, reduce \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive\_strain\_injury}{RSI}) as they have no moving parts, they are much better at smoothly tracking movement, and they don’t require constant cleaning like ball mice (though it may be wise to brush off the lens with a q-tip or other soft tool on occasion). Make sure that you spend money on a decent-quality mouse made by companies such as Microsoft or Logitech, as lower-end optical mice will skip if moved too fast. Mice of medium-to-high quality will track your movement almost flawlessly.

Although three buttons are generally enough for operating a computer in normal circumstances, extra buttons can come in handy, as you can add set actions to each button, and they can come in handy for playing various video games. One thing to note is that with some mice those extra buttons are not actually seen by the computer itself as extra buttons and will not work properly in games. These buttons use software provided by the manufacturer to function. However, it is sometimes possible to configure the software to map the button to act like a certain keyboard key so that it will be possible to use it in games in this manner.

Wireless keyboards and mice do not now display the sort of noticeable delay that they once did, and now also have considerably improved battery life. However, gamers may still want to avoid wireless input devices because the very slight delay may impact gaming activities, though some of the higher end models have less trouble with this. The extra weight of the batteries can also be an inconvenience.

\subsection{Printer and scanner}
For most purposes, a mid-range inkjet printer will work well for most people. If you plan on printing photos, you will want one that is capable of printing at around 4800dpi. Also, you will want to compare the speed of various printers, which is usually listed in ppm (pages per minute). When choosing a printer, always check how much new cartridges cost, as replacement cartridges can quickly outweigh the actual printer's cost. Be aware of other possible quirks as well. For example, Epson has protection measures that make refilling your own ink cartridges more difficult because an embedded microchip that keeps track of how much ink has been used keeps the printer from seeing the cartridge as full once it has been emptied.

For office users that plan to do quite a bit of black and white printing buying a black and white laser printer is now an affordable option, and the savings and speed can quickly add up for home office users printing more than 500 pages a month.

Scanners are useful, especially in office settings, they can function with your printer as a photocopier, and with software can also interact with your modem to send Faxes. When purchasing a Scanner, check to see how ``accessible'' it is (does it have one-touch buttons), and check how good the scanning quality is, before you leave the store if possible.

Finally, ``Multi-Function Centres'' (also called ``Printer-Scanner-Copiers'') are often a cost-effective solution to purchasing both, as they take up only one port on your computer, and one power point, but remember that they can be a liability, since if one component breaks down, both may need to be replaced.

\subsection{Display}
When choosing a display for your computer, you have two choices: a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screen, or a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen. Both technologies have their advantages and disadvantages: CRTs have been preferred by gamers and graphic artists, for their generally superior response times and color gamut, but this is offset by the added size and weight that a large screen requires. CRTs are still somewhat cheaper in sizes of 17 inches or less but LCDs are generally less expensive than CRTs in sizes above 17 inches. In sizes above 21 inches LCDs are far cheaper, and much easier to find. High-end LCD models are generally preferred for tasks which need higher definition, such as movie editing, and are also popular amongst people with little-to-no desk space, as they do not need as much space as a similarly-sized CRT.

\subsubsection{LCD panels}
Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) have the advantage of being a completely digital setup, when used with the DVI-D or HDMI digital connectors. When running at the screen's native resolution, this can result in the most stable and sharp image available on current monitors. Many LCD panel displays are sold with an analog 15-pin VGA connector or, rarely, with an analog DVI-I connector. Such displays will be a bit fuzzier than their digital counterparts, and are generally not preferred over a similarly-sized CRT. If you want an LCD display, be sure to choose a digital setup if you can; however, manufacturers have chosen to use this feature for price differentiation. The prime disadvantage of LCDs is ``dead pixels'', which are small failing areas on your monitor, which can be very annoying, but generally aren't covered under warranty---this can make purchasing LCD displays a financial risk. LCDs are generally okay for fast-paced gaming, but you should be sure that your screen has a fairly fast response time (of 12 ms or lower) if you want to play fast games. Nearly all flat panels sold today meet this requirement, some by a factor of 3. When picking an LCD, keep in mind that they are designed to display at one resolution only, so, to reap the benefits of your screen, your graphics card must be capable of displaying at that resolution. That in mind, they can display lower resolutions with a black frame around the outside (which means your entire screen isn't filled), or by stretching the image (which leads to much lower quality). Running at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle will either make everything on the screen smaller, at a significant quality drop, or will display only a part of the screen at a time.

\subsubsection{CRT (cathode ray tube) displays}
The other key type of display is the CRT or Cathode Ray Tube display. While CRT technology is older it often outperforms LCD technology in terms of response times, color reproduction, and brightness levels, although LCD displays are quickly catching up. CRTs are becoming increasingly difficult to find and have almost vanished from mass-market retail. High end CRT's are still available, though they are rapidly being discontinued, and now cost the moon. Used CRT's on the other hand, can often be had for a song as people change over to LCD screens, this won't last forever though.

There are two types of CRT displays, \emph{shadow mask} and \emph{aperture grill}. An aperture grill display is brighter and perfectly flat in the vertical direction, but is more fragile and has one or two mostly-unnoticeable thin black lines (support wires) running across the screen. CRTs are generally 2-4 times as deep as similarly-sized LCDs, and can weigh around 10 times as much. If you purchase a CRT display over the internet, shipping is much more expensive than an LCD, due to the significantly increased weight.

The response times of CRTs are often quicker than LCDs, which is good for gaming, however, CRT's can cause headaches in some people when run at lower frequencies, so it may be ideal to pick a screen offering higher update frequencies at whichever resolutions you intend to use. Most people who have problems with low frequencies (60Hz) find it preferable to have at least 80Hz at the intended resolution. Many won't be bothered by this at all however.

Note that sometimes CRTs with a flat screen instead of a curved one are called ``flat screens'', this is not to be confused with the term ``flat panel'' used to refer to LCDs.

\subsection{Speakers}
Computer speaker sets come in two general varieties; 2/2.1 sets(over a wide range of quality), and ``surround'', ``theater'', or ``gaming'' with four or more speakers, which tend to be somewhat more expensive. Low-end speakers can suffer from low bass response or inadequate amplification, both of which compromise sound quality. Powered speakers with separate sub-woofers usually cost only a few dollars more and can sound much better. At the higher end, one should start to see features like standard audio cables (instead of manufacturer-specific ones), built in DACs, and a separate control box.

The surround sets include a sub-woofer, and two or more sets of smaller speakers. These support 5.1 or 7.1 standards that allow sound to be mixed not only left and right, as with standard stereo speakers, but front and back and even behind the listener. Movies and video games make use of this technology to provide a more immersive experience. Make sure your sound hardware will support 5.1 or 7.1 before buying such a speaker system.. If your budget allows, you can avoid the computer speaker market entirely and look into piecing together a set of higher-end parts. If you are buying a speaker system designed for PCs, research the systems beforehand so you can be certain of getting one that promises clarity rather than just simple wattage. (Note: speaker power is usually measured in RMS Watts. However, some cheap speakers use a different measure, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMPO}{PMPO} which appears much higher.)

Headphones can offer good sound much more cheaply than speakers, so if you are on a limited budget but want maximum quality they should be considered first. There are even headphones which promise surround-sound, though these have not been favorably reviewed.

Now that you have selected your parts, you get to what is arguably the most fun part of the process: putting the parts together.

\section{Tools and equipment}
You won’t need many tools to assemble your computer, in fact the only must have is the screwdriver, but if you can get most of the following together, you’ll find things go a little easier.

\subsection{Basic tools}
Before you begin building or refitting a computer, you will need some basic tools:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 2 phillips-head (cross-shaped) screwdriver
	\item Needlenose pliers
	\item Anti-static Wrist Strap
	\item A large level working space
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Optional, but useful tools}
Some other tools and equipment can come in handy as well, such as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Grounding Mat or anti-static carpet
	\item Spring action parts grabber.
	\item Electrical tape
	\item Flashlight
	\item A second, working computer to swap parts, look for tips, ask for help online, download drivers and patches, etc.---very useful
	\item A can of compressed air---useful when working with older parts that have collected dust. A better alternative but also more costly, is a vacuum cleaner designed for cleaning electronics.
\end{enumerate}

If you do not have access to an anti-static mat or wrist-band, when working on a table rubber or leather-soled shoes can help prevent static charges obtained from walking around, although if you move your hands upon the ground, say picking up a dropped screw, your static charge WILL stay with you until you touch something metal. Therefore, after doing anything that might have potentially caused you to pick up a static charge, ground yourself on an unpainted surface of the computer case before touching anything electronic.

\section{Preparation}

Proper preparation is the key to a successful build. Before you begin, make sure you have all the tools you will need, and secure a clear, well-lit workspace. Gather all the components you’ll be using and unpack them one at a time, verifying that everything that is supposed to be there is actually present. At this point you should leave the parts themselves in their protective anti-static bags, and assemble all the accompanying manuals. Now I know you want to get started, but trust me, \emph{read the manuals}, check the diagrams, make sure you understand where each part goes and how it attaches. If there is anything you don’t understand, now is the time to do a little extra internet research or call the manufacturer with your questions.

Find a dry, well-ventilated place to do your work. You should have plenty of light to see your components with, and if possible, you should choose an area without carpet on the floor, as carpet tends to generate a lot of static, and this can be ameliorated by choosing a nonconductive floor surface. An unfurnished basement is a good work location.

\subsection{Safety precautions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Static electricity is the biggest danger to the expensive parts you are about assemble, even a tiny shock, much too small for you to feel, can damage or ruin the delicate electronic traces, many times smaller than a human hair, that make up your CPU, RAM and other chips. It’s important to use your anti-static wrist strap. Once you have the powersupply installed in the case, clip the end of the wrist strap to the outside of the powersupply. (Never plug your computer in while you are connected to it by a wrist strap.) This will ensure that you, the case and the power supply are all connected to a common ground, in other words there will be no inequality of charge that will allow a spark to jump from you to the case. It’s also helpful to have an antistatic mat to set the case and other components on.
	\item Nobody but you is at fault if you shock your components with static electricity. Make sure that you take the precautions in the previous paragraph to ground yourself from static electricity. (Note: if you really must work on a computer and haven't got proper anti-static equipment, it is \emph{usually} OK if you make sure that you don't move about much; are not wearing any static-prone clothing; handle components by the edges; and regularly (once a minute or so), touch a grounded object.). The \emph{case metal} of your PC's power supply will usually be a suitable grounded object. As noted above, touch it every few minutes while you are working on your PC if you haven’t got a wrist strap.
	\item Turn off your computer and unplug your Power Supply before installing or removing any components---if power is flowing to components as they are installed or removed, they can be seriously damaged.
	\item Never cut the grounding pin off your power cord. This ``safety ground'' stands between you and potentially lethal voltages inside the power supply.
	\item Be wary of sharp edges! Many lower-end PC cases have sharp, unfinished edges. This is especially so on interior surfaces, and where the case has been cut or punched-out. Use care and take your time to avoid cutting your hands.If your case has this problem, a little time with some sandpaper before you begin construction can spare you a lot of pain.
	\item Dismantling discrete electronic components such as your Power Supply or Monitor is dangerous. They contain high voltage capacitors, which can cause a severe electric shock if you touch them. These hold a charge even when the unit is not plugged in and are capable of delivering a fatal shock.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Construction}

Start by putting your case down on your work surface, with the case door facing up, and open the case.

\subsection{Motherboard}

Find the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motherboard}{motherboard} standoffs that should have come with the case. They are screws, usually brass, with large hexagonal heads that are tapped so you can fasten screws into the top.

Remove the I/O Shield from the back of the case where the ports on the back of the motherboard will fit, and put in the I/O Shield that came with your motherboard. There may be small metal tabs on the inside of this face plate, if so you may have to adjust them to accommodate the ports on the back of the motherboard.

Some case styles make it difficult to install the motherboard or the CPU with the power supply installed. If the power supply is in your way, take it out and set it aside (we'll put it back in later).

Now locate the screw holes on your motherboard and find the corresponding holes on the motherboard plate (or tray) in the case. Put a standoff in each of these holes on the tray and position the motherboard so that you can see the holes in the top of the standoffs through the screw holes in the motherboard.

Now is the time to make sure the ports on the motherboard are mating with the backplate you just installed, and make any necessary adjustments. The small metal tabs are intended to make contact with the metal parts of the connections on the back of the motherboard and ground them, but you may have to bend these tabs a bit to get the ports all properly mounted, this is where those needlenose pliers may come in handy.

If you have trouble lining up the screw holes, double check that you have the standoffs in the proper holes on the tray. With lower quality cases there are sometimes alignment problems and you may have to forgo one or two screws. If this is the case, make sure you remove the corresponding standoffs.

Now fasten a screw through each of the motherboard screw holes into the standoffs underneath. These screws should be snug but not tight, there is no reason to torque down on them, hand tight is fine, otherwise you can damage the motherboard.

There, the motherboard is in, now it's time to plug the other components into it.

\subsection{CPU}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{./images/Socket_462}
	\end{center}
	\caption{\href{http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Socket_462.saa.jpeg}{An example of a CPU socket, Socket A} (GFDL, by \href{http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Lzur}{Lzur})}\label{fig:Socket_462}
\end{wrapfigure}

Installing the CPU, and the CPU’s \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink}{heatsink} and fan, are by far the most difficult steps you’ll have to complete during your build. Here, more than anywhere else, it will pay to read the instructions carefully, look at the parts, study the diagrams that came with your CPU and/or third party cooling solution, and make sure you thoroughly understand what you are going to do \emph{before you try to do it}. During the process, if anything does not seem to fit or make sense, put the parts down and look things over carefully before you proceed. Some operations, especially installing the heatsink/fan combination, can require pretty firm pressure, so don’t be afraid to push a little harder if you’re sure everything is set up correctly.

The details of the installation process differ in slight but important ways for each manufacturer’s processors, and even within a manufacturers product line. Therefore, for these details, you should rely on the instructions that are provided with the CPU.

The two things that go wrong the most often and most expensively (minimum of a killed CPU, sometimes more) in building one's own computer are both related to the CPU and its cooler:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Switching the computer on ``just to see if it works'' before adding any CPU cooling unit. Without cooling, CPUs heat up at extreme rates (a CPU heats up anywhere between ten times and a thousand times as fast as a cooking area on your stove!) By the time you see the first display on the screen, your CPU will already be severely overheating and might be damaged beyond repair.
	\item Mounting the CPU cooler improperly. Read the instructions that came with your CPU and cooler very carefully and ensure you are using all components in the correct order and correct place.
\end{enumerate}

If you buy a third party cooling solution for your CPU make sure you get one that is compatible with the CPU you have. Most brands come with multiple mounting brackets that will suit many different chipsets, but it's best to check for compatibility just in case.

If using thermal paste, apply it only to the CPU die (the square piece of silicon in the middle of the CPU) and do so sparingly -- most modern CPUs take no more than a grain of rice sized dab of thermal paste. Some people do like to wipe some onto the heatsink's surface and then wipe it smoothly off so that bits of it may get into tiny holes for better heat transfer. \emph{See \href{http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic\_silver\_instructions.htm}{Arctic Silver Instructions} for more info on how to apply and remove thermal paste/grease. (It was written to be specifically for Arctic Silver paste, but the same techniques can be applied to other brands of thermal paste.)}

If using a thermal pad supplied with your cooler, make sure you remove any protective tape from the die just before installing and do not get it dirty---and do not combine thermal pads with thermal paste, it's either one or the other. Then, check that you install the cooler in the right orientation and that you set it flat on the CPU die without exerting undue pressure on any edges or corners---the latter can make small pieces of the die break off, killing the CPU.

One option you may consider, before installing the heatsink, is to ``lap'' the heatsink, which means to smooth out the bottom surface. To do this, you will need a very flat surface; a piece of thick window glass will work. Fasten your sandpaper on the flat surface, invert the heatsink on the sandpaper and sand in small circles, applying minimum pressure. Check frequently and when you see a uniform pattern of scratches, switch to finer grained sandpaper (the numbers go up as the sandpaper is finer, so something such as 220 is coarse while 2000 will be very fine.) Remember that you are not trying to remove any material, just polish out surface irregularities. If you get it right, you should have a surface which feels completely smooth to the touch (but don’t touch it, the oil in your fingers can cause corrosion of the fresh surface) with a mirror finish. Some companies producing heatsinks lap the surface themselves, so if the surface already looks like a perfect mirror, leave it alone. A lapped heatsink is more effective as it will have better surface contact with the chip.

Tighten the cooler using only the specified holding devices---if you did everything right, they will fit. If they don't fit, check your setup---most likely something is wrong. After mounting the cooler, connect any power cables for the fan that is attached onto the cooler.

As an aside to the instructions above, it has been my personal experience that fitting the CPU and heat sink is best done on a supportive surface (a telephone directory on a table in my case) prior to installation, to avoid excessive flexing of the motherboard.

If you've got the CPU and its cooler installed, and the motherboard in the case, you’re over the hump, there just a few more easy pieces to go before that momentous first power-up.

\subsection{RAM}

\begin{figure}[!h]	% Public domain
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Ram-slots}
	\label{fig:Ram-slots}
\end{figure}

Next, you will need to install your RAM (random access memory). Find the RAM slots on your motherboard; they will look something like the picture above. To install the RAM modules, first push on the levers (white plastic in the picture) on either side of the DIMM socket, so that they move to the sides. Do not force them, they should move fairly easily.\begin{comment} (They are the white 'handles' you see in the picture.) \end{comment}

Put the RAM module in the socket. Line up the notch in the center of the module with the small bump in the center of the RAM socket, making sure to insert it the right way. Push down on the module until both levers move up into the notches on the sides of the module. There should be a small ``snap'' when the module is fully seated. Although this does require a fair bit of force, don't over do it or you may break the RAM module.

Take a good look at your seated RAM, if one side seems to be higher than the other, odds are it's improperly seated---take it out and try again. As you handle the RAM, try not to touch the copper stripes you can see along the bottom edge, as doing so is the best way to damage the part.

Start adding RAM at the slot labeled ``Bank 0'' or ``DIMM 1''. If you don't have a stick in ``Bank 0'' or ``DIMM 1'' the system will think there is no RAM and won't boot.

On newer motherboards with 4 slots, you'll see alternating colours. For example, slot 1 is blue, slot 2 is black, slot 3 is blue, slot 4 is black.

If you were to put 1 gigabyte of RAM in your PC, it's best to use dual channel 512MBx2 sticks. Put the first 512MB stick in \textbf{slot 1}, and put the 2nd stick in \textbf{slot 3} (the two slots that are blue)---leaving slot 2 empty. This will give you better performance, vs. putting 1GB in slot 1, or two 512MB sticks in slot 1 and 2.

\subsection{Power supply}
Installing your power supply is pretty straightforward, if it came with your case it was preinstalled and if you took it out earlier to get the motherboard in, now is the time to put it back. Otherwise a few moments of screwdriver work will get the job done. Generally there will be a bracket on the top of the case where the power supply is mounted and a few screws used to fix it in place. Some cases place the PS differently, see the documentation that came with yours.

Some power supplies come with modular cables, so you can plug in only those you’ll be using, now is a good time to figure out what you’ll need and plug them in. Other power supplies have all the cables hardwired in, you’ll want to separate out the ones you’ll need and neatly coil the remainder somewhere out of the way.

If your power supply has a switch to select 115v or 220v make sure it is set properly, this is important. Many newer power supplies can automatically select and don’t have such a switch.

Once you get the power supply installed you should plug the main power, a 20 or 24 pin plug, into the motherboard. There may also be an additional four or eight pin power lead on the motherboard that needs to be plugged in, this is usually located near the processor socket. Make sure you check the motherboard documentation carefully for the location of the power sockets.

\subsection{Video card}
If your motherboard has a built-in video adapter you want to use, skip this section.

If you have an AGP video card, install the video card into the AGP socket. This is always the top expansion slot near the back of the computer. AGP slots are often brown, but can also be strange colours such as fluorescent green. Check the motherboard for levers (or similar devices) that are part of the AGP slot to help hold the card in place. These must be retracted before insertion of the card. Check the motherboard's manual for information on how to use these devices (if your motherboard has one.) Push the card into the socket (AGP slots are often pretty tight, don't be afraid to push it until it's well inserted), then screw it in at the top of the metal bracket. If it has a power connector, connect it to a 4-pin molex connector. If it has a pass through, do not connect it to a hard drive.

If you have a PCI Express video card, install it the same way as an AGP video card, however the slot where it goes looks a little different having an extra spot on the slot as opposed to the 2 slot parts on an AGP slot. PCI Express slots used for video cards are commonly 16x as opposed to AGP 8x.

When your card is properly installed the line formed by the top of the card will be exactly parallel to the motherboard, if one side seems to be higher than the other, chances are that it's not fully inserted, press a little harder on the high side or pull it out and try again.

\subsection{Installing drive jumpers}
If you are using SATA drives there is no need to adjust jumpers -- you can skip this section.

Before you install IDE/ATA (PATA) drives, you will need to set the drives jumpers.
Each IDE/ATA channel can handle two drives, a master and a slave.
Consult your drive's instructions on how to set the jumpers. The jumper configurations are usually either printed on the back, or on the top of the drive. Drives can be configured in 2 ways: Drive Select or Cable Select.
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Cable select'': Use this if you have 80-pin cables. Cable select automatically assigns slave/master based on the plug on the IDE cable the drive is plugged into. Put the jumper on CS.
	\item ``Drive select'': If you are using a 40 pin cable, you must use ``drive select''. Master/slave status is determined by the jumper. In this mode, configure the drive on the end connector the master, and drive connected to the middle connector the slave. If the IDE channel has only one drive, check your motherboard documentation for the appropriate setting, which is usually master.
\end{itemize}

Note that Drive Select will always work, while Cable Select will only work if you have the proper cable.

\subsection{Installing drives}
Next install the hard drive and optical drives.

How a drive is physically installed will depend on the case.

When using an IDE cable, plug the two connectors that are closer together into the 2 drives, and the third to the controller or motherboard. The connector furthest from the board should be attached to the drive set as Master. Make sure the drive that you will install your OS on is the primary master. This is the master drive on the Primary IDE bus which is usually the IDE 40 pin port on the motherboard labeled “Primary” or “IDE 1”..

Note: IDE connectors are keyed, so it \emph{should} be impossible to insert them backwards. However, it doesn't require very much force to do this and it can destroy your motherboard . Look carefully at the drive and the cable connection before you try to connect them. You should see a ``missing'' pin on the drive, and a corresponding blocked socket on the connector. If you break a pin on the drive, you will probably have a worthless drive.

Note: most parallel IDE cables have a colored stripe down one side. That coloured stripe signifies ``pin 1''---and usually will line up next to the molex power connection on your drive. Use this rule of thumb if your connectors aren't keyed.

Next, plug a 4 pin molex power connector into each hard drive and optical drive. If you are installing the power connector to a SATA drive, some drives have the option of using either the SATA power connector (a flat about 1&quot; wide connector) or the standard molex connector; use one or the other, \emph{not both}. Connecting both can break your hard drive. For better data transfer, you can purchase heat-protected high-end data cables at your nearest electronics store.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{180pt}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=180pt]{./images/Floppy_Drive_Cable-1}
	\end{center}
	\caption{\href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:Floppy_Drive_Cable-1.jpg}{Floppy Disk Drive Cable} (GFDL, by \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Shakespeare}{Shakespeare})}\label{fig:Floppy Drive Cable-1}
\end{wrapfigure}

If you install a floppy disk drive, the cable is very similar to the IDE cable, but with fewer wires, and a strange little twist in the middle. Floppy drives do not have master/slave configurations. The floppy disk connector is not usually keyed, making it all too easy to plug it in the wrong way! One wire in the IDE cable will be colored differently: this is pin 1. There is usually some indication on the floppy drive as to which side this is. The power plug for a floppy is 4 pins in a line, but rather smaller than the standard hard drive power connector. Plug the end of the cable with the twist into the floppy drive (``drive A:''). Plug the other end of the floppy ribbon cable into the motherboard. If you install a second floppy drives, plug the middle connector into ``drive B:''. The twist between drive A: (on the end) and drive B (in the middle) helps the computer distinguish between them.\footnote{\href{http://www.pcguide.com/ref/fdd/confCable-c.html}{PC Guide}}

\subsection{Other connections}
In order to turn the computer on, you’ll need to connect the power button and while you're at it, you might as well do the reset buttons and front panel lights as well. There will be a set of pins, usually near the front of the motherboard to which you will attach the cables that should have been supplied with the motherboard. (Sometimes there are cables already connected to the case, use them if they are there). These will plug into the front of the case. The plugs in the front of the case will be labeled. The pins on the motherboard may be labeled as well, but they can be difficult to read because the print is very small. The documentation that came with your case and motherboard should tell where these connectors are. The front panel LEDs are polarized: usually the positive wire is white.

In addition, you can connect any case-specific ports if they are supported by the motherboard. Many cases have front mounted USB, firewire and/or sound ports.

\subsection{Prepare for power up}

\begin{comment}	% CC-by-2.5
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{180pt}

	\end{center}
	\caption{Comparison of VGA and DVI}\label{fig:vga-dvi-comparison}
\end{wrapfigure}
\end{comment}

Some people will put power to a system several times during assembly and for experienced builders this may serve some purpose. For first timers though, it’s best to assemble a minimal complete system before powering up. Minimal because that way there are comparatively few potential sources of trouble, complete so that you can test everything at once and because the fewer times you have to put power to an open machine, the better..

If you’ve been working along with us you should now have such a minimal system put together. Briefly this includes a case with a motherboard in it, a processor (and its cooling unit) and some RAM plugged into the motherboard, hard and floppy drives installed, and some kind of video available. If your motherboard has built-in video, you might want to use that for this first try, even if you are going to install a video card later.

For this test, you’ll want to have the computer open, so that you can see all of the fans, and you’ll need to connect a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse (OK, you don’t really need the mouse . . .)

Monitors will either have a VGA or a newer DVI plug (see picture, as they are a lot less apparent than PS/2 / USB comparision). Most monitors use VGA connectors, and so most graphics cards have VGA output. If you have one type of plug and the graphics card has another, you can easily buy an adapter.

There are two standard connectors for mice and keyboards; PS/2 connectors and the more modern USB connectors. Plug the mouse and keyboard in the appropriate slot.

Note: If you intend to install an operating system from a boot CD or floppy, or modify bios settings you will need to use either a PS/2 keyboard, a USB to PS/2 converter, or a motherboard that supports USB devices. Otherwise your keyboard will not work until the operating system has loaded USB drivers.

Once you have this all set up, it’s time to double check, then triple check that you have made all the necessary connections and that you haven’t left any foreign objects (where’s that screwdriver?) in the case.

\section{Power up}
The moment of truth now approaches, time to take a deep breath, exhale slowly, then take a moment to check one more time that everything is as it should be. Make sure you've removed your wrist strap, turn on the monitor, then press the power button, and observe the inside of the open machine. (\emph{Do not touch any part of the inside of the machine while it is powered up – you will die and more importantly your computer will break.}) The first thing to look for is that the CPU cooler fan spins up, if it does not, cut the power immediately. This fan should start up right away; something is wrong if it doesn’t and your CPU is in danger of overheating so stop now and troubleshoot.

If the CPU fan spins up, check that all the other fans that should be spinning – case fans and fans on the power supply and video card (if installed) are also spinning. Some of these fans may not spin up until a temperature threshold is passed, check your documentation if anything is not spinning.

If the fans spin, you can turn your attention to the monitor, what you are hoping to see is the motherboard’s splashscreen, usually featuring the manufacturer’s logo. If you see this, take a moment to bask in the glow, you’ve built a computer!

If this happy event does not occur, if smoke appears, or if the computer doesn't do anything, unplug the power cord immediately and check the steps above to make sure you haven't missed anything. Give special attention to the cables and power connections. If the computer does appear to come on, but, you hear beeps, listen carefully to the beeps, turn the computer off, and refer to your motherboard's manual for the meaning of the beeps. Some boards have an optional diagnostic device, usually a collection of LEDs, which when properly plugged in will inform you of the nature of the problem. Instructions for installing this as well as the meaning of its display should be in the manual for the motherboard. If the computer turns on but the only thing that comes on is your power supply, turn it off. This probably means something is shorted, and leaving it on could damage the parts.

If all is well it's time to turn the computer off, and close it up. Then you may want to turn it on again and set certain options in the Computer's BIOS (usually by pressing 'F1' or 'Del' a few seconds after boot.) These options will be explained in the motherboard manual. In general, the default options are OK, but you may wish to set the computer's hardware clock to the correct time and date. The BIOS is also where you determine the default boot order of the system, typically Floppy, then CD-ROM, then Hard Disc.

If you want a further quick test, before you install an operating system, you may find a bootable CD-ROM such as \href{http://www.knoppix.net}{Knoppix} extremely useful.

\section{Additional hardware and peripherals}

Now that you have a working system it’s time to think about installing an operating system, which is covered in the next section. It’s best to leave the installation of additional components (like soundcards, modems, and second video cards) and peripherals (printers, joysticks, nerf missile launchers et. al.) until after the OS install in order to allow the plug n’ play features of the OS to do their stuff.

\chapter{Software}
\chapterlinks{Software}

Now that you’ve got a functioning computer, you’ll need to install some software if you’re going to do anything with it. An operating system or two must come first, then hardware drivers (so that the operating system can address your hardware) followed by security software and utilities. And that’s as far as we’re going to go with you, but you’ll also want to install some application software – games, word processors, databases, programming languages – whatever floats your boat... That’s pretty much the point of this whole computer business after all, though I hope you’ve found the journey of building it yourself has been worthwhile in its own way.

In this section we’ll consider what software you’ll want to install and how you might go about doing so.

\section{Operating system(s)}
The first thing to do after you have a working PC is install an \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operating_system}{operating system (OS)}. You can select from several available on the internet or from your local computer store. The first option, and the one taken by most people, is to install \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows}{Microsoft Windows}, of which the current version is Windows Vista. Another option is to install a GNU/Linux distribution (a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_software}{Free Software} operating system). There are many other operating systems to choose from as well, notably the very famous \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux}{Linux} but let us not forget other free operating systems, such as \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD}{BSDs}. Note that you also have the option of installing more than one operating system in what is called a multiboot setup.

If you are going to install both, install Windows XP first. This is because Windows overwrites the software that GNU/Linux requires to start up, even if something's already there. If you install Windows before all of your other systems, you will be able to easily boot into all of them.

Choosing between Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, or one of the other operating systems is largely depependent on what software you need to run. Simply put, can you accomplish your day to day tasks with the software that will run under the operating system in question? Microsoft Windows is better in terms of software availability, hardware compatability and support, but GNU/Linux wins in terms of stability, ability to run on older equipment, and cost. Both systems have a range of software, but determine your needs before installing either operating system.

Note that, having installed Windows, you can always install GNU/Linux later and, conversely, if you install GNU/Linux first, there is no throwaway cost to regret if it turns out later that you need Windows.

\subsection{Installing Windows}
The installation of Windows is relatively easy. Push the power button on the front of the PC, put the CD-ROM in your optical drive, and follow the on-screen instructions (you may have to restart with the CD in place). If you are doing a Windows-only install, just allocate all of the hard drive to XP. Again, for a Windows only install, the NTFS file system is faster and more efficient.

Some people find that it's useful to create separate partitions for the operating system and data. This means that if something goes wrong with the operating system, the partition can be formatted and the operating system can be reinstalled possibly without losing data.

If you are installing Windows on a RAID drive, or a SATA drive in some cases, you are going to have to provide drivers to the Windows installer so that it can access the hard drive on the raid controller. To do this during the Windows install wait for ``Press F6 to install any third party SCSI or RAID drivers.'' to appear at the bottom of the screen and duly hit F6. Then you will see a screen that says ``Setup could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in your system, or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter.'' At this screen you are going to want to hit 'S' to ``Specify Additional Device,'' another screen will pop up asking you to insert the floppy disk containing the drivers, followed by a screen asking you to choose the appropriate driver out of the set contained

\subsection{Installing Windows to dual-boot with GNU/Linux}

If you are dual-booting, some extra factors must be considered. NTFS, which is the default file system that Windows uses, is not very well supported outside of Windows. Only recently has \href{http://www.ntfs-3g.org/}{NFTS-3g} reached a usable stage, with users reporting no data corruption or loss during ordinary use of the latest versions of the driver, providing GNU/Linux users with a reliable way to read and write NTFS partitions. Previously only read support was safe, and this may still be the case for many distributions. However, NTFS does have some advantages over FAT32, in that a 4GB file size limit no longer exists. Likewise, Windows has no support for any of the standard GNU/Linux file systems. If you are going to be switching between the two frequently, then it might still be in your best interest to create a FAT32 partition for both operating systems to use.

When it comes the time to partition the hard disk(s), remember to leave space for GNU/Linux (a good amount is on the order of a third of your total hard disk space). You may want to have a spare FAT32 partition (of around 1 third of your disk space) on which to share documents between Windows and GNU/Linux. You should also modify the partition table as necessary---you may not need as much space for Windows or you may need more in your FAT32 transfer area. But you must ensure that you leave at least 3GB for your Windows installation, since the standard installation of Windows takes up about 2 GB of hard drive space, and it is always wise to leave a bit extra on, to allow for any changes that may occur.

\subsection{Installing GNU/Linux}
\seealso{Linux_Guide}{Linux Guide}
\wikipedia[\textit{See also: }]{List_of_Linux_distributions}{List of Linux distributions}
\wikipedia[\textit{See also: }]{Comparison_of_Linux_distributions}{Comparison of Linux distributions}

The primary problem faced in installing GNU/Linux is choosing between distributions. Of the many variants of GNU/Linux, Fedora, SuSE, and Ubuntu are generally recommended, as they are updated regularly and compatible with a broad range of hardware:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora}{Fedora}, currently at version 7. Used to be the de facto-standard GNU/Linux.
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suse}{SuSE}, currently at version 10.2.
	\item \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(Linux_distribution)}{Ubuntu}, currently at version 7.04. Increasingly gaining popularity as an easy to use desktop GNU/Linux.
\end{itemize}

Some GNU/Linux variants may support hardware that these do not. If you have obscure or old hardware, you may want to search bulletin board sites for various GNU/Linux variants to ensure compatibility.

For example, let’s consider \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(Linux_distribution)}{Ubuntu}. It's a variant of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian}{Debian}, and is the current standard for easy-to-use GNU/Linux distributions. One can download the .iso image or order a CD set (containing the installation CD and LiveCD) from its website. Most distros are available in these two ways. An .iso is nothing more than a special file format that your CD drive burning software uses to create a copy of the software, in this case a copy of Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

The installation of GNU/Linux is relatively easy. Push the button on the front of the PC, put the CD-ROM in your optical drive, and follow the on-screen instructions. By default, the installation version of Ubuntu will erase all files on the hard drive and partition 1.8 GB for the OS. If you want to customize, follow the on-screen instructions carefully. The LiveCd version does not erase your hard drive and is intended solely for a user to test drive Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

When installing a GNU/Linux distro, you may be asked to choose between alternatives – whether to run KDE or Gnome, for instance, or to install vi or Emacs. If the terms are unfamiliar a quick Google will usually bring enlightenment. Also, as in these two examples, most such choices are a matter of preference and either choice will work.

\section{Security}
After installation, security should be your priority.

\subsection{Updates}
From time to time, software companies and independent programers release new and improved versions to their software; these are known as updates. Updates usually install new features or fix problems. Usually, you should download the latest updates to improve system performance though it's sometimes wise to wait a little while to be sure the update itself does not cause problems. Many programs update themselves and this process is know as an automatic update. If you have to manually update your software, do so through the software developer's site, not through a secondary source. This approach will reduce the chance of contracting a virus or other piece of malicious software.

\subsubsection{Windows}
A newly installed Windows XP computer using a broadband connection can be attacked within moments of being connected to the Internet. In severe cases, the attacks can render a system unbootable or make a second reinstallation faster or easier than manually removing the malicious programs causing the problems. The SANS Institute provides a PDF guide called \href{http://isc.sans.org/presentations/xpsurvivalguide.pdf}{Windows XP: Surviving the First Day}, which explains how to update a new Windows XP box without immediately becoming infected by viruses and worms. To avoid having your new computer attacked, install a firewall, or activate the one that came with your OS. Both Windows and GNU/Linux have in-built firewalls: In some GNU/Linux distributions, it is enabled by default; in Windows XP Service Pack 2, it can be found by going to the Start button and choosing ``Control Panel'' then double-clicking the ``WIndows Firewall'' icon.

As soon as you are on the Internet, run your operating system's update facility to fix any security flaws that have been found since your CD was printed. To do this under Windows, simply click on your Start Menu, click on 'All Programs', and then click on Windows Update, and follow the instructions. If you use other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, then it can be valuable to use \href{http://update.microsoft.com}{Microsoft Update}, which covers updates for all Microsoft products. For either of these, you can also switch on ``Automatic Updates'' from the Security Center program mentioned above.

\subsubsection{GNU/Linux}
The method of updating your GNU/Linux system varies greatly from distribution to distribution.

For \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suse}{SuSE}, there are two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item YaST
	\item ZENworks updater
\end{enumerate}

For \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Core}{Fedora}, type

\indent yum update
as the root user inside a terminal window.

It is perhaps easiest to update the OS from Debian-based distributions such as \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian}{Debian}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu}{Ubuntu} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linspire}{Linspire}. For Debian and Linspire you type the following into a terminal window while running as the root user:

\indent apt-get update

\indent apt-get dist-upgrade

Ubuntu has you run sudo to switch run a program as root. Type the following into a terminal:

\indent sudo apt-get update

\indent sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

\subsubsection{Automatic updates}

If your computer will be running overnight, it may be good to have your computer update itself.
\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
		\hline
		Debian based &amp; cron-apt \\ \hline
		Windows &amp; Windows Update \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Anti-nasty}
Programs such as Anti-Virus, Anti-Spam and Anti-Spyware of commercial quality or better can be found for free online quite easily: Windows programs are listed in the software section below. (Usually these are not needed for non-Windows OSes)

Security software is important and should be set up first. The best procedure is not to connect to the internet at all until your choice of anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software is installed and activated, then connect to the internet and update each of these programs.

If you are using software that must be downloaded from the internet for this purpose, you can use another computer to download and burn the installation files to a CD or thumb drive. If this is not possible, download, install and update your anti-virus solution of choice first, disconnect from the internet and run a complete system scan. Then you can reconnect and install your other security software and be reasonably confident that you are not infected.

Once secured, your system should be safe for prudent internet browsing, remember to schedule regular scans and keep your security software up to date.

\section{Drivers}
Now that your computer is relatively secure, you will need to install software to control your various hardware components. This type of software is known as a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/_Device\_driver_}{driver}.

Although, most of your hardware will come with a cd containing the necessary driver, consider downloading the driver straight from the company's Internet site. This will insure you have the latest edition of the software. Knowing where to download the driver is also good in case you lose the cd that came with the device.

If you do not have a fast internet connection (broadband), the company usually provides an option to receive the driver cd in the mail, in which case you'll want to use the CD you have now and update the driver later. Even if something seems to be working fine, downloading new drivers may help increase computer efficiency, though there is always a risk that a brand new version may break something. Downloading drivers for your motherboard's chipset can often help if you are having a problem. Finally, many monitors will not go above a certain refresh rate without the proper driver, which may be of great concerns to gamers.

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can generally find drivers for your selected hardware on the manufacturer's website. Most GNU/Linux systems already have all of the drivers installed, with the exception of proprietary modem and graphics drivers. If you can't find the driver you need, a simple \href{http://www.google.com}{Google} search will often yield the best results.

\section{Software}

There is an abundance of useful software available for download gratis. From web browsers to word processors to graphic manipulation programs, there is plenty of software available online.

Though most of what is available is safe and useful, it’s always a good idea to do a little research and make a backup before installing anything new. The following are some proven and reliable programs that are available, free (or gratis), for individual use (and sometimes more, check the license).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{GNU/Linux}

Unlike Windows, on a GNU/Linux system the majority of the software that you will want for everyday use of your computer is usually included. You will probably not need to download anything. Most GNU/Linux distributions have a package manager (Portage for \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo}{Gentoo}, APT for Debian-based distros like Debian and Ubuntu, etc.) For some distributions you can simply download RPM or DEB files from your distribution's web site.

If they aren't already installed by your distribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Web Browser: \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox}{Firefox} or \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera}{Opera} (Opera is usually faster on lower-end hardware).
	\item EMail Client: \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird}{Mozilla Thunderbird}.
	\item Office Suite: \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org}{OpenOffice.org} or \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOffice}{KOffice}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Software}
For additional software some excellent sources of free and open-souce software are

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{http://www.tucows.com}{Tucows} a downloads site with freeware, shareware, open-source as well as commercial software. It has many mirrors all over the world for speedy downloads from local servers.
	\item \href{http://www.download.com/}{Download.com} similar to tucows
	\item \href{http://www.sourceforge.net}{SourceForge} a site featuring many OpenSource projects. You can start your own, or get software for almost every need. Most projects have GNU and Windows versions. The mirror system isn't as large as Tucows, but you can still usually get a mirror on the same continent.
	\item \href{http://linuxshop.ru/linuxbegin/win-lin-soft-en/table.shtml}{Table of equivalents} can be useful if you want to know more about specific programs when changing from windows to GNU or vice-versa.
\end{itemize}

Of course, it is also possible to \emph{buy} copies of software, particularly for the Windows operating system. To be fair, the library of proprietary software available for Microsoft Windows is the largest and most comprehensive body of software in history, while that available from the open source community is increasingly varied and mature.

\chapter{Overclocking}
\chapterlinks{Overclocking}

\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking}{Overclocking} is the practice of making a component run at a higher clock speed than the manufacturer's specification. The idea is to increase performance for free or to exceed current performance limits, but this may come at the cost of stability.

Overclocking is like souping up a car, if you just want to get where you're going, there's no need for it. But it is fun and educational and can get you a machine that provides performance all out of proportion to its cost.

Think of the 3GHz on your new 3GHz Pentium 4 as a speed limit asking to be broken. Some other components in your computer can also be overclocked, including RAM and your video card in many cases. Over clocking is possible because of the way electronic parts, especially VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) chips are made and sold. All processors in a given line, the Pentium 4 for example, are made the same way, on a large die that is cut up into individual processors, those processors are then tested and graded as to speed, the best chips will be marked as 3.0 GHz the second best 2.8 etc. As time goes by and production processes and masks improve, even the lower rated chips may be capable of faster speeds, especially if vigorous cooling is implemented. Also many manufacturers will mark chips that test faster at slower speeds if there is higher demand for the lower end component.

It’s important to note that not every chip will be overclockable; it’s really the luck of the draw. Some companies that sell ‘factory overclocked’ systems engage in a practice called “binning” where they buy a number of processors, test them for overclocking potential and throw the ones that don’t overclock in a bin to be resold at their rated speed. Even with processors that have a reputation for overclocking well, some parts simply will not exceed their rating.

That said, effective cooling can give a boost to a chips overclockability. With luck you will be able to get extra performance out of your components for free. With luck and skill you can get performance that is not possible even when using the top of the line components. Sometimes you can buy cheaper parts, and then OC them to the clock speed of the higher end component, though the cost of extra cooling can compromise any money you may be saving on the part, not to mention warranty and part life issues.

\textbf{WARNING: OVERCLOCKING MAY VOID THE WARRANTY ON THE PARTS BEING OVERCLOCKED. DOING SO MAY ALSO CAUSE SYSTEM INSTABILITY, AND MAY ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS AND DATA. REMEMBER THE 3 ``C'S'' WHEN OVERCLOCKING:CAREFUL, CONSERVATIVE, and CAUTIOUS .}

\section{Things that can't be overclocked}
Although it is possible to overclock many of the components of a computer (such as the CPU, FSB frequency and video card), it is not possible to overclock some components. For example, it is not possible to increase the read/write speed or access time of a hard disk or CD-ROM drive. The only solution to improving the performance of these components is to use faster components in the first place, or in some special cases of hard disks, change the configuration to a RAID.

\section{Components}

\subsection{CPU}

The CPU's clock speed is the FSB clock speed (base, not effective speed) times the CPU's multiplier. On most newer CPUs, the multiplier is locked, so you will have to adjust the FSB clock speed (However, it might be possible to 'unlock' the chip's multiplier on some older chips. See \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_locking}{CPU Locking}.) The FSB is not adjustable on some motherboards, and almost all OEM systems. The FSB and multiplier, if not locked, are adjustable from within the BIOS. Note that upping the FSB clock speed also increases the clock speed of many other components, including RAM.

When increasing the FSB clock speed, do so in small increments of a few MHz at a time. After you do this, boot up your computer to make sure it works. If your computer successfully boots, increase the FSB some more. If it won't boot, lower the FSB until your computer properly boots up. Repeat until you have the highest setting with which your computer will boot up. Next, test your OS to make sure it is stable by running a burn application, or any application that uses 100\% CPU power. If a crash or reboot results, lower the FSB speed some more until it runs smoothly. On some motherboards you are also able to change the voltage of the CPU and other components in order to help stabilize the system. However, this increases the components' heat output and can harm or shorten the life of your system instead.

Notes: On AMD K8-based chips (Athlon 64, Opteron, Turion, and Socket 754 and 939 Semprons), there is no FSB- there is an integrated memory controller (IMC) and a HyperTransport bus (HTT). The IMC has a base clock speed like a FSB does and for overclocking, it would be adjusted just like a FSB would. The HTT can also be overclocked like the CPU core can be. Its base clock speed is the exact same as the IMC's and thus by default you will overclock the HTT bus as you overclock the CPU. Note that the HTT bus has a multiplier and it is adjustable. Many motherboards do not function well with the HTT bus frequency much over the stock frequency- that's where the adjustible HTT multiplier comes in. (It should be noted that overclocked systems are most stable when the HTT is at or below 1000Mhz)

Also, some newer desktop processors (AMD K8 series with Cool 'n Quiet, Intel Pentium 4 6xx series, Pentium D 830, 840, stepping C1 Pentium D 9xx series with Enhanced Intel Speed Step) and most mobile processors (exc. Celeron M) can vary their operating frequency while running by lowering the CPU multiplier. This results in multipliers below the highest one being unlocked. This allows for a very high FSB/base clock speed with a lower multiplier to use very fast RAM to its full potential without overclocking the CPU so much that it is not stable.

\subsection{How to choose the best CPU for overclocking}

Assuming that you have selected quality components like an excellent motherboard, high-quality RAM , an excellent thermal solution and an excellent power supply; you may wonder why your processor won't exceed a certain speed limit. Lets assume that you have a memory chip that is capable of taking the maximum frequency the motherboard can throw at it and yet, when you exceed a certain speed limit you realize that your system becomes unstable.

A PCI bus generally runs at 33 Mhz. When you exceed 35-36 Mhz, the hard disk and other IDE devices become unstable, because the IDE controller is controlled through the PCI bus. Oftentimes, you may encounter texture corruption, when your AGP bus exceeds a certain speed limit. This was often observed on older motherboards that wouldn't allow you to lock the AGP and the PCI bus at stock speeds.
\texttt{}
The good news: regardless of the FSB speed, most motherboards nowadays automatically ensure that the frequency of the PCI, AGP and other buses always remain constant (in other words; their speeds are locked unless you deliberately change them). This implies that the other components connected to the motherboard don't undergo stress when the FSB speed is raised. You have the fastest RAM you could find and the obscenely fast speed ratings on your ensure that you can extract the most performance by bumping up your FSB speed to the limits.

The main culprit that plays the spoilsport is your CPU. Even if you have an exceptionally good thermal solution, your CPU won't exceed a certain limit.

Example: I had experimented with a Pentium III 700E Mhz processor and a Pentium III 800E MHz processor on an Asus CUBX-E motherboard using Kingston PC-133 SD-RAM. The reason I chose these 2 processors for experimentation was because they both used a FSB speed of 100MHz. This motherboard was really flexible, I was able to increment the FSB to 150Mhz. I was able to extract 1050 MHz from the stock 700Mhz. This is because the multiplier is 7, which unfortunately cannot be changed. So I bumped up the FSB from 100Mhz to 150 Mhz; which gave me the resultant speed of:

\[7\:(Multiplier) \times 150\:(Front Side Bus) = 1050 MHz\:(resultant frequency)\]

Simple arithmetic? Yes. Now, logically speaking, if I can extract 1050Mhz from a 700Mhz processor; I should be able to extract 1200Mhz from an 800 MHz processor. This is not true. I tried doing exactly the same with the 800 MHz processor and the Computer crashed. However, it was stable when I set the FSB speed to 133 MHz. When I set the FSB at 133 MHz ; this was the result:

\[8\:(Multiplier) \times 133\:(Front Side Bus) = 1064\:MHz\:(resultant frequency)\]

This simple experiment shows that a CPU gets saturated after a certain clock speed. Typical symptoms of an erratic CPU include instability and at times, you may not be able to boot up at all.

This particular CPU die was manufactured using a 0.18u process. When Intel launched a similar CPU using a 0.13u process; they shipped those CPUs with the stock speed of up to 1.4Ghz. This CPU core was based on the P6 Architecture and it used a 10 stage pipeline. Presently, Intel manufactures the Pentium-M CPU which is based on the P-6 architecture; the difference being that they manufacture it using a 0.09u process and they have increased the depth of the pipeline.

These terms may seem cryptic and this concept may be difficult for some to grasp. It's really very simple: To be a successful overclocker; you need to purchase the best CPU possible; not necessarily the fastest. Always go for a processor that uses the latest manufacturing process. A CPU rated at 3Ghz which is manufactured by using a 0.13u process won't overclock as well as a CPU that is rated at 2.6Ghz using a 0.09u process.

Deeper pipelines ensure that the CPU has the capability to scale higher in terms of speed. The disadvantage is that a CPU with a deeper pipeline is slower than a CPU that uses a smaller pipeline assuming that they are running at the same speed. AMD Athlon CPUs are famous for their relatively short pipelines. Thats why they perform better than the Pentium 4 CPUs at the same clock speed. Before purchasing the fastest processor, always keep this in mind. Choosing a processor smartly helps you extract the maximum speed out of your machine. You don't need to know what a pipeline exactly does. Refer to the processor spec sheet, find out these basic details of the CPU core and its architecture and choose accordingly.

To increase the computer's stability, you may also disable the spread spectrum; set the PCI speed to 100MHz; set the voltage to the middle range, not too high; and disable any smart fan settings. and those settings works for all recommended boards.

\subsection{Video card}
Two different parts of a video card may be overclocked, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and the RAM. In addition, disabled pipelines on a video card may also be enabled through third-party drivers, third-party software, or direct hardware modifications depending on your video card type. Overclocking a video card is usually done through third-party or proprietary software.

Recent ATI proprietary Catalyst drivers feature an interface called Overdrive that allows for dynamic GPU frequency scaling based on its temperature and load. Increase the load, the clock rate increases for performance, but it's balanced against the increasing temperature. Sufficient for simple increases in overall performance, this doesn't allow for the best performance increase which requires overclocking the memory. For that you'll need third-party applications or drivers.

An application example is ATITool. This program has many options, including GPU and memory overclocking, temperature monitoring, and fan control, allowing for a much more complete solution to overclocking ATI based video cards. There are many third party drivers, omegadrivers.net, for example hosts ATI and nVidia drivers as well. Both of which include integrated overclocking and many unlocked features, including enhanced image quality for nVidia-based cards.

nVidia video cards can also be OCed through a hidden feature in the driver called coolbits. Coolbits is a feature that can be unlocked by creating a DWORD in regedit for windows operating system. To use the coolbits feature, for windows just simply open the regedit then open the directory \texttt{HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE $&gt;$ Software $&gt;$ NVIDIA Corporation $&gt;$ NVTweak} and create a new DWORD value in the NVTweak folder named coolbits then right-click it&gt;modify type 3 for single card or 1A for SLI in the value name .It is a good a overclocking tool as it has a fairly conservative ``optimal clock'' once you have thus increased the core clock (not the memory clock!!) run a gpu intensive task like 3dmark, repeat until you have a sudden drop in the benchmark score. This is the thermal throttling kicking in; do not push it any harder as it will result in permanent damage to your gpu. Back off the clockspeed by about 20-30mhz

The most important thing to remember about overclocking a video card is cooling. This can't be stressed enough. Just as a CPU can be damaged or have a shortened lifespan by overclocking or excessive and prolonged heat, so can a video card. In the past year many inexpensive and easy to install options have surfaced for cooling a video card, from adhesive ram heatsinks which attach to un-cooled ram chips, to rather expensive water-cooling solutions. A good midpoint (both in cost and effectiveness) solution is to purchase and install a direct exhaust, ``sandwich'' cooling solution. Direct exhaust means all air from the cooling fan is blown across the video card and directly out of the computer case, usually using the open PCI slot below the AGP (or PCIe) slot. This allows for substantially lower GPU temperatures.

A sandwich cooler is two aluminum or copper heatsinks, shape formed for a particular video card, that ``sandwiches'' the video card in between the two and are usually connected by some kind of copper heat pipe which allows for the hotter side to convey heat to the cooler side for dissipation. The GPU should never surpass 60 degrees Celsius for optimal performance and to avoid damaging the card. Most of the latest video cards are rated to go up to 90c, but this is NOT recommended by anyone. The optimal temperature for a video card is 40-55c for the card itself (the GPU's temperature differs depending on which you have,) but the lower you can get it, the better.

One important thing to note. Many think that the option which says ``AGP voltage'' in their BIOS can be used to ``voltmod'' a video card to get a bit more power out of it. In fact, it's used for something else, and raising the AGP voltage can and probably will cause damage to a video card.

\section{Getting the few extra MHz out of a chip}

\subsection{Cooling}

When increasing the speed of any computer components you are making the components work harder and by doing so they output more heat. Heat can cause system instability so cooling is necessary to help keep your components stable at higher speeds. Without good cooling you could harm or shorten the life of your system. CPU temperature can usually be checked from within the BIOS. However, these are inaccurate as your CPU is under almost no load in the bios. SiSoftware Sandra may be used within Windows to check temperature. This should be done when your CPU has been under a heavy load for a while for optimum results.

There are three types of cooling that are generally accepted for overclocking: Air, water, and peltier.

With both air cooling and water cooling some type of transfer material is needed to move the energy away from the sensitive electronics. The device used for this purpose is a heatsink. The two most popular heatsink materials are Aluminum and Copper. The heatsink that is stock on factory computers by major manufacturers (Dell, Gateway, IBM) is usually made of aluminum, which has satisfactory heat transfer characteristics. However when overclocking more heat is being produced from the increase in power consumption. In order to obtain lower temperatures a material with better heat transfer properties is important and copper is the material that offers the best ratio of price/performance.

\subsection{Power}

Chips at higher speeds may need more power. Raising the vcore voltage on a CPU might enable it to go at slightly faster speeds but by doing so you add a lot more heat output from the CPU. The vcore of a processor is the voltage at which a chip is set to run at with the stock speed. This voltage may need to be changed when the multiplier is raised because otherwise the transistors in the chip won't switch fast enough---transistors switch faster the higher the supply voltage. If there is not enough voltage then the chip will begin to make mistakes and give bad data results. Good cooling is needed to keep the system stable at higher speeds. Raising the vcore too much may harm or shorten the life of your system. Raising the vcore can also greatly affect the stability of the system. This is where a high quality PSU will come into play. While many cheap, no-name brand PSU's will crash and die with more vcore, a good quality one will live to serve you for a long time.

Note: increasing the speed (multiplier or fsb) without changing the voltage will also increase heat output, but not as much as when also increasing voltage. Having said that, increasing the multiplier or FSB without adjusting the voltage may make your system unstable (undervolt).

\chapter{Silencing}
\chapterlinks{Silencing}

In contrast to overclocking, you may prefer to silence your computer. Some high-performance PCs are very loud indeed, and it is possible to reduce the noise dramatically. The main sources of noise are: Fans (CPU, case, power supply, motherboard, Graphics card), and Hard disks. While total silence in a PC is possible, it is far cheaper and easier to aim for something 'virtually inaudible'.

Note that quieter computers sometimes run slightly hotter---especially in small form factor (SFF) systems, so you need to monitor carefully what you do. Usually you can't overclock and silence at the same time (although it is possible with the right CPU and cooling techniques). Sometimes CPUs are \emph{underclocked} and fans are \emph{undervolted} to achieve greater silence at the expense of performance.

Designing a powerful and quiet machine requires careful consideration in selecting components, but need not be much more expensive than a normal, loud PC. If you are looking to quiet an existing PC, find the \emph{offending} component that produces the loudest or most irritating noise to replace first, and work down from there.

\section{Fans}
\seealso{Engineering_Acoustics/Noise_from_cooling_fans}{Noise from cooling fans}

In general, large diameter (120 mm), high quality fans are much quieter than small diameter ones, because they can move the same amount of air as 80mm or 92mm fans, but at slower speeds. Temperature-regulated fans are also much quieter, as they will automatically spin at a reduced speed when you computer is not in heavy use. Wire mesh grills (or no grill at all) allow better airflow than the drilled holes used in many cases.

\begin{description}
	\item[CPU]
		Modern CPUs can generate \emph{a lot} of heat in a very small area---sometimes as much as 100-watt lightbulb! For the vast majority of processors, a dedicated fan will be a necessity. There are some, like VIA processors, that require only a heat sink, but you will not find passively cooled CPUs at nearly the same speeds allowed by active cooling. However, for modern computers, CPUs are not the limiting component for speed in daily tasks, so unless you do demanding 3D gaming or video editing, then a passively cooled processor may be just for you. They would also be very attractive in media-center PCs, or other specialized applications where computer noise would be more noticable. \\
		The noisiest fan is usually the CPU fan: the Intel-supplied fan-heatsinks are particularly loud, although they do provide good cooling. Some BIOSs allow you to slow the CPU fan down automatically when it is not too hot---if this option is available, turn it on. Also, you can get 3rd party coolers, which are designed to be less noisy: for example, those made by \href{http://www.zalman.co.kr/}{Zalman}.
	\item[Power Supply (PSU)] Noisy power-supplies simply have to be replaced with quieter ones. The case fans can be slowed down by using fan-speed controllers, or resistors (but beware of insufficient cooling). Motherboard and lower-end graphics-card fans can usually be replaced with a small, passive heatsink.
\end{description}

After a few weeks, dust and debris can accumulate on fan blades. Dust on PC components can act as an insulator, trapping in heat and forcing your fans to spin at higher speeds to keep everything cool. Keep your PC clean to reduce noise and increase efficiency.

\section{Water cooling}
An efficient, if expensive way to eliminate the need for most fans in ones computer system is the implementation of water cooling devices. Water cooling kits are available for beginners, and additional components or ``water blocks'' can be added to the system, allowing virtually any system needing cooling to be put ``on water''.

Other cooling fluids are possible in a sealed system, although plain water is generally preferred because it has higher \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heat_capacity}{heat capacity} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thermal_conductivity}{thermal conductivity} than oil, and it is easier to clean up if a leak ever occurs: turn off the computer, shake off most of the water, and use a hair dryer to evaporate the rest of the water.

\section{Oil cooling}

\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_oil}{Transformer oil} has been used to cool electrical equipment for decades.

Some people are experimenting with oil cooling personal computers. Since oil is non-conductive, the motherboard and graphics card and power supply (but not the hard drives or optical drives!) will continue to run submerged in a ``fishtank'' filled with oil. Some people prefer colorless transparent ``mineral oil'' or cooking oil, but \href{http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/01/09/strip\_out\_the\_fans/page11.html}{Frank Völkel recommends motor oil}.

Oil cooling is lower cost than water cooling, because it doesn't require water-tight ``blocks'' or hoses. Some people leave the fans running on the motherboard and power supply to ``stir'' the oil. Other people remove all the fans and add a (submerged) pump to ``blow'' a stream of oil onto the CPU hot spot. Some CPUs, if given a big enough metal heat sink, can be adequately cooled by passive convection currents in the oil (and the large surface area of the oil-to-case and case-to-air), without any fans or pumps.

If any cable (the hard drive ribbon cable, the power cable, the monitor cable, etc.) exits the case below the oil line, it must have an oil-tight exit seal -- consider making all cables exit the top of the case instead.

Immersion in other cooling fluids has been attempted, such as \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fluorinert}{fluorinert} or liquid nitrogen\href{http://octools.com/index.cgi?caller=articles/submersion2/submersion2.html}{}\href{http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/12/30/5\_ghz\_project/index.html}{}.

\section{Hard disk}
A 'resting' hard disk is generally quite quiet compared with any fan, but increases dramatically when it starts 'churning', as when you open or save a file or perform a virus scan. As most hard drive manufacturers place capacity and performance ahead of noise, it is recommended that you look for a hard drive with good acoustics to start with. SilentPCreview.com does comprehensive testing, so picking any of their recommended drives will serve you well. There will usually be a compromise between performance and sound, so opting for a slower RPM or smaller capacity single-platter HDD may be necessary to reach very quiet levels. Also, 2.5`` notebook drives can be much quieter than any 3.5'' desktop drive, but are more expensive and come in smaller capacities.

After selecting a quiet drive, or if you want to reduce the noise coming from a loud drive, look into mounting options. Hard drives are usually mounted with four screws attaching them directly to the case, providing very stable support, some heat dissipation and a lot of direct transmission of HDD vibrations to the case. Reducing this transmission to almost nothing is possible, though it is not always easy.

But do ensure sufficient cooling of the hard drive: running a hard drive moderately hot can reduce its lifespan to under a year! Some mounts are designed to provide both extra cooling and silencing, such as the heat-pipe coolers. Spinning the HDD down when not in use will also reduce noise, but it can reduce the life of the drive by increasing the number of landings and take-offs performed by the read/write heads.

The best noise reductions come from suspending the hard drive with elastic, providing no direct route for sound transmission to the case. You can make your own from elastic in a fabric store, or buy kits that provide materials and instructions. (Rubber bands are not recommended, as they will become weak from the HDD heat and snap.)

Foam can be used to dampen vibrations, but may trap more heat than is safe. Resting the hard drive on the floor of your case on a bed of foam can be very effective at reducing noise.

Using silicone or rubber screws instead of metal mounting screws will give you marginal sound reduction, but is easiest and cheapest to implement. You also won't have to worry about shifting of the HDD if you move your computer.

A software tool created by \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/:wikipedia:Maxtor}{Maxtor} exists which can adjust a hard disk's noise/performance ratio to what your system requires. The technique is called \emph{acoustic management}. However, only certain drives currently support this feature. You can read more from the \href{http://www.rojakpot.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=14}{``Definitive Maxtor Silent Store Guide''} and get \href{http://www.maxtor.com/en/support/downloads/files/setacm.exe}{the tool from Maxtor}.

Completely silent computers will need to use solid state memory like flash drives or eeprom, which have no moving parts and make no noise. This is more expensive and has less capacity than a normal hard drive, so it can't be considered a mainstream storage solution, yet could suffice for a web-browsing PC. At the moment, hard drives are the only practical storage solution except in very specialised circumstances, though this will likely soon change with the rapidly dropping price of flash memory.

\section{Other}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Steel cases are quiter than aluminum ones, because the denser material vibrates less easily.
	\item Quiet cases are available, containing noise-damping acoustic foam. There are 3rd-party acoustic foams that you may decide to add as well.
	\item Experiment with rubber or foam washers when mounting drives and fans. These will dampen any vibration these devices cause.
	\item Keep cables tied up and neat. Not only will this keep them clear of fans (which could quickly cause dangerous heat build-up), but the reduced impedence of airflow throughout your case will make things cooler. Flat, ribbon-shaped cables can safely be folded up to a fraction of their original width.
	\item Make sure your case has rubber or foam feet if it rests on a hard surface. Placing it on carpeting will also reduce vibrations.
	\item Underclocking will reduce system performance, but you can also then reduce the CPU voltage, and power consumption as a whole. Noisy fans may then also be operated at reduced speed or eliminated altogether, as the computer will produce less heat. The converse of the diminishing-returns law for overclocking is that underclocking can prove surprisingly effective.
	\item The really obvious, but surprisingly effective: keep the computer under your desk or even in a closed cupboard, rather than under or beside your monitor.
\end{itemize}

NOTE: No matter what technique you use to quiet the machine, be sure to keep a steady supply of fresh air over all components. Don't put your machine in a closed cupboard unless you are sure heat will not be an issue. If you use acoustic foams, be sure they aren't acting as insulators, too---and keeping components hot.

\section{Operating systems}

Here are some links to Windows and Linux pages which might be useful when you have to choose an operating system. Be careful and do your research to make sure you get the OS that's right for you. To download the CD images (*.iso) for making installment CDs, you will want to have a DSL connection or faster, since files are often around 700 MB (the size of one CD). Some distros are larger than one CD.

\subsection{Downloading tips}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Download each ISO file seperately. If you do them all at the same time, it will eat bandwidth and take lots of time to download.
	\item Do not use dialup! It takes 3 hours to download a 12 MB Internet Explorer install package on dialup. Dialup is also shared bandwidth, so if you download, everything for most other people goes extremely slow.
	\item Don't download anything you think is unsafe. I recommend downloading items with proper names and the names of companies. Don't download something like ``WW32@Bugbear.3.E'' or ``timestamp maker''. Download stuff like ``Adobe Acrobat 7.0.7'' or ``Macromedia Flash Professional''.
	\item Virus check, and validate with the file's MD5 checksum before using. This ensures the download is not rigged or damaged.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Linux}
\begin{description}
	\item[\href{fedoraproject.org/wiki/}{Fedore Core}] Based on Redhat, this is the newest Redhat supported distro available. Has most of the features that Redhat once including a new ``bleeding edge'' interface. This has become about the second most powerful Linux distros on the web.
	\item[\href{www.mandriva.com/}{The Mandriva Distribution}] A common one with multiple uses.
	\item[\href{www.opensuse.org/}{The SUSE Distribution}] Comes in all shapes and sizes. The OSS or the ``Open Source Editon'' is a set of four downloadable isos with many open-source programs that are useful if you want a low cost office. The Novell Editon is the paid for edition including stuff like StarOffice, Mesa, commercial/proprietary software. So if you have a business, where you want quality and good tools for your money then buy that.
	\item[The \href{//www.ubuntu.com/}{Ubuntu} distros] A very popular distribution, Ubuntu is an attempt at ``user friendly'' Linux. Canonical Ltd. started Ubuntu with a 10 million dollar grant, and in less than a year has become a major player in the Linux field. All these distros can be configured as servers as well as running on their own.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \href{http://www.ubuntu.com/}{Ubuntu} The standard Ubuntu edition comes packaged with GNOME and lots of other open source software.
			\item \href{http://www.kubuntu.org/}{Kubuntu} The same as the Ubuntu edition, except it runs KDE (K Desktop Environment) instead of GNOME.
			\item \href{http://www.edubuntu.org/}{Edubuntu} Edubuntu in the educational release of Ubuntu running GNOME or KDE and having more than 100 educational pieces designed for use in the classroom. In fact, five school districts in the United States now use the Edubuntu product, but of its educational functionality.
			\item \href{http://www.xubuntu.org/}{Xubuntu} Ubuntu with the Xfce desktop. Good for lower-end systems.
		\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Live CDs}

Live CD Linux Distros are some distros that you can use in kiosk mode or just for testing out the system. They are very useful for demonstrating the capabilities of Linux.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{http://www.knoppix.org}{Knoppix}
	\item \href{http://slax.linux-live.org/}{SlaX} (Note: SlaX can run on a USB key)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced Linux distros}

Note: this section is only for pros. If you do not want to damage your newly built computer, stick with a Linux distibution above, or ask your nearest computer geek to help you. This is your final warning!

\begin{description}
	\item[\href{www.gentoo.org/}{Gentoo}] Gentoo is an advanced Linux distribution with one of a few nice features including Portage. When you connect to the Internet, there is a portage folder which has thousands of software, and software libraries at your disposal. Cons: Need a geek to set it up. Refer to the instruction manual on the Gentoo Documentation page before you commence installation.
	\item[\href{www.slackware.com/}{Slackware}] Good Distro, though not up to date with good graphical interfaces. If you want something newer, get a distro above. Cons: Requires a geek to install apps in Slackware.
\end{description}

\subsection{Microsoft Windows}

\href{http://www.microsoft.com/}{Microsoft Windows} is an operating system started in the late 80s after Apple Computer created the Macintosh. This is the OS running on the majority of PCs. Unlike open source systems like Linux, Windows is proprietary, and so must be purchased with a license. It is relatively easy to use, and runs on all PCs (except for Apple PCs, which run Apple's proprietary MacOS).

{\bf\large Preamble}
\end{center}

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ``free'' in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\par}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS}
\end{center}

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``\textbf{Document}'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``\textbf{you}''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``\textbf{Modified Version}'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``\textbf{Secondary Section}'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``\textbf{Invariant Sections}'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``\textbf{Cover Texts}'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``\textbf{Transparent}'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``\textbf{Opaque}''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The ``\textbf{Title Page}'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section ``\textbf{Entitled XYZ}'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``\textbf{Acknowledgements}'',
``\textbf{Dedications}'', ``\textbf{Endorsements}'', or ``\textbf{History}''.)  
To ``\textbf{Preserve the Title}''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 2. VERBATIM COPYING\par}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{2. VERBATIM COPYING}
\end{center}

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section~3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\par}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3. COPYING IN QUANTITY}
\end{center}


If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 4. MODIFICATIONS\par}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{4. MODIFICATIONS}
\end{center}

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

\begin{itemize}
\item[A.] 
   Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
   
\item[B.]
   List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
   
\item[C.]
   State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
   
\item[D.]
   Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   
\item[E.]
   Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
   
\item[F.]
   Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   
\item[G.]
   Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   
\item[H.]
   Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   
\item[I.]
   Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   
\item[J.]
   Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
   
\item[K.]
   For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
   
\item[L.]
   Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
   
\item[M.]
   Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
   
\item[N.]
   Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   
\item[O.]
   Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
\end{itemize}

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\par}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS}
\end{center}


You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section~4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
Entitled ``Endorsements''.

\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\par}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS}
\end{center}

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\par}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS}
\end{center}


A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section~3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 8. TRANSLATION\par}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{8. TRANSLATION}
\end{center}


Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section~4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section~4) to Preserve
its Title (section~1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 9. TERMINATION\par}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{9. TERMINATION}
\end{center}


You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\par}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE}
\end{center}


The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


\begin{center}
{\Large\bf ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\par}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents}
\end{center}

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
    Copyright \copyright{}  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
    Free Documentation License''.
\end{quote}
\bigskip
    
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with \dots\ Texts.'' line with this:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
\end{quote}
\bigskip
    
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

Building and assembling a computer, for those who have a penchant to do so, may be a very rewarding experience. If you are reading ``How To Assemble A Desktop PC'' (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer}{Personal Computer}), you are probably contemplating building or assembling a computer instead of purchasing one pre-built or pre-assembled. Building or assembling a desktop PC is a viable option for many people and may bring significant benefits, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning about computer components and how they fit and work together;
	\item Understanding the internal and hardware workings of a computer;
	\item Learning computer hardware terminology and 'geek-speak';
	\item Ability to customise a computer according to specialised specifications;
	\item Building and assembling something from components;
	\item The satisfaction of a job well-done;
	\item Engendering technical problem solving ability;
	\item Saving money; and
	\item Having fun!
\end{itemize}

Building your own computer instead of purchasing one pre-fabricated and assembled may also be contraindicated for certain people and may pose a significant challenge if you:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Don't enjoy the building and assembly process;
	\item Have no interest in researching and choosing the parts;
	\item Are not mindful of quality control processes when opening boxes and packaging and checking to ensure that everything is present;
	\item Are disinterested in assembling items and components into a custom-built PC designed and built according to your own specifications;
	\item Are used to and like calling a technical support person to fix your PC technology issues, rather than fixing them yourself; 
	\item Value a centralized warranty service (each part will have its own warranty/return policy), so if a part fails you’ll have to deal with either the company you bought it from or the actual manufacturer.
\end{itemize}

This information is provided to help you determine whether this book, ``How To Assemble A Desktop PC,'' is right for you!

\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
\chapterlinks{Conclusion}

If you're serious you’ve probably at least glanced over this book as you considered building your own computer, and I hope it has inspired you to go ahead with that project. Throughout we’ve tried to steer you clear of some of the pitfalls and alert you to some of the safety issues involved, and in so doing, we have undoubtedly overemphasized the dangers and difficulty. In sooth, it’s pretty hard to hurt yourself building a computer and most people get through their first build without burning up any parts. With a little planning, anyone who can use a screwdriver can build a computer.

The computer you build will always mean a little bit more to you than one you buy, not least because you designed it yourself and will no doubt be upgrading it from time to time for years to come. You may find a little smile of satisfaction creeping onto your face each time you hit the power button, and I think you’ll find that smile is an ample return for your time and effort.

Lastly, if you go through with it and build you own PC, you’re bound to run into something we've missed here; a problem we didn’t anticipate, something we forgot to mention, or something that has changed recently. If you do, please come back here and add to or change this book. You don’t have to know everything to contribute, just one thing that’s true. If this guide has helped you at all, think of it as payback.

Loose or poorly adjusted saddle 

Proper saddle position is often a matter of personal preference. Saddles can be adjusted for height, tilt and fore/aft position. The exact combination that works best for you will depend on your physical size and your riding style. For more information about checking saddle position and making adjustments, check elsewhere in the site. Make sure your saddle is secure before every ride. Most saddles are held in place by a few simple nuts and bolts. All of them should be tight enough to resist vigorous shaking. 


An over-extended seat post 

This is a serious safety hazard. In general, at least two inches of your seat post should be inserted into your frame at all times. This rule however will vary considerably if you follow the growing fashion of &quot;showing a lot of seatpost&quot;. If you have to raise your seat post beyond its extension limit line to get comfortable on your saddle, it's probably time for a larger seat post, or a bigger bike. Once you've found the &quot;perfect&quot; saddle position for you, mark your seat post and your saddle rails with tape or felt tip pen (indelible) so you can readjust them easily.


Preventing problems

Regularly remove your seat post from your frame and coat it with a thin layer of grease before re-installing it. This grease layer will help protect the post against rust and corrosion and more important, prevent the post seizing in your frame. 


Checking your saddle 

You should check your saddle to ensure it's secure and properly positioned. Grasp it firmly and attempt to move it out of position while holding your bike steady. Some side-to-side movement will probably occur but if your seat post shifts up and down, or your saddle feels loose, make adjustments. Also check your seat post visually to make sure you haven't exceeded the seat post extension limit line (the furthest point that the post can be safely extended upwards) has not been exceeded. This is clearly marked on the side of your seat post. Regularly remove your seat post from your frame and coat it with a thin layer of grease before re-installing it. This grease layer will help protect the post against rust and corrosion and more important prevent the post seizing in your frame.


Saddle Cleaning Procedures 

To keep your saddle in good condition, simply wipe it down from time to time and treat it with UV-protective conditioner. Most models can be cleaned with light soap and a little clean water. Others require special cleaners designed for their specific materials.

      <comment>moved [[Anatomy/Tetralogy of Fallot]] to [[General Anatomy/Tetralogy of Fallot]]:&amp;#32;Need book's category.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tetralogy of Fallot''' includes a '''''Large Ventricular Septal Defect''''' '''''(VSD),''''' the aorta overrides left and right ventricles, right ventricular outflow tract is obstructed, and the wall of the right ventricle thickens. More blood shunts through the VSD to the left side as the obstruction impedes the RV outflow, resulting in '''''Cyanosis;'''''&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot;&gt;http://www.rjmatthewsmd.com/Definitions/congenital_heart_disease.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Tetralogy of Fallot has four key features. A '''''Ventricular Septal Defect''''' (a hole between the ventricles) and many levels of obstruction from the right ventricle to the lungs (Pulmonary Stenosis) are the most important. Also, the Aorta (major artery from the [[../Heart|heart]] to the body) lies directly over the Ventricular Septal Defect, and the right ventricle develops thickened muscle.”&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheart&quot;&gt;http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11071&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults with Tetralogy of Fallot suffer shortness of breath and can’t tolerate exercise. Brain abscesses, strokes and heart infections can arise as complications. Tetralogy of Fallot patient’s fingers may have ''&quot;clubbing&quot;'' which is enlargements at the distal ends. If '''Tetralogy of Fallot''' remains uncorrected, most patients die in childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt;

Diagnosis is made with Echocardiography; the VSD can be visualized with Color Doppler, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with Heart Catherterization. 

Surgical repair improves survival and helps relieve symptoms. Patients should receive antibiotics before dental work or surgery. 

'''''“Even with repair these patients have a poorer survival rate… Patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot often have atrial fibrillation or flutter, which may cause considerable morbidity.”'''''&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt;

Pulmonary regurgitation may develop; it can be tolerated for long periods, but then the right ventricle enlarges and malfunctions, and a replacement pulmonary valve may be needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt;

Some patients have recurring obstruction of the outflow tract in the right ventricle, and need repeated surgery. Large residual ventricular septal defects may require repeated surgery in 10 to 20 percent of patients.  After repair of tetralogy of Fallot, Right bundle branch block patterns (RBBB) is common,&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/circulationaha;54/2/289&lt;/ref&gt; apparently increasing the chances of death. However, sometimes the first surgery is successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheart&quot; /&gt;

Survival is better among patients who had the surgery young.&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt; “Left and right ventricular failure due to right ventricular overload or left ventricular volume overload is another important cause of late death in older patients.”&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt;

Patients who had the surgery as adolescents or adults may have greater difficulty with exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;rjmatthews&quot; /&gt;

== Overview ==

An '''''Erumpent''''' is an animal that grows at least one large, spiral horn.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While we never see an Erumpent, we do see its horn. The horn is extremely large, leading us to believe that the animal in question is also very large. The horn in question is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s study, where he has purchased it believing it to be the horn of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crumple Horned Snorkack|Crumple Horned Snorkack]].

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] recognizes it at once, and tells Xenophilius that it is extremely unstable; some time afterwards, a stray [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunner]] hits it, and it explodes, causing serious damage to Xenophilius' house.

The Erumpent is further described in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot; as a large grey beast, native to Africa, that can be mistaken at a distance for a rhinoceros. The horn is extremely sharp, able to penetrate metal, and contains an exploding fluid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This summary describes the support for Lua/CELX-scripting in [http://shatters.net/celestia/ Celestia] and consists mostly of the CELX API.
This documents as well as the CELX-support in Celestia probably contain a number of errors or bugs. Please report any problems you find.

==Introduction==


===About this document ===

It was started to document the available functionality during development celestia v1.3.1pre11, and was then extended as new functionality was contributed.
   
CELX uses the Lua Programming Language, so you are writing real programs. This is completely different than older CEL Celestia scripts, which are just sequences of fixed commands. So you probably should have a little experience in programming, otherwise this document won't help you much.
 
It's also a good idea to read at least the first sections of the Lua-Documentation, available here:
* http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/
* http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ (Celestia version {{Celx:v150}} and later)

===How CELX works in Celestia ===

Celestia works roughly(!) by repeating this:
 
* Check user input, change rendering settings accordingly (e.g. enable rendering of orbits, change observer position/orientation)  
* Update the simulation time 
* Update the observer's position if goto is active 
* Render all objects using the current settings (renderflags, time. positions) 


If a CELX-script has been started, it is executed just before rendering begins. Then Celestia gives control to the Lua-interpreter, which continues to execute the script where he stopped the last time. When you call a CELX-method in a script, e.g. '''celestia:print()''', the Lua-interpreter calls in fact a little C++ function which converts the arguments from Lua-types to C++-types, calls the right Celestia-methods to perform the action, and if necessary converts the C++ return value back to a Lua-value. Note that the Lua-interpreter called this C++ function, so when it returns the script continues, there is never a chance to return control back to the Celestia loop. To do this, the script has to call the '''wait()''' function, which makes the Lua-interpreter return control.

Forgetting to call '''wait()''' in Celestia 1.3.1 meant that Celestia never gained control again, and thus couldn't even handle the command to stop or quit the script - it was completely blocked. As from version {{Celx:v132}}, Celestia periodically checks if the scripts has exceeded the maximum allowed time to execute (5 seconds), and if it has, it terminates the script.
 


It should have become obvious that most actions don't really change anything immediately, instead they change a setting which is used later on during rendering, &lt;u&gt;which from the point of view of the script happens while calling '''wait()'''&lt;/u&gt;. So if you change the position of the observer ten times without calling '''wait()''' in between, this will have NO effect - only the last position will actually be used in rendering.

===Syntax ===

For a complete description of the syntax of Lua, please read http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/&lt;br&gt; Celestia version {{Celx:v150}} uses Lua version 5.1, which differs slightly from version 5.0 of Lua, used in earlier Celestia releases.&lt;br&gt;The Lua 5.1 manual can be found at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/&lt;br&gt;For details about what changed between Lua versions 5.0 and 5.1, see http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#7

'''Some quick starting notes:'''

# Lua commands can be terminated either by a textual line terminator or by a semicolon. If you want to include several Lua commands on a single line of text, separate them by semi-colons (''';'''), but if there is only a single Lua command on a line of text, no semi-colon is needed.
# Write your CELX script by using a line editor like &quot;Notepad&quot;, &quot;Notepad++&quot; or &quot;Wordpad&quot;, &lt;u&gt;without text formatting&lt;/u&gt;;
# Short (singleline) comments start with two hyphens &quot;--&quot;;
# Long (multiline) comments use &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;--[[ comment ]]&quot;.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# When you use the comment &quot;-- Title: ''string:text''&quot; in the &lt;u&gt;first line&lt;/u&gt; of the CELX script, the ''string:text'' title will be displayed in the Celestia/File/Scripts drop down menu instead of the filename.

'''Example:'''

 -- Title: Example script
 -- This is a short comment line.
 -- [[ This
       is
       a
       long
       comment
       line.]]
 a = 5; b = 6 -- two Lua commands on a single line
 c = 3        -- one Lua command on a line



====Variables &amp; Types ====

Lua-variables don't have to be declared and don't have a type, but the &lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt; has a type.

There are eight basic types in Lua:
# nil
#* Nil is the type of the value nil, whose main property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the absence of a useful value.
# boolean
#* Boolean is the type of the values false and true.&lt;br&gt;Both nil and false make a condition false; any other value makes it true. 
# number
#* Number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers.
# string
#* String represents arrays of any 8-bit characters.
# table
#* Tables can be used as arrays that can be indexed not only with numbers, but with any value (except nil).&lt;br&gt;Tables also can contain values of all types (except nil).
# userdata
#* The objects to control Celestia are of this special type userdata. 
# function
#* The function type is an executable expression, compiled from a block of Lua and CELX code.
# thread
#* Not further explained here.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;The same variable &quot;a&quot; can have content of different type.

 a = 1                -- a is 1, an integer number
 a = a / 2            -- a is now 0.5, changed into a floatingpoint number
 a = &quot;Hello World&quot;    -- a contains a string now 
 a = a / 3            -- ERROR, because a string is divided by a number! 
 a = true             -- a is true, a boolean
 a = not a            -- a is now false, a boolean 

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;A table can be used like this.

 t = {}                                  -- define Table t
 t[&quot;key1&quot;] = &quot;value1&quot;                    -- long form to store a string
 t.key2 = &quot;value2&quot;                       -- short form to store a string
 u = { key1=&quot;value1&quot;, key2=&quot;value2&quot; }    -- u is now the same as t 
 v = { 1,2,3,4,5 }                       -- v[1] is now 1, v[2] is 2, etc.

To operate on '''userdata''', you can call methods for the objects. To use Lua for Celestia, &lt;u&gt;you mostly need to know only about the available objects, the methods defined on them and how to call them&lt;/u&gt; - everybody who already knows Object-Oriented-Programming should feel right at home.

At the beginning of a script, the '''celestia object''' is automatically defined, holding a reference to the core-functionality of Celestia! To operate on this celestia object you can call methods which are defined on it by using the &quot;celestia:&quot; prefix, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia|celestia methods]].

'''Example:'''

 -- Get observer instance of the active view and store it in &quot;obs&quot;
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 
 -- Find the celestial object representing Earth and store it in &quot;earth&quot;
 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
 
 -- Do something to confuse the reader, but possible in CELX
 -- The object with name mars is made equal to the object with name earth
 mars = earth
 
 -- You can also use obs and earth like this.
 obs:goto(earth)
 -- This will start the goto-command, which moves the observer to Earth,
 -- just as if you had pressed the ['''G'''] key in Celestia, after selecting Earth.


A '''function''' is an executable expression, compiled from a block of Lua and CELX code, whose value has type function.

A function can have arguments for input values and a function can also return zero, one or more values (see the Lua-documentation for details).

One or more functions can be defined at the beginning of your CELX script and they can be called once or several times from the main body of your CELX script.

'''Example:'''

 -- Define function with name &quot;add_one&quot; and parameterlist &quot;i&quot; (a number).
 function add_one(i) 
    -- use 'local' to declare variables local to function: 
    local j = i + 1 
    -- return the value of &quot;j&quot;, a number.
    return j 
 end
 
 -- Define function with name &quot;divide&quot; and parameterlist &quot;i, j&quot; (two numbers).
 function divide(i, j) 
    -- return the value of the division &quot;i / j&quot;, a number.
    return i / j 
 end

 -- Start of the main body of your script
 &lt;... other script code ...&gt;
 -- and now call the functions: 
 a = add_one(1) 
 b = divide(a, 2)
 &lt;... other script code ...&gt;

The function &quot;'''wait'''(''number:n'')&quot; is predefined in Celestia and waits ''number:n'' seconds. It is special because it returns control to Celestia, which you have to do to avoid blocking Celestia.

Many more functions are defined in Lua (see [http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ Lua-docs]), such as mathematical functions or string operations.

'''Notes:'''
# Not all Lua-libraries are loaded, you don't have access to io and debug-functions (which greatly reduces the danger of security-problems by &quot;evil&quot; scripts). See the methode [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#requestsystemaccess|celestia:requestsystemaccess()]] for more information.

====Control Structures ====

Lua has the typical control-structures, like '''for''', '''while''', '''repeat''' and '''if'''.

'''Examples:'''

 -- Execute the block of codelines (...) 10 times after each other,
 -- where &quot;i&quot; is incremented with 1 during each loop.
 for i = 1, 10 do 
    ... 
 end 

 -- Execute the block of codelines (...)
 -- as long as &quot;i&quot; is smaller than or equal to 11.
 i = 1 
 while i &amp;lt;= 11 do 
    ... 
    i = i + 1 
 end

 -- Execute the block of codelines (...) 
 -- until &quot;i&quot; is equal to &quot;j&quot;.
 i = 1
 j = 22
 repeat 
    ... 
    i = i + 1 
 until i == j

 -- Compare &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; with each other and execute a
 -- certain block of codelines (...1, ...2 or ...3),
 -- depending on the result of this comparizon.
 if i &amp;gt; j then 
    ...1
 elsif i &amp;lt; j then 
    ...2 
 else 
    ...3
 end 

 -- To loop over the contents of a table &quot;tbl&quot;, you can use this:
 for key, value in pairs(tbl) do 
    -- tbl[key] == value
    ...
 end 

 -- Use this for tabels used as arrays, i.e. indexed by numbers 1..n: 
 for i, value in ipairs(tbl) do 
    -- tbl[i] == value
    ... 
 end

==Objects and Methods (The CELX API)==

This section documents the '''userdata''' classes (object types) available in CELX Lua scripting.

Besides the predefined '''celestia object''', there are also other celestia related objects to control Celestia. You can't create an object (i.e. userdata) yourself, you must call some method to create one.
As you only have the '''celestia object''' (ignoring methods which are not Celestia related) available when the script is starting, you must use it to create other objects.

The following celestia related objects can be used within a CELX script:
# '''Observer object''':&lt;br&gt;An observer object is used to access properties specific to a view, such as viewer position, viewer orientation, frame of reference, and tracking status. To operate on an observer objects, you can call observer methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer|observer methods]].
# '''Object objects''':&lt;br&gt;An &quot;object&quot; object in CELX refers to a celestial object like a planet or a star. To operate on &quot;object&quot; objects, you can call &quot;object&quot; methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object|object methods]].
# '''Position objects''':&lt;br&gt;A position object contains the exact coordinates of a point in space. To operate on position objects, you can call position methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position|position methods]].
# '''Vector objects''':&lt;br&gt;A vector object is a geometric object that has both a length and direction [X,Y,Z] in a 3-dimensional Coordinate System. To operate on vector objects, you can call vector methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx vector|vector methods]].
# '''Rotation objects''':&lt;br&gt;A rotation object is internally a Quaternion, which is one possibility to mathematically describe a rotation in 3 dimensions (i.e. it can be converted to a rotation matrix). A rotation can also be used to describe the orientation of objects or the observer (i.e. where the observer is looking to, and where &quot;up&quot; is). To operate on rotation objects, you can call rotation methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation|rotation methods]].
# '''Frame objects''':&lt;br&gt;The frame object describes the celestia coordinate cystem and tells how the X, Y, and Z, axes of each 3-dimensional coordinate system are aligned. Coordinate systems are well documented in the available Celestia .Cel Scripting Guide v1-0g by Don Goyette, in the chapter: &quot;Coordinate Systems&quot;. To operate on frame objects, you can call frame methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame|frame methods]].
# '''Phase objects''':&lt;br&gt;The timeline of an object can be subdivided into one or more phases. Each phase object has its own trajectory, rotation model, orbit frame, and body frame. To operate on phase objects, you can call phase methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx phase|phase methods]].
# '''CELscript objects''':&lt;br&gt;A CELscript object contains a string with a valid  CEL script, which can be imbedded in a CELX script by using the &quot;celestia:createcelscript()&quot; method. To operate on CELscript objects, you can call CELscript methods which are defined on them, as shown in section [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celscript|CELscript methods]].


'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;To call the method '''getposition()''' of '''observer''', you have to get an observer-instance from '''celestia''' first and then call getposition() on it:

 obs = celestia:getobserver() 
 pos = obs:getposition() 

'''Notes:'''
# While using names for the various classes in this documentation, these names have no real meaning in a script. Even &quot;celestia&quot; is just a variable, holding an object of type celestia and is not really special.


In the following section, each method is listed with its signature: 

return_value_type {{Celx:func|object:methodname}}({{Celx:arg|type:parameter}}, {{Celx:arg|type:parameter}} [, {{Celx:arg|type:optional parameter}}])
                        
This is followed by:
* A short &lt;u&gt;description&lt;/u&gt; of what the method does;
* A list of the &lt;u&gt;arguments/parameters&lt;/u&gt; and what they are for;
* Possibly some &lt;u&gt;notes&lt;/u&gt; about how to use this method, what it does exactly, some concerns etc..
* Finally an &lt;u&gt;example&lt;/u&gt; about the usage of the method is given.

==Callbacks==

Callbacks are functions which are executed as a result of external events.

Right now there are two callbacks available in Celestia:
* [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Callback#Keyboard|Keyboard callback]]. 
* [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Callback#Cleanup|Cleanup callback]].


'''Note:''' Callbacks are limited in what you can do:
* The callback must complete within 1 second, or it will be terminated;
* You CANNOT use the '''wait()''' function in a callback !

==CEL to CELX migration ==

The following section contains an index of the available CEL commands. By clicking on a specific command, you will be routed to the explanation on its functionality and how that CEL command can be migrated to equivalent CELX objects and methods.


=== CEL command index ===

The CEL commands below are organized following the sequence and explanation of CEL script commands in [http://www.donandcarla.com/Celestia/ Celestia .Cel Scripting Guide v1-0g] by Don Goyette. The explanations also contain many of Don’s examples and syntax descriptions to aid in the migration from CEL to CELX.

Within this section, parameter values for CEL commands and CELX methods are printed like &lt;''type''&gt; or &lt;''name''&gt;. These parameter values need to be replaced when actually using these commands or methods.

'''Example:'''

 &lt;''string''&gt;    &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 &lt;''duration''&gt;  1.5
 &lt;''distance''&gt;  20000

Since Celestia version 1.6.0 and 1.6.1 the original listing of only 35 Cel commands has been expanded to 52 Cel commands. The additional commands are indicated with {{Celx:v160}} and {{Celx:v161}}.

==Notes==


===Typical Problems ===

 
* Lua scripts are executed between Celestia's rendering phases. So if you do some lengthy calculation (or an endless loop), Celestia won't be able to update the screen or even check for key presses (i.e. you can't stop the script by pressing ['''Esc'''] key). From the script's point of view, rendering and UI-handling only happen during calls to '''wait()'''. If the script doesn't return control to Celestia for more than 5 seconds, then the script is terminated.
                                         
* If you want to move the observer smoothly, do this by setting its position and then call '''wait()'''. But watch out: if &quot;track&quot; is activated on a body this can override any '''observer:setorientation()''' in the script. A high time rate will change the position of planets significantly before they are rendered, which can result in a jerky movement. If necessary, check and reset time and timerate in your script.
 
* On Windows '''wait()''' can return very quickly without doing any rendering, while on Linux it reliably enforces a rendering pass.
 
* The user can change settings while a script is running, including which body is selected, position, orientation, speed, timerate, renderflags etc. Don't rely on these to stay constant, if necessary you have to continuously reset them.
 
* Reference frames can be difficult to master at first. If you are trying to set the observer to a position within the Solar System, but get distances to the Sun of about 206 au instead, you probably got your reference-frame wrong. Before version {{Celx:v150}}, 206 AU is the distance between the point of origin [0,0,0] in universal coordinates and the position of the Sun. Starting with version {{Celx:v150}}, Celestia places the Solar System's barycenter at [0,0,0].
 
* If your script turns your screen completely black or other weird effects occur, check for any usage of '''observer:setorientation()''' or '''observer:lookat()'''. You probably have your orientation set to an &quot;invalid&quot; quaternion (for example all zero), possibly by using '''observer:lookat()''' with your up-vector parallel to the direction of view. If this happens, you should get Celestia usable again by running a script which sets the orientation to some sensible value (or simply by restarting Celestia).

      <comment>/* Floppy disks */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Floppy Disk Drive''' (FDD) magnetically reads and writes information into floppy disks. Floppy disks are a form of removable storage. The FDD is mounted inside the computer unit and is only removed from the system for repairs or upgrades. 

The standard size for modern day floppy disks is a 3 ½-inch disk with a hard plastic exterior shell that protects the thin, flexible disk inside. Standard Floppy Disks hold 1.44 MB of data, which is useful for simple files, such as Microsoft Word documents, but not very effective for graphical content. With the introduction of the USB Removable Drive, the Floppy Disk Drive has somewhat disappeared from newer computer systems.

== Floppy disks ==
[[File:Floppy disk 2009 G1.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right, 8-inch floppy, 5¼-inch floppy, and 3½-inch floppy]]
The floppy disks are legacy storage mediums that contain a small amount of data.  Despite the larger size, the 8-inch and 5.25-inch disks store less data than the 3.5-inch disk, due to less efficient manufacturing and design.

The disks themselves have three major components.  The outer envelope provides protection against some external hazards, such as dust (although the older floppies are stored in an additional envelope.)   On the inside of the envelope is a cloth to reduce turning friction, and is placed on both sides of the magnetic film used to store the data.  The 3½-inch disk also has a sliding metal tab that provides some additional protection.     

The notable components of the floppy disk are:
* The envelope, either a soft plastic for the larger disks, or a hard plastic shell for the 3½-inch floppy
* For the 3½-inch floppy, a metal shield.
* For some floppies, a hole or tab used to indicate write protection, disk density, etc. 
* On the inside of the envelope, a sheet used to reduce friction for the spinning component.
* A flexible magnetic-coated film that contains data.
* A hub (for the 3½-inch floppy) or hole used to allow the magnetic-coated film to rotate in the drive.

[[File:Floppy tabs 3x2.jpg|thumb|right|Write-protect notch for the 5¼-inch floppy]]
Floppy disks are given an ability to protect against accidental write operations.  With the 5¼-inch floppy, you can write to the disk by creating a notch on the upper-right corner, aligned with the bottom of the label.  With a 3½-inch floppy, there is a slidable tab on the back of the disk. 

{{-}}

== Floppy drives ==
The floppy drives are used to read the floppy disks.  

When installing a floppy drive, it is connected using a floppy drive cable, and a 4-pin berg or molex connector (depending on the drive).  An external drive uses its own connection (e.g. USB).  

In MS-Dos (and related operating systems), the drive letter assigned to the drive depends on the physical connection selected on the FDD cable.  If it is connected to the end of the cable, it is drive A.  If it is connected to the middle, it is drive B.  Up to two devices may be connected.  While some FDD connectors may include a pair of connectors at the end and at the middle, only one connector in the pair may be used to operate a drive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mathematica code is fully-fledged programming language, complete with a proper syntax. It is very important to get the syntax right, or else the kernel will be unable to perform your task. Mathematica is notorious for a steep learning curve, and part of the reason for this is the rigidity of the language. The best way to learn Mathematica is to acquaint yourself thoroughly with the basic aspects of the code's structure before attempting complex tasks.

This page will provide a condensed overview of the basics of the Mathematica language.　Links will be provided where necessary to more detailed explanations.

==Basic Structure of the Language==

Just as the smallest unit of the English language that still makes semantic sense is the word, the smallest unit of the Mathematica language is the '''object'''. Whenever you write some input, Mathematica first deconstructs this into a tree of objects and then interprets it. There are various types of token in Mathematica:

{| class=wikitable
!Type of token!!Examples!!Use
|-
|Symbol||&lt;tt&gt;a, abc, &amp;alpha;, &amp;alpha;&amp;beta;&amp;gamma;&lt;/tt&gt;||Represents an object
|-
|String||&lt;tt&gt;&quot;a&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;&amp;gamma;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;||Holds a fixed textual content
|-
|Number||&lt;tt&gt;1, 12.34, 2^10&lt;/tt&gt;||Holds a fixed numerical value
|-
|Operators||&lt;tt&gt;+, -, *, /&lt;/tt&gt;||Represents processes to perform on tokens
|-
|Comment||&lt;tt&gt;(*some text here*)||Holds notes that are not to be used by the kernel
|}

Any expression in Mathematica can then be nested functions of the form head[e1,e2,...] where head must be a Symbol and ei can be any of the supported object types or another  function.

== Overview ==

'''''Willy Widdershins''''' is apparently a small-time hood and mischief-maker.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], at the first dinner at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|the Headquarters of the Order]], is overheard regaling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] with a story about a large quantity of toads he nicked off one &quot;Will&quot; and then sold back to him. Though &quot;Will&quot;'s last name is never mentioned, it is possible that this is Willy Widdershins.

Just before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s hearing at the Ministry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] mentions that he is trying to track down a prankster who is charming public toilets in Bethnall Green to make them regurgitate.

When Harry and the Weasley family visit Arthur in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]] on the afternoon after the snake attack, Arthur has evidently found an article in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] saying that Willy Widdershins had been responsible; one of his curses had backfired and he had been found in the toilets covered head to foot in... It appears that somehow he got off being charged; Arthur surmises that gold changed hands. Arthur comments that he's since been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and that two of them had lost fingers and were in St. Mungo's having bones regrown, and seems rather hopeful that he'll actually see them.

At the meeting in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s office after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]] has told [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] about Dumbledore's Army, Umbridge reports to those present that her informant, Willy Widdershins, was at the bar in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] when the first meeting of what was then called the Defence Association was held. Although he was heavily bandaged, his hearing was still fine, and he immediately reported what he had overheard to Umbridge. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], on hearing this, says that now she understands how he got off so lightly for all the regurgitating toilets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book will deal with all the topics covered in the high school syllabus, through numerical problems and other questions. Unlike a textbook which teaches students, we expect the content of this book to teach students to teach themselves.

The articles, problems and solutions discussed here will focus on the thought process rather than the steps involved. The second goal of this problem book is to make students realize that Chemistry is indeed simpler than Physics, Mathematics and Biology at the highschool level.

Presently, this book is randomly edited as per the questions put forward to the contributors. As we submit more and more content, we will start integrating the pieces into a picture. Volunteers are welcome to discuss the content policy, make contributions, and above all - giving touch ups to the already submitted content.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why &quot;Exim&quot;?==

I don't know where the idea that Vim's scripting language was called &quot;Exim&quot; came from.  Conventionally on the Vim mailing lists it's been referred to as &quot;Vim script(ing)&quot; or just &quot;VimL&quot;&amp;mdash;if you were to call it &quot;Exim&quot; there you'd probably confuse everybody, including [[wikipedia:Bram Moolenaar|Bram]], the developer and copyright owner of Vim.

The only references to &quot;exim&quot; in the Vim help files are for the command-line equivalent of invoking &quot;&lt;code&gt;vim -E&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (ex mode), and while Vim scripts are interpreted as if you had typed all the commands in ex mode that still doesn't justify arbitrarily naming the scripting language &quot;Exim&quot;.

Further confusing the issue, [[wikipedia:Exim|Exim is a mail transfer agent]]. -- [[User:Heptite|Heptite]] 20:50, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

:Since there's been no disagreement (indeed, no discussion at all) on this subject, I went ahead and just moved the subarticle/submodule. -- [[User:Heptite|Heptite]] ([[User talk:Heptite|talk]]) 16:58, 4 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey. I've been around wikibooks and wikipedia for a long time, though I've never edited much of anything or contributed substantially in any way until now. I am a mexican otaku in college, who will move to japan as soon as he gets his phd and accumulates enough money. Nice to meet you, don't spam me.

For now, I think I'm warming up on a textbook that will teach the fundamentals of my personal conlang, Sapollide. If you want, you can look at it, and if you're interested in learning it, not yet. It's not complete, but should be by the end of the year.

Thanks for reading, cacafire.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==First-Order Logic==
In propositional logic, we considered formulas made about atomic objects, which could only be either true or false. First-order logic, the topic of this chapter, builds upon propositional logic and allows you to look inside the objects discussed in formulas. We can provide this more refined level of granularity by discussing objects as elements of sets that can be larger than just the set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, and also include arbitrarily complex relationships with each other.

We begin first by defining the syntax of first-order (FO) logic, and then give these structures meaning.

===Syntax===
The domain of discourse for first order logic is first-order structures or models. A '''first-order structure''' contains
# Relations,
# Functions, and
# Constants (functions of arity 0).

The vocabulary of first-order logic is
# a set of relation symbols with associated arities, and
# a set of function symbols with associated arities.

Here are some example first-order logic vocabularies:
# A graph
#* Relation Set = { &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; : unary, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; : binary }
#* Function Set = { &lt;math&gt;\mathit{next}&lt;/math&gt; : unary }
# Arithmetic
#* Relation Set = { &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; : ternary, &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; : ternary, &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; : ternary, &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; : binary, &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; : binary}
#*Function Set = { &lt;math&gt;\mathit{next}&lt;/math&gt; : unary, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; : const }

Here, a graph is a set of vertices &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and a set of edges &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. For the arithmetic set note that the use of &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; is purely syntactic and we could have used the symbols &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;times&quot; instead. We haven't provided the symbols with any meaning yet.

A '''term''' denotes an element in the first-order structure. A term is used to refer to the elements in our domain of discourse. Here are the rules that describe what a term is:
* every variable is a term, where a variable is simply another set of symbols
* every constant is a term
* If &lt;math&gt;t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are terms, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function then &lt;math&gt;f(t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k})&lt;/math&gt; is a term.
For example, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a binary function and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a ternary function then the following are all terms: &lt;math&gt;x, a, f(x, y), g(x, f(x, y), a)&lt;/math&gt;.

An '''atomic formula''' is
:&lt;math&gt;R(t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k})&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation and &lt;math&gt;t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are terms. When viewing &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as a set, then this is just another way of saying that the tuple
:&lt;math&gt;(t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k})\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

A special relation &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;equal&quot; and cannot be interpreted otherwise. For example, &lt;math&gt;t_{1} = t_{2}&lt;/math&gt; stands for
:&lt;math&gt;=(t_{1}, t_{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

A first-order '''formula''' is an expression built using a given first-order vocabulary and variables and the symbols &lt;math&gt;(, ), \neg, \vee, \wedge, \rightarrow, \exists, \forall&lt;/math&gt;. The set of first-order formulas is the minimum set satisfying the following:
* atomic formulas are first order formulas
* If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are formulas and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable, then the following are also formulas:
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \wedge \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\neg \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \rightarrow \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\exists x \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\forall x \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

===Semantics===
A first-order structure over a given vocabulary consists of
# A domain, which is a set of elements (also known as a universe)
# A mapping associating to every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation symbol in the vocabulary a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation over the domain, and to every &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function over the domain.
These components give meaning to the symbols.

Example:
:Relation Set = { &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; : ternary, &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; : ternary, &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; : ternary, &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; : binary, &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; : binary }
:Function Set = { &lt;math&gt;next&lt;/math&gt; : unary, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; : const }
A first-order structure over this vocabulary is:
# Domain: the set of integers
# Mapping : &lt;math&gt;+ \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; addition, &lt;math&gt;\times \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; multiplication, &lt;math&gt;\uparrow \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; exponentiation, &lt;math&gt;&lt; \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ordering, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{next} \rightarrow i+1&lt;/math&gt;

In this structure, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \forall y \forall z[\times (y, z, x) \rightarrow ((y = 1) \vee (z = 1))]&lt;/math&gt;
expresses the statement &quot;there exists a prime number&quot; (the number 1 also satisfies this statement).

Note here that &lt;math&gt;\times (y, z, x)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(x = y \times z)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Scope of Quantifiers====
In the formula &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\exists x \phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the scope of quantification of the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. An occurrence of a variable in a formula is bound if it is in the scope of quantification of that variable, otherwise the occurrence is said to be free. You can consider a quantifier use as a variable declaration.

A '''sentence''' is a formula with no free variables (i.e., all variables are bound). A sentence is either true or false.

A formula with free variable(s) can be considered as describing the properties of the free variable(s).  For example, &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a formula with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; occurring free and describes the properties of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

If a sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;  evaluates to true over a structure &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and denote this by &lt;math&gt;I \models\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

*&lt;math&gt;I \models R(t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k})&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;(t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{k}) \in I(R)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I(R)&lt;/math&gt; is the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;I \models \phi \wedge \psi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;I \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I \models \psi&lt;/math&gt;. (Similar for &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;.)
*&lt;math&gt;I \models \neg \varphi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;I \not\models \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;I \models \exists x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;I \models \phi(x \leftarrow c)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the domain.
*&lt;math&gt;I \models \forall x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;I \models \phi(x \leftarrow c)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the domain.

Note: &lt;math&gt;\phi(x \leftarrow c)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the result of substituting &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for every free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  Substitution is covered further later in this chapter.

===Axiomatic approach===
The '''axioms''' are a set of sentences meant to distinguish &quot;desired&quot; models from others. But typically, also have &quot;undesired&quot; models, which are called non-standard models.

Examples: Consider the vocabulary &lt;math&gt;(\mathit{next}, +, \times, \uparrow, 0, =, &lt;)&lt;/math&gt;, where the symbols have the usual meaning (defined by FO sentences over this vocabulary). The standard interpretation for this set of axioms (see the end of this chapter) is the integers, but these are also satisfied by the set of integers modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. This possibility is ruled out by adding the following sentence to the axioms:
&lt;math&gt;\forall x (x &lt; \mathit{next}(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Question: Can all non-standard models be axiomatized away? The answer is no. Consider the model shown in [TODO: import figure] for the vocabulary containing only &lt;math&gt;0,&lt;,\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (all elements in the upper line are larger than those on the lower line).

There is no set of first-order sentences that can distinguish this model from the natural numbers. Intuitively, the reason is that we cannot &quot;backtrack&quot; arbitrarily (towards &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) in a first-order sentence. A similar non-standard model can be obtained for the full vocabulary above.

===Evaluating FO Sentences===
Given a first-order structure &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and a FO sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, can we tell if &lt;math&gt;I \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;?

This problem is decidable for finite structures. For example, suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a binary relation representing the edges of a graph, and the given sentence is
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x_{1} \exists x_{2} \exists x_{3}(E(x_{1}, x_{2}) \wedge E(x_{2}, x_{3}) \wedge E(x_{3}, x_{1}) \wedge x_{1} \neq x_{2} \wedge x_{2} \neq x_{3} \wedge x_{3} \neq x_{1} )&lt;/math&gt;.
We can evaluate the truth of this sentence by trying all possible values for &lt;math&gt;x_{1}, x_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{3}&lt;/math&gt;. (Naive evaluation: &quot;nested loop&quot;.) This is polynomial time (in domain size) but exponential in the size of the formula.

On infinite domains, we may or may not be able to evaluate the truth of a sentence. With the vocabulary &lt;math&gt;(N, 0, \sigma, &lt;, +)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, it is decidable if a sentence is true. (This is known as Presburger arithmetic.) However if we include multiplication, the truth of a sentence becomes undecidable.

===A Deductive System for FO===
A set &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; of FO sentences is
* Satisfiable if there is some structure &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;I \models \Delta&lt;/math&gt;
* Unsatisfiable if it is not satisfiable
* Valid if &lt;math&gt;I \models \Delta&lt;/math&gt; for all structure &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;

Given a set of FO sentences &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and a sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; entails &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;), if every structure that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \cup \{\neg \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.
* If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is finite then, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\neg \Sigma \lor \phi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.
* If a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; has free variables &lt;math&gt;\vec{X} = (x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is valid iff &lt;math&gt;\forall \vec{X} \phi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.

====Axioms for Validity====
The axioms for validity are from three categories:
# Axioms for boolean validity. These are inherited from propositional logic.
# Axioms for equality.
# Axioms for quantification.

=====Boolean Validity=====
Given a FO formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, a boolean form of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; a propositional formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; by replacing each propositional variable in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; by a subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of Boolean forms of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;BF(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples:
* For the FO formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x P(x) \lor \neg \forall x P(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the boolean form is &lt;math&gt;p \lor \neg p&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv \forall x G(x,y) \land \exists x G(x,y) \land (G(z,x) \lor \forall x G(x,y)) &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;BF(\varphi) \equiv x_{1} \land x_{3} \land (x_{2} \lor x_{1}) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_1 = \forall x G(x,y), x_2 = G(z,x), x_3 = \exists x G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Claim''': If &lt;math&gt;\psi \in BF(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is valid, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.

=====Equality Axioms=====
Let &lt;math&gt;t, t_{1}, \ldots, t_{k}, t'_{1}, \ldots, t'_{k}&lt;/math&gt; be terms. The following are valid formulas.

* &lt;math&gt;t = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(t_{1} = t'_{1} \land \cdots \land t_{k} = t'_{k}) \rightarrow (f(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{k}) = f(t'_{1}, \ldots, t'_{k}))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function.
* &lt;math&gt;(t_{1} = t'_{1} \land \cdots \land t_{k} = t'_{k}) \rightarrow (R(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{k}) \rightarrow R(t'_{1}, \ldots, t'_{k}))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation.

=====Substitutions=====
Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in which variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; occurs free (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;) and a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, we define the substitution of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x \leftarrow t)&lt;/math&gt;, as the formula that results from replacing every 
free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the constraint that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; contains no variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; quantified in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; occurs free within the scope of quantification of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not occur free &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x \leftarrow t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; be
:&lt;math&gt;((x = 1) \rightarrow \exists x (x = y))&lt;/math&gt;,
then
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x \leftarrow (y + 1))&lt;/math&gt; is a valid substitution
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi(y \leftarrow (x + 1))&lt;/math&gt; is not a valid substitution.

=====Quantification Axioms=====
#&lt;math&gt;\forall x \varphi \rightarrow \varphi(x \leftarrow t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a term and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x \leftarrow t)&lt;/math&gt; is a valid substitution
#&lt;math&gt;(\forall x (\varphi \rightarrow \psi)) \rightarrow ((\forall x \varphi) \rightarrow (\forall x \psi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \forall x \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\exists x \varphi \leftrightarrow \neg \forall x \neg \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

In summary, the axioms for validity are &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf {Ax}}&lt;/math&gt;:
#Axioms for boolean validity. These are inherited from propositional logic.
#Axioms for equality.
#Axioms for quantification.

'''Definition''': A ''proof'' is a sequence &lt;math&gt;\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}, \ldots, \phi_{k}&lt;/math&gt; of FO sentences such that for each &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt;\phi_{i} \in{\mathbf {Ax}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exists j, k &lt; i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_{j} \equiv \psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{k} \equiv (\psi \rightarrow \phi_{i})&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Notation''': If there is a proof of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{Ax}}&lt;/math&gt;, we denote this fact by &lt;math&gt;\vdash_{\mathbf {Ax}}\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Fact''' (Soundness): If &lt;math&gt;\vdash_{\mathbf {Ax}} \phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.

'''Remark''': The set of formulas which can be proven valid is recursively enumerable.

Example: Proof of the formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow (\forall x \phi \land \forall x \psi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow (\phi \land \psi) (x \leftarrow x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi \land \psi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \forall x \phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \forall x \phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi&lt;/math&gt;
The proof of &lt;math&gt;\forall x \psi&lt;/math&gt; is symmetrical.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi \land \forall x \psi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow (\forall x \phi \land \forall x \psi)&lt;/math&gt;

====Useful Equivalences====
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \land \psi) \leftrightarrow (\forall x \phi) \land (\forall x \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi \lor \psi) \not\leftrightarrow (\forall x \phi) \lor (\forall x \psi)&lt;/math&gt; e.g. &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) \approx&lt;/math&gt; &quot;x is even&quot; and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)\approx&lt;/math&gt; &quot;x is odd&quot;
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x (\phi(x) \lor \neg \phi(x)) \not\leftrightarrow (\forall x \phi(x) \lor \forall x \neg \phi(x))&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\exists x (\phi \lor \psi) \leftrightarrow (\exists x \phi) \lor (\exists x \psi)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\neg \exists x \phi \leftrightarrow \forall x \neg \phi&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\neg \forall x \phi \leftrightarrow \exists x \neg \phi&lt;/math&gt;

====Prenex Normal Form====
'''Claim''': Every FO sentence is equivalent to a FO sentence of the form &lt;math&gt;Q_{1} x_{1} \cdots Q_{k} x_{k} \phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_{i} \in \{\exists, \forall \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is quantifier free.

This is proved using the distributive properties of quantifiers.  It may be necessary to rename variables, to avoid ambiguities. Although you can always move all quantifiers to the left, the resulting formula can actually be exponentially larger than the original one.

'''Example''':
:&lt;math&gt;\phi \equiv \forall x (G(x,x) \land (\forall y G(x,y) \lor \exists y \neg G(y,y))) \land G(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv (\forall x (G(x,x) \land (\forall y G(x,y) \lor \exists y \neg G(y,y)))) \land G(w,0)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv\forall x (G(x,x) \land (\forall y G(x,y) \lor \exists y \neg G(y,y)) \land G(w,0))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv\forall x (G(x,x) \land (\forall y G(x,y) \lor \exists z \neg G(z,z)) \land G(w,0))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv\forall x (G(x,x) \land \forall y (G(x,y) \lor \exists z \neg G(z,z)) \land G(w,0))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv\forall x \forall y (G(x,x) \land (G(x,y) \lor \exists z \neg G(z,z)) \land G(w,0))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv\forall x \forall y (G(x,x) \land \exists z (G(x,y) \lor \neg G(z,z)) \land G(w,0))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\equiv\forall x \forall y \exists z (G(x,x) \land (G(x,y) \lor \neg G(z,z)) \land G(w,0))&lt;/math&gt;

====Recall the Axiomatic Method====
# Describe the desired model as closely as possible using a (possibly infinite but recursive) set &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; of axioms (FO sentences).

#Prove things using deduction.

'''Notation''': We say &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a valid consequence of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;\Delta \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;), if every model satisfying &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Fact''': &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \cup \{\neg \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

===Aside: Nonlogical axioms for number theory===

The following fourteen first-order axioms describe the properties of arithmetic and numbers, i.e. addition (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;), multiplication (&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;), exponentiation (&lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;, equality (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;), ordering (&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;), successor function (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) and remainder (mod). This example shows the expressive power of first-order statements, which were originally hoped to provide a basis for the &quot;one true mathematics.&quot;

Question: Why are they called &quot;nonlogical&quot; axioms?

:NT1:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x(\sigma(x) \ne 0)&lt;/math&gt;
:NT2:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (\sigma(x) = \sigma(y) \rightarrow x=y)&lt;/math&gt;
:NT3:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x=0 \vee \exists y \sigma(y) = x)&lt;/math&gt;
:NT4:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x+0=x) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT5:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y(x+\sigma(y) = \sigma(x+y)) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT6:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x\times 0 = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT7:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (x\times \sigma(y) = (x \times y ) + x) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT8:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x ( x \uparrow 0 = \sigma(0)) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT9:  &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (x \uparrow \sigma(y) = (x \uparrow y ) \times x ) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT10: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x&lt;\sigma(x)) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT11: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ( x &lt; y \rightarrow (\sigma (x)\le y)) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT12: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ( \neg (x&lt;y) \leftrightarrow y \le x) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT13: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \forall z (((x&lt;y) \wedge (y&lt;z)) \rightarrow x&lt;z) &lt;/math&gt;
:NT14: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \forall z \forall z' (mod(x,y,z)\wedge mod(x,y,z') \rightarrow z = z') &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Introduction to the Scientific Method&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
----

In Ecology, as with many sciences a series of steps known as the [[w:scientific_method|scientific method]] are involved in trying to support or nullify a hypothesis.

There are two ways to support your hypothesis.  The first way is by a weak inference, which is basically using one distinct hyptohesis and trying to support that hypothesis through observation.  The other way is by using strong inference.  This method is regarded as having more credibility as it uses numerous hypotheses with a null hypothesis for each.  Instead of trying to support one hypothesis as with a weak inference, the researcher tries to disprove numerous hypotheses through controlled experimentation to support a single hypothesis.

'''Lemon pickle''' is a traditional condiment used with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] food. Many pickle recipes from India have oil to help preserve the pickle, but this recipe uses no oil.

{{see also|Cookbook:Lemon Pickle}}

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]] - 8 small or 4 large
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ¼ - ½ cup of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 4 small green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Mustard|yellow mustard]] seed
* 1 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Mustard|ginger]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seed
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]]

==Procedure==

# Cut lemons into small pieces, and place in a bowl.
# Cover with salt and set aside for at least 4 hours (better 24!)
# Chop the chilis finely.
# Dry-roast the yellow mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, star anise, and chopped chilis on a high heat, shaking constantly - don't burn them!
# Strain the juice from the lemons into a small saucepan, add the turmeric, ginger and sugar, and simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sugar has dissolved. If there isn't enough juice, add a tablespoon or two of water.
# Add the spices and sugar mixture to the bowl of lemons, and mix together well.
# Pack into a pint jar, pressing the pieces in if needed, to ensure that the liquid covers all the lemon pieces.
# Set aside to mature for 1 month.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you don't have fresh chilis, add some dried chilis or chili powder. The pickle in the photo has three whole dried chilis in it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">GarageBand was developed by Apple under the direction of Gerhard Lengeling, formerly of the German company Emagic, makers of Logic Audio. (Emagic was acquired by Apple in July 2002.)

The application was announced during Steve Jobs's keynote speech at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in San Francisco on 6 January 2004; musician John Mayer assisted with its demonstration.

GarageBand 2 was announced at the (2005) Macworld Conference &amp; Expo on January 11, 2005. It shipped, as announced, around 22 January 2005. Major new features included the abilities to view and edit music in Musical Notation form, to record up to 8 tracks at once, to fix timing and pitch of recordings, to automate track pan position, master volume, and master pitch, to transpose both audio and MIDI, and to import MIDI files.

GarageBand 3, announced at 2006's Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, includes a 'podcast studio', including the ability to use more than 200 effects and jingles, and integration with iChat for remote interviews.

The latest version of GarageBand is part of iLife '08. It incorporates the ability to separately record sections of a song such as bridges and chorus lines, support for automation of tempos and instruments, and a &quot;Magic GarageBand&quot; feature that includes a virtual jam session with a complete 3D view of the instruments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creating your own music can be very fun and also very gratifying. But until now, the technology to do so was either too simple or too expensive and complicated. GarageBand is the first music creation program that strikes the perfect balance between the two extremes, and it comes free with every new Mac that Apple ships.

Whether you are an experienced musician who wants to record themselves and digitally add a back-up band, or can't tell a clef from a key and are just trying to have fun, GarageBand will accommodate you, and this book will teach you how to get the most out of it.

Hello! For the articulated propositions the golden rule is that in modern neapolitan these propositions don't exist. 
For example:   Vaco 'a posta a pavà 'e bullette (I go to Post Office to pay the bills) instead of Vaco â posta a pavà ê bullette.</text>

Why is the grammar of the neapolitan always compared with the grammar of italian??? Italian and neapolitan are different languages. Imagine to explain the spanish grammar comparing it with french or italian. It will be borring for them that don't know these languages.
:I think that the majority of people (admittedly not all) who are interested in Neapolitan have some acquaintance with Italian and it may be important to point out the differences where important.  This is a case where I think it is important.  Articulated prepositions are integral to Italian, they aren't so much in Neapolitan and newer users may attempt erroneously to create them. I have seen other orthographies vis-á-vis the circumflexed vowels.  The circumflex indicates a drawn out vowel sound.  I have also seen it as ''á'' etc.. It is my understanding that the circumflex is used in books about Neapolitan.-[[User:E. abu Filumena|E. abu Filumena]] 05:36, 12 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gregorovitch and the wands ==

{{spoiler}}

Just as a reminder: We have to be very careful talking about why Voldy is looking for Gregorovitch. Although the reader doesn't yet know this, what Voldy wants specifically is the Elder Wand, which he is chasing back through the last person known to have had it: Gregorovitch. Harry doesn't find this out until March. Until we learn that the Hallows exist, we don't know that the Elder Wand exists either; and so we are working on the assumption that Voldy wants Gregorovitch to make him a wand. But we don't want to explicitly say this; as with Slughorn in the previous book, we should let the reader form their own, erroneous conclusion.

Note that I, at least, on hearing of the Hallows, thought that what Voldy was after was the Stone. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:11, 3 September 2007 (UTC)


== Luna and Barny Weasley ==

Why must people always found big hidden links and incredibly powerful secrets. There is not a clue in the all seven books that Luna Lovegood have any unexpected magical abilities.
Is Ron secretly a cat animagus because he once won a Chess match against McGonagal enchanted pieces? Is Dudley the heir of Helga Huffulpuff because he let a CUP of tea beneath Harry's door in the second chapter? 
Harry have drink Polyjuice Potion and look has an hypothetical cousin Barny but he talks like Harry Potter (though with a different voice), he moves like Harry Potter... Luna clearly tell she recognises him from the way he act. The Death Eaters identify Harry between 7 decoys just because he act &quot;Potter Style&quot;.
Yes Luna is a little weird but if she succeed in Harry's indentification it's because, unlike other people, she's curious, open-minded and that she cares about people.

[[User:Melmoth|Melmoth]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Melmoth|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:11, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
:An interesting point. I think that it is a case of people seeing what they expect to see, perhaps. It's certainly true that Draco didn't identify Harry and Ron pretending to be Crabbe and Goyle; or, for that matter, Barty impersonating Moody. In those two cases, certainly it is possible that people saw who they expected to see, and in this case, &quot;Barney Weasley&quot; being a total unknown, they wouldn't have any expectations and would see what was actually there. Luna likely would recognize Harry because she is much more in this world than many others. If you don't mind, I will write that up.

== Symbol of the Hallows ==

Should it be mentioned what the Hallows symbol is in the GP section?  This would be a good place to talk about the Swastika allegory that is referenced loosely in the Questions section, too.</text>

This is a variation of fruit cake that originated in Ireland. 

==Ingredients==
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Flour|cake flour]]
*A pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*4 oz [[Cookbook:Raisin|sultanas or golden raisins]]
*6 oz [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*6 oz [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*2 oz [[Cookbook:Zest|citrus peel]]
*2 oz [[Cookbook:Cherry|dried cherries]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat the oven to 350°F.
#Sift together flour, salt and baking powder.
#Cream butter and sugar, this may take 5-10 min.
#Add eggs individually, incorporating each fully before adding the next.
#Fold in fruits then the dry mixture.
#Turn on to a greased and lined 8 inch cake pin.
#Bake on the center rack for 75-90 minutes. (Check for doneness after 60 minutes.)
#Let cake cool to room temperature in pan.
#Remove to a wire tray, cover with towel and allow to sit until completely cool.

==Variations==
*This particular version of the recipe does not include whiskey. If you were to add it, it would be added along with the butter and sugar. Approximately one quart should be used.
*This recipe uses raisins and cherries but apples, strawberries, or raspberries can be substituted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't understand nothing at all. THERE IS NO ONE USABLE SOURCE CODE ON HOW TO CREATE BIBLIOGRAPHY. What do I have to write in .tex and what to write in an outer .bib file. Please, write only ONE solution what is works. Just for the beginners. {{unsigned|Brtkr|20:43, 31 July 2012}}
 

there is no copyright notice on the source page, or am i missing it. [[User:70.17.91.192|70.17.91.192]] 17:55, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think we need it: all the authors are properly referenced in [[LaTeX/Authors]]. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 20:39, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

The biblatex package is a recent addition to the bibliography process that allows greater flexibility than standard bibtex. It might be worthwhile to write a section about this package.

We should mention &lt;code&gt;\cite[pagenumber]{citekey}&lt;/code&gt; somewhere on this page.
- This is there; but there is a contradiction between these instructions and the instructions on multiple references (possibly this is a fault with LaTeX and cannot be resolved here)

When introducing the natbib package, the bibliographystyle is mentioned. But this is a concept related to BibTeX, that come later in the page. This can be confusing for the reader.

Corrected Citavi entry. Citavi is straightforward commercial software (not free as claimed), which offers a size-limited version (100 entries) for free.


The paragraph describing the &lt;code&gt;\bibliography&lt;/code&gt; command mentions that you can specify a different directory - $HOME/....  This will not work.  The $ will be interpreted as the start of a math element.

== Bibliography styles: how to reduce vertical space between bibliography entries? ==

I wonder how to reduce the vertical space ''between'' bibtex entries - while I can reduce the linespace with the &quot;setspace&quot; packages (works fine) I don't manage to get more entries on a page... ? thanks for a hint, [[User:Bumbulski|Bumbulski]] ([[User talk:Bumbulski|talk]]) 19:07, 8 September 2009 (UTC)
: Found it: the natbib style allows to define &lt;code&gt;\bibsep&lt;/code&gt;. Redefine with (0pt is no line space between items; here: have a bit of space): &lt;code&gt;\setlength{\bibsep}{3pt}&lt;/code&gt; [[User:Bumbulski|Bumbulski]] ([[User talk:Bumbulski|talk]]) 19:00, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

The LaTeX code is too small, I think it would be better to enlarge it

== Explain natbib earlier ==

Shouldn't Natbib be explained earlier in this chapter than at the very end? Switching from plain BibTeX to Natbib is a pain, while setting Natbib to numeric mode is quite easy. Elsevier uses Natbib for all LaTeX journals... [[User:Qwertyus|Qwertyus]] ([[User talk:Qwertyus|talk]]) 21:35, 22 October 2010 (UTC)

== further reading ==

if there were a further reading section it ought to have a link to http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94mori.pdf --[[Special:Contributions/87.127.117.246|87.127.117.246]] ([[User talk:87.127.117.246|discuss]]) 22:19, 3 February 2011 (UTC)

== Correcting &quot;Add the Bibliography to the Table of Contents as numbered item&quot; ==

If I'm not mistaken, the tips provided here add an extra blank page before the bibliography (at least in the report document type).
The solution to remove it seems to be provided here: http://www.latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=10573
Should this be mentioned?
--[[Special:Contributions/192.54.144.229|192.54.144.229]] ([[User talk:192.54.144.229|discuss]]) 09:42, 20 July 2011 (UTC)

Easiest way I've found to add bibliography to the TOC is: 
{{{
\renewcommand{\bibsection}		{\chapter{\bibname}}
}}}

This works because usually the bibsection is chapter* (which has no toc entry). You can also modify this to use addcontentsline after the \bibname which is a mix of my solution and the one already used on the page. 
--[[User:Ayrn|Ayrn]] ([[User talk:Ayrn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ayrn|contribs]]) 10:37, 20 March 2012 (UTC)

== The mention of VIM at the end ==

There is mention of compiling the latex document and aux file with bibtex through vim. Though this is good, it seems misplaced. There could be a section devoted to integrating latex into different editors.
Also, you can get bibtex to process the file more simply by using the command...

!bibtex %&lt;

== Add BibLaTeX section? ==

Should BibLaTeX maybe be mentioned? [[User:Benregn|Benregn]] ([[User talk:Benregn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Benregn|contribs]]) 18:53, 12 October 2011 (UTC)

Definitly! Especialy the Multiple Biliographies part is worth noting about it. Its so easy to do it with biblatex:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;

\printbibliography[title={Book references},type=book]
\printbibliography[title={Article references},type=article]
\printbibliography[title={Other references}, nottype=article, nottype=book]
&lt;/source&gt;
That's it.

== Alphabeticising &quot;von&quot; names ==

The '''John von Neumann''' example is actually more complicated than discussed here. I don't know about JvN in particular, but often people with de Surname, von Surname and van Surname like it to appear as &quot;(de|von|van) Surname, Firstname&quot; BUT they want to be alphabeticised under the first letter of Surname (so, N for JvN), not under d for &quot;de&quot; or &quot;v&quot; for &quot;(von|van)&quot;. This page doesn't seem to deal with this issue, and probably should. Likewise, examples for name postfixes that aren't part of the surname, like the researcher Hal Duamé III[http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/] or Firstname Surname Jr. [[User:Thayvian|Thayvian]] ([[User talk:Thayvian|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thayvian|contribs]]) 02:10, 28 May 2012 (UTC)

== Fields not displayed ==

I had a problem when copying-pasting templates from this article.

With the following template, the &quot;year&quot; filed was not displayed in my document.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@article{Xarticle,
    author    = &quot;&quot;,
    title     = &quot;&quot;,
    journal   = &quot;&quot;,
    %volume   = &quot;&quot;,
    %number   = &quot;&quot;,
    %pages    = &quot;&quot;,
    year      = &quot;XXXX&quot;,
    %month    = &quot;&quot;,
    %note     = &quot;&quot;,
}
&lt;/source&gt;

But with this template, it was:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@article{Xarticle,
    author    = &quot;&quot;,
    title     = &quot;&quot;,
    journal   = &quot;&quot;,
    year      = &quot;XXXX&quot;,
    %volume   = &quot;&quot;,
    %number   = &quot;&quot;,
    %pages    = &quot;&quot;,
    %month    = &quot;&quot;,
    %note     = &quot;&quot;,
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It seems to be linked to the position of the fields with &quot;%&quot;. Can anybody confirm ? If this is the case it would have to be mentioned in the article.

== Mention something about biber? ==

Biber is being used more frequently and recommended more often now (http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/35233/bibtex-and-chicago-style-citations). Should this article be extended to have a quick blurb about biber?

== thebibliography environment is not supported by texlipse ==

I took a decent while for me to figure this one out. That example at the top of the page does not work. An introductory example should be as accessible as possible, I think. At least we should warn texlipse users about this.[[Special:Contributions/130.234.207.147|130.234.207.147]] ([[User talk:130.234.207.147|discuss]]) 14:10, 21 September 2013 (UTC)

== Underscore ==

Maybe it should be mentioned somewhere that it is not a good idea to use the underscore character in your bibtexkey (as is written in &quot;Getting current LaTeX document to use your .bib file&quot;). Apparently Latex doesn't like it much when you \cite{bibtex_key}

[[Special:Contributions/131.180.138.34|131.180.138.34]] ([[User talk:131.180.138.34|discuss]]) 10:56, 28 November 2013 (UTC)

:Can you be more specific? Every single key in my main .bib has 1 or more underscores and it works fine, all I can find by googling is that starting a key with underscore is anissue.  [[User:ChrisHodgesUK|ChrisHodgesUK]] ([[User talk:ChrisHodgesUK|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ChrisHodgesUK|contribs]]) 12:32, 28 November 2013 (UTC)

== Merge ==

The page [[LaTeX/More Bibliographies]] is mostly redundent and far less complete than [[LaTeX/Bibliography Management]]. It should be merged into it. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 09:00, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

== Babelbib inconsistent name ordering ==

Maybe the section &quot;Localizing bibliography appearance&quot; should include a paragraph about how to customize how babelbib writes names in bibliography entries.
Because the babelbib styles (e.g. babplain) writes the first author as &quot;Lastname, Forename&quot; and subsequent authors as &quot;Forename Lastname&quot; to emphasize its ordering by lastname. However there exists additional style variants suffixed with &quot;-fl&quot; (e.g. babplain-fl) or &quot;-lf&quot; to consistently writes names as respectively &quot;Forename Lastname&quot; or &quot;Lastname, Forename&quot;.

See &quot;4 Available bibliography styles&quot; in the bablebib documentation (http://mirrors.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/babelbib/babelbib.pdf) for more information.

==Section I Analytical Reasoning==

==Section II Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===
===Question 02===
===Question 03===
===Question 04===
IDENTIFY This ia a flaw question.  The keyword here is &quot;questionable&quot; in the question.

READ Politician P, as most politicians do, is attacking his opponent's claim. He states his oponent's claim in the first sentence and attacks it in the second sentence and argues that his opponent is &quot;mistaken&quot;.  His reasoning is that raising taxes upsets the taxpayers because of the loss of purchasing power and therefore, it is wrong.

ANALYZE His reasoning is that whatever makes people upset, it is wrong. It is a questionable logic because anything that lead to a number of people becoming upset is deemed &quot;simple mistaken&quot;. 

CHOOSE Let's go through the answer response one by one.

(A) Incorrect. P does not presupposes that the claim is wrong.  P has a reason for it. Moreover, no &quot;other unpopular views&quot; is mentioned here. Raising tax may be a unpopular view but there is nothing else.

(B) Incorrect. There is no attack on character here. The politician only describes the effect of the claim that people would be upset. 

'''(C) Correct.''' Right on target. P argues that raising tax (or the implementation of the claim) would lead to unhappiness (many taxpayers becoming upset).

(D) Incorrect. There is no irrelvant issue in the argument. 

(E) Incorrect. P actually argues that the obligation does not exist. This choice is for the people who misread the question, thinking that the task is to find the flaw in the opponent's reasoning not Politician P's. Be careful.

===Question 05===
===Question 06===
===Question 07===
===Question 08===
===Question 09===
===Question 10===
===Question 11===
===Question 12===
===Question 13===
===Question 14===
===Question 15===
IDENTIFY
This is a flaw question.
READ
The editorialist argues that if one is mature enough to handle the responsibilities, then we can give the person the previleges.  Previledges entail responsibilities. Then the editorialists cite a scientific fact that people are physically mature by 17.  
    
ANALYZE
He mistakenly equates physical maturity with all around maturity.  Just because one is physically mature does not mean the person is capable in all regards.  You can't run for U.S. president or the Senate when you are 18.  You can't even buy alochol legally in the States.
  
CHOOSE 
(A) Incorrect. The argument does not assume what it sets out to prove. If this is the case, it would be a circular reasoning and easy to spot. 

(B) Incorrect. The weakness is not in the small number of examples.  The evidence the editorialist uses is pretty powerful.  &quot;Science has established&quot; he says. He implies that there have been conclusive research findings to support this to be a generally accepted theory.

'''(C) Correct.''' You need to remember the definition of &quot;equivocate&quot; which is like beating around the bush. The editorialist confuses us by implying that physically maturity is all that is required for accepting adult's responsibilities, which isn't true.  He is playing with the central concept of maturity. 

(D) Incorrect. There is no authority here. He did not appeal to some eminent scientist.  Even if there exists some goddess of science, she is not an inappropriate authority.  She would be the authority. Therefore, this choice is clearly wrong.

(E) Incorrect. This is a side issue. The editorialist's argument is consistent with this choice since it could be true that most are mature by 17 while some are mature at 16. So this choice does not weaken the argument.

===Question 16===
IDENTIFY&lt;br&gt;
This is a parrell reasoning question. You might want to consider skipping if you are not very good at this type of questions or low on time.

READ&lt;br&gt;
Read carefully for the structure.

ANALYZE&lt;br&gt;
Use your logic game diagramming skill to briefly sketch the structure.
All A -&gt; commercial or critical
All critical -&gt; commercial
All A -&gt; commercial or commercial (substitute critical with commercial)
All A -&gt; commercial

CHOOSE&lt;br&gt;
(A) Incorrect. The word &quot;Most&quot; ruins it. The passage says &quot;every new play&quot;.  This choice is not a 100% foolproof logic because &quot;most&quot; opens a hole.
(B) Incorrect. 
'''(C) Correct.'''
(D) Incorrect.
(E) Incorrect.

===Question 17===
===Question 18===
===Question 19===
===Question 20===
===Question 21===
IDENTIFY

This is a flaw question.

READ

Mr. Ziegler is on trial for shooting. His lawyer argues that his client is not guilty because he was insane when he fired the shot.   The lawyer points out that the plaintiff did not prove (probably could not) that he was sane during the firing but only provided evidence that he is sane after the incident. 

ANALYZE

The attonery does not see the link between the defendant's sanity after the crime and his mental state before the crime.  If he is sane now, why wouldn't he be sane then?  His sanity after the crime sugguests a strong probability that he was sane then.

CHOOSE

(A) Incorrect. We do not known Ziegler's professional qualification or educational background.  The attorney does not raise this point.

(B) Incorrect. The lawyer does not conclude that there is a lack of evidence for his sanity- in fact, there is as the plaintiff submitted.  The attorney does not provide any evidence against his sanity.  He concludes that Ziegler is insane for lack of evidence in contrary.

(C) Incorrect. Ziegler's consulting firm may be worried about this point but this is not relevant. 

(D) Incorrect. Moral responsibility is not an issue here. Legal culpability is.  Moreover, this response does not address any flaw in the reasoning.  

'''(E) Correct.''' Bingo. His sanity later indicates that he may be sane before.

===Question 22===
===Question 23===
===Question 24===
IDENTIFY

This is a disagreement question.  As the passage above indicates Monica and Hector are arguing about something.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''THINK LIKE THE TESTMAKERS'''
The LSAT is a test of your way of thinking.  It tests how well you think like the testmakers.  Once you start to think like them, you can be thought as having the LSAT mind.  Your preparation of the LSAT should therefore focus on learning to this way of thinking.
  
==Logical Reasoning==
This PrepTest explanation for Logical Reasoning sections follows a methodology called IRAC(pronounced EYE-rack) which stands for: '''Identify, Read, Analyze, and Choose'''.  It is a step by step methodology for tackling LSAT questions. 

'''Identify'''

The IRAC starts with quickly scanning the question.  Most LSAT questions start with a brief passage or statement followed by a question.  It is important to figure out exactly what the question is looking for.  You may decide to skip the question if you are low on time or the question seems too difficult.  You can choose to guess random. 

'''Read'''

You need to move to the beginning of the passage and quickly and accurately work the passage. Underline, paraphrase and engage with the passage. Using symbols to mark the passage.  Do not overanalyze or bring outside information or knowledge but stick to what's provided.

'''Analyze'''

Use your LSAT analytical skill.  Apply the right analysis required by the question.  You are not given credit for doing something else.  Once you are done with analyzing the passage, move to each response.  

'''Choose'''

==Reading Comprehension==
This PrepTest explanation for Reading Comprehension sections follows a methodology called BRIEF (you are essentially briefing the passage) which stands for: '''Break, Read, Internalize, Eliminate, Find'''.  It is a step by step methodology for tackling LSAT questions. 

'''Break'''

Go to the questions and figure out the key terms and words. You are essentially breaking the question.  When you read, pay a special attention to those words and relationship.

'''Read'''

Scan quickly and visualize a chart in your brain.

'''Internalize'''

Digest what you read.

'''Eliminate'''

Do not look for the right answer.  Look for the wrong one first.

'''Find'''

Mark your answer sheet and move on.

==Analytical Reasoning==
This PrepTest explanation for Analytical Reasoning sections follows a methodology called CASES which stands for: '''Chart, Analyze, S, Eliminate, Select'''.  It is a step by step methodology for tackling LSAT questions. 


'''Chart'''

'''Analyze'''

S
'''Eliminate'''

'''Select'''

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|extern}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The keyword {{C sharp|extern}} indicates that the method being called exists in a [[:w:Dynamic-link library|DLL]].

A tool called &lt;code&gt;tlbimp.exe&lt;/code&gt; can create a wrapper assembly that allows C# to interact with the DLL like it was a .NET assembly i.e. use constructors to instantiate it, call its methods.

Older DLLs will not work with this method. Instead, you have to explicitally tell the compiler what DLL to call, what method to call and what parameters to pass. Since parameter type is very important, you can also explicitally define what type the parameter should be passed to the method as.

Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace ExternKeyword
{
     public class Program
     {
          static void Main()
          {
               NativeMethods.MessageBoxEx(IntPtr.Zero, &quot;Hello there&quot;, &quot;Caption here&quot;, 0, 0);
          }
     }
  
     public class NativeMethods
     {
          [DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;)]
          public static extern MessageBoxEx(IntPtr hWnd, string lpText, string lpCaption, uint uType, short wLanguageId);
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The {{C sharp|[DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;)]}} tells the compiler which DLL to reference. Windows searches for files as defined by the PATH environment variable, and therefore will search those paths before failing.

The method is also static because the DLL may not understand how to be &quot;created&quot;, as DLLs can be created in different languages. This  allows the method to be called directly, instead of being instantiated and then used.

'''Field Dreams''' is an eclectic yet easy to make appetizer. The unusual flavors and ingredient combination makes this an excellent way to start a dinner party.

==Ingredients==
*2 Golden Delicious [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
*Yellow [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] as served on hot dogs
*1 oz crumbly, fresh goat [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]]


==Procedure==
#Wash the apples and cut across (i.e. not from top to bottom) into slices 1/4 inch thick. Preferably the apples should come from the refrigerator as the cold temperature will add to the contrast.
#Cover one side of the apple slices with yellow mustard.
#Crumble the goat cheese onto each slice.
#Serve immediately as is.

Makes 6 to 8 slices.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Tip 1: Golden delicious apples are preferable, yet any sweet, crisp apple will do.
*Tip 2: Add honey roasted nuts of some kind along with the goat cheese for an interesting combination.
*Tip 3: For a professional look, lay each slice of apple on lettuce or another type of garnish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FOSS Open Content}}
In response to the excesses of copyright system, there has been a need for strong alternatives.  The FOSS movement was perhaps one of the first to articulate such an alternative in a formal manner.  While phrases such as &quot;Free Software&quot; and &quot;copyleft&quot; conjure up an image of alternatives to copyright, it is relevant to note that FOSS is not a model that abandons copyright.  In fact, quite the opposite, it relies on copyright law, but users it creatively to articulate a positive, rather than a negative rights discourse.  What does a positive rights framework mean?{{focref|50}}  As we have seen, copyright has traditionally been an exclusive right that is granted to the owner of copyright to exploit his / her work.

Copyright is usually thought of as a bundle of rights that are available to the owner, and these are:

* Reproduction rights: the right to reproduce copies of the work (for example, making copies of a book from a manuscript).

* Adaptation rights: the right to produce derivative works based on the copyrighted work (for example, creating a film based on a book).

* Distribution rights: the right to distribute copies of the work (for example, circulating the book in bookshops).

* Performance rights: the right to perform the copyrighted work publicly, (for example, having a reading of the book or a dramatic performance of a play).

* Display rights: the right to display the copyrighted work publicly (for example, showing a film or work of art).

Another important dimension is that there are no procedural requirements for obtaining copyright; it vests automatically with the creator the moment the work has been created and fixed in some tangible form.  This can be a very serious problem.  For instance, suppose that I have made a useful graphic file and posted it on the Internet. Even if I do not object to having the file downloaded and used for any purposes, such as including it in a teaching pack or on a homepage, the law of copyright is such that someone who uses the graphic without my permission would be infringing my copyright.

It may be that I choose not to prosecute them, but what has effectively happened is that the rule of exclusion has become the default rule in copyright. We have effectively moved away from a time when everything was presumed to be in the public domain unless otherwise stated, to a system where everything is presumed to be protected unless otherwise stated.

==Licenses and the Control of Copyright==

At this point, it is useful to return to the story of the extension of copyright law.  Given the fact that copyright includes so many rights, it basically becomes impossible for any person to use another's work without running into the danger of being an &quot;infringer.&quot;  Thus, one needs to obtain a license from the owner of copyright to use any portion of the work. A license in copyright law is basically the grant of a right by the owner of copyright which allows the recipient of the license, the licensee, to exercise certain rights with respect to the copyright work.  Without this license, any use not granted by copyright by default would be considered an '''infringement'''.

Derived from the Latin word licere, &quot;to allow,&quot; license literally means &quot;permission.&quot;  Theoretically, a license can only permit things that copyright law places under the provision of the copyright owner and does not already permit by default. A license can thus only allow more, not less than, the default copyright regulations.  FOSS and Open Content licenses, therefore, are licenses in the proper sense of the word. '''Proprietary software licenses''', however, are even more restrictive than default copyright regulation.

! Data
|-
|Information can mean anything from numbers to images, from white noise to sound. A weather report, a portrait, a shadow in surveillance footage, a salary statement, birth and death statistics, a headcount in a gathering of friends, private email, ultra-high pedestrians as they walk in a city - all of this is data.

'''Etymology''': 1646, from Latin datum &quot;(thing) given,&quot; neuter pp. of dare, &quot;to give.&quot;

Similarly, the word &quot;data&quot; in Hindi / Sanskrit is taken to mean &quot;giver&quot;, which suggests that one must always be generous with information, and make gifts of our code, images and ideas.  To be stingy with data is to violate an instance of the secret and sacred compacts of homophonic words from different cultural / spatial orbits as they meet in the liminal zone between languages, in the thicket of the sound of quotidian slips of the tongue. Errors in transmission and understanding too carry gifts and data.{{focref|51}}
|}

How is it possible that such a &quot;license&quot; is not a permission, but imposes additional restrictions?  The catch lies in the term &quot;license agreement&quot;, which shifts the whole matter from copyright to contract law.  By making users click on a box signifying their agreement to the terms of the license agreement, software vendors make you sigh a usage contract with them, thus circumventing even the scarce &quot;fair use&quot; liberties granted by copyright law (such as public lending of works in libraries).{{focref|52}}

As Pamela Samuelson notes:

''Software is not the first time that they have attempted to restrict user rights via a license, and even book publishers have attempted to do so.  Book publishers and sound recording companies once tried to restrict what purchasers of their products could do with they by &quot;licenses&quot;, but fortunately the courts didn't let them get away with it. (Take a look at an old Victoria recording jacket and you'll see that it purports to license use of the recording to one Victoria machien and to deny authority to retransfer one's copy of the recording.) One important case was Bobbs-Merrill vs Straus.  Bobbs-Merrill sued Straus because he sold copies of bobbs-Merrill books in violation of a license restriction that conditioned the right to retransfer copies of the books on an agreement to charge at least US$1 per copy.  The US Supreme Court treated the license restriction as ineffective as a matter of copyright policy.  The Bobbs-Merrill decision contributed to the emergence of the &quot;first sale&quot; or &quot;exhaustion of rights&quot; doctrine in copyright law, under which publishers lose authority to control redistributions of copies of their works when, in commercial reality, the transaction is a sale. In the aftermath of this and similar cases, publishers and sound recording companies abandoned these overly restrictive practices.''

==The GNU General Public License==
It is within this highly rigid regime of copyright that the Free Software movement sought to make an intervention. As a result, it has become highly popular across the world, and has become an inspiration for similar licensing models beyond the world of software. While the traditional software license specifically denies certain rights, the GNU General Public License is a license that is designed to grant certain fundamental freedoms.{{focref|53}} These are:

* Users should be allowed to run the software for any purpose.
* Users should be able to closely examine and study the software and should be able to freely modify and improve it to better serve their needs.
* Users should be able to give copies of the software to other people to whom the software will be useful.
* Users should be able to freely distribute their improvements for the benefit of the broader public.

The Free Software model differs drastically from the &quot;closed source&quot; principles of licensing.  Why then do we say that the GNU GPL model is based on an innovative use, rather than an abandonment of copyright? The Free Software model is predicated on ensuring that the fundamental freedoms are not taken away or removed from the public domain by anyone; thus, there is a condition attached to the use of Free Software.

The fundamental condition is that any person who uses Free Software to create a derivative work, or an adaptation of the software, must ensure that this software is also licensed on the same terms and conditions, namely under the GNU GPL.  If the author of a piece of Free Software decided to relinquish his copyright, it would mean that someone could use his or her code and create a derivative work and then license it as a proprietary piece of code, therefore preventing others from making use of the software in a free manner.

==Challenges to Copyright==
What the Free Software movement did was to use copyright in an innovative manner to ensure access rather than restrict people's ability to use, distribute and modify code.

At the heart of the Free Software movement lies a radical reworking of the very idea of the user.  While in the realm of proprietary software, the user was a passive consumer, the Free Software model is based on the idea of the user as producer - a user who has the ability to contribute to the existing work and simultaneously become a producer as well.  Copying, cutting and pasting, changing things, applying filters, and so on are part of the basic language of digital media.  The user-producer concept speaks to he digital experience and the freedoms that this digital culture allows for ordinary people to become artists and producers.  This model fundamentally challenges the traditional assumptions of copyright law.  It moves away from the romantic notion of authorship which saw cultural production as an isolated activity carried out by a solitary genius creating something out of nothing.  Instead, it argues that the very essence of cultural production has been about learning by creatively using works that exist in the public domain.  It also moves away from the mythical notion of the originality of the work to recognize the value that various users contribute through their modifications and adaptations to an existing work, thus placing a higher premium on collaborative rather than isolated production.

{| Class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|'''Collaboration'''
It is not at though the idea of collaborative production is a new one.  In fact, the history of cultural production has, to a large extent, been the history of collaborative production, and this is true in all kinds of human achievements.  Take for instance a few simple illustrations:

* The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' was only possible through the collaborative efforts of hundreds of people from across the world.  It did not bear the tag of being an open model of production because it was created in a time when the myth of copyright backed by the power of large content owners had not yet engulfed the imagination of production.

* Hip-hop music has been about the ability to build on previous work by sampling and creating new works.

* The world of dance is marked by a constant culture of borrowing and building on previous efforts.

* Media design is constantly building upon and linking to the work of others.

The Open Content model also brings into place a community of givers and receivers who see themselves as linked within chains of reciprocity.  So, while the formal trappings of the exclusivity of property may not exist, this does not mean that the social norms and etiquette governing relationships of creation and use within Open Content communities do not exist.  The gift economy may, therefore, be a useful way of characterizing relations in Open Content projects.  The gift is a fascinating phenomenon marked by complex relationships of reciprocities, and the idea that there is no such thing as a free gift is true, though not in the monetary sense of the term.  The giving and taking of a gift sets in chain a complex relationship of reciprocity, where a gift transaction is always incomplete until the person receiving the gift has also given the gift back.  While the relationship of reciprocity may be between the gift giver and the gift taker, it is certainly not restricted only to them.  The exchange of the gift actually brings into play an economy of circulation, which includes a wider network of participation by members of the community.

The Raqs Media Collective says that:

''The gift is something freely given, and taken, as in free code.  Gift givers and gift takers are bound in networks of random or pre-meditated acts of symbolic exchange. The code begets the gift as the form of its own survival over time.  In this way a gift is a quiet meme.  Reciprocity begets reciprocity.  The principle of the gift demands that the things being given be price-less, in other words so valuable as to be impossibe to quantify in terms of the possibilities of abstract generalized exchange.{{focref|54}}''

What was unique about the FOSS model was that it used the copyright regime for the first time to express this aspect of collaborative production, and also afford it protection to ensure that it remained within the public domain.  Having gotten rid of the heavy burden of the myth of copyright, the challenge was then to translate the terms of the GNU GPL into other models of creative licensing would enable people to ct as collaborators / producers rather than merely as passive users, and also ensure that there is a rich public domain of materials that people can use and build on for the future.

|-
|Wikipedia is a global and multilingual web-based cooperative free-content encyclopedia.
It exists as a wiki, a type of website that allows visitors to edit its content; the word
Wikipedia itself is a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia and is often abbreviated to WP
by its users.Wikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers, allowing most articles to be
changed by anyone with access to a computer,web browser and Internet connection.
The project began on 15 January 2001 as a complement to the expert-written (and now
defunct) Nupedia, and is now operated by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation.Wikipedia
has more than 3,800,000 articles in many languages, including more than 1,154,000 in the
English-language version. Since its inception,Wikipedia has steadily risen in popularity and
has spawned several sister projects.55
Wikipedia combines two core characteristics: First, it uses a collaborative authorship tool, a
wiki. This platform enables anyone, including anonymous passers-by, to edit almost any
page in the entire project. It stores all versions, makes changes easily visible, and enables
anyone to revert a document to any prior version as well as to add changes, small and
large. All contributions and changes are rendered transparent by the software and
database. Second, it is a self-conscious effort at creating an encyclopedia – governed first
and foremost by a collective informal undertaking to strive for a neutral point of view,
within the limits of substantial self-awareness as to the difficulties of such an enterprise.56

It is important to note that the Wikipedia has also answered one of the usual criticisms against Open Content projects, namely, the question of the reliability of the information of knowledge that is produced.  The journal Nature compared science articles from Wikipedia to the gold standard of the Encyclopædia Britannica and concluded that &quot;the differene in accuracy was not particularly great.&quot;{{focref|57}}

==The Public Domain==

We have been using the idea of the public domain.  What exactly do we mean by that?  For the purposes of understanding cultural production, the public domain could be understood as the body of works to which we have access to create newer works.  Thus, while Shakespeare was a brilliant playwright, we should also remember the fact that he drew rather liberally from various sources, from history, mythology and the works of his peers, etc. as inspiration and as sources to modify.  Similarly, even Walt Disney had a rich variety of sources from which he could draw from to make his cartoon versions of Fantasia, Steamboat Willie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, etc.  This public domain has also often been referred to through the metaphor of the &quot;commons&quot; - resources that are not divided into individual bits of property but rather are jointly held so that anyone may use them without special permission.  Think of public streets, parks, waterways, outer space, and creative works in the public domain - all of these things are, in a way, sub-set of the commons.{{focref|58}}

|The idea that a cultural good can be marked as an ‘original’, that it is therefore of higher
value, is in turn premised on the idea that goods once sold (or purchased, or in any other
way transacted) perish, at least in an economic sense.Here, it is held that the transaction,
and the transference of ownership onto the person of the consumer that it entails,
‘consumes’ the value of the good. It is as if the life of a thing is short-circuited when it is
sold. It can no longer enter the chain of circulation (except at a diminished value) as a
thing that could be used for different purposes by different people.Hence,once bought,
an object becomes,‘second-hand’,‘used’,‘depreciated’ or in some general sense,‘degraded’.
While this may be true of some material goods, (and is strictly true only for rapidly
perishable goods) it is difficult to imagine how it can be true for non-material goods
today – a recording of sounds or images, an arrangement of text or numbers, or a piece
of software, loses nothing when it is reproduced, or is passed on from one user to another
in a digital environment.With the arrival of digital encoding of information, it no longer
makes sense to distinguish between an original (which attains only the status of an
event, or an instance of its first emergence) and a copy, because the act of making of
copies in and of itself need not involve any perceivable loss of information.
In fact, with each instance of a data object moving from person to person, the information
content contained within it may actually increase. It does not make sense to speak of
‘end users’ of digital information; rather it would be more accurate to speak of custodians
who nurture pieces of information when they receive them, as part of a networked
community of receivers who are also always givers – of users, who are also potentially, if
not actually, producers. Thus, each person who becomes a custodian of the ‘material’ has
the possibility of adding to it something that was not present before, before passing on a
copy. It is in this way for instance,that ever-lengthening playlists of music make their way
from hand to hand, or rather between disc to disc in a community of aficionados.
There is nothing new in this process.The epics, stories, songs and sagas that represent in
some ways the collective heritage of humanity have survived only because their
custodians took care not to lock them into a system of ‘end usage’, and embellished
them, adding to their health and vitality, before passing them on to others.When codes
or languages closed in on themselves, allowing no ‘interpolations’ or trespasses after a
point, they rapidly haemorrhaged.However, the contemporary digital environment does
tend to give to this process an unprecedented velocity. Unlike commodities, gifts can
accrue value to themselves as they pass from one person to another in a network of gift
exchange.

== Open/Collaborative Production and its Advantages ==

It is as a response to the shrinking of the public domain through stronger enforcement of copyright laws that the FOSS and Open Content movements have emerged.  What are some of the benefits of licensing works on an Open Content model rather than relying on the traditional copyright model?  There may be a number of reasons and advantages for wanting to do so.{{focref|59}}

* For most artists, musicians or designers who are not already established, the easiest way to make a name for yourself is by ensuring that your work is sen by a large number of people, and by a wide range of audiences, as this helps to popularize your work, and establish your reputation.  Open Content licenses enable your work to circulate in a much wider manner than if there were restrictions on the work.  Apart from making you more visible, this model of distribution also enables you to obtain more shows, more work, sponsorship, etc. The English music group Thermal and a Quarter based in Bangalore, for instance, have made their albums available online for people to download, to enable their fans to listen to them and attend more of their shows.

* Since the model of distribution relies, more often than not on a P2P system of sharing, it cuts out significant costs in terms of a middleman, an agent or a gallery who act as distributors.  This is a system in which people can often contact the content creator directly rather than having to go through an institution of an individual who mediates on their behalf.  Often creators who are struggling to establish themselves have no bargaining power with publishers, record companies, etc. since they do not have the ability to distribute on their own.  The Open Content model, combined with the powers of the internet, is a great way for someone to establish themselves without having to rely on the big business model of authors and artists.

* The value of value - added distribution: One of the major advantages of using an Open Content model arises when you are looking at the distribution process not merely as the distribution of a final end product but also as a way of harnessing extra support and labour in projects which require, for instance, value-added contributions.  An instance of this is &quot;Distributed Proofreading.&quot; Originally unaffiliated with Project Gutenberg, the site is devoted to proofing Project Gutenberg e-texts more efficiently by distributing the volunteer proofreading function in smaller and more information - rich modules.{{focref|60}}

* More often than not, people do not create content only for monetary reasons. They do it to express themselves, to share their works, to get an idea across, etc. In such cases, by licensing the work through an Open Content license, you have the ability to reach out to a much larger group of people as people can freely use your work, and distribute your work without the fear of violating your copyright.

* But leaving aside the romance of altruism, assuming that you do want to make money out of your work, it is important to remember that Free / Open Content is not inconsistent with the abiliy for you to charge for your work.  The licensing model allows enough flexibility for you to determine the manner in which you will license the use of your work.  For instance, while you may allow for academic uses and other not-for-profit use (or even charge for them), you could reserve the right to any commercial usage (such as distributing copies of a book for sale, or using a design on a t-shirt or website).  Thus, you will still be able to charge for such usage.

* There are also cases of relatively unknown part-time musicians such as Allan Vilhan from Slovakia, working under the name Cargo Cult, who made his group's music available online for free and receives donations from people who have enjoyed the music (this and many similar stories are available at the Creative Commons website, http://creativecommons.org).

* The Internet model of distribution may seem like a disaster for large content companies or already-established artists (even that is contestable), but for emerging artists or creators who do not hve access to a great deal of capital investment, the Internet is truly a god-send in terms of its ability to reach out to a large number of people at a relatively low cost.

*There have been some recent examples of how people make their works available for free online, and yet this has not affected their offline sales.  Science fiction author Cory Doctorow took advantage of this trend when he released an online version of his book, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom simultaneously with a print version of the book.  The print version has done very well; in fact, it could even be argued that the print version has sold better as a result of the book having been distributed for free.  This is very similar to allowing people to browse through a book in a shop before they decide whether they want to buy it.

* More and more people are realizing the value of collaborative content creation. By making their works available not only to a larger community of users but also a larger community of creators, they also realize that there is a value that is added to their work.  Most Open Content licenses demand a detailed recording of the process of authorship, and every use of your work is also at the same time a record of your authorship.  There is therefore a very significant attempt to move away from the binaries of originals and copies, to the idea of a rescension, a version or a re-mix that is neither a copy nor an original but instead a work that builds on existing work and yet has an autonomy of its own.

|-
! colspan=1 | '''Rescension'''
|-
|A re-telling, a word taken to signify the simultaneous existence of different versions of
a narrative within oral, and from now onwards, digital cultures.Thus one can speak of a
‘southern’ or a ‘northern’ rescension of a myth, or of a ‘female’ or ‘male’ rescension of a
story, or the possibility (to begin with) of Delhi/Berlin/Tehran ‘rescensions’ of a digital
work. The concept of rescension is contraindicative of the notion of hierarchy.
A rescension cannot be an improvement, nor can it connote a diminishing of value. A
rescension is that version which does not act as a replacement for any other
configuration of its constitutive materials. The existence of multiple rescensions is a
guarantor of an idea or a work’s ubiquity.This ensures that the constellation of narrative,
signs and images that a work embodies is present, and waiting for iteration at more
than one site at any given time. Rescensions are portable and are carried within
orbiting kernels within a space. Rescensions, taken together, constitute ensembles that
may form an interconnected web of ideas, images and signs.61

* Some people may want to use the open licenses model for distributing their content simply because they are tired of the monopoly of the content industry and the limitations of the system of copyright.  Thus, the idea of being able to contribute to an intellectual commons may seem highly attractive.  Some people may be attracted by the notion of others building upon their work, or by the prospect of contributing to an intellectual commons.

* This idealism has not only inflicted young people who are used to an age of access, but even established stars like George Michael, who recently announced that he was not going to produce any commercial music in the future and that all of his music in the future will be available for free via the Internet.

* Very often, we forget that a lot of content owners - especially those in the world of academia or artists who benefit from endorsement grants from public bodies - are actually producing intellectual property using public resources.  In such case, it is important for us to start thinking in terms of &quot;public intellectual property for public money.&quot;

|'''A Case For using Open Content by Documentary Film Makers'''&lt;br&gt;
Copyright licensing makes the acquisition or use of a pre-existing work very expensive.
If copyright owners have their way, then as a film maker, you may have to obtain a
hundred copyright permissions before you use any music, clip, etc. while making your
own film. Think about your own experiences. If you had to pay for every time you
wanted to use a clip or a song, how much would that add to your overhead?
A cautionary take: In 1990, Jon Else, an American documentary film maker was working
on a documentary about Wagner’s ‘Ring Cycle’. The focus was stage-hands at the San
Francisco Opera.Stage-hands are a particularly funny and colourful element of an opera.
During a show, they hang out below the stage in the grips’ lounge and in the lighting
loft.They make a perfect contrast to the art on the stage.
During one of the performances, Else was shooting some stage-hands playing checkers.
In one corner of the room was a television set.While the stage-hands played checkers
and the opera company played Wagner,‘The Simpsons’ was playing on the television set.
Else thought this shot would be great to use and he went ahead and shot it; he then
decided to obtain permission to use the four-second clip from the owners of the
copyright of ‘The Simpsons. While Matt Groening, the creator, did not have a problem,he
did not own the copyright. However, Gracie Films, the owner, demanded that he pay
them $10,000 for the use of the four seconds.&lt;br&gt;
Else obviously could not afford to pay Gracie Films.He could have gone ahead and used
the clip, and it would have fallen under his ‘fair use’ right to do so. But this was too risky
given that Gracie Films had a record of pursuing copyright infringement cases, and the
average costs of defending a law suit in the US is $250,000.
The situation in the US is pretty bleak now, and any documentary film maker submitting
a film to a broadcast organization has to get copyright clearances for all materials used,
otherwise they refuse to broadcast the film.This sounds almost like countries where you
have to obtain a censor certificate for films before broadcast.
So why should documentary film makers start taking the Free Software movement
seriously and think about similar licensing models for their works, as well as the very idea
of collaborative production for the future?&lt;br&gt;

Here are some sound reasons:&lt;br&gt;
'''Distribution is a major headache''': One of the biggest problems faced by documentary
film makers has been the question of circulation and distribution.
If the work were available freely (note, this does not mean that you cannot charge for the
documentary, but means that a person who has bought a copy may make a copy and
distribute it to others), there would be a far greater circulation of documentaries
amongst other film makers, students, activists, scholars and general public.
It is a fact that, currently, if you want to access documentaries, then you either have to
approach the film maker or approach a non-governmental organization that keeps
documentaries. Greater availability will ensure greater distribution and subsequently
promote documentary film viewership.&lt;br&gt;
'''If you have no problem, say so''': I am sure that most documentary film makers do not
mind if people circulate their work, but it is important to remember that unless you state
explicitly that people have a right to do so or to otherwise use your work, it is presumed
that they do not have the right.
In that sense, copyright by default applies to your work, which is why it is important to
start thinking in terms of a proactive licensing policy that allows people to use your
work.&lt;br&gt;
'''You do not have to waive all your rights''': There may be one or two immediate
concerns that arise. If I make my work available, isn’t there a danger that someone will
use my materials and pass them off as their own work? &lt;br&gt;
By licensing under an ‘Open Content’ license, you do not waive all your rights as the
author of the work. It is really up to you to determine the nature of the usage involved.
For instance, you could have a license that allows the work only to be copied for
non-profit purposes (thus, I would not be able to make a hundred copies of your work
and then start selling them for profit). Similarly, by licensing under an Open Content
license,you do not loose your other rights, such as the right to be identified as the author
of the work, and so on. You may or may not allow someone to modify the work or use
significant portions.&lt;br&gt;
'''Film makers do not live off of royalties''': More importantly is the fact that most
documentary film makers do not live off royalty earnings in any case. Their films are
either commissioned or they earn some money from various prizes, invitations and the like.
So, fear of lost revenue cannot be a very serious one.But apart from the film maker’s fear
of potential revenue loss is a more important issue.When a film maker is commissioned
to make a film, it is important to ask where that money comes from. If the money comes
from public funding, there should be no reason why the film should then become the
private property of an individual film maker.
Let’s assume that the money that is provided for the film is not that great and cannot be
measured in terms of the efforts that the film maker has put in. It is important to
acknowledge that the film maker still benefits in terms of experience, credits,
recognition, future assignments, etc.&lt;br&gt;
'''Film-making is collaborative by nature''': Copyright’s myth of the individual creator
genius is perhaps more violently expressed in film-making. Film-making, as we all know,
is perhaps one of the most collaborative of the arts, and the amount of diverse labour
that goes into it is incredible.
Yet, for the purposes of copyright, the author of the film is considered to be a single
individual, namely, the producer of the film. To its credit, the system of credits in
film-making, especially in feature film, still recognizes this process of joint authorship.
Another issue, of course, is to recognize the hundreds and thousands of influences and
inspirations that have gone into our own films.We need to work beyond the assumed
myths of copyright law, and develop alternative practices that recognize the
multiplicity that goes into the making of a film.&lt;br&gt;
When this principle is extended to the making of films, we can start thinking in terms of
the great benefit that making film footage available has on film-making itself. I think at this
point we really need to laud the efforts taken by a few documentary film makers post the
riots in Gujarat in which thousands of Muslims were killed, in the form of the shared
footage project. Given that documentary film makers in India are a small
community, it is important to start thinking in terms of the benefits of collaboration, prime
among which will obviously be vast amounts of footage available to be used.&lt;br&gt;
'''Copyright increasingly threatens creativity''': If copyright is increasingly threatening
creativity, then one of the means of protecting this creativity is by ensuring that we take
proactive steps that build towards an ethic of the public domain in our own practices as well.
One thing is sure: the digital revolution has arrived.You have more and more people from
non-film making backgrounds who want to experiment with films, use them in the course
of their work, etc. In that sense, the media and the medium is no longer external to any of
our practices.
At some level, whether we are academics or lawyers or activists, we all have to start
thinking of ourselves as media professionals as well.And the great thing that digital media
has done is that it has enabled almost any person to become a low-cost production studio.&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* Kinds of Test Scores */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to understand test results from standardized tests it is important to be familiar with a variety of terms and concepts that are fundamental to “measurement theory” -  the  academic study of measurement and assessment. Two major areas in measurement theory - reliability and validity were discussed in the previous chapter; in this chapter we focus on concepts and terms associated with test scores.
 
==Basic Concepts about Standardized Measurement==

===Frequency Distributions===
A '''frequency distribution''' is a listing of the number of students who obtained each score on a test. If 31 students take a test, and the scores range from 11 to 30 then the frequency distribution might look like [[Table 11-2.]] We also show the same set of scores on a histogram or bar graph in [[Figure 11-5.]] The horizontal (or ''x axis'') represents the score on the test and the vertical axis (''y axis'') represents the number or frequency of students. Plotting a frequency distribution helps us see what scores are typical and how much variability there are in the scores. We describe more precise ways of determining typical scores and variability next.  

===Central tendency and Variability===
There are three common ways of measuring central tendency or which score(s) are typical. The '''mean''' is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. In the example 11-2 the mean is 24. The '''median''' is the “middle” score of the distribution – that is half of the scores are above the median and half are below. The median on the distribution is 23 because 15 scores are above 23 and 15 are below. The '''mode''' is the score that occurs most often. In [[Table 11-2]] there are actually two modes 22 and 27 and so this distribution is described as bimodal. Calculating the mean, median and mode are important as each provides different information for teachers. The median represents the score of the “middle” students, with half scoring above and below, but does not tell us about the scores on the test that occurred most often. The mean is important for some statistical calculations but is highly influenced by a few extreme scores (called outliers) but the median is not. To illustrate this, imagine a test out of 20 points taken by 10 students, and most do very well but one student does very poorly. The scores might be 4, 18, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20. The mean is 17.5 (170/10) but if the lowest score (4) is eliminated the mean is now is 1.5 points higher at 19 (171/9). However, in this example the median remains at 19 whether the lowest sore is included. When there are some extreme scores the median is often more useful for teachers in indicating the central tendency of the frequency distribution.
  
The measures of central tendency help us summarize scores that are representative, but they do tell us anything about how variable or how spread out are the scores. [[Figure 11-6]] illustrates sets of scores from two different schools on the same test for 4th graders. Note that the mean for each is 40 but in school A the scores are much less spread out. A simple way to summarize variability is the '''range,''' which is the lowest score subtracted from the lowest score. In  School A with low variability the range is (45 – 35) = 10; in the school B the range is ( 55-22 = 33. However, the range is only based on two scores in the distribution, the highest and lowest scores, and so does not represent variability in all the scores. The '''standard deviation''' is based on  how much, on average,  all the scores deviate from the mean. In the example in [[Figure 11-3]] the standard deviations are 7.73 for School A and 2.01for School B. In [[Figure 11-7]] we demonstrate how to calculate the standard deviation.  

'''The Normal Distribution'''
Knowing the standard deviation is particularly important when the distribution of the scores falls on a normal distribution. When a standardized test is administered to a very large number of students the distribution of scores is typically similar, with many students scoring close to the mean, and fewer scoring much higher or lower than the mean. When the distribution of scores looks like the bell shape shown [[Figure 11-8]] it is called a '''normal distribution.''' In the diagram we did not draw in the scores of individual students as we did in [[Figure 11-6]], because distributions typically only fall on a ''normal curve'' when there are a large number of students--too many to show individually. An ideal normal distribution is symmetric, and the mean, median and mode are all the same. Real sets of test scores only approximate the ideal normal distribution, so the mean, median, and mode usually differ at least slightly.  

Normal curve distributions are very important in education and psychology because of the relationship between the mean, standard deviation, and percentiles. In all normal distributions 34% of the scores fall between the mean and one standard deviation of the mean. Intelligence tests often are constructed to have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15 and we illustrate that in figure 11-9. In this example, 34% of the scores are between 100 and 115 and as well, 34% of the scores lie between 85 and 100. This means that 68% of the scores are between -1 and +1 standard deviations of the mean (i.e. 85 and 115). Note than only 14 % of the scores are between +1 and +2 standard deviations of the mean and only 2% fall above +2standard deviations of the mean.  

In a normal distribution a student who scores the mean value is always in the 50th percentile because the mean and median are the same. A score of +1 standard deviation above the mean (e.g. 115 in the example above) is the 84tile (50% and 34% of the scores were below 115). In [[Figure 11-10]] we represent the percentile equivalents to the normal curve and we also show ''standard scores''.

===Kinds of Test Scores===
A '''standard score''' expresses performance on a test in terms of standard deviation units above of below the mean (Linn &amp; Miller, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. L., &amp; Miller, M. D. (2005). ''Measurement and Assessment in Teaching, 9th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ:  Pearson . &lt;/ref&gt;. There are a variety of standard scores:
====Z-score====
One type of standard score is a ''z-score,'' in which the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This means that a z-score tells us directly how many standard deviations the score is above or below the mean. For example, if a student receives a z score of 2 her score is two standard deviations above the mean or the 84th percentile. A student receiving a z score of -1.5 scored one and one half deviations below the mean. Any score from a normal distribution can be converted to a z score if the mean and standard deviation is known. The formula is 

:'''''Z score''' = (Score – mean score)/(Standard deviation)''

So if the score is 130, the mean is 100, and the standard deviation is 15, then the formula leads to this calculation:

:'''''Z''' = (130 – 100)/15  = 2'' 

If you look at [[Figure 11-9]], you can see that this is correct; a score of 130 is 2 standard deviations above the mean. So the z score is 2.

====T score====
A '''T-score''', by definition, has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. This means that a T score of 70 is two standard deviations above the mean and so is equivalent to a z score of 2.

====Stanines====
Stanines (pronounced ''stay-nines'') are often used for reporting students’ scores and is based on a standard nine point scale and with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. They are only reported as whole numbers and [[Figure 11-10]] shows their relation to the normal curve.

===Grade Equivalent Scores===
A '''grade equivalent score''' provides an estimate of test performance based on grade level and months of the school year (Popham, 2005, p. 288)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2005). ''America’s “failing” schools. How parents and teachers can cope with No Child Left Behind.'' New York: Routledge Falmer. &lt;/ref&gt;. A grade equivalent score of 3.7 means the performance is at that expected of a 3rd grade student in the 7th month of the school year. Grade equivalents provide a continuing range of grade levels and so can be considered developmental scores. Grade equivalent scores are popular and seem easy to understand however they are typically misunderstood. If, James, 4th-grade student, takes a reading test and the grade equivalent score is 6.0 this does ''not'' mean that James can do 6th-grade work. It means only that James performed on the 4th-grade test as a 6th-grade student is expected to. Testing publishers calculate grade equivalents by giving one test to several grade levels. For example, a test designed for 4th graders would also be given to 3rd and 5th graders. The resulting raw scores are plotted, and a &quot;trend line&quot; is established which is used to establish the grade equivalents. Note that in [[Figure 11-12]], the trend line extends beyond the grades levels actually tested so a grade equivalent above 5.0 or below 3.0 is based solely on the estimated trend lines.

Grade equivalent scores also assume that the subject matter that is being tested is emphasized at each grade level to the same amount and that mastery of the content accumulates at a mostly constant rate (Popham, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2005). erica’s “failing” schools. How parents and teachers can cope with No Child Left Behind. New York: Routledge Falmer.''&lt;/ref&gt;. Many testing experts warn that grade equivalent scores should be interpreted with considerable skepticism and that parents often have serous misconceptions about grade equivalent scores. Parents of high achieving students may have an inflated sense of what their child’s levels of achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people have very strong views about the role of standardized tests in education. Some believe they provide an unbiased way to determine an individual’s cognitive skills as well as the quality of a school or district. Others believe that scores from standardized tests are capricious, do not represent what students know, and are misleading when used for accountability purposes. Many educational psychologists and testing experts have nuanced views and make distinctions between the information standardized tests ''can'' provide about students’ performances, and how the tests results are ''interpreted and used''. In this more complex view, many of the problems associated with standardized tests arise from their high stakes ''use,'' such as determining selection into educational programs, eligibility for graduation or for licensure, or publicizing the &quot;success&quot; of a school as high vs. low performing.  

===Are Standardized Tests Biased?===
In a multicultural society one crucial question is, are standardized tests biased against certain social class, racial, or ethnic groups? This question is much more complicated than it seems because ''bias'' has a variety of meanings. An everyday meaning of the term often refers to the fairness of standardized test results for predicting future performance of disadvantaged students who may have previously had few educational resources. For example, should Dwayne, a high school student who worked hard but had limited educational opportunities because of the poor schools in his neighborhood and few educational resources in his home, be denied graduation from high school because of his score on one test? It was not his fault that he did not have the educational resources, and if given a change with a change his environment (e.g., by going to college), his performance may improve significantly. Viewed this way, standardized test scores reflect societal inequalities and can therefore punish students who are less privileged. The scores can also be interpreted erroneously as reflecting students' fixed inherited capacities.

Educational researchers, however, typically consider bias in three more technical ways: item content and format; accuracy of predictions, and stereotype threat. These ideas have special meanings not necessarily shared in everyday conversations about testing.

===Item Content and Format===
Test items may be harder for some groups than others. An example of social class bias in a multiple choice item asked students the meaning of the term ''field.'' The students were asked to read the initial sentence in italics and then select the response that had the same meaning of field (Popham  2004, p. 24)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2004). ''America’s “failing” schools. How parents and teachers can cope with No Child Left Behind.'' New York: Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;:
  
:''My Dad’s field is computer graphics''
::''A. The pitcher could field his position''
::''B. We prepared the field by plowing it''
::''C. The doctor examined my field of vision''
::''D. What field will you enter after college?''

Children of professionals are more likely to understand this meaning of field as doctors, journalists and lawyers have “fields” whereas cashiers and maintenance workers have jobs so their children are less likely to know this meaning of field. (The correct answer is supposed to be D).

Testing companies try to minimize these kinds of content problems by having test developers from a variety of backgrounds review items and also examining statistically if certain groups find some items easier or harder. However, problems do exist and a recent analyses of the verbal SAT tests indicated that Whites tend to scores better on easy items whereas African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans score better on hard items (Freedle, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Freedle, R. O. (2003). Correcting the SAT’s ethnic and social–class bias: A method for reestimating SAT scores. ''Harvard Educational Review, 73''(1), 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt;. While these differences are not large, they can influence test scores. Researchers think that the easy items involving words that are used in every day conversation may have subtly different meanings in different subcultures whereas the hard words (e.g., vehemence, sycophant) are not used in every conversation and so do not have these variations in meaning. Test format can also influence test performance. Females typically score better at essay questions and when the SAT recently added an essay component, the females overall SAT verbal scores improved relative to males (Hoover, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, E. (2006, October 21). SAT scores see largest dip in 31 years. ''Chronicle of Higher Education, 53''(10), A1.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Accuracy of Predictions===
Standardized tests are used among other criteria to determine who will be admitted to selective colleges. This practice is justified by predictive validity evidence – i.e., that scores on the ACT or SAT are used to predict first year college grades. Recent studies have demonstrated that the predictions for Black and Latino students are less accurate than for White students and that predictors for female students are less accurate than male students (Young, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. W. (2004). Differential validity and prediction: Race and sex differences in college admissions testing. In R. Zwick (Ed). ''Rethinking the SAT: The future of standardized testing in university admissions'' (pp. 289-301). New York: Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, perhaps surprisingly the test scores tend to slightly over predict success in college for Black and Latino students, i.e., these students are likely to attain lower freshman grade point averages than predicted by their test scores. In contrast, test scores tend to slightly under predict success in college for female students, i.e., these students are likely to attain higher freshman grade point averages than predicted by their test scores. Researchers are not sure why there are differences in how accurately the SAT and ACT test predict freshman grades

===Stereotype Threat===
Groups that are negatively stereotyped in some area, such as women’s performance in mathematics, are in danger of stereotype threat, i.e., concerns that others will view them through the negative or stereotyped lens (Aronson &amp; Steele, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, J., &amp; Steele, C. M. (2005). Stereotypes and the Fragility of Academic Competence, Motivation, and Self-Concept. In  A. J. Elliott &amp; C. S. Dweck (Eds.). ''Handbook of competence and motivation.'' (pp.436-456) Guilford Publications, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have suggested that test performance of stereotyped groups (e.g., African-Americans, Latinos, women) ''declines'' when it is emphasized to those taking the test that (1) the test is high stakes, (2) measures intelligence or math, or (3) they are reminded of their ethnicity, race or gender (e.g., by asking them before the test to complete a brief demographic questionnaire). Even if individuals believe they are competent, stereotype threat can reduce working memory capacity because individuals are trying to suppress thee negative stereotypes. Stereotype threat seems particularly strong for those individuals who desire to perform well. Standardized test scores of individuals from stereotyped groups may significantly underestimate actual their competence in low-stakes testing situations.  

===Do Teachers Teach to the Tests?===
There is evidence that schools and teachers adjust the curriculum so it reflects what is on the tests and also prepare students for the format and types of items on the test. Several surveys of elementary school teachers indicated that more time was spend on mathematics and reading and less on social studies and sciences in 2004 than 1990 (Jerald, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jerald, C. D (2006,August). ''The Hidden costs of curriculum narrowing: Issue brief.'' Washington DC: The Center for Comprehensive School Reform and Improvement. Accessed  November 21, 2006 from [[http://www.centerforcsri.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Principals in high minority enrollment schools in four states reported in 2003 that had reduced time spend on the arts. Recent research in cognitive science suggests that reading comprehension in a subject (e.g. science or social studies) requires that students understand a lot of vocabulary and background knowledge in that subject (Recht &amp; Leslie, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;Recht, D. R. &amp; Leslie, L. (1988). Effect of prior knowledge on good and poor readers’ memory of text. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 80'', 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;. This means that even if students gain good reading skills they will find learning science and social studies difficult if little time has been spend on these subjects.
  
Taking a test with an unfamiliar format can be difficult so teachers help students prepare for specific test formats and items (e.g., double negatives in multiple choice items; constructed response). (At the beginning of this chapter, for example, a middle school teacher, Erin, and a Principal, Dr Mucci described the test preparation emphasis in their schools.) There is growing concern that the amount of test preparation that is now occurring in schools is excessive and students are not being educated but trained to do tests (Popham, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2006). Educator cheating on No Child Left Behind Tests. Educational Week, 25(32) 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;.
  
===Do Students and Educators Cheat?===
It is difficult to obtain good data on how widespread cheating is but we know that students taking tests cheat and others, including test administrators, help them cheat (Cizek, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Cizek, G. J. (2003). ''Detecting and preventing classroom cheating: Promoting integrity in assessment.'' Corwin Press, Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;. Steps to prevent cheating by students include protecting the security of tests, making sure students understand the administration procedures, preventing students from bringing in their notes or unapproved electronic devices as well as looking at each others' answers. Some teachers and principals have been caught using unethical test preparation practices such as giving actual test items to students just before the tests, giving students more time than is allowed, answering students’ questions about the test items, and actually changing students’ answers (Popham, 2006). Concerns in Texas about cheating led to the creation of an independent task force in August 2006 with 15 staff members from the Texas Education Agency assigned investigate test improprieties. (Jacobson, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, L. (2006). Probing Test irregularities: Texas launches inquiry into cheating on exams. Education Week, 28(1), 28&lt;/ref&gt;. While the pressure on schools and teachers to have their student perform well is large, these practices are clearly unethical and have lead to school personnel being fired from their jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Communication in Classrooms ''vs.'' Communication Elsewhere==
Classroom events are often so complex that just talking with students can become confusing. It helps to think of the challenge as a problem in '''communication'''—or as one expert put it, of ''“who says what to whom, and with what effect”'' (Lasswell, 1964)&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1964). The structure and function of communication in society. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''Mass communications.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In classrooms, things often do not happen at an even pace or in a logical order, or with just the teacher and one student interacting while others listen or wait patiently. While such moments do occur, events may sometimes instead be more like a kaleidoscope of overlapping interactions, disruptions, and decision—even when activities are generally going well. One student finishes a task while another is still only half-way done. A third student looks like she is reading, but she may really be dreaming. You begin to bring her back on task by speaking to her, only to be interrupted by a fourth student with a question about an assignment. While you answer the fourth student, a fifth walks in with a message from the office requiring a response; so the bored (third) student is overlooked awhile longer. Meanwhile, the first student—the one who finished the current task—now begins telling a joke to a sixth student, just to pass the time. You wonder, “Should I speak now to the bored, quiet reader or to the joke-telling student? Or should I move on with the lesson?” While you are wondering this, a seventh student raises his hand with a question. And so on.

One way to manage situations like these is to understand and become comfortable with the key features of communication that are characteristic of classrooms. One set of features has to do with the functions or purposes of communication, especially the balance among talk related to content, to procedures, and to controlling behavior. Another feature has to do with the nature of nonverbal communication—how it supplements and sometimes even contradicts what is said verbally. A third feature has to do with the unwritten expectations held by students and teachers about how to participate in particular kinds of class activities—what we will later call the structure of participation.

===Functions of Talk: Content, Procedures, and Behavior Control===
Classrooms are different from many other group situations in that communication serves a unique combination of three purposes at once: content, procedures, or behavior control (Wells, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Wells, G. (2006). The language experience of children at home and at school. In J. Cook-Gumperz (Ed.), ''The social construction of literacy, 2nd edition,'' 76-109. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Content talk''' focuses on what is being learned; it happens when a teacher or student states or asks about an idea or concept, for example, or when someone explains or elaborates on some bit of new knowledge (Burns &amp; Myhill, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Burns, C. &amp; Myhill, D. (2004). Interactive or inactive? A consideration of the nature of interaction in whole-class instruction. ''Cambridge Journal of Education, 34''(1), 35-49.&lt;/ref&gt;. Usually content talk relates in some obvious way to the curriculum or to current learning objectives, as when a teacher tells a high school history class, “As the text explains, there were several major causes of the American Civil War.” But content talk can also digress from the current learning objectives; a first-grade student might unexpectedly bring a caterpillar to school and ask about how it transforms into a butterfly.

'''Procedural talk,''' as its name implies, is about administrative rules or routines needed to accomplish tasks in a classroom. It happens, for example, when the teacher says, “When you are done with your spelling books, put them in the bins at the side of the room,” or when a student asks, “Do you want us to print our names at the top of page?” Procedural talk provides information that students need to coordinate their activities in what can be a relatively crowded space—the classroom—and under conditions in which time may be relatively short or tightly scheduled. It generally keeps activities organized and flowing smoothly. Procedural talk is not primarily about removing or correcting unwanted behavior, even though certain administrative procedures might sometimes annoy a particular student, or even though students might sometimes forget to follow a procedure. Instead it is intended to provide the guidance that students need to coordinate with each other and with the teacher.

'''Control talk''' is about preventing or correcting misbehaviors when they occur, particularly when the misbehaviors are not because of ignorance of procedures. It happens, for example, when a teacher says, “Jill, you were talking when you should have been listening,” or “Jason, you need to work on your math instead of doodling.” Most control talk originates with the teacher, but students sometimes engage in it with each other, if not with the teacher. One student may look at a nearby classmate who is whispering out of turn and quietly say, “Shhh!” in an attempt to silence the behavior. Or a student may respond to being teased by a classmate by saying simply, “Stop it!” Whether originating from the teacher or a student, control talk may not always be fully effective. But its purpose is, by definition, to influence or control inappropriate behavior. Since control talk is obviously important for managing class effectively, we discussed it at length in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation|Chapter 6]].

What can make classroom discourse confusing is that two of its functions—content and procedures—often become combined with the third, control talk, in the same remark or interaction. A teacher may ask a content-related question, for example, as a form of control talk. She may, for example, ask, “Jeremy, what did you think of the film we just saw?” The question is apparently about content, but the teacher may also be trying to end Jeremy’s daydreaming and to get him back on task—an example of control talk. Or a teacher may state a rule, “When one person is talking, others need to be listening.” The rule is procedural in that it helps to coordinate classroom dialogue, but it may also control inattentive behavior. Double functions like these can sometimes confuse students because of their ambiguity, and lead to misunderstandings between certain students and teachers. A student may hear only the content or procedural function of a teacher’s comment, and miss an implied request or command to change inappropriate behavior (Collins &amp; Michaels, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.
Collins, J. &amp; Michaels, S. (2006). Speaking and writing: Discourse strategies and the acquisition of literacy. In J. Cook-Gumperz (Ed.), ''The social construction of literacy, 2nd edition,'' pp. 245-263. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. But double functions can also help lessons to flow smoothly by minimizing the disruption of attending to a minor behavior problem and by allowing more continuous attention to content or procedures.

===Verbal, Nonverbal, and Unintended Communication===
Another way to understand classroom communication is to distinguish verbal from nonverbal communication, and intended both unintended forms of communication. As the name suggests, '''verbal communication''' is a message or information expressed in words, either orally or in writing. Classrooms obviously have lots of verbal communication; it happens every time a teacher explains a bit of content, asks a question, or writes information or instructions on the chalkboard. '''Non-verbal communication''' is any gesture or behavior that conveys information, often simultaneously with spoken words (Guerrero, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L. (2006). ''Nonverbal communication in close relationships.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. It happens, for example, when a teacher looks directly at students to emphasize a point or to assert her authority, or when the teacher raises her eyebrows to convey disapproval or disagreement. Nonverbal behaviors are just as plentiful as verbal communications, and while they usually add to a current verbal message, they sometimes can also contradict it. A teacher can state verbally, “This math lesson will be fun,” and a nonverbal twinkle in the eye can send the confirm message nonverbally. But a simultaneous nonverbal sigh or slouch may send the opposite message—that the lesson will not, in fact be fun, in spite of the teacher’s verbal claim.

Whether verbal or non-verbal, however, classroom communications often convey more meaning than is intended. '''Unintended communications''' are the excess meanings of utterances; they are the messages received by students without the teacher’s awareness or desire. A teacher may say, “This section of the text won’t be on the test, but read it anyway for background.” But a student may instead hear the message, “Do not read this section of the text.” What is heard is not what the teacher intended to be heard.

Like many public settings that involve a diversity of people, classrooms tend to rely heavily on explicit, verbal communication, while at the same time recognizing and allowing nonverbal communications to occur (Neill, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Neill, S. (1991). ''Classroom nonverbal communication.'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;. This priority accounts for the characteristically businesslike style of teacher talk—a style that we discuss in detail in the next chapter. A major reason for relying on an explicit, businesslike verbal style is that diversity among individuals increases the chances of their misinterpreting each other. Because of differences in background, the partners may differ in how they expect to structure conversation as well as other kinds of dialogue. Misunderstandings may result—sometimes without the partners being able to pinpoint the cause. Later in this chapter we suggest how to minimize these problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Effective Verbal Communication==
Communicating effectively requires using all forms of classroom talk in combinations appropriate for particular utterances and interactions. In various places earlier in this book, we have suggested ways of doing so, though in those places we usually did not frame the discussion around the term communication as such.

===Effective Content Talk===
In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]], for example, we suggested ways of talking about content so that it is most likely to be understood clearly, but in that chapter we described these as instructional strategies. In explaining ideas, for example, whether briefly or as a extended lecture, we pointed out that it helps to offer advance organizing ideas, to relate new content to prior knowledge, and to organize and elaborate on new information. In the same chapter, we also suggested strategies about content talk intended for students, so that students understand their own thinking as well as possible. We especially highlighted two: inquiry learning and cooperative learning.  [[Table 12-1]] summarizes instructional strategies both for students and for teachers, and indicates how they contribute to effective verbal communication about content.

===Effective Procedural and Control Talk===
In addition to communicating about content, teachers need to communicate procedures and expectations about appropriate classroom behavior. In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|Chapter 7]] we described quite a few ways to communicate with students about these matters, though, in that chapter we did not refer to them as methods of communication, but as methods of classroom management, of creating a positive learning environment, and of resolving conflicts in the class. ([[Table 12-2]] summarizes several of the major strategies described in that chapter.)  By framing communication in these ways, we called attention to their importance as forms of communication. As we pointed out earlier, procedural talk and control talk matter when teaching simply because clear procedures and appropriate classroom behavior if students are to learn.

===Effective Nonverbal Communication===
In spite of their importance, words are not the only way that teachers and students communicate. Gestures and behaviors convey information as well, often supporting a teacher’s words, but sometimes also contradicting them. Students and teachers express themselves nonverbally in all conversations, so freely and automatically in fact that this form of communication can easily be overlooked.

====Eye Contact====
One important nonverbal behavior is '''eye contact,''' which is the extent and timing of when a speaker looks directly at the eyes of the listener. In conversations between friends of equal status, for example, most native speakers of English tend to look directly at the speaker when listening, but to avert their gaze when speaking (Kleinke, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Kleinke, C. (1986). Gaze and eye contact: A research review. ''Psychological Bulletin, 100''(1), 78-100.&lt;/ref&gt;. Re-engaging eye contact, in fact, often signals that a speaker is about to finish a turn and is inviting a response from the listener.

But conversations follow different rules if they involve someone of greater authority talking with someone of lesser authority, such as between a teacher and a student. In that case, the person in authority signals greater status by gazing directly at the listener almost continuously, whether listening or speaking. This alternate pattern can sometimes prove awkward if either party is not expecting it. For students unused to continuous eye contact, it can feel like the teacher is staring excessively, intrusively, or inappropriately; an ironic effect can be for the student to feel more self-conscious rather than more engaged, as intended. For similar reasons, inexperienced or first-time teachers can also feel uncomfortable with gazing at students continuously. Nevertheless research about the effects of eye contact suggests that it may help anyone, whether a student or teacher, to remember what they are seeing and hearing (Mason, Hood, &amp; Macrae, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Mason, M., Hood, B., &amp; Macrae, C. (2004). Look into my eyes: Gaze direction and person memory. ''Memory, 12''(5), 637-643.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Communication problems result less from eye contact as such than from differences in expectations about eye contact. If students’ expectations differ very much from the teacher’s, one party may misinterpret the other party’s motivations. Among some non-White ethnic groups, for example, eye contact follows a pattern that reverses the conventional White, English-language pattern: they tend to look more intently at a partner when talking, and avert gaze when listening (Razack, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Razack, S. (1998). ''Looking White people in the eye: Gender, race, and culture in courtrooms and classrooms.'' Toronto, Ontario: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The alternative pattern works perfectly well as long as both parties expect it and use it. As you might imagine, though, there are problems if the two partners use opposite patterns of eye contact. In that case one person may interpret a direct gaze as an invitation to start talking, when really it is an invitation to stop talking. Eventually the conversational partner may find himself interrupting too much, or simply talking too long at a turn. The converse can also happen: if the first person looks away, the partner may take the gesture as inviting the partner to keep listening, when really the first person is inviting the partner to start talking. Awkward gaps between comments may result. In either case, if the conversational partners are a teacher and student, rapport may deteriorate gradually. In the first case, the teacher may even conclude, wrongly, that the student is socially inept because the student interrupts so much. In the second case, the teacher may conclude—also wrongly—that the student is very shy or even lacking in language skill.

To avoid such misunderstandings, a teacher needs to note and remember students’ preferred gaze patterns at times when students are free to look wherever and at whomever they please. Traditional seats-in-a-row desk arrangements do not work well for this purpose; as you might suppose, and as research confirms, sitting in rows makes students more likely to look either at the teacher or to look at nothing in particular (Rosenfeld, Lambert, &amp; Black, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, P., Lambert, N., &amp; Black, A. (1985). Desk arrangement effects on pupil classroom behavior. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 77''(1), 101-108.&lt;/ref&gt;. Almost any other seating arrangement, such as sitting in clusters or in a circle, encourages freer patterns of eye contact. More comfortable eye contact, in turn, makes for verbal communication that is more comfortable and productive.

===Wait Time===
Another important nonverbal behavior is '''wait time,''' which is the pause between conversational turns. Wait time marks when a conversational turn begins or ends. If a teacher asks a question, for example, the wait time both allows and prompts students to formulate an appropriate response. Studies of on classroom interaction generally show that wait times in most classes are remarkably short—less than one second (Good &amp; Brophy, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Good, T. &amp; Brophy, J. (2002). ''Looking in Classrooms, 9th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. Unfortunately wait times this short can actually interfere with most students’ thinking; in one second, most students either cannot decide what to say or can only recall a simple, automatic fact (Tobin, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, K. (1987). The role of wait time in higher cognitive functions. ''Review of Educational Research, 57''(1), 69-95.&lt;/ref&gt;. Increasing wait times to several seconds has several desirable effects: students give longer, more elaborate responses, they express more complex ideas, and a wider range of students participate in discussion. For many teachers, however, learning to increase wait time this much takes conscious effort, and may feel uncomfortable at first. (A helpful trick, if you are trying to wait longer, is to count silently to five before calling on anyone.) After a few weeks of practice, discomfort with longer wait times usually subsides, and the academic benefits of waiting become more evident.

As with eye contact, preferred wait times vary both among individuals and among groups of students, and the differences in expected wait times can sometimes lead to awkward conversations. Though there are many exceptions, girls tend to prefer longer wait times than boys—perhaps contributing to an impression that girls are unnecessarily shy or that boys are self-centered or impulsive. Students from some ethnic and cultural groups tend to prefer a much longer wait time than is typically available in a classroom, especially when English is the student’s second language (Toth, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Toth, P. (2004). When grammar instruction undermines cohesion in L2 Spanish classroom discourse. ''The Modern Language Journal, 88''(1), 14-30.&lt;/ref&gt;. When a teacher converses with a member of such a group, therefore, what feel to the student like a respectful pause may seem like hesitation or resistance to the teacher. Yet other cultural groups actually prefer overlapping comments—a sort of negative wait time. In these situations, one conversational partner will begin at exactly the same instant as the previous speaker, or even before the speaker has finished (Chami-Sather &amp; Kretschmer, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Chami-Sather, G. &amp; Kretschmer, R. (2005). Lebanese/Arabic and American children’s discourse in group-solving situations. ''Language and Education, 19''(1), 10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;. The negative wait time is meant to signal lively interest in the conversation. A teacher who is used to a one-second gap between comments, however, may regard overlapping comments as rude interruptions, and may also have trouble getting chances to speak.

Even though longer wait times are often preferable, therefore, they do not always work well with certain individuals or groups. For teachers, the most widely useful advice is to match wait time to the students’ preferences as closely as possible, regardless of whether these are slower or faster than what the teacher normally prefers. To the extent that a teacher and students can match each other’s pace, they will communicate more comfortably and fully, and a larger proportion of students will participate in discussions and activities. As with eye contact, observing students’ preferred wait times is easier in situations that give students some degree of freedom about when and how to participate, such as open-ended discussions or informal conversations throughout the day.

===Social Distance===
When two people interact, the physical space or distance between them—their social distance—often indicates something about how intimate or personal their relationship is (Noller, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Noller, P. (2006). Nonverbal communication in close relationships. In V. Mansunov &amp; M. Patterson (Eds.), ''Handbook of nonverbal communication,'' pp. 403-420.&lt;/ref&gt;. Social distance also affects how people describe others and their actions; someone who habitually is more distant physically is apt to be described in more general, abstract terms than someone who often approaches more closely (Fujita, et al., 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Fujita, K., Henderson, M., Eng, J., Trope, Y., &amp; Liberman, N. (2006). Spatial distance and mental construal of events. Psychological Science, 17(4), 278-282.
Global Deception Research Team. (2006). A world of lies. ''Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology, 37''(6), 60-74.&lt;/ref&gt;. In White American society, a distance of about two to four feet is what most people prefer when talking face-to-face with a personal friend. The closer end of this range is more common if the individuals turn sideways to each other, as when riding on an elevator; but usually the closest distances are reserved for truly intimate friendships, such as between spouses. If the relationship is more businesslike, individuals are more likely to situate themselves in the range of four to twelve feet. This is a common distance, for example, for a teacher talking with a student or talking with a small group of students. For still more formal interactions, individuals tend to allow more than twelve feet; this distance is typical, for example, when a teacher speaks to an entire class.

Just as with eye contact and wait time, however, individuals differ in the distances they prefer for these different levels of intimacy, and complications happen if two people expect different distances for the same kind of relationship. A student who prefers a shorter social distance than her partner can seem pushy or overly familiar to the partner. The latter, in turn, can seem aloof or unfriendly—literally “distant.” The sources of these effects are easy to overlook since by definition the partners never discuss social distance verbally. But they are real. The best remedy, again, is for teachers to observe students’ naturally occurring preferences as closely as possible, and to respect them as much as possible: students who need to be closer should be allowed to be closer, at least within reasonable limits, and those who need to be more distant should be allowed to be more distant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many class activities take on communication patterns that class members learn to expect without even being reminded. Each pattern is a '''participation structure,''' a set of taken-for-granted rights and responsibilities expected from students and teacher during an activity. Sometimes the teacher announces or explains the rights and responsibilities explicitly, though often they are just implied by the actions of class members, and individual students learn them simply by watching others. A lecture, for example, has a particular participation structure: students are responsible for listening, for raising a hand to speak, and for keeping comments brief and relevant if called on. The teacher, on the other hand, has the right to talk at length, but also the responsibility to keep the talk relevant and comprehensible.

In principle, a host of participation structures are possible, but just a handful account for most class activities (Cazden, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Cazden, C. (2001). ''Classroom discourse: The language of teaching and learning, 2nd edition.'' Westport, CT: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;. Here are some of the most common:

* '''Lecturing'''—the teacher talks and students listen. Maybe students take notes, but maybe not.

* '''Questions and Answers'''—the teacher asks a series of questions, calling on one student at a time to answer each of them. Students raise their hands to be recognized and give answers that are brief and “correct.” In earlier times this participation structures was sometimes called recitation.

* '''Discussion'''—the teacher briefly describes a topic or problem and invites students to comment on it. Students say something relevant about the topic, but also are supposed to respond to previous speakers if possible.

* '''Group work'''—the teacher assigns a general task, and a small group of students work out the details of implementing it. The teacher may check on the group’s progress before they finish, but not necessarily.

Each of these structures influences how communication among teachers and students tends to occur; in fact each is itself sort of an implied message about how, when, and  with whom to interact. To see how this influence works, look in the next sections at how the participation structures affected classroom communication for one of the contributors to this book ([[User talk: Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]] as he taught one particular topic—children’s play—over a twenty-year period. The topic was part of a university-level course for future teachers. During this time, Kelvin’s goals about the topic remained the same: to stimulate students’ thinking about the nature and purposes of play. But over time he tried several different structures of participation, and students’ ways of communicating changed as a result.

===Lecture===
The first time one of the contributors to this book, ([[User talk: Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]], taught his students about children’s play, he lectured about it. He used this structure of participation not because he believed on principle that it was the best, but because it was convenient and used widely by his fellow university teachers. An excerpt from Kelvin’s lecture notes is shown in [[Table 12-3a]], and gives a sense of what he covered at that time.

In some ways the lecture proved effective: Kelvin covered the material efficiently (in about 20 minutes), related the topic to other ones in the course, defined and explained all key terms clearly, and did his best to relate the material to what he thought were students’ own interests. These were all marks of good lecturing (Christensen, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. (2006). The nuts and bolts of running a lecture course. In A. DeNeef &amp; C. Goodwin (Eds.), ''The academic’s handbook, 3rd edition,'' pp. 179-186. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Students were mostly quiet during the lecture, but since only about a third of them took notes, Kelvin had to assume that the rest had committed the material to memory while listening. Students quietness bothered him a little, but as a newcomer to university teaching, Kelvin was relieved simply to get through the class without embarrassment or active resistance from the students.

But there were also some negative signs. In spite of their courtesy, few students lingered after class to talk about children’s play or to ask questions. Worse yet, few students chose children’s play as a term paper topic, even though it might have made a highly interesting and enjoyable one. On the final exam few seemed able to relate concepts about play to their own experiences as teachers or leaders of recreational activities.

There was an even more subtle problem. The lecture about play focused overtly on a topic (play) that praised action, intrinsic motivation, and self-choice. But by presenting these ideas as a lecture, Kelvin also implied an opposite message unintentionally: that learning is something done passively, and that follows an intellectual path set only by the teacher. Even the physical layout of the classroom sent this message—desks faced forward, as if to remind students to look only at the person lecturing. These are features of lecturing, as Kelvin later discovered, that are widely criticized in educational research (McKeachie &amp; Svinicki, 2005; Benedict &amp; Hoag, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;McKeatchie, W. &amp; Svinicki, M. (2005). ''Teaching tips: Strategies, research, and theory for college teachers, 12th edition.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, M. &amp; Hoag, J. (2004). Seating location in large lectures: Is location related to performance? ''Journal of Economics Education, 35''(3), 215-231.&lt;/ref&gt;. To some students the lecture format might even have implied that learning is equivalent to daydreaming, since both activities require sitting quietly and showing little expression. An obvious solution might have been to invite students to comment from time to time during the lecture, relating the topic to experiences and knowledge of their own. But during Kelvin’s first year of teaching about play, he did little of this. The lecture medium, ironically, contradicted the lecture message, or at least it assumed that students would think actively about the material without ever speaking.

===Questions and Answers===
Because of these problems, Kelvin modified his approach after a few years of teaching to include more asking of questions which students were invited to answer. This turned the lecture on children’s play into something more like a series of explanations of key ideas, interrupted by asking students to express their beliefs, knowledge, or experience about children’s play. Kelvin’s preparation notes changes in appearance as a result (see [[Table 12-3b]]). Asking questions and inviting brief responses was reassuring because it gave indications of whether students were listening and understanding the material. Questions served both to motivate students to listen and to assess how much and how well they knew the material. In this regard Kelvin was using a form of communication that was and continues to be very popular with many teachers.

But there were also new challenges and problems. For one thing the topic of children’s play took longer to cover than before, since Kelvin now had to allow time for students to respond to questions. This fact forced him to leave out a few points that he used to include. More serious, though, was his impression that students often did not listen to each other’s responses; they only listened carefully to Kelvin, the teacher. The interactions often become simply two-way exchanges between the teacher and one student at a time: Kelvin asked, one student responded, Kelvin acknowledged or (sometimes) evaluated. (Mehan, 1979; Richards, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Mehan, H. (1979). ''Learning lessons: Social organization of the classroom.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, K. (2006). ‘Being the teacher’: Identity and classroom discourse. ''Applied Linguistics, 27''(1), 51-77.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the exchanges could in principle have happened just as easily without any classmates present.

In general students still had little control over the course of discussion. Kelvin wondered if he was controlling participation too much—in fact whether the question-and-answer strategy attempted the impossible task of controlling students’ very thought processes. By asking most of the questions himself and allowing students only brief responses, was Kelvin trying to insure making sure that students thought about children’s play in the “right” way, his way? To give students more influence in discussion, it seemed that Kelvin would have to become less concerned about precisely what ideas about children’s play he covered.

===Classroom Discussion===
After several more years of teaching, Kelvin quit lectures altogether, even ones interspersed with questions and answers, and began simply leading general discussions about children’s play. The change again affected his planning for this topic. Instead of outlining detailed content, he now just made concise notes that listed issues about children’s play that students needed to consider (an abbreviated version of the notes are shown in [[Table 12-3c]]). The shift in participation structure led to several major changes in communication between teacher and students as well as among students. Since students spoke more freely than before, it became easier to see whether they cared about the topic. Now, too, more students seemed motivated to think and learn about children’s play; quite a few selected this topic, for example, for their term projects. Needless to say, these changes were all to the good.

But there were also changes that limited the effectiveness of classroom communication, even though students were nominally freer to speak than ever. Kelvin found, for example, that certain students spoke more than their share of the time—almost too freely, in fact, in effect preventing more hesitant students from speaking. Sometimes, too, it seemed as if certain students did not listen to others’ comments, but instead just passed the time waiting for their turn to speak, their hands propped permanently in the air. Meanwhile there were still others who passed the time apparently hoping not to speak; they were busy doodling or staring out the window. Since the precise focus of discussion was no longer under Kelvin’s control, furthermore, discussions often did not cover all of the ideas about children’s play that Kelvin considered important. On one occasion, for example, he meant for students to discuss whether play is always motivated intrinsically, but instead they ended up talking about whether play can really be used to teach every possible subject area. In itself the shift in focus was not bad, but it did make Kelvin wonder whether he was covering the material adequately. In having these misgivings, as it happened, he was supported by other educators who have studied the effects of class discussions on learning (McKeatchie &amp; Svinciki, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;McKeatchie, W. &amp; Svinicki, M. (2005). ''Teaching tips: Strategies, research, and theory for college teachers, 12th edition.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Group Work===
By the time he had taught about children’s play for twenty years, Kelvin had developed enough concerns about discussion as a communication strategy that he shifted approach again. This time he began using a form of '''collaborative group work''': small teams of students carrying out projects on aspects of children’s play that interested them, making observations of children at play, reporting on their results to the class, and writing a common report about their work. (Kelvin’s work guidelines given to the groups are shown in [[Table 12-3d]].) Kelvin hoped that by giving students a common focus, communication among them would improve. Conversations would deal with the tasks at hand, students would necessarily listen to each other, and no one could afford either to dominate talk excessively or to fall silent.

In some ways these benefits did take place. With a bit of encouragement from Kelvin, students did listen to each other more of the time than before. They also did diversify their tasks and responsibilities within each group, and they did seem to learn from each other in the course of preparing projects. Participation in the unit about children’s play reached an all-time high in Kelvin’s twenty years of teaching at university. Yet even now there were problems. Some groups seemed much more productive than others, and observing them closely suggested that differences were related to ease of communication within groups. In some groups, one or two people dominated conversations unduly. If they listened to others at all, they seemed immediately to forget that they had done so and proceeded to implement their own ideas. In other groups, members all worked hard, but they did not often share ideas or news about each other’s progress; essentially they worked independently in spite of belonging to the group. Here, too, Kelvin’s experience corroborated other, more systematic observations of communication within classroom work groups (Slavin, 1995). When all groups were planning at the same time, furthermore, communication broke down for a very practical reason: the volume of sound in the classroom got so high that even simple conversation became difficult, let alone the expression of subtle or complex ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Teachers and students have identifiable styles of talking to each other that linguists call a register. A '''register''' is a pattern of vocabulary, grammar, and expressions or comments that people associate with a social role. A familiar example is the “baby-talk” register often used to speak to an infant. Its features—simple repeated words and nonsense syllables, and exaggerated changes in pitch—mark the speaker as an adult and mark the listener as an infant. The classroom language register works the same way; it helps indicate who the teacher is and who the student is. Teachers and students use the register more in some situations than in others, but its use is common enough that most people in our society have no trouble recognizing it when they hear it. In  the following scene, for example, the speakers are labeled only with letters of the alphabet; yet figuring out who is the teacher and who are the students is not difficult:

:''A: All right now, I want your eyes up here. All eyes on me, please. B, are you ready to work? We are going to try a new kind of math problem today. It’s called long division. Does anyone know what long division is? C, what do you think it is?''
:''C: Division with bigger numbers?''
:''A: Any other ideas? D?''
:''E (not D): Division by two digits.''
:''A: …I only call on people who raise their hands.  D, can you help with the answer?''
:''D: Division with remainders.''
:''A: Close. Actually you’re both partly right.''
In this scene Person A must surely be the teacher because he or she uses a lot of procedural and control talk, and because he or she introduces a new curriculum topic, long division. The other Persons (B, C, D, and E) must be students because they only respond to questions, and because they individually say relatively little compared to Person A.

In general, effective classroom communication depends on understanding how features of the classroom talk register like these operate during actual class times. In the following sections therefore we describe details of classroom talk, and then follow with suggestions about how to use the register as effectively as possible. In both of these sections we assume that the better the communication, the better the learning and thinking displayed by students. For convenience we divide classroom talk into two parts, teacher talk and student talk.

===How Teachers Talk===
Although teacher talk varies somewhat with the tasks or purposes at hand, it also has uniformities that occur across a range of situations. Using detailed observations of discourse in science activities, for example, Jay Lemke identified all of the following strategies from observations of teachers’ classroom talk (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, J. (1990). ''Talking science: Language, learning, and values.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;. Each strategy simultaneously influences the course of discussion and focuses students’ attention, and in these ways also helps indirectly to insure appropriate classroom behavior:

* ''Nominating, terminating, and interrupting speakers:'' Teachers often choose who gets to speak. (“Jose, what do you think about X?”). On the other hand, they often bring an end to a student’s turn at speaking as well, or even interrupt the student before he or she finishes. (“Thanks; we need to move on now.”)

* ''Marking importance or irrelevance'': Teachers sometimes indicate that an idea is important (“That’s a good idea, Lyla.”). On the other hand, they sometimes also indicate that an idea is not crucial or important (“Your right, but that’s not quite the answer I was looking for.”), or fully relevant (“We’re talking about the book Wuthering Heights, not the movie that you may have seen.”). Marking importance and relevance obviously helps a teacher to reinforce key content. But the strategy can also serve to improve relationships among students if the teacher deliberately marks or highlights an idea offered by a quiet or shy student (O’Connor &amp; Michaels, 1996; Cohen, et al., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, M. &amp; Michael, S. (1996). Shifting participant frameworks: Orchestrating thinking practices in group discussion. In D. Hicks (Ed.), ''Discourse, learning, and schooling'' (pp. 63-103). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, E., Brody, C., &amp; Sapon-Shevin, M. (2004). ''Teaching cooperative learning.'' Albany, NY: SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case marking importance can build both a student’s confidence and the student’s status in the eyes of classmates.

* ''Signaling boundaries between activities:'' Teachers declare when an activity is over and a new one is starting—an example of the procedural talk that we discussed earlier. (“We need to move on. Put away your spelling and find your math books.”). In addition to clarifying procedures, though, signaling boundaries can also insure appropriate classroom behavior. Ending an activity can sometimes help restore order among students who have become overly energetic, and shifting to a new activity can sometimes restore motivation to students who have become bored or tired.

* ''Asking “test” questions and evaluating students’ responses:'' Teachers often ask '''test questions'''--questions to which they already know the answer. Then they evaluate the quality or correctness of the students’ answers (''Teacher:'' “How much is 6 x 7 ? ''Student:'' “42.” ''Teacher:'' “That’s right.”). Test-questions obviously help teachers to assess students’ learning, but they also mark the teacher as the expert in the classroom, and therefore as a person entitled to control the flow of discourse.

There are additional features of teacher-talk that are not unique to teachers. These primarily function to make teachers’ comments more comprehensible, especially when spoken to a group, but they also help to mark a person who uses them as a teacher (Black, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Black, L. (2004). Teacher-pupil talk in whole-class discussions and processes of social positioning in primary classrooms. ''Language and Education, 18''(1), 347-360.&lt;/ref&gt;:

* ''Exaggerated changes in pitch'': When busy teaching, teachers tend to exaggerate changes in the pitch of their voice—reminiscent of the “sing-song” style of adults when directing speech to infants. Exaggerated pitch changes are especially characteristic of teachers of young students, but they happen at all grade levels.

* ''Careful enunciation:'' In class teachers tend to speak more slowly, clearly, and carefully than when conversing with a friend. The style makes a speaker sound somewhat formal, especially when combined with formal vocabulary and grammar, mentioned next.

* ''Formal vocabulary and grammar'': Teachers tend to use vocabulary and grammar that is more formally polite and correct, and that uses relatively few slang or casual expressions. (Instead of saying “Get out your stuff,” they more likely say, “Please get out your materials.”) The formality creates a businesslike distance between teachers and students—hopefully one conducive to getting work done, rather than one that seems simply cold or uncaring. The touch of formality also makes teachers sound a bit more intelligent or intellectual than in casual conversation, and in this way reinforces their authority in the classroom.

===How Students Talk===
Children and youth also use a characteristic speech register when they are in a classroom and playing the role of students in the presence of a teacher. Their register—student talk—differs somewhat from the teacher’s because of their obvious differences in responsibilities, levels of knowledge, and relationships with each other and with the teacher. Student-talk and teacher-talk are similar in that both involve language strategies that guide content and procedures, and that sometimes seek to limit the inappropriate behavior of others. Compared to teachers’, though, students’ language strategies often pursue these goals a bit more indirectly.

* ''Agenda enforcement'': Sometimes students interrupt a discussion to ask about or remind others, and especially the teacher, of an agreed-on agenda. If the teacher tells students to open their text to an incorrect page, for example, a student may raise her hand to correct the teacher—or even do so without raising a hand. This communication strategy is one of more public, direct ways that students influence activities in the classroom, but its power is limited, since it does not create new activities, but simply returns the class to activities agreed on previously.

* ''Digression attempts'': During a discussion or activity, a student asks a question or makes a statement that is not relevant to the task at hand. While the teacher is leading students in a discussion of a story that they read, for example, a student raises his hand and asks, “Mr. X, when does recess begin?”

* ''Side talk'': One student talks to another student, either to be sociable (“Did you see that movie last week?”) or to get information needed for the current assigned task (“What page are we on?”). Sometimes side talk also serves to control or limit fellow students’ behavior, and in this way functions like control-talk by teachers (as when a student whispers, “Shhh! I’m trying to listen” or “Go ahead and ask her!”). The ability of such talk to influence classmates’ behavior is real, but limited, since students generally do not have as much authority as teachers.

* ''Calling out'': A student speaks out of turn without being recognized by the teacher. The student’s comment may or may not be relevant to the ongoing task or topic, and the teacher may or may not acknowledge or respond to it. Whether ignored or not, however, calling out may change the direction of a discussion by influencing fellow students’ thinking or behavior, or by triggering procedural and control talk by the teacher (“Jason, it’s not your turn; I only call on students who raise their hands.”).

* ''Answering a question with a question'': Instead of answering a teacher’s “test” question directly, the student responds with a question of her own, either for clarification or as a stalling tactic (“Do you mean X?”). Either way, the effect is to shift the discussion or questioning to content or topics that are safer and more familiar.

* ''Silence:'' The student says nothing in response to a speaker’s comments or to an invitation to speak. The speaker could be either the teacher or a fellow student. The silence makes the speaker less likely to continue the current topic, and more likely to seek a new one.

* ''Eye contact, gaze aversion, and posture'': The student looks directly at the teacher while the teacher is speaking, or else deliberately averts gaze.  The student may also adopt any of a variety of postures while sitting (sit up straight vs. slouching). As we discussed earlier in this chapter, the timing of eye gaze depends partly on cultural expectations that the student brings to school. But it may also represent a deliberate choice by the student—a message to the teacher and to classmates. The same can be said about sitting posture. In classroom situations, listening is conventionally indicated by looking directly at the teacher, and either sitting up straight or leaning slightly forward. Although these behaviors can be faked, they tend to indicate and to be taken as showing interest in and acceptance of what a speaker is saying. By engaging in or avoiding these behaviors, therefore, students can sometimes influence the length and direction of a discussion or activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using Classroom Talk to Stimulate Students' Thinking==
The various features of classroom talk characterize the communication of most teachers and students, at least when they are in a classroom and “doing school.”  (Communication outside of school is a different matter: then teachers as well as students may speak, listen, and behave quite differently!) As you might suppose, the most desirable balance among the features depends on grade level, curriculum area, and personalities of students or teachers. But failing to use a classroom register at all can easily create communication problems. Suppose, for example, that a teacher never asks informal test questions. In that case the teacher will learn much less than otherwise about her students’ knowledge of the current material. Then also suppose that a student does not understand teachers’ questions as test questions. That student may easily respond in ways that seem disrespectful (''Teacher:'' “How much is 23 x 42?” ''Student:'' “I don’t know; how much do you think it is?”) (Bloome, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Bloome, D., Carter, S., Christian, B., Otto, S., &amp; Shuart-Faris, N. (2005). ''Discourse analysis and the study of classroom language.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The classroom talk register, then, constrains how communication between teachers and students can take place, but it also gives teachers and students a “language” for talking about teaching and learning. Given this double-edged reality, how can teachers use the classroom talk register to good advantage? How in particular can teachers communicate in ways that stimulates more and better thinking and discussion? In the next, final section of the chapter, we offer some suggestions for answering these questions. As you will see, the suggestions often reinforce each other. They are more like a network of ideas, not a list of priorities to be considered or followed in sequence.

===Probing for Learner Understanding===
How do you know whether a student understands what you are saying? One clue, of course, is by whether the student is looking at and concentrating on you and your comments. But this clue is not foolproof; we have all had moments of storing at a speaker while daydreaming, only to realize later that we have not heard anything that the speaker said. It is sometimes important, therefore, to probe more actively how much students are actually understanding during lessons or other activities.

Strategies for probing understanding generally involve mixing instruction with conversation (Renshaw, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Renshaw, P. (2004). Dialogic teaching, learning, and instruction: Theoretical roots and analytic perspectives. In J. van der Linden &amp; P. Renshaw (Eds.), ''Dialogic learning: Shifting perspectives to learning, instruction, and teaching.''  Norwell, MA: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;. In explaining a new topic, for example, you can check for understanding by asking preliminary questions connecting the topic to students’ prior experiences and knowledge about the topic. Note that this strategy combines qualities of both instruction and conversation, in the sense that it involves combining “test” questions, to which you already know the answer, with real questions, to which you do not. When introducing a science lesson about density to kindergarten children, for example, the teacher might reasonably ask both of the following:

:''Teacher: Which of these objects that I have do you expect will sink and which ones will float?'' (A test question—the teacher already will know the answer.)

:''Teacher: What other things have you seen that float? Or that sink?'' (A real question—the teacher is asking about their experience and does not know the answer.)

By asking both kinds of questions, the teacher scaffolds the children’s learning, or creates a ''zone of proximal development,'' which we described in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]] as part of Vygotsky’s theory of learning. Note that this zone has two important features, both of which contribute to children’s thinking. One is that it stimulates students’ thinking (by asking them questions), and the other is that it creates a supportive and caring atmosphere (by honoring their personal experiences with real questions). The resulting mix of warmth and challenge can be especially motivating (Goldstein, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, L. (1999). The relational zone: The role of caring relationships in the co-construction of mind. ''American Educational Research Journal, 36''(3), 647-673.&lt;/ref&gt;.

When warmth and challenge are both present in a discussion, it sometimes even becomes possible to do what may at first seem risky: calling on individual students randomly without the students’ volunteering to speak. In a study of “cold calling” as a technique in university class discussions, the researchers found that students did not find the practice especially stressful or punitive, as the teachers feared they might, and that spontaneous participation in discussion actually improved as a result (Dallimore, et al., 2006). The benefit was most likely to happen, however, when combined with gestures of respect for students, such as warning individuals ahead of class that they might be called on, or allowing students to formulate ideas in small groups before beginning to call on individuals.

===Helping Students To Articulate Their Ideas and Thinking===
The classroom talk register is well designed to help students articulate ideas and thoughts, particularly when used in the context of discussion. In addition to the conversational probes, like the ones we described in the previous section, there are other ways to support students in expressing their ideas fully and clearly. One way is for the teacher to check repeatedly on her own understanding of students’ contributions as a discussion unfolds. Consider this exchange:

:''Student (during a class discussion): It seems to me that we all need to learn more climate change.''
:''Teacher: What do you mean by “learn more”? It’s a big topic; what parts of it are you thinking about?''

Still another strategy for helping students to articulate their ideas is to increase the wait time between when the teacher asks a question and when the teacher expects a student to answer. As we pointed out earlier in this chapter, [[../Verbal vs. Nonverbal Communication|wait times]] longer than average—longer than one second, that is—give students more time to formulate ideas and therefore to express themselves more completely and precisely. In addition, longer wait times have the added advantage of indirection: instead of telling a student to say more, the teacher needs only to wait for the student to say more.

In general any communication strategy will help students become more articulate if it both allows and invites further comment and elaboration on their ideas. Taken together, the invitations closely resemble a description of class discussion, though they can actually be used singly at any time during teaching. Consider these possible conversational moves:

* The teacher asks the student to explain his initial idea more completely.

* The teacher rephrases a comment made by a student.

* The teacher compares the student’s idea to another, related idea, and asks the student to comment.

* The teacher asks for evidence supporting the student’s idea.

* The teacher asks the student how confident he is in his idea.

* The teacher asks another student to comment on the first student’s idea.

===Promoting Academic Risk-Taking and Problem-Solving===
In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]] we described major features of problem solving, as well as three techniques that assist in solving problems—problem analysis, working backwards from the beginning, and analogical thinking. While all of the techniques are helpful, they do not work if a student will not take the risk of attempting a solution to a problem in the first place. For various reasons students may sometimes avoid such risks, especially if he or she has sometimes failed at a task in the past, and is therefore concerned about negative evaluations again (Hope &amp; Oliver, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Hope, A. &amp; Oliver, P. (2005). ''Risk, education, and culture.'' Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;.

What can a teacher say or do to counteract such hesitation? There are several strategies, all of which involve focusing attention on the process of doing an activity rather than on its outcome or evaluation.

* Where possible, ''call attention to the intrinsic interest or satisfaction of an activity.'' Consider, for example, an elementary-level activity of writing a Japanese haiku—a poem with exactly seventeen syllables. This activity can be satisfying in itself, regardless of how it is evaluated. Casually reminding individuals of this fact can contribute to students’ sense of ease about writing the haiku, and encourage them indirectly to do better work.

* ''Minimize the importance of grades'' where possible. This strategy supports the one above; by giving students less to worry about, they become freer to experience the intrinsic satisfactions of an activity. In writing that haiku mentioned above, for example, you can try saying something like, “Don’t worry too much about your grade; just do the best you can and you will come out well enough in the end.”

* ''Make sure students know that they have ample time to complete an activity.'' If students need to rush—or merely just thinks they do—then they are more likely to choose the safest, most familiar responses possible. In writing an amusing story from their early childhood, for example, middle years students may need time to consider and choose among story possibilities. Then they may need additional time to experiment with ways of expressing the story in writing. In this case, to make sure students know that they have such time, try saying something like, “Writing a good story will take time, and you may have to return to it repeatedly. So we will start working on it today, but do not expect to finish today. We’ll be coming back to it several times in the next couple of weeks.”

* ''Show that you value unusual ideas and elegant solutions to problems.'' When a student does something out of the ordinary, show your enthusiasm for it. A visually appealing drawing, a well-crafted essay, a different solution to a math problem than the one you expected—all of these deserve an explicit compliment. Expressing your interest and respect does more than support the specific achievement. It also expresses a more general, underlying message that in your classroom, it is safe and rewarding to find and share the unusual and elegant.

Note that these communication strategies support not only problem-solving, but also the related skills of ''creativity'' that was discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]]. In describing creativity in that chapter, in particular, we called attention to the difference importance of ''divergent'' (open-ended) thinking. As with problem-solving, though, divergent thinking may seem risky to some students unless they are encouraged to do so explicitly. The strategies for encouraging academic risk-taking can help to communicate this encouragement—that process matters more than product, that there will be time enough to work, and that you, as teacher, indeed value their efforts.

===Promoting a Caring Community===
A '''caring community''' is one in which all members have a respected place, in which diversity among individuals is expected, and in which individuals assist each other with their work or activities wherever appropriate. Classrooms and even entire schools can be caring communities, though moving them in this direction takes work on the part of teachers and other school staff (Noddings, 1992, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, N. (1992). ''The challenge to care in schools: An alternative approach to education.'' New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, N. (2004). ''Happiness and education.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The key work in promoting a caring community involves arranging for students to work together on tasks, while at the same time communicating the teacher’s commitment to mutual respect among students and between students and teachers. Many of the instructional strategies discussed earlier in this book, such as cooperative learning and inquiry learning (in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]]), therefore contribute to community in the classroom.

More specifically, you can as a teacher encourage community by doing any or all of the following:

* Tell students that you value mutual respect, and describe some of the ways that students can show respect for each other and for school staff. Better yet, invite students themselves to describe how they might show respect.

* Look for ways to sustain relationships among students and teachers for extended times. These ways may be easier to find in elementary school, where a teacher and class normally remain together for an entire year, than in middle and secondary school, where students learn from many teachers and teachers teach many students. But still there are ways. Participating in extra-curricular activities (like sports teams or drama club), for example, can sometimes provide settings where relationships develop for relatively long periods of time—even more than a single school year.

* Ask for input from students about what they want to learn, how they want to learn it, and what kind of evaluation they consider fair. Although using their ideas may feel at first as if you are giving up your responsibility as the teacher, asking for students’ input indicates respect for students. It is likely that many of their suggestions need clarification or revision to become workable, especially if the class must also cover a particular curriculum during a set time. But even just the asking for input shows respect, and can contribute to community in the classroom.

* If conflicts arise between students or between a student and teacher, encourage respectful communication as explicitly as you can. Some communication strategies about conflict resolution were described in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|Chapter 7]] and are helpful in this regard: identifying true problem ownership, listening actively, assertive (not aggressive) I-messages, and negotiation.

* Find times and ways for the class to experience itself as a community. This suggestion may look a bit vague at first glance, but in practice it is actually quite concrete. Any action builds community if it is carried out by the group as a whole, especially if it is done regularly and repeatedly and if it truly includes every member of the class. Such actions become ''rituals,'' not in the negative sense of empty or mindless repetitions, but in the positive sense of confirmations by group members of their commitment to each other (Ehrenreich, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, B. (2007). ''Dancing in the streets.'' New York: Henry Holt/Metropolitan Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the elementary grades, an obvious example of a ritual is reciting the pledge of allegiance (or its equivalent in classrooms outside the United States). But there are many other examples of classroom routines that gradually acquire the (positive) qualities of ritual or community-affirmation, often without deliberate intention or effort. A daily, regular time to work through homework problems together in class, for example, may serves obvious academic purposes. But it may also gradually contribute to a classroom’s identity as a class. With time and familiarity the group homework time may eventually come to represent “who we are” and of “what we do here” for that class.

      <comment>/* Radiation Therapy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Epidemiology==
*Estimated 2-3% of primary CNS tumors in &lt;18 population.
*Majority of patients present at age &lt;3 yrs.
*A workshop on ATRT (PMID 12142780) reported that pathologic review of a recent CCG study suggests ATRT may represent a significant proportion of brain tumors in children &lt;3 yrs old.

==Diagnosis==
*Major diagnostic dilemma is distinguishing from medulloblastoma.
*IHC necessary for diagnosis (vimentin, EPA, and SMA found in rhabdoid tumors but not medulloblastoma)
*INI1 gene mutated in ~85% of ATRT.

==Treatment==
*Treatment strategy includes maximum surgical debulking, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

===Radiation Therapy===
*'''Neurological Institute, Taipei, 2006''' (1990-2003) - PMID 16406394 -- &quot;Impact of radiotherapy for pediatric CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (single institute experience).&quot; Chen YW et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Mar 15;64(4):1038-43.
**17 pts w/ ATRT who received radiotherapy as part of their treatment regimen.
**Time interval b/w surgery and RT initiation was important prognostic factor on multi-variate analysis for overall survival.
**No difference in OS was seen for patients receiving &gt; or &lt; 50Gy

*'''St. Jude's, 2005''' (1984-2003) - PMID 15735125 -- &quot;Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRT): improved survival in children 3 years of age and older with radiation therapy and high-dose alkylator-based chemotherapy.&quot;  J Clin Oncol. 2005 Mar 1;23(7):1491-9.
**37 pts w/ ATRT (22 pts 3 yrs or younger)
**Majority of pts &gt;3 yrs received CSI.  
**2yr OS was significantly better for pts &gt;3 yrs old.
**The only survivors who were &lt;3 y/o received RT as part of their tx.

*'''Boston Regimen''' - PMID 15803379 -- &quot;Continuous remission of newly diagnosed and relapsed central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.&quot;
**Early pilot data, reported in detail in:
*&quot;'The DFCI study (02-294)&quot;' - PMID: 19064966 -- &quot;Intensive multimodality treatment for children with newly diagnosed CNS atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.&quot; (2008) had the following design:
•	Following diagnosis, patients underwent maximal surgical resection. Patients were reported as GTR, Subtotal or biopsy according to surgical opinion and MRI after surgery.
•	All patients underwent brain and spine MRI, CSF examination, CT chest and abdomen, bone marrow aspiration and trephine. Staging was according to that of Chang (REF)
•	Chemotherapy was begun within 50 days of surgery. Blocks of chemotherapy were given as follow:
1/ Pre-irradiation induction (weeks 1-6)
2/ Chemo-radiation induction (weeks 7-12)
3/ Post-irradiation induction (weeks 13-18
4/ Maintenance (weeks 19-44)
5/ Continuation ± Doxorubicin (weeks 45-51)
Outcome from this study
**Two year PFS was 53±13% and OS 70 ±10%.
**20 evaluable patients: 14 M0, 1 M2 and 5 M3. 
**1 treatment-related death, 4 PD in the first 13 weeks, 1 radiation recall, 1 transverse myelitis. 
**Metastatic stage was prognostic. Eight of fourteen patients with localized disease were alive, NED. One patient with M2 disease remained alive with disease. Four of five with M3 disease died of disease, but one achieved CR with induction chemotherapy, received CSRT and remained alive, NED.
**The degree of surgical resection was of prognostic value. 
Three patients underwent biopsy alone, and all died rapidly. 
Five of seven who had subtotal resection and 9/10 who had gross total resection were alive at the time of publication.
**Response to chemotherapy was prognostic. Seven of seven in continued CR, and a further 2 of 2 who achieved CR after induction chemotherapy were alive with NED at publication. One of 6 with a mixed or PR remained alive (with disease). This patient had stable disease after radiotherapy. Three patients had stable disease after induction. One achieved CR after RT and remained alive, NED. One had continued SD after RT, and remained alive with disease. One progressed after RT and died.
Fifteen patients received RT on study, 11 focal and 4 craniospinal. Status after radiotherapy was prognostic. All ten patients in CCR (n=9) or CR (n=1) after RT were alive, although one had ongoing disease. Two patients with persistent stable disease remained alive with disease. All others (n=8) had died.

==Reviews==
*'''Brown; 2007''' - PMID 16855864 &amp;mdash; &quot;Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor: the controversy behind radiation therapy.&quot; (Squire SE, J Neurooncol. 2007 Jan;81(1):97-111.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page needs a lot of cleanup.  I mass moved a lot of stuff that was under &quot;Your Career&quot; to being here, since it seemed more relevant to be under finding a prospective employer instead of determining a career path.  It seems that it had been forked earlier, and now the content here is double, when I copied and pasted, so it needs to get reintegrated on this page. --[[User:Jacob Walker|Jacob Walker]] 00:11, 5 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

If this is the first time you are trying out LaTeX, you don't even need to install anything. For quick testing purpose you may just create a user account with an [[#Online solutions|online LaTeX editor]] and continue this tutorial in the next chapter. These websites offer collaboration capabilities while allowing you to experiment with LaTeX syntax without having to bother with installing and configuring a distribution and an editor. When you later feel that you would benefit from having a standalone LaTeX installation, you can return to this chapter and follow the instructions below.

LaTeX is not a program by itself; it is a language. ''Using LaTeX'' requires a bunch of tools. Acquiring them manually would result in downloading and installing multiple programs in order to have a suitable computer system that can be used to create LaTeX output, such as PDFs. '''TeX Distributions''' help the user in this way, in that it is a single step installation process that provides (almost) everything.

At a minimum, you'll need a TeX distribution, a good text editor and a DVI or PDF viewer. More specifically, the basic requirement is to have a TeX compiler (which is used to generate output files from source), fonts, and the LaTeX macro set. Optional, and recommended installations include an attractive editor to write LaTeX source documents (this is probably where you will spend most of your time), and a bibliographic management program to manage references if you use them a lot.

==Distributions==
TeX and LaTeX are available for most computer platforms, since they were programmed to be very portable. They are most commonly installed using a distribution, such as teTeX, MiKTeX, or MacTeX. TeX distributions are collections of packages and programs (compilers, fonts, and macro packages) that enable you to typeset without having to manually fetch files and configure things. LaTeX is just a set of macro packages built for TeX.

The recommended distributions for each of the major operating systems are:

* [http://www.tug.org/texlive/ TeX Live] is a major TeX distribution for *BSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
* [http://www.miktex.org/ MiKTeX] is a Windows-specific distribution.
* [http://www.tug.org/mactex/ MacTeX] is a Mac OS-specific distribution based on TeX Live.

These, however, do not necessarily include an editor. You might be interested in other programs that are not part of the distribution, which will help you in writing and preparing TeX and LaTeX files.

===*BSD and GNU/Linux===

In the past, the most common distribution used to be '''teTeX'''. As of May 2006 teTeX is no longer actively maintained and its former maintainer Thomas Esser recommended TeX Live as the replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;teTeXHome&quot;&gt;[http://www.tug.org/tetex/ teTeX Home Page] (Retrieved January 31, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The easy way to get TeX Live is to use the package manager or portage tree coming with your operating system. Usually it comes as several packages, with some of them being essential, other optional. The ''core'' TeX Live packages should be around 200-300 MB.

If your *BSD or GNU/Linux distribution does not have the TeX Live packages, you should report a wish to the bug tracking system. In that case you will need to [http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html download TeX Live] yourself and run the installer by hand.

You may wish to install the content of TeX Live more selectively. See [[#Custom installation with TeX Live|below]].

===Mac OS X===
Mac OS X users may use [http://tug.org/mactex/ MacTeX], a TeX Live-based distribution supporting TeX, LaTeX, AMSTeX, ConTeXt, XeTeX and many other core packages. Download MacTeX.mpkg.zip on the [http://www.tug.org/mactex/ MacTeX page], unzip it and follow the instructions. Further information for Mac OS X users can be found on the [http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/ TeX on Mac OS X Wiki].

Since Mac OS X is also a Unix-based system, TeX Live is naturally available through [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts] and [http://www.finkproject.org/ Fink]. Further information for Mac OS X users can be found on the [http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/ TeX on Mac OS X Wiki].

===Microsoft Windows===
Microsoft Windows users can install [http://miktex.org/ MiKTeX] onto their computer. It has an easy installer that take care of setting up the environment and downloading core packages. This distribution has advanced features, such as automatic installation of packages, and simple interfaces to modify settings, such as default paper sizes.

There is also a port of TeX Live available for Windows.

==Custom installation with TeX Live==

This section targets users who want fine-grained control over their TeX distribution, like an installation with a minimum of disk space usage. If it is none of your concern, you may want to jump to the [[#Editors|next section]].

Picky users may wish to have more control over their installation. Common distributions might be tedious for the user caring about disk space. In fact, MikTeX and MacTeX and packaged TeX Live features hundreds of LaTeX packages, most of them which you will never use. Most Unix with a package manager will offer TeX Live as a set of several big packages, and you often have to install 300-400 MB for a functional system.

TeX Live features a manual installation with a lot of possible customizations. You can get the network installer at [http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html tug.org]. This installer allows you to select precisely the packages you want to install. As a result, you may have everything you need for less than 100 MB. TeX Live is then managed through its own package manager, ''tlmgr''. It will let you configure the distributions, install or remove extra packages and so on.

You will need a Unix-based operating system for the following. Mac OS X, GNU/Linux or *BSD are fine. It may work for Windows but the process must be quite different.

TeX Live groups features and packages into different concepts:
* ''Collections'' are groups of packages that can always be installed individually, except for the ''Essential programs and files'' collection. You can install collections at any time.
* ''Installation Schemes'' group collections and packages. Schemes can only be used at installation time. You can select only one scheme at a time.

=== Minimal installation ===

We will give you general guidelines to install a minimal TeX distribution (''i.e.'', only for plain TeX).
# Download the installer at http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz and extract it to a temporary folder.
# Open a terminal in the extracted folder and log in as root.
# Change the [[w:umask|umask]] to 022 to make sure other users will have read-only access to the installed distribution.
 # umask 022
{{Warning|All administration operations for TeX Live should be made with a 022 umask. Otherwise you will not be able to use TeX at all with an unprivileged user.}}
# Launch &lt;tt&gt;install-tl&lt;/tt&gt;.
# Select the ''minimal scheme (plain only)''.
# You may want to change the directory options. For example you may want to hide your personal macro folder which is located at TEXMFHOME. It is &lt;tt&gt;~/texmf&lt;/tt&gt; by default. Replace it by &lt;tt&gt;~/.texmf&lt;/tt&gt; to hide it.
# Now the options:
## '''use letter size instead of A4 by default:''' mostly for users from the USA.
## '''execution of restricted list of programs:''' it is recommended to select it for security reasons. Otherwise it allows the TeX engines to call any external program. You may still configure the list afterwards.
## '''create format files:''' targetting a minimal disk space, the best choice depends on whether there is only one user on the system, then deselecting it is better, otherwise select it. From the help menu: ''&quot;If this option is set, format files are created for system-wide use by the installer. Otherwise they will be created automatically when needed. In the latter case format files are stored in user's directory trees and in some cases have to be re-created when new packages are installed.&quot;''
## '''install font/macro doc tree:''' useful if you are a developer, but very space consuming. Turn it off if you want to save space.
## '''install font/macro source tree:''' same as above.
## Symlinks are fine by default, change it if you know what you are doing.
# Select portable installation if you install the distribution to an optical disc, or any kind of external media. Leave to default for a traditional installation on the system hard drive.

At this point it should display
 1 collections out of 85, disk space required: 40 MB
or a similar space usage.

You can now proceed to installation: ''start installation to hard disk''.

Don't forget to add the binaries to your PATH as it's noticed at the end of the installation procedure.

=== First test ===

In a terminal write
 $ tex '\empty Hello world!\bye'
 $ pdftex '\empty Hello world!\bye'
You should get a DVI or a PDF file accordingly.

=== Configuration ===

Formerly, TeX distributions used to be configured with the &lt;tt&gt;texconfig&lt;/tt&gt; tool from the teTeX distribution. TeX Live still features this tool, but recommends using its own tool instead: &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt;.
Note that as of January 2013 not all &lt;tt&gt;texconfig&lt;/tt&gt; features are implemented by &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt;. Only use &lt;tt&gt;texconfig&lt;/tt&gt; when you cannot do what you want with &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt;.

List current installation options:
 tlmgr option

You can change the install options:
 tlmgr option src 1
 tlmgr option doc 0
 tlmgr option paper letter

See the &lt;tt&gt;TLMGR(1)&lt;/tt&gt; man page for more details on its usage.
If you did not install the documents as told previously, you can still access the &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt; man page with
 tlmgr help

=== Installing LaTeX ===

{{Warning|Do not forget to set the root umask to 022 for all TeX Live administration operations.}}
Now we have a running plainTeX environment, let's install the base packages for LaTeX.

 # tlmgr install latex latex-bin latexconfig latex-fonts

In this case you can omit &lt;tt&gt;latexconfig latex-fonts&lt;/tt&gt; as they are auto-resolved dependencies to LaTeX.
Note that &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt; resolves some dependencies, but not all. It may happen to install dependencies manually. Thankfully this is rarely too cumbersome.

Other interesting packages:
 # tlmgr install amsmath babel carlisle ec geometry graphics hyperref lm  marvosym oberdiek parskip pdftex-def url

| Required for some {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} features.
|-
|}

If you installed a package you do not need anymore, use
 # tlmgr remove &lt;package&gt;

=== Hyphenation ===

If you are using Babel for non-english documents, you need to install the hyphenation patterns for every language you are going to use. They are all packaged individually. For instance, use

 # tlmgr install hyphen-{finnish,sanskrit}

for finnish and sanskrit hyphenation patterns.

Note that if you have been using another TeX distribution beforehand, you may still have hyphenation cache stored in you home folder. You need to remove it so that the new packages are taken into account. The TeX Live cache is usually stored in the &lt;tt&gt;~/.texliveYYYY&lt;/tt&gt; folder (&lt;tt&gt;YYYY&lt;/tt&gt; stands for the year). You may safely remove this folder as it contains only generated data. TeX compilers will re-generate the cache accordingly on next compilation.

=== Uninstallation ===
By default TeX Live will install in &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/texlive&lt;/tt&gt;. The distribution is quite proper as it will not write any file outside its folder, except for the cache (like font cache, hyphenation patters, etc.). By default,
* the system cache goes  in &lt;tt&gt;/var/lib/texmf&lt;/tt&gt;;
* the user cache goes in &lt;tt&gt;~/.texliveYYYY&lt;/tt&gt;.

Therefore TeX Live can be installed and uninstalled safely by removing the aforementioned folders.

Still, TeX Live provides a more convenient way to do this:
 # tlmgr uninstall
You may still have to wipe out the folders if you put untracked files in them.

==Editors==

TeX and LaTeX source documents (as well as related files) are all text files, and can be opened and modified in almost any text editor.
You should use a text editor (e.g. Notepad), not a word processor (Word, OpenOffice). Dedicated LaTeX editors are more useful than generic plain text editors, because they usually have autocompletion of commands, spell and error checking and handy macros.

===Cross-platform===

==== BaKoMa TeX ====

Authorea renders and compiles everything to the web (HTML5), in addition to PDF (export to numerous journal formats is provided). Authorea's versioning control system is entirely based on Git (every article is a Git repository).

== Bibliography management ==
Bibliography files (&lt;tt&gt;*.bib&lt;/tt&gt;) are most easily edited and modified using a management system. These graphical user interfaces all feature a database form, where information is entered for each reference item, and the resulting text file can be used directly by BibTeX.

=== Cross-platform ===
[[File:Jabref-2.2-screenshot.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Screenshot of [[w:JabRef|JabRef]].]]
* [http://jabref.sourceforge.net/ JabRef]
* [http://www.mendeley.com// Mendeley]

=== Mac OS X-only ===
[[File:BibDesk1.3.8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Screenshot of BibDesk]]
* [[w:BibDesk|BibDesk]] is a bibliography manager based on a BibTeX file. It imports references from the internet and makes it easy to organize references using tags and categories&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/ BibDesk]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Viewers ==

Finally, you will need a viewer for the files LaTeX outputs. Normally LaTeX saves the final document as a &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt; (Device independent file format), but you will rarely want it to. DVI files do not contain embedded fonts and many document viewers are unable to open them.

Usually you will use a LaTeX compiler like &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; to produce a PDF file directly, or a tool like &lt;tt&gt;dvi2pdf&lt;/tt&gt; to convert the DVI file to PDF format. Then you can view the result with any PDF viewer.

Practically all LaTeX distributions have a DVI viewer for viewing the default output of &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt;, and also tools such as &lt;tt&gt;dvi2pdf&lt;/tt&gt; for converting the result automatically to PDF and PS formats.

Here follows a list of various PDF viewers.
* Adobe Reader
* epdfview
* Evince
* Foxit
* Okular
* Sumatra
* Zathura

==Tables and graphics tools==

LaTeX is a document preparation system, it does not aim at being a spreadsheet tool nor a vector graphics tool.

If LaTeX can render beautiful tables in a dynamic and flexible manner, it will not handle the handy features you could get with a spreadsheet like dynamic cells and calculus. Other tools are better at that. The ideal solution is to combine the strength of both tools: build your dynamic table with a spreadsheet, and export it to LaTeX to get a beautiful table seamlessly integrated to your document. See [[LaTeX/Tables|Tables]] for more details.

The graphics topic is a bit different since it is possible to write [[LaTeX/Introducing Procedural Graphics|procedural graphics]] from within your LaTeX document. Procedural graphics produce state-of-the-art results that integrates perfectly to LaTeX (''e.g.'' no font change), but have a steep learning curve and require a lot of time to draw.

For easier and quicker drawings, you may want to use a WYSIWYG tool and export the result to a vector format like PDF. The drawback is that it will contrast in style with the rest of your document (font, size, etc.). Some tools have the capability to export to LaTeX, which will partially solve this issue. See [[LaTeX/Importing Graphics|Importing Graphics]] for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Geology of Indonesia Wikibook is an online book about the Geology of Indonesia. This wiki books means to be collaborated approach to acquire maximum knowledge available about the subject, intended to compile the current technical knowledge on the geology of Indonesia. As Indonesia is a vast region, the general geology for each region is described separately under different chapters. 

The book also covers the geological application for the petroleum, natural resources and geological hazards. The geological hazard will also cover the recent development of earthquake, tsunami, and other hazards in Indonesia. Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire with extensive volcanic network which give rise to the recent earthquake. 

'''Background'''

In 1949, R. W van Bemmelen published a compilation of reports and data on the Geology of Indonesia. The book was reprinted in 1970 with no additional data. This book has documented a lot of data and geological understanding before the second world war and only covered onshore geology of Indonesia. W. Hamilton published a book titled Tectonics of the Indonesian Region in 1979 which include offshore seismic data and remote sensing. 
The Indonesian geologist celebrated the 50th anniversary of R. W. van Bemmelen's book in a conference on &quot;Tectonics and Sedimentation of Indonesian&quot; in 1999 and published &quot;An Outline of the Geology of Indonesia&quot; the following year (2000). The data and the knowledge on the geology of Indonesia are so much and make it so difficult to compile them in a single book. In 2007 the Wikibook of the Geology of Indonesia was initiated. The idea is to include as many geoscientists as possible to keep the information on the geology of Indonesia as good as possible. The online version of Wikibook also give a chance to renew or update the information stored in this book at anytime.

== Stratigraphy ==
The stratigraphical knowledge of the Indonesian Archipelago will be summarized in this chapter. A synopsis of the stratigraphy of the Netherlands East Indies has been published by BROUWER (1925) and L. M. R. RUTTEN (1927). In 1938 UMBGROVE gave a comprehensive review of the geological history of the East Indies. A number of important contributions to the stratigraphy which appeared in 1937-1938, not available to UMBGROVE, were summarized by SMIT SIBINGA (1940). L. M. R. RUTTEN (1948) and DE BEAUFORT (1948) reviewed the paleontological work carried out in the Netherlands for the Dutch Overseas Territories during the period 1918-1943.

Other important reviews on the stratigraphy of the Indian Archipelago are to be found in: The &quot;MARTIN-Volume&quot; of the &quot;Leidsche Geologische Mededeelingen&quot; (1931), in which a number of authors gives a review of the paleontological and stratigraphical data up to the year 1930; UMBGROVE (1934 b) on theNeogene, and(1935)on thePre-Tertiary; BADINGS (1936) on the Paleogene; STAUFFER (1945) on the stratigraphy of Indonesia; SMITH (1924, 1925) on the stratigraphy of the Philippines; MONTGOMERY, OSBORN and GLAESSNER on the stratigraphy of Eastern New Guinea 1); CHHIBBER (1934) on the stratigraphy of the Andamans and Nicobars.

In 1950, P. Marks, published Stratigraphic Lexicon of Indonesia, which is a compilation of formation names in Indonesia. The formation names are sorted in alphabetical order with their description, rough map of the localities, and summarized them in stratigraphic charts.

The first Indonesian Stratigraphic Nomenclature guide (Sandi Stratigraphy Indonesia) was published in 1973 by Soejono Martodjojo and Djuhaeni. This book was updated in 1996 and published electronically by the Indonesian Geologist Association. The file is available online in SSI-1996. Many publications related to sequence stratigraphy and seismic stratigraphy in Indonesia were published by the Indonesian Petroleum Assocation (IPA), the Indonesian Geological Association (IAGI)and other professional organizations. A compilation of updated article on biostratigraphy of SE Asia is currently being prepared by the Indonesian Sedimentologists Forum (FOSI), which aim to issue it in 2014. Another key source on the stratigraphy of Indonesia is the Geological Research and Development Centre of Indonesia (GRDC)

In 1979, S. Sartono, from the Institute of Technology, Bandung, published a lecture outline in Indonesian, titled Stratigrafi Indonesia with occurence maps of the stratigraphic units in Indonesia. This book also provide updates on R. W. van Bemmelen's book.

For the sake of brevity, in this chapter only some notes will be given on recent advances in our knowledge of the pre-tertiary stratigraphy. For the rest the reader is referred to the regional descriptions.

The tertiary and quaternary formations have a much wider distribution than the pre-tertiary rocks. Their stratigraphy is most important in the unraveling of the evolution of the younger mountain systems in this area. Therefore, the stratigraphy of the Tertiary and the Quaternary will be treated at some length in this chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Indonesia is the largest archipelagic state in the world comprising five major islands and about 300 smaller island
groups. Altogether there are 13,667 islands and islets of which about 6,000 inhabited. The archipelago is situated
on a crossroad between two oceans, the Pacific and Indian oceans, and bridges two continents, the Asian and
Australian. Indonesia has a total area of 9,8 million sq km, of which more than 7,9 million sq km are under water.
Physiographically, the islands of Sumatra, Java and Kalimantan are attached to the Sunda Shelf of the Asian continent.
On this landmass the water depth does not exceed 200 meters. To the east, Irian Jaya and the Aru islands lie on the
Sahul Shelf, which are parts of the Australian continent. Located between these two shelves is the island group of Nusa
Tenggara, Sulawesi, Maluku and Halmahera. These islands are encircled by deep seas which in many places reach
5,000 meters.

About 60 Tertiary sedimentary basins, spread out from Sumatra in the west to Irian Jaya in the east, are identified in
Indonesia. So far only 38 basins have been explored and drilled for petroleum and 14 of the are now producing oil
and gas. Seventy three percent of these basins are located offshore, about one third of them in the deeper sea, with
water depth exceeding 200 m.

==Introduction==

The basic premise to explore the petroleum is the existence of sedimentary basin. Sedimentary basin is a depression on the earth surface the can accummulated the sedimentation material through time. Since most of the sediment transporting agent are water, the sedimentary basin usually the place where the water finally accummulate. It can be in the form of sea, lake, delta, or river. 

Indonesia is a large country with various type of sedimentary basins. Most of the sedimentary basin in the western Indonesia are already explored since the end of 19th century. The recent years also saws the exploration on the frontier basins, especially in the eastern Indonesia. Unfortunately, the interest of the major oil companies lost their appetite to conduct explorationa activities in Indonesia probably due to the unfavorable fiscal regime. As a result, the oil and gas production is keep declining in Indonesia without any substantial reserve replacement.

The sediment which comprise of clay, sand, boulder or carbonate are being deposited in the sedimentary basin over a geologic time (million years). Due to the weight of the sedimentary deposit, the sedimentary basin experience subsidence to allow more sedimentation. This sedimentary process may accummulate sediment with cumulative thickness of several thousand meters.

==Characteristics==

About 60 Tertiary sedimentary basins, spread out from Sumatra in the west to Irian Jaya in the east, are identified in Indonesia. So far only 38 basins have been explored and drilled for petroleum and 14 of the are now producing oil and gas. Seventy three percent of these basins are located offshore, about one third of them in the deeper sea, with water depth exceeding 200 m.

==Back-arc Basin==

The most prolific sedimentary basin in Indonesia are belong to back-arc basin, whichis located on the 'back' of the volcanic-arc. Most of the back-arc basin located in the northeastern coast of Sumatra, northern Java, and continue to northern Lesser Island. Almost all of the back-arc basin are currently producing oil and gas, therefore categorized as proven petroleum province.

==Fore-arc Basin==

The fore-arc basin located to the 'front' of the volcanic arc, which is located along southwestern coast of Sumatra, southern coast of Java and Lesser Island. The fore-arc basin is mainly considered as a frontier basin and no commercial hydrocarbon found yet. However, there is strong indication of working petroleum system in the fore-arc basin, such as gas discoveries in the Nias area. Oil shows also reported to be found in offshore Bengkulu (Southern Sumatra). On the interesting note, the fore-arc basin in the southern part of Papua New Guinea already found commercial gas accummulation in the Pandorra Gas Field.

Hi! Can anybody please tell me if chickens can absorb bonemeal and if this is a good source of calcium.I have noticed they love it especially if it has abit of meat in it (protein). Small chicks grow well with this additive too. I ahve also noticed that greens make a nice orangy/yellow yolk. Please respond</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fiscal Regime ==

Fiscal regime for the petroleum exploration in Indonesia is considered un-competitive compared to other countries. It reflected on the minimal interest from the major oil companies to invest their money for the petroleum exploration activities in Indonesia.

== Technical Brain Drain ==

The problem on the petroleum industry in Indonesia is the technical brain drain. Large proportion of the highly skilled technical people with good experience in the oil industry are left to working overseas to gain international experience and higher salary. It is not a secret that oil industry in Indonesia is unfairly renumerate their workers. The renumeration for expatriate personnel is about 5-10 times higher than the local employee with similar technical skills and level of experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Merging [[First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]] into [[Outdoor Survival]]==
I notice that you marked [[First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]] for merge with another book. You're welcome to use our content in any book you like, however it is most definitely a part of the [[First Aid]] wikibook, and should stay as such. I'm going to remove the tag, but again: feel free to use the content. If you need help with anything, just ask.

:Ok thats no problem Mike, I was more so thinking about adding the content. Is there any tag like merge that says you want to leave the current page as well? Thanks [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 14:03, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

::I don't know, actually. I doubt it. Wikipedia has massive amounts of templates for just about everything under the sun, but we don't. I left the tag on [[Outdoor Survival]] so contributors know that they can take content from [[First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]]. I also left a note on [[Talk:First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]] to the same effect. 
::The other thing you can do is request an import of pages from Wikipedia at [[WB:RFI]]. That's a great way to bring in large amounts of content - the only catch is that everything needs to be rewritten from encyclopaedia-style to textbook-style.

:::Ok thanks for the info I'm a new user and just learning. I'm interested in Outdoor Survival and saw that there were many articles about it scattered all over. I'm trying to piece them together and I had just thought the [[First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]] had some good information in it. Any ways thanks for your help [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 14:10, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

:::By the way you might want to take a look at this article [[Transwiki:Wilderness first aid]]. It has more information on Wilderness First Aid. If you would like any help on the First Aid section I'd be glad to do anything that needs to be done. [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 14:12, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

::::Thanks - we've already culled all the content we needed. It's mostly stuff that isn't specific to Wilderness first aid (surprisingly), and the stuff that is has been integrated into [[First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]] ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:19, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

:::::If the information is already integrated should that article be changed to a redirect then? Or is there some reason for keeping the Transwiki version such as a copyright policy or something? I would like to know for the future if I merge any other Transwiki articles. [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 14:23, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

We had most of those topics covered already, so it wasn't a full-on merge. If you're going to use Transwikis as a basis for pages in a book, I'd suggest that instead of merging manually, you simply move the page from the transwiki namespace into the book as whatever you want the page name to be, then work on it there. So for [[Transwiki:Wilderness first aid]], you might move it to [[Outdoor Survival/First aid]], then start working on it there... dewikifying, rewriting for style, copyediting etc. That's the easiest way to ensure that the edit history stays intact. If anyone needs the wikipedia page again, we can import it again.

:Ok thanks again for all your help with this, I appreciate it. [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 14:42, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

::No problem. If you need anything else, you can ask me on my talk page, or also at [[WB:SL|the staff lounge]].

Please be careful when you move pages. Try to move them only once; if you move them multiple times you create double redirects that have to get cleaned up. If you lay out the structure of your book ahead of time, then start moving content and filling in pages, you'll fare better.

:Ok sorry about that I thought I was going to name it something then I changed my mind. I'll plan it out more next time. [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 15:11, 5 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=[[File:Crystal_Clear_app_password.png|25px]]Identity=

An object id (OID) is something that uniquely identifies an object.  Within a VM this is typically the object's pointer.  In a relational database table, a row is uniquely identified in its table by its [[w:Primary key|primary key]].  When persisting objects to a database you need a unique identifier for the objects, this allows you to query the object, define relationships to the object, and update and delete the object.  In JPA the object id is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Id.html @Id]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;id&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element and should correspond to the primary key of the object's table.


===Example id annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private long id
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example id XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Common Problems====

=====&lt;i&gt;Strange behavior, unique constraint violation.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: You must never change the id of an object.  Doing so will cause errors, or strange behavior depending on your JPA provider.  Also do not create two objects with the same id, or try persisting an object with the same id as an existing object.  If you have an object that may be existing use the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;merge()&lt;/code&gt; API, do not use &lt;code&gt;persist()&lt;/code&gt; for an existing object, and avoid relating an un-managed existing object to other managed objects.

=====&lt;i&gt;No primary key.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: See [[#No Primary Key|No Primary Key]].

=Sequencing=
An object id can either be a natural id or a generated id.  A natural id is one that occurs in the object and has some meaning in the application.  Examples of natural ids include user ids, email addresses, phone numbers, and social insurance numbers.  A generated id (also known as a surrogate id) is one that is generated by the system.  A sequence number in JPA is a sequential id generated by the JPA implementation and automatically assigned to new objects.  The benefits of using sequence numbers are that they are guaranteed to be unique, allow all other data of the object to change, are efficient values for querying and indexes, and can be efficiently assigned.  The main issue with natural ids is that everything always changes at some point; even a person's social insurance number can change.  Natural ids can also make querying, foreign keys and indexing less efficient in the database.

In JPA an &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; can be easily assigned a generated sequence number through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/GeneratedValue.html @GeneratedValue]&lt;/code&gt; annotation, or &lt;code&gt;&lt;generated-value&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

===Example generated id annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example generated id XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;generated-value/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Sequence Strategies==
There are several strategies for generating unique ids.  Some strategies are database agnostic and others make use of built-in databases support.

JPA provides support for several strategies for id generation defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/GenerationType.html GenerationType]&lt;/code&gt; enum values: TABLE, SEQUENCE and IDENTITY.

The choice of which sequence strategy to use is important as it affects performance, concurrency and portability.

===Table sequencing===
Table sequencing uses a table in the database to generate unique ids.  The table has two columns, one stores the name of the sequence, the other stores the last id value that was assigned.  There is a row in the sequence table for each sequence object.  Each time a new id is required the row for that sequence is incremented and the new id value is passed back to the application to be assigned to an object.  This is just one example of a sequence table schema, for other table sequencing schemas see [[#Customizing|Customizing]].

Table sequencing is the most portable solution because it just uses a regular database table, so unlike sequence and identity can be used on any database.  Table sequencing also provides good performance because it allows for sequence pre-allocation, which is extremely important to insert performance, but can have potential [[#Concurrency and Deadlocks | concurrency issues]].

In JPA the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/TableGenerator.html @TableGenerator]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;table-generator&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is used to define a sequence table. The TableGenerator defines a &lt;code&gt;pkColumnName &lt;/code&gt; for the column used to store the name of the sequence, &lt;code&gt;valueColumnName &lt;/code&gt; for the column used to store the last id allocated, and &lt;code&gt;pkColumnValue &lt;/code&gt; for the value to store in the name column (normally the sequence name).

====Example sequence table====
SEQUENCE_TABLE

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing=0 border=1 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;SEQ_NAME&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;SEQ_COUNT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;EMP_SEQ&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PROJ_SEQ&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;550&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Example table generator annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @TableGenerator(name=&quot;TABLE_GEN&quot;, table=&quot;SEQUENCE_TABLE&quot;, pkColumnName=&quot;SEQ_NAME&quot;,
        valueColumnName=&quot;SEQ_COUNT&quot;, pkColumnValue=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.TABLE, generator=&quot;TABLE_GEN&quot;)
    private long id;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example table generator XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;generated-value strategy=&quot;TABLE&quot; generator=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;table-generator name=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot; table=&quot;SEQUENCE_TABLE&quot; pk-column-name=&quot;SEQ_NAME&quot;
                value-column-name=&quot;SEQ_COUNT&quot; pk-column-value=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Common Problems====

=====&lt;i&gt;Error when allocating a sequence number.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: Errors such as &lt;i&gt;&quot;table not found&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&quot;invalid column&quot;&lt;/i&gt; can occur if you do not have a SEQUENCE table defined in your database, or its schema does not match what you have configured, or what your JPA provider is expecting by default.  Ensure you create the sequence table correctly, or configure your &lt;code&gt;@TableGenerator&lt;/code&gt; to match the table that you created, or let your JPA provider create you tables for you (most JPA provider support schema creation).  You may also get an error such as &lt;i&gt;&quot;sequence not found&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, this means you did not create a row in the table for your sequence.  You must insert an initial row in the sequence table for your sequence with the initial id (i.e. &lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO SEQUENCE_TABLE (SEQ_NAME, SEQ_COUNT) VALUES (&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;, 0)&lt;/code&gt;), or let your JPA provider create your schema for you.

=====&lt;i&gt;Deadlock or poor concurrency in the sequence table.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: See [[#Concurrency and Deadlocks | concurrency issues]].

===Sequence objects===
Sequence objects use special database objects to generate ids.  Sequence objects are only supported in some databases, such as Oracle, DB2, and Postgres.  Usually, a SEQUENCE object has a name, an INCREMENT, and other database object settings.  Each time the &lt;code&gt;&lt;sequence&gt;.NEXTVAL&lt;/code&gt; is selected the sequence is incremented by the INCREMENT.

Sequence objects provide the optimal sequencing option, as they are the most efficient and have the best concurrency, however they are the least portable as most databases do not support them.  Sequence objects support sequence preallocation through setting the INCREMENT on the database sequence object to the sequence preallocation size.

In JPA the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/SequenceGenerator.html @SequenceGenerator]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;sequence-generator&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is used to define a sequence object.  The SequenceGenerator defines a &lt;code&gt;sequenceName&lt;/code&gt; for the name of the database sequence object, and an &lt;code&gt;allocationSize&lt;/code&gt; for the sequence preallocation size or sequence object INCREMENT.

====Example sequence generator annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;)
    @SequenceGenerator(name=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;, sequenceName=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;, allocationSize=100)
    private long id;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example sequence generator XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;generated-value strategy=&quot;SEQUENCE&quot; generator=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;sequence-generator name=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot; sequence-name=&quot;EMP_SEQ&quot; allocation-size=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Common Problems====

=====&lt;i&gt;Error when allocating a sequence number.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: Errors such as &lt;i&gt;&quot;sequence not found&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, can occur if you do not have a SEQUENCE object defined in your database.  Ensure you create the sequence object, or let your JPA provider create your schema for you (most JPA providers support schema creation).  When creating your sequence object, ensure the sequence's &lt;code&gt;INCREMENT&lt;/code&gt; matches your &lt;code&gt;SequenceGenerator&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;allocationSize&lt;/code&gt;.  The DDL to create a sequence object depends on the database, for Oracle it is, &lt;code&gt;CREATE SEQUENCE EMP_SEQ INCREMENT BY 100 START WITH 100&lt;/code&gt;.

=====&lt;i&gt;Invalid, duplicate or negative sequence numbers.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: This can occur if your sequence object's &lt;code&gt;INCREMENT&lt;/code&gt; does not match your &lt;code&gt;allocationSize&lt;/code&gt;.  This results in the JPA provider thinking it got back more sequences than it really did, and ends up duplicating values, or with negative numbers.  This can also occur on some JPA providers if your sequence object's &lt;code&gt;STARTS WITH&lt;/code&gt; is 0 instead of a value equal or greater to the &lt;code&gt;allocationSize&lt;/code&gt;.

===Identity sequencing===
Identity sequencing uses special IDENTITY columns in the database to allow the database to automatically assign an id to the object when its row is inserted.  Identity columns are supported in many databases, such as MySQL, DB2, SQL Server, Sybase, and PostgreSQL. Oracle does not support IDENTITY columns but its is possible to simulate them using sequence objects and triggers.

Although identity sequencing seems like the easiest method to assign an id, they have several issues.  One is that since the id is not assigned by the database until the row is inserted the id cannot be obtained in the object until after commit or after a flush call.  Identity sequencing also does not allow for sequence preallocation, so can require a select for each object that is inserted, potentially causing a major performance problem, so in general are not recommended.

In JPA there is no annotation or element for identity sequencing as there is no additional information to specify.  Only the &lt;code&gt;GeneratedValue&lt;/code&gt;'s strategy needs to be set to &lt;code&gt;IDENTITY&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example identity annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example identity XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;generated-value strategy=&quot;IDENTITY&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====PostgreSQL Serial Columns====
Sequence objects are database constructs and can be instantiated as distinct objects as needed. They provide incremental values when their &quot;next&quot; method is called. Note that the increments can be values greater than one, for example incremented by two's, three's etc. An 'on insert' trigger can be constructed for each table that calls a sequence object created for that specific table primary key asking for the next value and inserting it into the table with the new record. Identity datatypes in products like MySQL or SQL Server are encapsulated types that do the same thing without requiring the set up of triggers and sequences (although PostgreSQL at least has automated much of this with its Serial and Big Serial ''pseudo'' datatypes (these actually create an int/bigint column and run a &quot;macro&quot; creating the sequence and 'on insert' trigger when the CREATE TABLE statement is executed.)).

====Common Problems====

=====&lt;i&gt;null is inserted into the database, or error on insert.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: This typically occurs because the @Id was not configured to use an @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY).  Ensure it is configured correctly.  It could also be that your JPA provider does not support identity sequencing on the database platform that you are using, or you have not configured your database platform.  Most providers require that you set the database platform through a persistence.xml property, most provider also allow you to customize your own platform if it is not directly supported. It may also be that you did not set your primary key column in your table to be an identity type.

=====&lt;i&gt;Object's id is not assigned after persist.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: Identity sequencing requires the insert to occur before the id can be assigned, so it is not assigned on persist like other types of sequencing.  You must either call &lt;code&gt;commit()&lt;/code&gt; on the current transaction, or call &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt;.  It may also be that you did not set your primary key column in your table to be an identity type.

=====&lt;i&gt;Child's id is not assigned from parent on persist.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: A common issue is that the generated &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; is part of a child object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; through a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping.  In this case, because JPA requires that the child define a duplicate &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mapping for the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, its &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; will be inserted as null.  One solution to this is to mark the &lt;code&gt;Column&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; mapping in the child as &lt;code&gt;insertable=false, updateable=false&lt;/code&gt;, and define the &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; using a normal &lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; this will ensure the foreign key field is populated by the &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; not the &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt;.  Another option is to first persist the parent, then call &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; before persisting the child.

=====&lt;i&gt;Poor insert performance.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: Identity sequencing does not support sequence preallocation, so requires a select after each insert, in some cases doubling the insert cost.  Consider using a sequence table, or sequence object to allow sequence preallocation.

=====&lt;i&gt;Lost latest free id.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: MySQL bug [http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=199 199] causes its autoincrement counter to be lost on restart. So if the last entity is removed and the MySQL server restarted, the same id will be re-used and thus not be unique.

==Composite Primary Keys==
A composite primary key is one that is made up of several columns in the table.  A composite primary key can be used if no single column in the table is unique.  It is generally more efficient and simpler to have a one-column primary key, such as a generated sequence number, but sometimes a composite primary key is desirable and unavoidable. 

[[Image:Cascaded-keys.PNG]]

Composite primary keys are common in legacy database schemas, where ''cascaded keys'' can sometimes be used.  This refers to a model where dependent objects' key definitions include their parents' primary key; for example, &lt;code&gt;COMPANY&lt;/code&gt;'s primary key is &lt;code&gt;COMPANY_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEPARTMENT&lt;/code&gt;'s primary key is composed of a &lt;code&gt;COMPANY_ID&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;DEP_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt;'s primary key is composed of &lt;code&gt;COMPANY_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEP_ID&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.  Although this generally does not match object-oriented design principles, some DBA's prefer this model.  Difficulties with the model include the restriction that employees cannot switch departments, that foreign-key relationships become more complex, and that all primary-key operations (including queries, updates, and deletes) are less efficient.  However, each department has control over its own employee IDs, and if needed the database &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; table can be partitioned based on the &lt;code&gt;COMPANY_ID&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DEP_ID&lt;/code&gt;, as these are included in every query.

Other common usages of composite primary keys include many-to-many relationships where the join table has additional columns, so the table itself is mapped to an object whose primary key consists of the pair of foreign-key columns and dependent or aggregate one-to-many relationships where the child object's primary key consists of its parent's primary key and a locally unique field.

There are two methods of declaring a composite primary key in JPA, &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt;.

===Id Class===
An &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; defines a separate Java class to represent the primary key.  It is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/IdClass.html @IdClass]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;id-class&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  The &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; must define an attribute (field/property) that mirrors each &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; attribute in the entity.  It must have the same attribute name and type.  When using an &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; you still require to mark each &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; attribute in the entity with &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt;.

The main purpose of the &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; is to be used as the structure passed to the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getReference()&lt;/code&gt; API.  Some JPA products also use the &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; as a cache key to track an object's identity.  Because of this, it is required (depending on JPA product) to implement an &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method on the &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt;.  Ensure that the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method checks each part of the primary key, and correctly uses &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; for objects and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; for primitives.  Ensure that the &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method will return the same value for two equal objects.
: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Do not require the implementation of &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; in the id class.

====Example id class annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
@IdClass(EmployeePK.class)
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private long employeeId

    @Id
    private long companyId

    @Id
    private long departmentId
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example id class XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;id-class class=&quot;org.acme.EmployeePK&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;employeeId&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;companyId&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;id name=&quot;departmentId&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example id class====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
public class EmployeePK implements Serializable {
    private long employeeId;

    private long companyId;

    private long departmentId;
    
    public EmployeePK(long employeeId, long companyId, long departmentId) {
        this.employeeId   = employeeId;
        this.companyId    = companyId;
        this.departmentId = departmentId;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object object) {
        if (object instanceof EmployeePK) {
            EmployeePK pk = (EmployeePK)object;
            return employeeId == pk.employeeId &amp;&amp; companyId == pk.companyId &amp;&amp; departmentId == pk.departmentId;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    public int hashCode() {
        return employeeId + companyId + departmentId;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Embedded Id===
An &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt; defines a separate &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; Java class to contain the entities primary key.  It is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/EmbeddedId.html @EmbeddedId]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;embedded-id&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  The &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; class must define each id attribute for the entity using &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mappings.  All attributes in the &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; are assumed to be part of the primary key.

The &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt; is also used as the structure passed to the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getReference()&lt;/code&gt; API.  Some JPA products also use the &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt; as a cache key to track an object's identity.  Because of this, it is required (depending on JPA product) to implement an &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method on the &lt;code&gt;EmbeddedId&lt;/code&gt;.  Ensure that the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method checks each part of the primary key, and correctly uses &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; for objects and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; for primitives.  Ensure that the &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method will return the same value for two equal objects.

...

public class Employee {
    @EmbeddedId
    private EmployeePK id
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;embeddable/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example embedded id class====

public class EmployeePK {
    @Basic

    @Basic
    private long departmentId
        
    public EmployeePK(long employeeId, long companyId, long departmentId) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.companyId = companyId;
        this.departmentId = departmentId;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object object) {
        if (object instanceof EmployeePK) {
            EmployeePK pk = (EmployeePK)object;
            return employeeId == pk.employeeId &amp;&amp; companyId == pk.companyId &amp;&amp; departmentId == pk.departmentId;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    public int hashCode() {
        return employeeId + companyId + departmentId;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Primary Keys through OneToOne and ManyToOne Relationships==
A common model is to have a dependent object share the primary key of its parent.  In the case of a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; the child's primary key is the same as the parent, and in the case of a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; the child's primary key is composed of the parent's primary key and another locally unique field.

JPA 1.0 does not allow &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; on a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt;, but JPA 2.0 does.

One of the biggest pitfalls when working with composite primary keys comes with the implementation of associations to entity classes whose tables have multi-column primary keys (using the @JoinColumns annotation). Many JPA implementations may throw seemingly inconsistent exceptions when not specifying referencedColumnName for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; @JoinColumn annotation, which JPA requires (even if all referenced column names are equal to the ones in the referencing table). See http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/JoinColumns.html

===JPA 1.0===
Unfortunately JPA 1.0 does not handle this model well, and things become complicated, so to make your life a little easier you may consider defining a generated unique id for the child.  JPA 1.0 requires that all &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; mappings be &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mappings, so if your &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; comes from a foreign key column through a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping, you must also define a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; mapping for the foreign key column.  The reason for this is in part that the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; must be a simple object for identity and caching purposes, and for use in the &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; API.

Because you now have two mappings for the same foreign key column you must define which one will be written to the database (it must be the &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; one), so the &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; foreign key must be defined to be read-only.  This is done through setting the &lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; attributes &lt;code&gt;insertable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatable&lt;/code&gt; to false, or by using the &lt;code&gt;@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; instead of the &lt;code&gt;@JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;.

A side effect of having two mappings for the same column is that you now have to keep the two in synch.  This is typically done through having the set method for the &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; attribute also set the &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; attribute value to the target object's id.  This can become very complicated if the target object's primary key is a &lt;code&gt;GeneratedValue&lt;/code&gt;, in this case you must ensure that the target object's id has been assigned &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; relating the two objects.

Some times I think that JPA primary keys would be much simpler if they were just defined on the entity using a collection of &lt;code&gt;Column&lt;/code&gt;s instead of mixing them up with the attribute mapping.  This would leave you free to map the primary key field in any manner you desired.  A generic &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; could be used to pass the primary key to &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; methods, and it would be the JPA provider's responsibility for hashing and comparing the primary key correctly instead of the user's &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt;.  But perhaps for simple singleton primary key models the JPA model is more straight forward.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Allow the primary key to be specified as a list of columns instead of using &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; mappings.  This allows &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping foreign keys to be used as the primary key without requiring a duplicate mapping.  It also allows the primary key to be defined through any other mapping type.  This is set through using a &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;addPrimaryKeyFieldName&lt;/code&gt; API.

:[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] / [[Java Persistence/Open JPA|Open JPA]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] (as of 1.2): Allows the &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; annotation to be used on a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping.

====Example OneToOne id annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
public class Address {
    @Id
    @Column(name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;)
    private long ownerId;
    
    @OneToOne
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;)
    private Employee owner;
    ...
    
    public void setOwner(Employee owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
        this.ownerId = owner.getId();
    }
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example OneToOne id XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Address&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Address&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;ownerId&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;one-to-one name=&quot;owner&quot;&gt;
            &lt;primary-key-join-column name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot; referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-one&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example ManyToOne id annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
@IdClass(PhonePK.class)
public class Phone {
    @Id
    @Column(name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;)
    private long ownerId;

    @Id
    private String type;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;)
    private Employee owner;
    ...
    
    public void setOwner(Employee owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
        this.ownerId = owner.getId();
    }
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example ManyToOne id XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Address&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Address&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;id-class class=&quot;org.acme.PhonePK&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;ownerId&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;type&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;many-to-one name=&quot;owner&quot;&gt;
            &lt;primary-key-join-column name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot; referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/many-to-one&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===JPA 2.0===
Defining an &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; in JPA 2.0 is much simpler.  The &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; XML attribute can be added to a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping.  The &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; used for the object will be derived from the target object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;.  If the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; is a single value, then the source object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; is the same as the target object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;.  If it is a composite &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, then the &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; will contain the &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; attributes, and the target object's &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; as the relationship value.  If the target object also has a composite &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, then the source object's &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt; will contain the target object's &lt;code&gt;IdClass&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example JPA 2.0 ManyToOne id annotation====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
@IdClass(PhonePK.class)
public class Phone {

    @Id
    private String type;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @Id
    @JoinColumn(name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;)
    private Employee owner;
    ...//getters and setters
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example JPA 2.0 ManyToOne id XML====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Address&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Address&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;id-class class=&quot;org.acme.PhonePK&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;type&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;many-to-one name=&quot;owner&quot; id=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
            &lt;join-column name=&quot;OWNER_ID&quot; referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/many-to-one&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;entity/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example JPA 2.0 id class====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
public class PhonePK {
    private String type;
    private long owner;
    
    public PhonePK() {}

    public PhonePK(String type, long owner) {
        this.type = type;
        this.owner = owner;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object object) {
        if (object instanceof PhonePK) {
            PhonePK pk = (PhonePK)object;
            return type.equals(pk.type) &amp;&amp; owner == pk.owner;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    public int hashCode() {
        return type.hashCode() + owner;
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Advanced Sequencing==

====Concurrency and Deadlocks====
One issue with table sequencing is that the sequence table can become a concurrency bottleneck, even causing deadlocks.  If the sequence ids are allocated in the same transaction as the insert, this can cause poor concurrency, as the sequence row will be locked for the duration of the transaction, preventing any other transaction that needs to allocate a sequence id.  In some cases the entire sequence table or the table page could be locked causing even transactions allocating other sequences to wait or even deadlock.  If a large sequence pre-allocation size is used this becomes less of an issue, because the sequence table is rarely accessed.  Some JPA providers use a separate (non-JTA) connection to allocate the sequence ids in, avoiding or limiting this issue.  In this case, if you use a JTA data-source connection, it is important to also include a non-JTA data-source connection in your persistence.xml.

====Guaranteeing Sequential Ids====
Table sequencing also allows for truly sequential ids to be allocated.  Sequence and identity sequencing are non-transactional and typically cache values on the database, leading to large gaps in the ids that are allocated.  Typically this is not an issue and desired to have good performance, however if performance and concurrency are less of a concern, and true sequential ids are desired then a table sequence can be used.  By setting the &lt;code&gt;allocationSize&lt;/code&gt; of the sequence to 1 and ensuring the sequence ids are allocated in the same transaction of the insert, you can guarantee sequence ids without gaps (but generally it is much better to live with the gaps and have good performance).

===Running Out of Numbers===
One paranoid delusional fear that programmers frequently have is running out of sequence numbers.  Since most sequence strategies just keep incrementing a number it is unavoidable that you will eventually run out.  However as long a large enough numeric precision is used to store the sequence id this is not an issue.  For example if you stored your id in a NUMBER(5) column, this would allow 99,999 different ids, which on most systems would eventually run out.  However if you store your id in a NUMBER(10) column, which is more typical, this would store 9,999,999,999 ids, or one id each second for about 300 years (longer than most databases exist).  But perhaps your system will process a lot of data, and (hopefully) be around a very long time.  If you store your id in a NUMBER(20) this would be 99,999,999,999,999,999,999 ids, or one id each millisecond for about 3,000,000,000 years, which is pretty safe.

But you also need to store this id in Java.  If you store the id in a Java int, this would be a 32 bit number , which is 4,294,967,296 different ids (well actually 2,147,483,648 positive ids), or one id each second for about 100 years.  If you instead use a long, this would be a 64 bit number, which is 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 different ids, or one id each millisecond for about 300,000,000 years, which is pretty safe.  I would recommend using a long vs an int however, as I have seen int ids run out on large databases before (what happens is they become negative until they wrap around to 0 and start getting constraint errors).

=== Customizing ===
JPA supports three different strategies for generating ids, however there are many other methods.  Normally the JPA strategies are sufficient, so you would only use a different method in a legacy situation.

Sometimes the application has an application specific strategy for generating ids, such as prefixing ids with the country code, or branch number.  There are several ways to integrate a customize ids generation strategy, the simplest is just define the id as a normal id and have the application assign the id value when the object is created.

Some JPA products provide additional sequencing and id generation options, and configuration hooks.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Several additional sequencing options are provided.  A &lt;code&gt;UnaryTableSequence&lt;/code&gt; allows a single column table to be used.  A &lt;code&gt;QuerySequence&lt;/code&gt; allows for custom SQL or stored procedures to be used.  An API also exists to allow a user to supply their own code for allocating ids.

:[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] : A GUID id generation options is provided through the &lt;code&gt;@GenericGenerator&lt;/code&gt; annotation.

==Primary Keys through Triggers==
A database table can be defined to have a trigger that automatically assign its' primary key.  Generally this is normally not a good idea (although some DBAs may think it is), and it is better to use a JPA provider generated sequence id, or assign the id in the application.  The main issue with the id being assigned in a trigger is that the application and object require this value back.  For non-primary key values assigned through triggers it is possible to refresh the object after committing or flushing the object to obtain the values back.  However this is not possible for the id, as the id is required to refresh an object.

If you have an alternative way to select the id generated by the trigger, such as selecting the object's row using another unique field, you could issue this &lt;code&gt;SQL&lt;/code&gt; select after the insert to obtain the id and set it back in the object.  You could perform this select in a JPA [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/PostPersist.html &lt;code&gt;@PostPersist&lt;/code&gt;] event.  Some JPA providers may not allow/like a query execution during an event, they also may not pick up a change to an object during an event callback, so there may be issues with doing this.  Also some JPA providers may not allow the primary key to be un-assigned/null when not using a &lt;code&gt;GeneratedValue&lt;/code&gt;, so you may have issues.  Some JPA providers have built-in support for returning values assigned in a trigger (or stored procedure) back into the object.

: [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Provide a &lt;code&gt;ReturningPolicy&lt;/code&gt; that allows for any field values including the primary key to be returned from the database after an insert or update.  This is defined through the &lt;code&gt;@ReturnInsert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@ReturnUpdate&lt;/code&gt; annotations, or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;return-insert&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;return-update&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML elements in the eclipselink-orm.xml.

==Primary Keys through Events==
If the application generates its' own id instead of using a JPA &lt;code&gt;GeneratedValue&lt;/code&gt;, it is sometimes desirable to perform this id generation in a JPA event, instead of the application code having to generate and set the id.  In JPA this can be done through the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/PrePersist.html &lt;code&gt;@PrePersist&lt;/code&gt;] event.

==No Primary Key==
Sometimes your object or table has no primary key.  The best solution in this case is normally to add a generated id to the object and table.  If you do not have this option, sometimes there is a column or set of columns in the table that make up a unique value.  You can use this unique set of columns as your id in JPA.  The JPA &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; does not always have to match the database table primary key constraint, nor is a primary key or a unique constraint required.

If your table truly has no unique columns, then use all of the columns as the id.  Typically when this occurs the data is read-only, so even if the table allows duplicate rows with the same values, the objects will be the same anyway, so it does not matter that JPA thinks they are the same object.  The issue with allowing updates and deletes is that there is no way to uniquely identify the object's row, so all of the matching rows will be updated or deleted.

If your object does not have an id, but its' table does, this is fine.  Make the object an &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; object, embeddable objects do not have ids.  You will need a &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; that contains this &lt;code&gt;Embeddable&lt;/code&gt; to persist and query it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Look at the table of the LCR.. the parity select columns say &quot;Bit 3 | Bit 4 | Bit 5&quot; and the word length bits go &quot;Bit 1 | Bit 0&quot;.

----


I've written a serial communication program in Turbo C (DOS) recently and I've encountered quite a few &quot;gotcha's&quot; that don't seem to be described in the main document. You mostly run into these problems when doing high volume/high speed data transfers. I am crapy with formatting wiki text, so I'll leave this here for others to implement into the main document.


* Flowcontrol. When implementing flow control in your program keep in mind that some data will be 'on the wire' or in the UARTS fifo. Only the more advanced 16750 uarts can have hardware support for flowcontrol, (and it usually doesn't). In the most common 16550 uart, you will have to implement flowcontrol in software yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in case of RTS/CTS flowcontrol, make sure you raise your RTS before you reach your absolute limit in your receive buffer or you will have to drop data bytes. Since most uarts use a 16 byte fifo, raising the RTS some 20 bytes before your receive buffer is full should be sufficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the same spirit, keep your transmit buffer on short leash. When the remote side raises a flowcontrol flag, try stop sending as soon as possible. Keep in mind that anything in the transmit fifo will go out regardless.
&lt;br&gt;
* Shared IRQs. Data transfer over multiple serial ports on the same IRQ should be possible since the uarts will use a flag (bit 0 of IIR will be 0) to indicate if it generated any interrupts.
&lt;br&gt;
* Broken fifos. Not all uart types have working fifo's. Be sure to check which one you are running on and disable them if needed.
&lt;br&gt;
* BREAK signal. If you have 'Break signal enabled' (bit 6 in the LCR) then receiving a BREAK from the remote side will set your parity to space (aka sticky) to send a BREAK signal back. If you are not doing anything with BREAKs, I reccoment you turn this off.
&lt;br&gt;
* Interrupt priorities. For EACH event the uart will generate an interrupt; receiving a byte, having send a byte or changes on status lines. However, some events will be of a higher priority then others. This creates a problem for the 'Transmit holding register empty' interrupt which is on the lowest priority. Sometimes this event will be lost if there's a lot of other events coming in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are relying on 'THR empty' interrupts to drive your transmit-buffer sending code, then you will end up in a deadlock where you are waiting for the interrupt but it won't come since it has been lost. To prevent this, you must twiddle the 'TX interrupt enable' bit (bit 1 of IER) after servicing an interrupt event from the uart. This will ensure that if the THR is empty, an interrupt will be guaranteed.
&lt;br&gt;
* Many events in one interrupt. If you are doing high-speed, full duplex, flowcontrolled transfers then many events will occur. To speed up handling these events you can keep processing events in a single interrupt. Once you clear the current event by reading the correct register for example, then you can jump back to checking the uart for more events. 
&lt;br&gt;
* Shadow registers. Reading some registers will reset counters and some, like you speed divisor, are just hard to reach. I reccomend you keep shadow registers for most of these registers and read these out instead of the registers themselves. An exception can be made for line signals like CTS, DCD and such.


Here's a correct and complete template for a C ISR function. Note that this template does not include XON/XOFF flowcontrol.


&lt;pre&gt;
void interrupt serial_isr(void)
{
unsigned char iir, t, b;

disable();                              /* Disable all interrupts */

for(t=0; t&lt;MAX_UARTS; t++)              /* Loop through the UARTS we're servicing */

=&lt;big&gt;Building Numbers&lt;/big&gt;=

One of the most familiar entities in maths are numbers. From pre-school to advanced levels, numbers are intimately linked with maths. But what are these numbers mathematically speaking? This little book builds numbers the way mathematicians build them up (at least the way most of them do now). We start from the bare axioms of set theory and develop numbers in the mathematical sense. The reader is assumed to be sufficiently mathematically mature, having been exposed at least to high school maths to understand the arguments that follow.

==The Basics==
Nothiing can be build out of nothing. Our arguments can only proceed from some unproven assumptions. We start off with a list of the axioms of set theory, using these as our &quot;unproven truths&quot;. We do not bother to focus much on logic here, rather give an intutive feel of the axioms, so that our end goal of building numbers is not sidetracked.

For those interested in a very logically sound discussion of these axioms (specifically in first order logic) the bibliography mentions books which carry further details.

1. '''Axiom of extensionality'''

Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.

2. '''Axiom of regularity'''

Every non-empty set x contains a member y such that x and y are disjoint sets.

3. '''Axiom schema of specification''' 

If ''z'' is a set, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\!&lt;/math&gt; is any property which may characterize the elements ''x'' of ''z'', then there is a subset ''y'' of ''z'' containing those ''x'' in ''z'' which satisfy the property. 

4. '''Axiom of pairing'''

If x and y are sets, then there exists a set which contains x and y as elements.

5. '''Axiom of union'''

For any set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; there is a set ''A'' containing every set that is a member of some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. (For example if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=\{\{X,Y\},\{Z\}\}&lt;/math&gt; then there is a set ''A'' containing X, Y and Z. Here X, Y and Z are sets.)

6. '''Axiom schema of replacement'''

The image of any set under any definable mapping is also a set. 

7. '''Axiom of infinity'''

Let &lt;math&gt;S(x)\!&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt; x \cup \{x\} \!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x \!&lt;/math&gt; is some set. Then there exists a set ''X'' such that the empty set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of ''X'' and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''. 

8. '''Axiom of power set'''

Let &lt;math&gt;z \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt;\forall q (q \in z \Rightarrow q \in x).&lt;/math&gt; For any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' which is a superset of the power set of ''x''.

9. '''Axiom of choice'''

Let a choice function be a function ''f'', defined on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets, such that for every set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''. For any set ''X'' of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function ''f'' defined on ''X''.

==The Natural numbers==
With these axioms in hand we can start building the numbers. Our focus here is to quick start and build all the commonly used numbers. Hence, we wont focus on developing all properties that sets have, trusting that the user will agree that our constructions are sound enough and proofs of all properties proved strictly through these axioms do exist.

Our first target is to make the basic counting numbers, also called natural numbers. The axiom of infinity says that a set ''X'' exists which satisfies the property that it contains the empty set and the set and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''. There may or may not exist any other such sets. Taking the intersection of all such sets we get the set of natural numbers '''N'''. Clearly it is the smallest such set. Also as &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of '''N''', so is, &lt;math&gt;\{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt;, and so is &lt;math&gt;\{\varnothing\,\{\varnothing\}\}&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Intutively it is obvious that no other kind of members are there as '''N''' was the smallest such set. We let &lt;math&gt;0=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; to match with our intuition that 0 should be defined as &quot;nothing&quot;. Next we define &lt;math&gt;1=\{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt; to match with our intuition that 1 should convey the notion of &quot;one-ness&quot; which a set having a solitary element does. Similarly we define, &lt;math&gt;2=\{\varnothing\,\{\varnothing\}\}&lt;/math&gt; and so on.

Hence we have mathematically defined the set of natural numbers. We will define addition and multiplication for natural numbers as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;x^+=S(x)\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can recursively define addition by &lt;math&gt;a + (b^+) = (a + b)^+&lt;/math&gt;. (Hence &lt;math&gt;1+1=1+0^+=(1+0)^+=1^+=2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Note that &lt;math&gt;0^+=1&lt;/math&gt;.) Similarly multiplication is defined recursively by x×0 = 0 and x×S(y) = (x×y) + x. Such definitions are justified owing to a particular theorem in maths called recursion theorem, but we needn't go there. A few examples are usually sufficient to convince oneself of the validity of these definitions. 

==The Integers==
Once more we will take a leap and assume that the reader trusts us when we say that all usual properties of natural numbers can be established in our constructed system of natural numbers. The reason we avoid doing that here is because we wish to avoid getting tied up in formal arguments, and sidetrack our goal to provide a quick mathematical build-up of the numbers.

Next we tackle the integers. Since we need some brief extraneous concepts in our toolbox for this purpose (which all are defined and their properties established consistent with the axioms of set theory) we shall briefly mention those. First up is the concept of an ordered pair (a,b) which is defined as the set {{a},{a,b}} and using this a 3-tuple (a,b,c) is defined as the ordered pair (a,(b,c)) i.e. {{a}{{b},{b,c}}}. Similary 4-tuples, 5-tuples etc may be defined. Next is the concept of functions and relations which we trust the reader is aware of from calculus. Finally, we talk of equivalence relations and equivalence classes.

A given relation ~ on a set ''A'' is said to be an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Equivalently, for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''A'':
*''a'' ~ ''a''. (Reflexivity)
*if ''a'' ~ ''b'' then ''b'' ~ ''a''. (Symmetry)
*if ''a'' ~ ''b'' and ''b'' ~ ''c'' then ''a'' ~ ''c''. (Transitivity)

The equivalence class of ''a'' under ~, denoted [''a''], is defined as &lt;math&gt;[a] = \{b\in A | a\sim b\}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if A is the set of all cars, and ~ is the equivalence relation &quot;has the same color as&quot;, then one particular equivalence class consists of all green cars. Another example deals with functions: any function f : X → Y defines an equivalence relation on X by x1 ~ x2 if and only if f(x1) = f(x2). The equivalence class of x is the set of all elements in X which get mapped to f(x), i.e. the class [x] is the inverse image of f(x). 

[[File:Relatives Numbers Representation.png|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers -5 to 5

|upright=2]]
Now the set of integers can be formally defined as the set of equivalence classes of a particular relation. That relation is defined between ordered pairs of natural numbers (not between the natural numbers themselves but between their pairs).

The intuition is that (''a'', ''b'') stands for the result of subtracting ''b'' from ''a''. To confirm our expectation that {{nowrap|1 &amp;minus; 2}} and {{nowrap|4 &amp;minus; 5}} denote the same number, we define an equivalence relation ~ on these pairs with the following rule:
:&lt;math&gt; (a,b) \sim (c,d) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;
precisely when
:&lt;math&gt;a+d = b+c. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Addition and multiplication of integers can be defined in terms of the equivalent operations on the natural numbers; denoting by [(''a'',''b'')] the equivalence class having (''a'',''b'') as a member, one has:
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]+[(c,d)] := [(a+c,b+d)].\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]\cdot[(c,d)] := [(ac+bd,ad+bc)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:
:&lt;math&gt;-[(a,b)] := [(b,a)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence subtraction can be defined as the addition of the additive inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]-[(c,d)] := [(a+d,b+c)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The standard ordering on the integers is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]&lt;[(c,d)]\,&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a+d &lt; b+c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.

Every equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form (''n'',0) or (0,''n'') (or both at once). The natural number ''n'' is identified with the class [(''n'',0)] (in other words the natural numbers are embedded into the integers by map sending ''n'' to [(''n'',0)]), and the class [(0,''n'')] is denoted −''n'' (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class [(0,0)] a second time since −0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Thus, [(''a'',''b'')] is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} a-b, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge b  \\ -(b-a),  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; b. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

If the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers, this convention creates no ambiguity.

This notation recovers the familiar representation of the integers as  {... −3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Some examples are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 0 &amp;= [(0,0)] &amp;= [(1,1)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k,k)] \\
 1 &amp;= [(1,0)] &amp;= [(2,1)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k+1,k)] \\
-1 &amp;= [(0,1)] &amp;= [(1,2)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k,k+1)] \\
 2 &amp;= [(2,0)] &amp;= [(3,1)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k+2,k)] \\
-2 &amp;= [(0,2)] &amp;= [(1,3)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k,k+2)].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Rational numbers==
Next stop: the rationals!

Those who have done a course in algebra may recognize the construction that follows as precisely being the one by which an integral domain is embedded in a field. (And indeed it is no big wonder as the integers form an integral domain and the rationals a field.) For those who think fields are open spaces and are thinking about agriculture, not to worry. We provide the full construction below.

[[File:RationalRepresentation.pdf|thumb|right|300px|a diagram showing a representation of the equivalent classes of pairs of integers]]

Mathematically the construction is similar as when we constructed the integers out of the naturals. We consider the following relation between all ordered pairs of integers (''m'',''n''), with ''n'' ≠ 0. Specifically, the relation is (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if, and only if, {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.}} We can define addition and multiplication of these pairs with the following rules:
: &lt;math&gt;\left(m_1, n_1\right) + \left(m_2, n_2\right) := \left(m_1n_2 + n_1m_2, n_1n_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left(m_1, n_1\right) \times \left(m_2, n_2\right) := \left(m_1m_2, n_1n_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and, if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, division by
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left(m_1, n_1\right)} {\left(m_2, n_2\right)} := \left(m_1n_2, n_1m_2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence relation (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if, and only if, {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}  is a congruence relation, i.e. it is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above, and we may define the set of all rational numbers '''Q''' to be the set of all equivalence classes under this relation. We denote by [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)] the equivalence class containing (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). If (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) then, by definition, (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) belongs to [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) belongs to [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]; in this case we can write [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)] = [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Given any equivalence class [(''m'',''n'')] there are a countably infinite number of representation, since

:&lt;math&gt; \cdots  = [(-2m,-2n)] = [(-m,-n)] = [(m,n)] = [(2m,2n)] = \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

The canonical choice for [(''m'',''n'')] is chosen so that gcd(''m'',''n'') = 1, i.e. ''m'' and ''n'' share no common factors, i.e. ''m'' and ''n'' are coprime. For example, we would write [(1,2)] instead of [(2,4)] or [(&amp;minus;12,&amp;minus;24)], even though [(1,2)] = [(2,4)] = [(&amp;minus;12,&amp;minus;24)].

The integers may be considered to be rational numbers by the embedding that maps ''m'' to [(''m'', 1)].

==The Reals==
The Real Numbers await us!

For starters we need the concept of Dedekind cuts. A Dedekind cut, named after Richard Dedekind, is a partition of the rational numbers into two non-empty parts A and B, such that all elements of A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element. The cut itself is, conceptually, the &quot;gap&quot; defined between A and B. In other words, A contains every rational number less than the cut, and B contains every rational number greater than the cut. 

For convenience we may take the lower set A as the representative of any given Dedekind cut A, B, since A completely determines B. We now define the set of real numbers to be the set of all Dedekind cuts. In more detail, a real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is any subset of the set &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of rational numbers that fulfills the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is not empty
# &lt;math&gt;r \neq \textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
# ''r'' is closed downwards.  In other words,  for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;y \in r&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in r&lt;/math&gt;
# ''r'' contains no greatest element.  In other words, there is no &lt;math&gt;x \in r&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;y \in r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y \leq x&lt;/math&gt;

* We form the set &lt;math&gt; \textbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; of real numbers as the set of all Dedekind cuts &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \textbf{Q} &lt;/math&gt;.

* We embed the rational numbers into the reals by identifying the rational number &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; with the set of all smaller rational numbers &lt;math&gt; \{ x \in \textbf{Q} : x &lt; q \} &lt;/math&gt;.

* Addition. &lt;math&gt;A + B := \{a + b: a \in A \and b \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

* Defining multiplication is less straightforward.
** if &lt;math&gt;A, B \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; A \times B := \{ a \times b : a \geq 0 \and a \in A \and b \geq 0 \and b \in B \} \cup \{ x \in \mathrm{Q} : x &lt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
** if either &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; is negative, we use the identities &lt;math&gt; A \times B = -(A \times -B) = -(-A \times B) = (-A \times -B) \,&lt;/math&gt; to convert &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; to positive numbers and then apply the definition above.

==The Complex numbers==

Are we done? Not quite. The set of complex numbers which the reader has no doubt encountered still awaits us. Fortunately, it does not require such a detailed development as the reals and we quickly obtain it as follows.

Let '''C''' be the the set '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of ordered pairs (''a'', ''b'') of real numbers. '''C''' is defined as the set of complex numbers. In this notation, the above formulas for addition and multiplication read

: &lt;math&gt;(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; (a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (ac - bd, bc + ad)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is then just a matter of notation to express (a, b) as a + ib. Addition and multiplication are defined naturally.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:mechanical engineering|mechanical engineering]]''': an engineering discipline that involves the application of principles of physics for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It requires a solid understanding of core concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and energy. Mechanical engineers use the core principles as well as other knowledge in the field to design and analyze motor vehicles, aircraft, heating and cooling systems, watercraft, manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, robotics, medical devices and more.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:aerospace engineering|aerospace engineering]]''': the branch of engineering behind the design, construction and science of aircraft and spacecraft. Aerospace engineering includes two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. The former deals with craft that stay within Earth's atmosphere and the latter deals with craft that operate outside of Earth's atmosphere. While &quot;aeronautical&quot; was the original term, the broader &quot;aerospace&quot; has superseded it in usage, as flight technology advanced to include craft operating in outer space.

== Deriving a series voltage summer from KVL ==

[[Image:Ser_summer_loop_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. In order to sum voltages, we have just to connect in series the input voltage sources and the load.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Ohm's law has given us an idea how to create the most elementary [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|voltage-to-current]] and [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|current-to-voltage]] converters. Now, ''Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)'' will help us to make the simplest voltage summer.

According to the famous law, we have just to connect in series (Fig. 2) the input voltage sources and the load (let's for concreteness assume that we have three sources). The output voltage across the load is the sum of the input voltages:

&lt;center&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Only, what is actually the summer here? Where is it? The input voltage sources and the load are external components; so, the rest (a bare loop or just a piece of wire) serves as a summer!

&lt;center&gt;''The simplest voltage summer is just a loop.''&lt;/center&gt;

It is just wonderful! The series voltage summer is an ideal &quot;device&quot; because there is not actually a device:)!

The input voltage sources in the circuit on Fig. 2 are connected in the same direction; so, their voltages are summed. If we reverse some source, its voltage will be subtracted from the whole sum. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== The problem of the common ground ==

=== Flying sources ===

[[Image:Ser_summer_flying_sources_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3a. If we ground the source V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and the load, the sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; become flying.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The summing circuit on Fig. 2 is &quot;flying&quot;; there is no connection with the common reference point referred to as ''ground''. Usually, the input voltage sources and the load are preliminarily connected to the ground (they can be electronic devices connected to the common power supply). So, we have to choose a point from our summing circuit that to connect to the ground. Only, what point of the circuit do we connect to the ground? Let's try some connections.

First, we can ground the common point between the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and the load. Only, the sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; become flying.

Note that in this arrangement, all the input voltages are positive regarding to ground.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Flying source and load ===

[[Image:Ser_summer_flying_load_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px||&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3b. If we ground the sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;, the source V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; and the load become flying.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Then, we can ground the common point between the input sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;. Only, now the source V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; and the load become flying. Obviously, the series voltage summer has a problem with the common ground.

Travelling the loop in clockwise direction we can note that all the input voltages have the same polarity direction (-  +, -  +, -  +). Only, regarding to the ground, the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; is negative while the others are positive.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Flying load ===

Fortunately, there is a very successful combination - two grounded input sources and a differential load. It is widely used in op-amp circuit design because, as a rule, the operational amplifiers have differential inputs. Almost all the series summer applications are based on this arrangement (see the examples [[#Wheatstone bridge|below]]).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Applications ==

The series voltage summer exists in many analog circuits considered in electronics books; only, authors do not discern and do not pay attention to it. As a result, it is presented rather implicitly than manifestly. In this section, we will do our best to show its presence in various electronic circuits. This famous circuit deserves our attention.

=== Series battery configuration ===

Is there a more suitable example of using a series voltage summer than a series battery configuration? It is invented by Volta in 1799 by placing many galvanic cells in series. From the classical viewpoint, such a battery consists only of ''cells''; from our viewpoint, it contains ''cells'' and a ''series voltage summer'' (it sounds quite strange, doesn't it?):

&lt;center&gt;''Series battery = cells + series voltage summer''&lt;/center&gt;

=== Wheatstone bridge ===

[[Image:Ser_summer_bridge_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. The famous Wheatstone bridge consists of two voltage dividers, whose output voltages are subtracted by a series voltage summer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We may think of this legendary circuit as a system of two voltage dividers (Fig. 4). Their output voltages are connected in series with opposite polarities (- V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; +, + V&lt;sub&gt;R4&lt;/sub&gt; -) so that they are subtracted (regarding to the ground, the voltages have the same polarities). In this way, the output voltage of this series voltage summer represents the difference between the voltages. 

If the bridge is balanced, the result is zero

&lt;center&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;R4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&lt;/center&gt;

and no current flows through the load (no matter how much low-resistive it is). This phenomenon is referred to as ''bootstrapping''; Baron Munchhausen put it in practice for the first time (the legend says that he was using his own boot straps to pull himself out of the sea:).

Note that in this arrangement, the two input voltage sources are grounded while the load (usually the so called zero indicator or galvanometer) is flying.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Circuits with series negative feedback ===

[[Image:Ser_summer_nfb_system_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. A voltage follower with negative feedback consists of three components: a power source, a regulating element and a subtractor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Circuits with negative feedback are the great mass of devices in analog electronics. Let's, for example, consider the most elementary of them - the voltage follower. It consists of three components (Fig. 5): a source of energy E (power source), a regulating element R and a voltage subtractor. The regulating element produces an output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; (by controlling the energy of the power source) and continuously compares it with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; by the voltage subtractor, in order to keep zero difference between them. As a result, the output &quot;copy&quot; voltage is equal to the input &quot;original&quot; one.

Depending on the nature of the voltage subtractor (series or parallel), there are two kinds of circuits: ''with series negative feedback'' and ''with parallel negative feedback''. Circuits with series negative feedback are based on a series voltage summer acting as a subtractor.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Transistor NFB circuits ====

[[Image:Ser_summer_emitter_follower_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Emitter follower consists of a power source, a transistor and a subtractor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Emitter follower is the most elementary transistor circuit with series negative feedback that we can build. For this purpose, we connect the output part of the transistor (collector-emitter) in series to the power supply and the load (Fig. 6). It acts as a regulating element that doses the voltage of the power supply by changing its present resistance.

Then, to make the transistor compare the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, we connect the two voltages in series and apply their difference dV = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; to the input part of the transistor (the base-emitter junction). As a result, the transistor produces an output voltage that is almost equal to the input one:

V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (we have written &quot;≈&quot; instead &quot;=&quot; because of the troublesome voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE0&lt;/sub&gt;).

According to the classical viewpoint, the emitter follower consists only of a transistor. From our viewpoint, the emitter follower contains a power supply, a transistor and a series voltage summer:

''Emitter follower = power supply + transistor + series voltage summer''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Op-amp NFB circuits ====

[[Image:Ser_summer_op-amp_follower_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px||&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. In an op-amp voltage follower, the input and output voltages are subtracted by a series voltage summer (a bare loop).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Similarly, an op-amp voltage follower is the most elementary op-amp circuit with series negative feedback that we can build. For this purpose, we supply properly the op-amp and 
connect the op-amp output to the load (Fig. 7). Now, the op-amp acts as a regulating element that doses the voltage of the power supply by changing the present resistance of its output transistors.

Then, in order to make the op-amp compare the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, we connect as above the two voltages in series and apply their difference dV = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; to the op-amp input (the input voltage - to the non-inverting op-amp input and the output voltage - to the inverting op-amp input). As a result, the op-amp produces an output voltage that is almost exactly equal to the input one: V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.

From the classical viewpoint, the op-amp voltage follover consists only of an operational amplifier. From our viewpoint, the op-amp follower consists of a power supply, an op-amp and a series voltage summer (a bare loop):

''Op-amp voltage follower = power supply + op-amp + series voltage summer''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Series versus parallel summer ==

We can do a few remarks about the circuit of a series voltage summer comparing it with the parallel one.

• The output voltage of the series summer is a sum of the whole input voltages; if we want to sum voltages with weighting coefficients, we have to attenuate them by voltage dividers. The circuit of the [[Circuit Idea/Parallel Voltage Summer|parallel voltage summer]] is more appropriate for this case.

• The output voltage of the series summer can exceed any of the input voltages; the output voltage of the parallel voltage summer is less than the highest input voltage.

• There are no any losses in the series summer; the resistors of the parallel voltage summer dissipate power.

• The series voltage summer has a problem with the common ground; the parallel voltage summer has not such a problem.

• An interesting feature of the series voltage summer is that the current flowing through the input voltage sources and the load is the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Indonesia is a meeting place of two tectonic plates, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Australian_Plate Indo-Australian_Plate] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate Eurasia] [[(Sunda Plate)]]. The Australian plate was moved northward and subducted under the Eurasian plate. The subduction zone can be traced from northern tip of Sumatra until the Lesser Islands, that creates deep submarine trench. Most of the earthquake also concentrate in this subduction zone. This subduction also trigger the formation of volcanic range from Sumatra, Java to Lesser Islands. 

The center part of Indonesia also experienced another subduction of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_plate Pacific plate] that move southwesterly under the Eurasian plate. This subduction create the formation of volcanoes in the North Sulawesi, Sangihe and Halmahera.

The Australian and Pacific plate collides in the eastern part of Indonesia and formed the mountain range in Papua, with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carstenz_Pyramid Puncak Jaya / Carstenz Pyramide] as the highest peak.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types of Resources for Professional Development and Learning==
At some level reflection on practice is something you must do for yourself, since only you have had your particular teaching experiences, and only you can choose how to interpret and make use of them. But this rather individual activity also benefits from the stimulus and challenge offered by fellow professionals. Others’ ideas may differ from your own, and they can therefore help in working out your own thoughts and in alerting you to ideas that you may otherwise take for granted. These benefits to reflection can happen in any number of ways, but most fall into one of four general categories:

* talking and collaborating with colleagues,
* participating in professional associations,
* attending professional development workshops and conferences, and
* reading professional literature.
In the next sections we explore what each of these activities has to offer.

===Colleagues as a Resource===
Perhaps the simplest way to stimulate reflections about your own teaching is to engage fellow teachers or other colleagues in dialogue (or thoughtful conversation) about teaching and learning: What do ''you'' think of this kind of experience? Have you ever had one like it yourself, and what did you make of it? Note that to be helpful in stimulating reflection, these conversations need to be largely about educational matters, not about personal ones (“What movie did you see last night?”). Dialogues with individual colleagues have certain advantages to more complex or formal professional experiences. Talking with an individual generally allows more participation for both of you, since only two people may need to express their views. It also can provide a measure of safety or confidentiality if your conversation partner is a trusted colleague; sometimes, therefore, you can share ideas of which you are not sure, or that may be controversial.

A somewhat more complex way of stimulating reflection is ''group study''. Several teachers at a school gather regularly to bring themselves up to date on a new curriculum, for example, or to plan activities or policies related to a schoolwide theme (e.g. “the environment”). Group meetings often result in considerable dialogue among the members about the best ways to teach and to manage classrooms, as well as stories about students’ behavior and learning experiences. For a beginning teacher, group study can be a particularly good way to learn from experienced, veteran teachers.

Sharing of ideas becomes even more intense if teachers ''collaborate'' with each other about their work on an extended basis. Collaboration can take many forms; in one form it might be “team teaching” by two or more teachers working with one group of students, and in another form it might be two or more teachers consulting regularly to coordinate the content of their courses. Collaborations work best when each member of the team brings responsibilities and expertise that are unique, but also related to the other members’ responsibilities. Imagine, for example, a collaboration between Sharon, who is a middle-years classroom teacher, and Pat, who is a resource teacher—one whose job is to assist classroom teachers in working with students with educational disabilities or special needs. If Pat spends time in Sharon’s classroom, then not only will the students benefit, but they both may learn from each other’s presence. Potentially, Pat can learn the details of the middle-years curriculum and learn more about the full range of students’skills—not just those of students having difficulties. Sharon can get ideas about how to help individuals who, in a classroom context, seem especially difficult to help. Achieving these benefits, of course, comes at a cost: the two teachers may need to take time not only for the students, but also for talking with each other. Sometimes the time-cost can be reduced somewhat if their school administrators can arrange for a bit of extra planning and sharing time. But even if this does not happen, the benefits of collaboration will be very real, and often make the investment of time worthwhile.

===Professional Associations and Professional Development Activities===
Another way to stimulate reflection about teaching is by joining and participating in '''professional associations'''—organizations focused on supporting the work of teachers and on upholding high standards of teaching practice. [[Table 13-1]] lists several major professional associations related to education and their Internet addresses. Most of them are composed of local branches or chapters serving the needs of a particular city, state, or region.

To achieve their purposes, a professional association provides a mixture of publications, meetings, and conferences intended for the professional development of educators, including classroom teachers. Typically the publications include either a relatively frequent newsletter or a less frequent journal focused on issues of practice or research. Very large associations often publish more than one newsletter or journal, each of which is focused on a particular topic or type of news (for example, the [[http://www.nea.org National Education Association ]] in the United States publishes eight separate periodicals). Some also publish online journals (there are several listed as part of [[Table 13-2]]) or online versions of print journals. Whatever format they take, professionally sponsored publications stimulate thinking by discussing issues and dilemmas faced by professional educators, and sometimes also by presenting recent educational research and the recommendations for teaching that flow from that research. We discuss ways of using these publications further in the next section of this chapter.

The meetings and conferences sponsored by a professional association also take a variety of forms. Depending on the size of the association and on the importance of the topic, a meeting could be as short as a one half-day workshop or as long as a full week with many sessions occurring simultaneously. Sometimes, too, an association might sponsor a more extended course—a series of meetings focused on one topic or problem of concern to teachers, such as classroom management or curriculum planning. In some cases, the course might carry university credit, though not always.

As you might expect, the size of a professional association makes a difference in kinds of professional development experiences it can provide. In general, the smaller the association, the more exclusively it focuses on local news and educational needs, both in its publications and in its meetings or other activities. At a professional development workshop sponsored by a local teachers’ association, for example, you are relatively likely to see colleagues and acquaintances not only from your own school, but from other neighboring schools. Locally sponsored events are also more likely to focus on local issues, such as implementing a new system for assessing students’ learning within the local schools. In general, too, local events tend to cost less to attend, in both time and money.

By the same token, the larger the association, the more its professional development opportunities are likely to focus on large-scale trends in education, such as the impact of the No Child Left Behind legislation we discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|Chapter 1]] or the latest trends in using computer technology for teaching. Conferences or other professional development events are more likely to span several days and to be located outside the immediate town or region whether you live and work. You may therefore see fewer of your everyday colleagues and acquaintances, but you may also have a greater incentive to make new acquaintances whose interests or concerns are similar to your own. The event is also more likely to feature educators who are well-known nationally or internationally, and to call attention to educational trends or issues that are new or unfamiliar.

Whether large or small, the activities of professional associations can stimulate thinking and reflecting about teaching. By meeting and talking with others at a meeting of an association, teachers learn new ideas for teaching, become aware of emerging trends and issues about education, and confront assumptions that they may have made about their own practices with students. Professional meetings, conferences, and workshops can provide these benefits because they draw on the expertise and experience of a wide range of professionals—usually wider than is possible within a single school building. But compared simply to talking with your immediate colleagues, they have a distinct disadvantage: they take effort and a bit of money to attend, and sometimes they are available at convenient times. Well-balanced professional development should therefore also include activities that are available frequently, but that also draw on a wide range of expertise. Fortunately, an activity with these features is often easily at hand: the reading of professional publications about educational research and practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Reading and Understanding Professional Articles== 
Although publications about educational issues and research can take many forms, they tend to serve three major purposes in some sort of combination. A publication could either:
# provide a framework for understanding teaching and learning,
# offer advice about how to teach, or
# advocate particular ideas or practices about education.
Benefiting from a professional publication depends partly on understanding which of these purposes a particular article or book is emphasizing.

===Three Purposes of Educational Publications===
Consider the first purpose, to ''provide a framework for understanding teaching and learning'' (Hittleman and Simon, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Hittleman, D. &amp; Simon, A. (2005). ''Interpreting educational research, 4th edition.'' Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;.  A &quot;framework&quot; in this context means a perspective or general viewpoint for understanding specific events and actions. They are much like the theories described earlier in this book, though not always as formal or broad. A published article might propose, for example, a way of understanding why certain students are disrespectful in spite of teachers’ efforts to prevent such behaviour (perhaps they are reinforced by peers for being disrespectful). It might offer evidence supporting this perspective. In doing so, the author provides a sort of “theory of disrespectful behavior,” though he or she may not call it a theory explicitly.

A second purpose is to ''offer advice about appropriate teaching practices.'' An article intended for this purpose, for example, might suggest how to introduce reading instruction to first-graders, or how to use fiction to teach high school history, or how to organize a class to include a student with a disability. Often giving such advice overlaps with the first purpose, providing a framework for understanding, since thinking about an educational issue in a particular way may imply certain ways of dealing with it in practice.

A third purpose of a published article is to ''advocate ideas and persuade others'' to take actions benefiting students and society.  It might take a position about important issues in education: Is it a good idea or not to retain (or hold back) a student in grade level for another year if the student fails the curriculum the first time?  Should schools teach about sexuality? Should girls learn science in classrooms separate from boys? In advocating for ideas or policies about such matters, the article may express concern about what is good, ethical or desirable in education, not just about what is factually true or practical. The author may seek explicitly to persuade readers of the author’s point of view. These features do not mean, however, that you need to give up thinking for yourself. On the contrary, when reading an advocacy-oriented article, reflection may be especially important.

Whatever its purpose—understanding, advice, or advocacy—an article or book about a professional issue can stimulate thinking about what you know and believe about teaching and learning. It should therefore create, rather than undermine, your individuality as a teacher.  Think of professional reading as a dialogue or conversation about education:  some of the comments in the conversation will probably be more helpful than others, but each participant contributes somehow, even if none can give a final answer or everlasting truth. It is the same with publications; some may be more helpful than others, but none will be so perfect that you can afford to cease further reading or further thinking. If you are about to begin a teaching career, for example, you may be especially interested in anything published about classroom management, but less interested in the problems of administering schools or in the political issues that usually accompany educational systems.  Yet some publications may discuss these latter issues anyway, and eventually you may find yourself more concerned about them than at the start of a career. Your job, as a reflective teacher, will be sort out the currently useful articles (or parts of articles) from ones you cannot use immediately.

To experience educational publications in this way, however, you must think of the authors as your collaborators as well as general authorities.  As a reader, you need to assume that you are entitled to consider an author’s ideas, but not obligated to accept it without question. There are several strategies for developing this attitude, but to keep the discussion focused, we will look at just two. We have already discussed the first strategy, which is to understand the purposes of any particular piece of research which you encounter, in order to assess its current usefulness to your daily work and your long-term professional goals. We have already indicated several general purposes of educational research publications, but we will go into more detail about this in the next section. The second strategy for relating to authors as collaborators is to think about how you yourself might contribute to professional knowledge by engaging in research of your own, even as a classroom teacher—an activity often called '''action research''' (Mills, 2006; Stringer, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Mills, G. (2006). ''Action research: A guide for the teacher researcher, 3rd edition.'' New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stringer, E. (2007). ''Action research, 3rd edition.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;. At the end of this chapter we discuss what action research involves, and how you might consider using it.

===Authors’ Assumptions about Readers===
Authors of professional articles and books also make assumptions about their readers, and it helps to be aware of these while you read. The assumptions affect the style, content, and significance of the author’s ideas in ways that are both obvious and subtle.

One assumption is about the ''response which an author expects'' from you, the reader:  does he or she expect you actually to do something new, or simply to consider doing something new?  Or does the author just want you to be aware of a new idea?  Consider, for example, an article reviewing best practices about inclusion of students with special needs. The author may imply, or even urge you to take a moral position:  you should include these students, the author may seem to say.  But in a different article—one recommending particular teaching practices—the author may merely ask you to think about alternatives to your normal ways of teaching. Certain strategies worked under certain teaching conditions, the author says, so simply consider whether they might work for you as well.

A second, less obvious difference among professional publications is in their unstated ''assumptions about prior experiences and attitudes'' of readers.  This assumption may be either helpful or frustrating, depending on you actual prior background. A piece intended as a “framework for understanding” may assume, for example, that you are familiar with basic theories of learning already. If you have read and understood what we outlined in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]], about basic learning theories, the article may turn out to be relatively accessible or understandable to you even if you have relatively little experience in actual classroom teaching, and even if you have never studied learning theories in detail.  The article might seem more accessible than expect because, for example, it focuses primarily on how teacher's praise affects students' learning, an idea with which you may be somewhat familiar already.

On the other hand, a professional publication may assume that you have taught school for a number of years already, or that you are at least familiar with classroom life from the point of view not of students, but of a teacher. An author writing about ''&quot;withitness&quot;'' (discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|Chapter 7]]), for example, may make this assumption, since the concept originated by observing teachers managing large group classroom activities. If you yourself are experienced at actual teaching, reading about withitness may trigger a lot of questions about just how ''withit'' teachers are able to be in practice, and about whether in fact they always need to be ''withit''. You can also ask yourself these questions even if you have not yet been a teacher yourself, of course, but they may seem less immediate or urgent.

A professional article intended to advocate for a particular educational policy or practice may make very different assumptions about you as a reader. It may assume, for example, that you do in fact enjoy persuading others of your point of view, even when others initially disagree or react indifferently.  This sort of assumption may show up as much in what the writing omits, as in what it includes:  if the term ''cooperative learning activity'' is used without explanation, for example, the researcher may be assuming not only that you are the sort of person--perhaps a teacher--who knows what that term means already, but also that you already believe in the value of cooperative learning and are motivated to explain its value to others.

In making these distinctions among published articles, keep in mind a point we made at the outset: that an individual article usually serves more than one purpose at a time and makes more than one assumption about your prior knowledge and about how you are supposed to respond to the article. The differences are only about emphasis. To illustrate these ideas about the purposes and effects of research, look in [[../Examples of Professional Publications|the next section]] at three examples of actual published articles relevant to education.  The studies are not a full cross-section of educational research or publications, but they do suggest some the variety possible (and necessary) among them.  Each example serves a mixture of purposes, but also emphasizes one purpose in particular (perspective-taking, teaching recommendations, or advocacy) described earlier.  The authors of each example also particular assumptions about you, the reader—about the intellectual work which the authors expect you to do and about the motivations which they assume you have or hope that you will acquire. For each example, we describe the reactions of one of us (Kelvin Seifert) as he read the article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As stated in [[../Understanding Professional Articles|the previous section]], the authors of each of the following examples make particular assumptions about you, the reader. They expect you to have particular background knowledge, to have particular goals, and to do particular intellectual work in reading their material.

===Example #1:  How Do Children Acquire Moral Commitments?===
In 1997, Herbert Saltzstein and several colleagues published a research-oriented article about how children acquire moral beliefs (Saltzstein, et al., 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Saltzstein, H., Millery, M., Eisenberg, Z., Dias, M., &amp; O’Brien, D. (1997). Moral heteronomy in context: Interviewer influence in New York City and Recife, Brazil. In H. Saltzstein (Ed.), ''New directions in child development: Culture as a context for moral development,'' pp. 37-50. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;. The group of researchers were all graduate students and professors of psychology, working mostly at the City University of New York.  When one of the contributors to this Wikibook, [[User talk: Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]], read of their affiliation with psychology, he suspected that they would talk about moral beliefs in general, and not necessarily about moral issues in classrooms, such as cheating or treating classmates with care and respect. Still, the article interested Kelvin as a former and current teacher, because he had long been concerned with fostering qualities like integrity, honesty, cooperation, and loyalty in students. If Kelvin could find out about the mechanism or process by which children acquire mature moral beliefs, he reasoned, maybe he could modify his teaching to take advantage of that knowledge.

So Kelvin began reading the article.  He discovered some parts were challenging and required careful reflection, whereas others were easier to read.  One of the most challenging passages came almost immediately, in the second and third paragraphs; these paragraphs, it seemed, required a bit of prior knowledge about theories of moral development.  But Kelvin was willing to concentrate more fully on these paragraphs, because he expected that they might clarify the rest of the study.  Here are the paragraphs (in italics), followed by some of Kelvin’s thoughts as he read them:

:''We began by re-examining the phenomenon of heteronomy, Piaget's assertion (1932/1965) following Kant (1785/1959) that young children equate moral obligation with deference to authority when justifying their moral judgments.  The concept is important because it is central to the organismic account of moral development as a series of differentiations and integrations....[p. 37]''

:::This was one of the difficult paragraphs, perhaps especially because Kelvin had never read the specific book by Piaget or by the philosopher Kant. But Kelvin did recall reading, at various times over the years, ''about'' Piaget's views on moral development.  Piaget believed that at first, children define morality in terms of what adults think:  an action is &quot;good&quot; if and only if adults (e.g. parents) consider it good, and &quot;bad&quot; if and only if adults consider it bad.  This is the idea of &quot;heteronomy&quot; that Saltzstein is referring to. Children, in this view, take quite awhile to develop or &quot;grow&quot; into truly autonomous moral beliefs. Autonomous beliefs form slowly out of earlier beliefs, in the way that a young plant or animal might grow.  This is the &quot;organismic account of moral development&quot; that Saltzstein is talking about.

:''...This account has been challenged by Turiel's &quot;domain theory&quot; (Turiel, 1983).  According to Turiel and his colleagues, even young children intuitively distinguish moral from conventional rules. [p. 37]''

:::Here was an idea that was intriguing! Saltzstein and his colleagues were pointing to research (by the person cited, named Turiel) that suggests that even preschoolers know the difference between truly moral rules and merely conventional rules.  Apparently they believe, for example, that it would be wrong to steal toys or to hit someone, even if adults gave you permission to do so.  But apparently they also know that it would be OK for traffic lights to use different colors--for red to mean &quot;go&quot; and green to mean &quot;stop&quot;—provided that everyone agreed on changing the rule.  That is what the researcher named Turiel apparently meant by distinguishing convention from morality.

The introduction continued in this academically challenging style for about two pages, requiring Kelvin to read slowly and carefully in order to understand its points.  Kelvin was not discouraged from continuing, though, because he wanted to find out more about how, in general, children acquire moral beliefs.  Did moral beliefs take time to develop-- did they &quot;grow&quot; on children slowly after initially being borrowed from parents or other adults?  In this case, then maybe Kelvin owed it to his students to adopt and express desirable moral attitudes myself, so as to provide a good model for their developing beliefs.  Or were students’ key moral beliefs already in place when they entered school--almost as if &quot;hard wired&quot; in their minds, or at least already learned during infancy and the preschool years?  In this second case, it might still be desirable for Kelvin to adopt positive moral attitudes, but not for the purpose of modeling them for students. Students already “hard wired” for key moral beliefs might not need a model so much as an enforcer of desirable moral behaviors.  Concerning the issue of cheating, for example, the students might already understand the undesirable nature and implications of this behavior.  As a result they might not need demonstrations of honest integrity from their teacher as much as affirmations from the teacher of the importance of honesty and integrity, along with consistent enforcement of appropriate sanctions against cheating when it did occur.

For Kelvin, therefore, the outcomes of research on moral development--including Saltzstein's that he was currently reading--posed issues of classroom management, both in university classrooms and in public school classrooms.  So Kelvin read on.  Saltzstein proposed resolving the issues about the origins of moral development by distinguishing between moral ''conflicts'' and ''moral dilemmas'':

:''Moral conflicts are conflicts between moral duty or right and a non-moral desire.  An example might be the conflict between whether to return a wallet to its rightful owner or keep the coveted wallet with its extra cash.  In contrast, moral dilemmas are conflicts involving two moral rights or duties.  For example, [a person might feel a dilemma between] whether to steal a drug to save a spouse's life. [p. 38]''

:::The distinction between conflicts and dilemmas looked promising to Kelvin.  Moral conflicts looked fairly simple in cognitive terms, even if they were sometimes difficult emotionally.  The &quot;right&quot; action was obvious.  Moral dilemmas were more complex cognitively as well as emotionally, because two &quot;goods&quot; were being weighed against each other.  The moral alternatives might both be right and wrong at the same time, and their relative &quot;rightness&quot; might not be immediately obvious.

Saltzstein and his colleagues proposed that when young children show awareness of moral rules, they may be doing so in the simpler context of moral conflicts.  A young child might believe that you should return a dollar to its owner, even if the child has trouble in practice overcoming a selfish impulse to keep the dollar.  The same child might have trouble deciding, however, whether it is &quot;right&quot; to inform his teacher if a best friend has cheated on a test.  In that case two moral principles compete for attention--honesty and loyalty to a friend.  To sort out the implications of choosing between these principles, a young child might need to rely on older, wiser minds, such as parents or other adults.  And the minute that he or she does so, the child is showing the moral heteronomy that Piaget used to write about and that Saltzstein referred to early in the article.

Understanding these ideas took effort, but once Kelvin began figuring them out, the rest of the article was easier to follow.  In reading the remaining pages, he noted in passing that the researchers used several techniques common in educational research.  For example, they interviewed participants, a common way of gathering systematic information about individuals' thinking.  They also imposed ''controls'' on their procedures and on the selection of participants.  Procedures were controlled, for example, by posing the same three moral dilemmas and to all participants, so that individuals' responses could be compared meaningfully.  The selection of participants was controlled by selecting two age groups for deliberate comparison with each other--one that was seven years old and the other that was eleven. Since the researchers wanted to generalize about moral development as much as possible, but obviously could not interview every child in the world, they also ''sampled'' participants:  they selected a manageable number (sixty-five, to be exact) from the larger student population of one particular school.  In a second part of the investigation, they also selected a comparable number of children of the same two ages (7 and 11) from the city of Recife, located in Brazil.  The Brazilian group's responses were compared deliberately with the American group's, in order to allow for the impact of cultural beliefs on moral development in general.

Kelvin recognized this research strategy as an example of using ''control groups''.  In research terms, the Brazilian group &quot;controlled for&quot; the impact of American culture on children's moral beliefs.  And vice versa:  the American group controlled for the impact of Brazilian culture on children's moral beliefs.  Altogether, these techniques helped insure that the interviews of children's moral beliefs really illustrated what they were supposed to illustrate--that they were '''reliable''' and '''valid,''' in the senses that we discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments|Chapter 11]].  As Kelvin noticed Saltzstein's attention to good research techniques, he gained confidence in Saltzstein’s observations and in the interpretations that the authors made from them.

What did Saltzstein and his colleagues find out--or more to the point, what did Kelvin Seifert learn from what Saltzstein and his colleagues wrote about?  There were three ideas that occurred to Kelvin.  One was that in everyday life, children probably deal with moral beliefs of all levels of cognitive complexity, and not just &quot;simple&quot; moral conflicts and &quot;complex&quot; moral dilemmas.  Saltzstein found that children's solutions to moral dilemmas depended a lot on the content of the dilemma.  Children advocated strongly for truthfulness in some situations (for example, in deciding whether to tell the teacher about a friend's cheating), but not in other situations (like in deciding whether to back up a friend who is being teased and who has lied in an effort to stop the teasing).  But it was rare for all children to support any one moral principle completely; they usually supported a mix.

Another idea that Kelvin learned from Saltzstein's research was about how children expressed moral heteronomy versus moral autonomy.  Age, it seemed, did not affect the beliefs that children stated; younger and older children took similar positions on all dilemmas initially.  But age did affect how steadfastly children held to initial beliefs.  Younger children were more easily influenced to switch opinions when an adult &quot;cross-examined&quot; with probing questions; older children were more likely to keep to their initial position.  Moral heteronomy was revealed not by a child's views as such, but by the kind of dialogue a child has with adults.

A third idea that Kelvin learned was about children's perceptions of adults' moral beliefs.  Saltzstein found that even though older children (the 11-year-olds) showed more moral autonomy (were more steadfast) than younger children, they tended to believe that adults thought about moral issues in ways similar to children who were ''younger''. In the &quot;teasing&quot; dilemma mentioned above, for example, the 11-year-olds opted much more often than 7-year-olds for remaining loyal to a friend, even though doing so meant further untruthfulness with peers.  Yet the 11-year-olds also more often stated a belief that adults would resolve the same dilemma in a way characteristic of 7-year-olds--that is, by telling the truth to peers and thus betraying loyalty to a friend.  This finding puzzled Kelvin.  Why should older, and presumably more insightful, children think that adults are more like younger children than like themselves?  Saltzstein suggested an interpretation, however, that helped him make sense of the apparent inconsistency:
 
:''...Consistent with our past research, children attributed the kinds of moral choices made by younger children to adults.  In our view, this finding tends to support a constructivist rather than a [social modeling] view of morality, which would predict that the child's judgments mirror (or develop toward) their representation of adult judgments. [p. 41]''
 
:::In other words, thought Kelvin, if children learned moral beliefs by imitating (or modeling themselves after) parents or other adults, then they ought to see themselves as resembling adults more and more as they get older.  Instead, they see themselves as resembling adults ''less'', at least during middle childhood.  This would happen only if they were preoccupied with &quot;constructing&quot; their own beliefs on the basis of their experiences, and therefore failed to notice that adults might also have constructed beliefs similar to their own.
 
====Relevance: A Framework for Understanding Moral Development====
The article by Saltzstein offered a way to understand how children develop moral beliefs, and especially to understand the change from moral heteronomy to moral autonomy.  By imposing controls on the procedures (uniform interviews) and on the selection of participants (particular ages, particular societies or cultures), the researchers eliminated certain sources of ambiguity or variability in children's responses.  By framing their project in terms of previous theories of moral development (Piaget’s, Turiel’s), furthermore, they made it easier to interpret their new results in the general terms of these theories as well.  In these ways the investigation aspired to provide a general perspective about children's moral development. Providing a framework for understanding, you recall, is one of the major purposes of many professional publications.

But note that the authors paid a price for emphasizing this purpose. By organizing their work around existing general theory and research, they had to assume that readers already had some knowledge of that theory and research.  This is not an unreasonable assumption if the readers are expected to be fellow researchers; after all, many of them make a living by &quot;knowing the literature&quot; of psychology. But assuming such knowledge can be an obstacle if the authors intend to communicate with non-psychologists:  in that case, either the authors must make more of an effort to explain the relevant background research, or readers must educate themselves about the research.  The latter activity is not necessarily difficult (the background knowledge for Saltzstein's work, for example, took me only a few paragraphs to explain in writing), but it must be done to make full sense of research that tries to provide a universal framework of psychological knowledge.

====The Reader's Role:  Interested Observer of Children====
In conducting and reporting their research, Saltzstein and his colleagues were not presenting themselves as school teachers, nor were they expecting readers necessarily to respond as teachers.  As they put it in the first paragraph of the article, they sought to offer ''&quot;a more contextualized perspective for understanding the development of moral judgments&quot;'' [p. 37].  Unlike most teachers, they seemed indifferent to recommending how children's moral judgments ought to be fostered.  Observation of children was their purpose, not intervention.  The meaning of the term &quot;contextualized perspective&quot; was not obvious to Kelvin when he first read it, but eventually it became clearer: they were talking about the importance of distinguishing among types of moral decisions and moral beliefs. They did sometimes note information relevant to teaching--for example, they pointed out that for cultural reasons, teachers in Brazil do not command high respect and therefore compared to American children, Brazilian children may feel less compelled to tell the truth to their teachers.  But this comment was not the primary focus of their research, nor did the authors discuss what (if anything) it might imply about teaching in the United States.

Yet the non-teaching perspective of the article did not keep Kelvin, a long-time school teacher and current university teacher, from reflecting on the article in terms of its educational relevance.  As we mentioned already, Kelvin was attracted to the article because of his own concerns about character development in students--how do they acquire moral beliefs and commitments, and how should he help them in doing so?  Kelvin did not really expect to find an answer to the second of these questions, given the &quot;observation&quot; orientation of the authors.  He did hope to find an answer to the first, although even here he also expected that to make allowances for the fact that research interviews are not usually identical to classroom situations.  Children might respond differently when interviewed individually by a researcher, compared to how they might respond to a teacher in class.  Or perhaps not.  So in reflecting on the article, Kelvin had to note the context and purposes of Saltzstein's study, and to remind himself that once a teacher went beyond simply observing children to intervening on their behalf, the teacher might be led to different conclusions about children’s moral development.  But in spite of these cautions--or maybe because of them--Kelvin found much food for thought in the article related to teaching.

===Example #2:  Learning Disability as a Misleading Label===
In 2006, Ray McDermott, Shelley Goldman, and Hervé Varenne published an article that discussed the use of disability categories in education&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R., Goldman, S., &amp; Varenne, H. (2006). The cultural work of learning disabilities. ''Educational Researcher, 35''(6), 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;. The article attracted Kelvin’s attention because he had been concerned for a long time about the ambiguities of disability categories (see [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs|Chapter 5]] of this book) as well as about their potential for stigmatizing individuals. He expected the article to document additional problems with labeling when a student is from a non-White ethnic group. Kelvin’s expectation was fulfilled partially, but he was surprised also to encounter an additional and tougher message in the article. Here is how the study began (again, printed in ''italics''):

:''Since about 1850…classifying human beings by mental ability, accurately or not, has been a politically rewarded activity. Those with power have placed others, usually the downtrodden, into ability and disposition groups that they cannot escape… People who live together in a culture must struggle constantly with the constraints…of systems of classification and interpretation used in the culture.''

:::Kelvin had a mixed reaction to this opening. In one way it seemed to say something familiar—that classification systems (such as categories for disabilities) may create problems for individuals. But the tone of the paragraph sounded more severely critical than Kelvin had expected: it was saying that power governed all classifications, implying that misclassifications may be widespread or even universal.  

Kelvin’s initial hunch was therefore that the article would express a radically critical view of disability classifications—particularly as they affect the “downtrodden,” which presumably included children from minority ethnic groups. His expectation proved correct as the authors explained their point of view, which they called a cultural approach to understanding disability. Using learning disabilities (LD) as an example, here is how they explained their position:

:''We are not as interested in LD behavior as in the preoccupations—as seen from the level of classroom organization—of all those adults who are professionally poised to discover LD behavior. We are less interested in the characteristics of LD children than in the cultural arrangements that make an LD label relevant.''

:::At this point Kelvin was not sure if he wanted to continue reading the article because it seemed like it might not be relevant to classroom life specifically. It also implied a severe criticism of professional educators—implied that they are too eager to find examples of LD and for this reason may misclassify students. On the other hand, Kelvin was already aware that LD are an especially ambiguous category of disability; maybe the article would help to show why. So he kept reading.

The authors continued by outlining the history of LD as a category of disability, describing this category as an outgrowth of the general intelligence testing movement during the twentieth century. By the 1970s, they argued, the concept of LD offered a way to classify children with academic difficulties without having to call the children mentally disabled. Because of this fact, the LD category was needed—literally—by well-off parents who did not want their children treated or educated as children with mental disabilities. LD as a concept and category came to be applied primarily to children from the White middle-class, and mental disability became, by default, the equivalent category for the non-White and poor.

To support this assertion, the authors reported a classroom observation of three non-White boys—Hector, Ricardo, and Boomer—while they worked together to design an imaginary research station in Antarctica. Citing actual transcripts of conversation while the boys worked, the authors concluded that all three boys showed intelligence and insight about the assignment, but that the teacher was only aware of the contributions of one of the boys. Hector systematically hid his knowledge from the teacher’s view by getting Boomer to speak for their group; Ricardo participated well in the group work but was rarely acknowledged by the other two boys. Boomer received considerable praise from the teacher, thanks to his speaking for the group. Yet the teacher was never aware of these subtleties. The authors blamed her oversight not on the teacher herself, but on an educational and cultural system that leads educators to classify or typify students too quickly or easily. Here is how they put it:

:''The American classroom is well organized for the production of display of failure, one child at a time if possible, but group by group if necessary…Even if the teacher manages to treat every child as capable, the children can hammer each other into negative status; and even if both…resist dropping everyone into predefined categories, the children’s parents can take over, demanding more and more boxes with which to specify kinds of kids doing better than other kinds of kids. In such a classroom, if there were no LD categories, someone would have to invent them.''

:::When Kelvin read this conclusion, he did not really disagree, but he did feel that it was beside the point for most teachers. Maybe children do get classified too easily, he thought, but a teacher’s job is not just to lament this possibility, as the authors seemed to be doing. Instead their job is to help the real, live children for whom they have daily responsibility. What teachers need are therefore suggestions to avoid misclassifying students by overlooking key information about them. Kelvin wished, at the end, that the authors had made some of these suggestions.

====Relevance: A Critical Framework====
In this study the authors offered a sort of backhanded framework of thinking about categories of disability; or more precisely they offered a framework for understanding what the categories are ''not''. In essence they said that disability categories describe qualities “in” students only in the sense that educators and others happen to think of disability categories in this way. An equally reasonable way to think about disabilities, they argued, is that modern society is organized so that its citizens have to be classified for many different reasons. Educators are simply helping to implement this society-wide expectation. A frequent result in classrooms is that teachers classify students too easily and that key evidence of students’ capacity is overlooked.

In making this argument, the authors implied an indirect recommendation about how to teach, though the recommendation actually focused on what teachers should not do. Instead of (mis)identifying children with learning difficulties, the authors implied, teachers and other educators should stop concerning themselves with classifying children, and seek to reorganize classrooms and schools so that classification is less important. “Change the school,” they wrote, “and LD becomes less relevant.” This conclusion may be an important reminder, but it is not especially helpful as a recommendation to practicing teachers, who usually need to know about more than what to avoid.

====The Readers’ Role: Concerned Advocate for Social Justice====
It is not surprising that the article lacked concrete recommendations for teaching, given that the authors seemed to speak to readers not as classroom teachers, but as general critics of society who are concerned about fairness or social justice. Their comments made two assumptions: first, that readers will want to minimize unfair stereotypes of students, and second, that readers will seek greater fairness in how teachers treat students. For readers who happen to be teachers themselves, the first of these assumptions is a reasonable one; most of us would indeed like to minimize unfair stereotyping of students. The second is also reasonable, but perhaps not in a way that the authors intended. Teachers probably do try their best to treat students fairly and respectfully. Their responsibilities usually mean, however, that they can only do this conveniently with their own students; the time available to work toward general social justice is often limited. (As you might suspect, Kelvin was not fully satisfied after he finished reading this article!)

===Example #3:  The Impact of Bilingualism on Reading===
In 1995, three education professors--Robert Jiménez, Georgia García, and David Pearson--published a study about the impact of bilingualism on children's ability to read English (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Jimenez, R., Garcia, G., &amp; Pearson, D. (1995). Three children, two languages and strategic reading: Case studies in bilingual/monolingual reading. ''American Educational Research Journal, 32''(1), 67-98.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The three specialized in curriculum studies, literacy acquisition, and bilingual language development, and were therefore motivated by a concern for the academic success of bilingual children and especially by concern for identifying why bilingual children sometimes have difficulty learning to read English.  Too much research on bilingualism, they argued, was based on what they called a &quot;deficit&quot; framework:  it focused on what bilingual children lacked compared to monolinguals.  They sought an alternative framework, one focused on bilingual students' competence, and especially on their competence to read a second language.

To search for this alternative, the researchers mounted a large research program, and the article published in 1995 was one of the studies resulting from this research.  It caught Kelvin’s interest not only because of its topic, but because of its approach.  Instead of surveying dozens of students with a questionnaire, as researchers sometimes do, these investigators relied on just three students studied intensively.  Each student became a case study and included detailed, lengthy observations and interviews of that particular student. Each student was chosen deliberately for a particular purpose.  One was a highly proficient reader who was also bilingual (Spanish and English); a second was a marginally proficient reader who was bilingual (Spanish and English); and a third was a highly proficient reader who was monolingual in English.  To qualify for the study, furthermore, each student had to be comfortable reflecting on and talking about their own reading processes, so that the authors could interview them at length on this topic.  The researchers asked each student to read six one-page passages in English and (where relevant) in Spanish.  They invited all three to think aloud about their reading as they went along, commenting on how they figured out particular words or passages.  The oral readings and think-aloud commentaries were taped and transcribed, and became the information on which the authors based their conclusions and recommendations.

Using these procedures, Jiménez, García, and Pearson discovered important differences among the three girls.  The proficient bilingual, Pamela, used her growing knowledge of each language to help in learning vocabulary from the other language.  When she encountered the English word ''species,'' for example, she guessed correctly that it meant the same as the similar Spanish word ''especies''; and when she encountered the Spanish ''liquído,'' she guessed correctly that it meant the English ''liquid''.  Her focus on learning vocabulary was stronger than for the proficient monolingual, Michelle, who commented less on specific words than how the overall reading passages related to her prior general knowledge.  The difference presumably stemmed from Michelle's greater familiarity with English vocabulary--so much greater, in fact, that Michelle did not need to think about individual words deliberately.  Both Michelle and Pamela differed, however, from the less-proficient bilingual reader, Christine.  Like Pamela, Christine focused on vocabulary, but she did not think of her native Spanish as a resource for this task.  When reading a Spanish word, she was sometimes reminded of English equivalents (&quot;cognates,&quot; as language teachers call them), but she did not use her much greater knowledge of Spanish to assist with her more limited English.  But she did not search for equivalent words deliberately, as Pamela did.

====Relevance: Recommendations for Teaching English as an Additional Language====
The authors of this article focused more directly on particular learning behaviors than did the authors of the two articles described earlier.  Jimenez and his colleagues emphasized the importance of regarding a child's native language as a strength in the process, not a liability, and they then pointed out the importance of facilitating vocabulary development.  But they did not claim this recommendation to be appropriate for all children or for all forms of bilingualism.  They only focused on a particular pair of languages (Spanish and English in the USA), and on three combinations of skill level in these two languages. These are common bilingual experiences in the United States, but they are not the only ones, either in the United States or elsewhere in the world.

For other bilingual situations, their conclusions might not hold true.  For some students (e.g. Chinese-Americans), the native language and the second language are much more different in vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar than Spanish is to English, and therefore may provide less of a resource to a child learning to read.  And in some settings, relationships between languages are more equal than in the United States.  In Canada, for example, both the numbers and the overall social status of English speakers and French speakers are more equal than in the United States.  In both of these situations, if a child fails to learn to read the second language, it may not be for the reasons suggested by Robert Jiménez, but for other reasons, ranging from difficulties with reading ''per se'' to cultural differences in how a child expects to be taught (Johnson, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M. (2004). ''A philosophy of second language acquisition.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====The Reader's Role: Both Teacher and Researcher====
In the published article describing their research, Jiménez, García, and Pearson assumed that readers have some familiarity with bilingual students and with issues related to teaching reading.  They began their article by describing previous research studies in these areas--more than a dozen of them, in fact.  In the middle they described numerous responses of the three bilingual students to the passages they were asked to read.  At the end of the article they made specific suggestions for teaching, such as &quot;focus more on vocabulary development.&quot; When Kelvin read these various sections, he found that his prior knowledge of and reflections about teaching helped to make sense of them.  But he also found that did not need to be an expert in bilingualism order to understand the authors' messages—he had never, in fact, taught English as a Second Language, nor had he ever conducted research on reading or bilingual language development.

== Estimators and Observers ==

A problem arises in which the internal states of many systems cannot be directly observed, and therefore state feedback is not possible. What we can do is try to design a separate system, known as an '''observer''' or an '''estimator''' that attempts to duplicate the values of the state vector of the plant, except in a way that is observable for use in state feedback. Some literature calls these components &quot;observers&quot;, although they do not strictly observe the state directly. Instead, these devices use mathematical relations to try and determine an estimate of the state. Therefore, we will use the term &quot;estimator&quot;, although the terms may be used interchangeably.

=== Creating an Estimator ===

Notice that we know the ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' matrices of our plant, so we can use these exact values in our estimator. We know the input to the system, we know the output of the system, and we have the system matrices of the system. What we do not know, necessarily, are the initial conditions of the plant. What the estimator tries to do is make the estimated state vector approach the actual state vector quickly, and then mirror the actual state vector. We do this using the following system for an observer:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}' = A\hat{x} + Bu + L(y - \hat{y})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y} = C\hat{x} + Du&lt;/math&gt;

''L'' is a matrix that we define that will help drive the error to zero, and therefore drive the estimate to the actual value of the state. We do this by taking the difference between the plant output and the estimator output.

[[Image:State Feedback with Estimator.svg|center|500px]]

In order to make the estimator state approach the plant state, we need to define a new additional state vector called ''state error signal'' &lt;math&gt;e_x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. We define this error signal as:

:&lt;math&gt;e_x(t) = x - \hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;

and its derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;e_x'(t) = x' - \hat{x}'&lt;/math&gt;

We can show that the error signal will satisfy the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;e_x'(t) = Ax + Bu - (A\hat{x} + Bu - L(y - \hat{y}))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_x'(t) = A(x- \hat{x}) + L(Cx - C\hat{x})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_x'(t) = (A + LC)e_x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We know that if the eigenvalues of the matrix ''(A + LC)'' all have negative real parts that:

:&lt;math&gt;e_x(t) = e^{(A + LC)}e_x(t_0) \to 0 &lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; t \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
This &lt;math&gt;e_x(\infty) = 0&lt;/math&gt; means that the difference between the state of the plant &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the estimated state of the observer &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; tends to fade as time approaches infinity.

=== Separation Principle ===

We have two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;e_x[k + 1] = (A - LC)e_x[k]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x[k + 1] = (A - BK)x[k] + BK \cdot e_x[k]&lt;/math&gt;

We can combine them into a single system of equations to represent the entire system:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}e_x[k + 1] \\ x[k + 1]\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}A - LC &amp; 0 \\ +BK &amp; A - BK\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}e_x[k] \\ x[k]\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can find the characteristic equation easily using the '''separation principle'''. We take the Z-Transform of this digital system, and take the determinant of the coefficient matrix to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation of the whole system is: (remember the well known &lt;math&gt;(zI-A)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}zI - A + LC &amp; 0 \\ -BK &amp; zI - A + BK\end{vmatrix} = |zI - A + LC| |zI - A + BK|&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the determinant of the large matrix can be broken down into the product of two smaller determinants. The first determinant is clearly the characteristic equation of the estimator, and the second is clearly the characteristic equation of the plant. Notice also that we can design the ''L'' and ''K'' matrices independently of one another.

It is worth mentioning that if the order of the system is ''n'', this characteristic equation (full-order state observer plus original system) becomes of order ''2n'' and so has twice the number of roots of the original system.

=== The L Matrix ===

You should select the ''L'' matrix in such a way that the error signal is driven towards zero as quickly as possible. The transient response of the estimator, that is the amount of time it takes the error to approximately reach zero, should be significantly shorter than the transient response of the plant. The poles of the estimator should be, by rule of thumb, at least 2-6 times faster then the poles of your plant. As we know from our study of classical controls, to make a pole faster we need to:

;S-Domain:Move them further away from the imaginary axis (in the Left Half Plane!).
;Z-Domain:Move them closer to the origin.

Notice that in these situations, the faster poles of the estimator will have less effect on the system, and we say that the plant poles dominate the response of the system.

:&lt;math&gt;L = \alpha_e(z)Q\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\ \vdots \\1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''Q'' is the observability matrix of the plant, and &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic equation of your estimator.

This can be computed in MATLAB with the following command:

 L=acker(A', C', K)';

where L is the estimator gain and k is the poles for the estimator.

=== Composite System ===

Once we have our ''L'' and ''K'' matrices, we can put these together into a single composite system equation for the case of state-feedback and zero input:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}x[n + 1]\\ \bar{y}[n]\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; -BK \\ LH &amp; A - BK - LH\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x[n] \\ \bar{x}[n]\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u[n] = -Kx[n]&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the Z-Transform of this discrete system and solving for an input-output relation gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U(z)}{Y(z)} = -K[zI - A + BK +L]^{-1}L&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this is not the same as the transfer function, because the input is on top of the fraction and the output is on bottom. To get the transfer function from this equation we need to take the inverse of both sides. The determinant of this inverse will then be the characteristic equation of the composite system.

Notice that this equation gives us the ability to derive the system input that created the particular output. This will be valuable later.

== Ackerman's Formula ==

Consider a linear feedback system with no reference input:

:&lt;math&gt;u = -Kx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' is a vector of gain elements. Systems of this form are typically referred to as '''regulators'''. Notice that this system is a simplified version of the one we introduced above, except that we are ignoring the reference input. Substituting this into the state equation gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = Ax - BKx&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ackerman's Formula''' gives us a way to select these gain values ''K'' in order to control the location's of the system poles. Using Ackerman's formula, if the system is controllable, we can select arbitrary poles for our regulator system.

{{eqn|Ackerman's Formula}}
:&lt;math&gt;K = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\zeta^{-1}a(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a(z)'' is the desired characteristic equation of the system and &amp;zeta; is the controllability matrix of the original system. The goal of this type of regulator is to drive the state vector to zero. By using a reference input instead of a linear state feedback, we can use the same kind of idea to drive the state vector to any arbitrary state, and to give the system arbitrary poles.

=== Reference Inputs ===

The idea of the system above with a linear feedback and no reference input is to drive the system state vector to zero. If we have a system reference input ''r'', we can define a vector ''N'' that is the desired value for our state. This combined input is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;rN = x_r&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the reference state we want our state ''x'' to reach. Here is a block diagram of a system that uses this kind of state reference:

[[Image:State Feedback with Reference.svg|center|400px]]

We have our gain matrix, ''K'', and our reference input ''rN''. Mathematically, we can show that:

:&lt;math&gt;u = -K(x - x_r)&lt;/math&gt;

In this system, assuming the system is type 1 or higher, we can prove that

:&lt;math&gt;x(\infty) = x_r&lt;/math&gt;

The state will approach the reference state as time approaches infinity.

The Reference Input is calculated in the continuous domain using the below equations:

&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix}N_x \\ N_u\end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix}A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D\end{matrix} \right]^{-1} \left[ \begin{matrix}0 \\ 1\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;


and &lt;math&gt;\bar{N}=N_u+KN_x&lt;/math&gt;

== Reduced-Order Observers ==

In many systems, at least one state variable can be either measured directly, or calculated easily from the output. This can happen in the case where the ''C'' matrix has only a single non-zero entry per system output. 

If one or more state variables can be measured or observed directly, the system only requires a '''reduced-order observer''', that is an observer that has a lower order than the plant. The reduced order observer can estimate the unmeasurable states, and a direct feedback path can be used to obtain the measured state values.

== Adaptive Controllers ==

What we've been studying up till this point are fixed systems, that is systems that do not change over time. However, real-world applications and experience tells us that the environment can change over time: New noise can be added to a signal, the signal quality can be degraded, or the specifications of the signals can be changed at the source.

There is a distinct need then for controllers which can modify themselves to produce the same output regardless of changes to the input. Herein lies the problem of '''adaptive control'''. We will introduce some of the concepts in this chapter, and discuss them in greater detail in future chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Australian Society between 1920 and 1938 ==
==== Introduction ====

After World War I was announced to be over, Australia as a nation was eager to leave the hardships of war behind them. Several introductions to the domestic household that was meant to improve the quality of life such as the automobile and the wireless (radios) were changing the way people lived and shaped the industry around it. This was still the era of traditional social family structure, where man was viewed as the sole bread winner. However, women started to gain independence to a certain extent, although racial tension between natives and settlers remained high. 
The Great Depression in 1929 changed the way Australia operated due to the crash in the global stock markets. This lead to a reaction of events which eventually ended with the unemployment rate higher then ever before, and with Australians turning to sporting legends like Don Bradman for inspiration.

=== Fashion ===

With the new age rapidly approaching, a new age in fashion was also taking flight. When Orville and Wilbur Wright first flew their bi-plane in 1903, little did they know what a world wide phenomenon it would be. Aviation was in, and corsets were out. People not only went to air shows, but also wore aviation equipment wherever they went. Pilots were regarded as heroes, and their planes were seen as a symbol of the perfect modern age. Aviation is still popular, even today. People flock to air shows to watch the latest planes and aircraft in action. The aviation fashion has not continued though. Unfortunately people don’t wear flying suits around town any more, or wear the over sized goggles. 

The Ford Model T was by far the most popular automobile of the 1920s. People flocked to buy them, and Henry Ford’s revolutionary factories could produce them in less than 1 hour. When you went out driving with your family you usually dressed in full driving attire including the goggles. Not only did people think that the goggles meant that they were exclusive in this modern age, but they provided protection for the eyes, as many of the motorcars did not have roofs.

Suits were also very popular. The businessman wore a suit wherever he went, even if he was going off to play a soccer game, or slide down a slippery dip. It was incredibly fashionable to have fair skin. Women would go to extreme measures to keep their skin nice and pale. Parasols and hats were popular fashion accessories and often complemented the long flowing dresses the women wore. 

As the years progressed the fashions began to change. Men no longer wore suits everywhere they went, but donned more relaxed styles of clothing like t-shirts and shorts. Women wore shorter dresses and usually cut their hair in short practical styles.

=== Music ===

The 1920s the  host of musical styles was jazz to soul. Louis Armstrong, perhaps one of the most famous Jazz players of all time, rose to fame in the nightclubs of the 1920s. People eager to forget their sorrow and leave their pasts behind them would not only dance to their favorite tunes, but also with the revolutionary gramophone, listen to their favorite tracks in the comfort of their living rooms.

Movies that incorporated music were now also being released. Ben Hur, the most noted film of the 1920’s, incorporated nearly two whole hours of music in the film, which was met with open arms. The audience could now tell what the film was going to be about, just by listening to the music, due to the emotions that could be invoked with instruments.
The Charleston also became rather famous.

=== Entertainment ===

During the 1920s and 1930s people were coming up with new and exciting ways to keep themselves entertained. Newsreels gave way to cinema with 95% of all movies in Australia coming from Hollywood. This was one of the first signs of the upcoming dominance of America.
Although not many people in our modern day society go for joyrides in their cars, in the 1920s and 1930s going for a ride in your new Model-T or Model-A motorcar was the one of the best family outings there was.
People would often seek out cheap forms of entertainment. Sports games were  affordable and a very exciting way to spend your Saturday afternoon or evening. Soccer, cricket and Australian Rules football were by far the most popular sporting codes and could draw crowds of 20,000 plus. The wireless had justnbeen introduced as well. People could sit down for hours at a time and listen to their set.
Beaches like Bondi were also growing in popularity. People would flock from all across the country to sit on those golden beaches and take a dip in the cool water. This new “beach rush” saw a change in fashion as well. Designers were designing short and practical swim suits for women to swim in.

=== Transport ===

Transport was changing. From wooden carts drawn by horses, to the beautifully designed and crafted model T by Ford, cars were quickly revolutionising the way people were living. They could now go and visit relatives or friends any time they pleased. If they needed to go shopping, they didn’t walk for an hour to get to the shops, simply took a quick drive in their motorcar
.
Henry Ford’s factories could produce thousands of cars every day. The factories were actually giant moving assembly lines. Henry Ford invented the moving assembly line as a way of hiring unskilled workers to produce cars. The moving assembly line was in essence a line that moved. The special thing was that every meter or so, someone would do a little job on the bit of car that was going past. Whether it was screwing in a bolt or putting on a door handle, every job was small and very easy to accomplish. This enabled Ford to avoid paying for skilled workers and pay low wages to the working class. 

By 1921, Australia already has its first Airline, Qantas. These new flying machines could fly across the world in days, not weeks. What used to be a trip on the high seas turned into a pleasant and smooth flight flying as the hawk flew from destination A to B.

Electric trams were also fast revolutionising the way people traveled. The first trams could only travel a few kilometres an hour, but by 1920, they were reaching speeds of up to 30km/h.

=== Technology ===

New advances in the field of technology were taking the world by storm. In Australia the radio or wireless as it was known back then had just hit the airwaves. In 1923 Australia’s first radio station, 2SB, began transmitting. At first users needed to pay a small fee to the government, but this soon changed to lifelong membership. In 1925 60,000 people had subscribed to the radio in Australia. By 1929 over 300,000 people had a radio license.

The gramophone was also gaining popularity. A gramophone is a fancy piece of equipment that plays vinyl records. People liked to sit down much as we do today, and listen to their music pumping through their speakers.
The radio was probably the most noted piece of technology in the period. It boomed growing from the first station to over 200 stations today. Unlike the past however, we can listen free unlike when people who lived back in the 1920s who paid a small fee to the government.

As electricity became more widely used, things like washing machines and hot water started creeping into people’s houses. All of these advances were contributing to a general feeling that society couldn’t really get any better, and people started to buy goods. It was this idea of a perfect society that provided the building block for Henry Ford’s Company. He employed unskilled workers, paid them good salaries and built cars. However, he developed a system to allow unskilled workers to build cars through a moving assembly line. The moving assembly line was his most genius creation. He pulled apart every little job there was in the creation of a car, and then gave that job to someone to do over and over. This enabled him produce thousands of cars everyday and sell them cheaply to the population.

The Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, during the Great Depression. It was an attempt to get the economy flowing again. The bridge, was maybe one of the greatest industrial achievements of the century. It measured over 1 km long and is the longest arch bridge in the world.

=== Sport ===
Sport in the 1920’s was just as prominent as it is now. Australia’s population not only followed professional sport, but played lots of sport themselves. Australians believed everyone should get a fair go, and this simple but just motto, still applies even today.
Cricket, soccer and AFL were Australia’s favourite sports. Cricket, was one of the sports we were really good at. Australians flocked to pitches to see the likes of Gordon Coventry and Sir Donald Bradman. Sir Donald Bradman was a crowd favourite. His quick eye, good coordination, and perfect footwork gave him a freakish ability to score lots of runs, without getting out. It was Heroes like Don who attracted massive crowds to the sporting arenas.
Sport however was sometimes  used to promote bad intentions, Hitler used the 1936 Olympics as a way to promote Aryan supremacy over the world. Unfortunately for him, Athletes like Jesse Owens upset his plan by winning nearly everything they went in.
The wireless radio had a massive impact on the sporting field. People could now follow their favourite individuals or teams, without actually being at the sporting ground. In 1924 people from all over Australia listened to Andrew Charlton win the 1500m swimming finals in Paris.

=== Aboriginal People ===

The 1920s and 1930s were scarred with racism towards the Aboriginal People. The Aboriginal Protection Board was meant to ease the tensions and fix Aboriginal problems. What they did was take away children from their parents and place them in white training institutions called missions. The belief was, if they took the children away, the Aboriginal problems would breed out. 
The generation has now become known as the Stolen Generation. Many of the Stolen Generation have struggled with depression, and some have even taken their own lives. Recently a case was settled for the government to pay compensation for a man who was taken from his parents. This money however is too little and too late.
The Australian government also repossessed sacred Aboriginal land for soldier settlement schemes. Aboriginal soldiers who had served Australia in both World Wars lay forgotten or returned back to racism and hatred that they had faced before the war.
Aboriginals were also subject to horrid working conditions. They often worked for 16 hours a day, and only received a fraction of what the equivalent white man would receive. It was these racial tensions that in 1928, lead to the murder of 31 Aboriginal men, women and children, in supposed self-defence as a team of investigators researched the death of a Dingo Hunter. 
On Australia Day 1938 The Aboriginals commemorated 150 years of white settlement not with a day of celebration but with a day of mourning.

=== Unionism ===

A Trade Union is an organisation which people of a certain skill are part of. Australian worker by the late 19th Century had developed strong Trade Unions. This enabled skilled workers to gain good wages for themselves and feed their hungry families. During World War 1, Trade Unions organised strikes. These strikes were to protest frozen wages that the tradesmen were submitted to.
When the Labor party was torn apart by the conscription issue, Trade Unions received little to no support from the conservative parties and their powers were diminished

=== Summary ===

As you can see, the 1920s and the 1930s were a time of great change. People forgot the old and embraced the new in an attempt to leave the hardship and struggles of the war behind them. New Technology was being created like toasters and cars. The fashion world was seeing great change in the latest fashions. Aboriginals still faced the racial tension from nearly the whole of Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Fill in the missing values in the table. The 
table contains 63 blanks, so we expect a student to solve the table in 90 
minutes.
&lt;p&gt;Note: -
&lt;p&gt;1.) Each of the processes are carried out on 1 
mole of&amp;nbsp; ideal gas.
&lt;p&gt;2.) The odd numbered processes are for monoatomic 
ideal gases, while the rest are for diatomic ideal gases. For a monoatomic ideal 
gas, Cv = (3/2)R and for a diatomic ideal gas, Cv = (5/2)R. Cp = Cv + R, so 
theyre (5/2)R and (7/2)R respectively; not considering the vibrational degrees 
of freedom which we neglect at relatively low temperatures.
&lt;p&gt;3.) Throughout the entire page, &amp;#8747;PextdV implies 
the definite integral over the initial and the final stages as the lower and 
upper limits respectively. It DOES NOT designate the indefinite integral.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel stumped by the 
sheer lack of data in the table, know that this is not an impossible task. It 
is, actually, a mechanical, mindless work. This is mainly because the table 
doesn't require a proper understanding of a process and the related intricacies. 
All it demands is a harmony among the formulae in the student's mind. Filling up 
this table will give a strong practice of the mathematics involved, and will 
also benefit the student in simplifying the more complex numerical problems.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;If you still do not gather any 
courage to fill the table, you should consider solving the introductory 
problems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

== Hints ==

=== Column 1 ===

&lt;p&gt;(a)Pi - Since three of the gas 
parameters are known, the fourth parameter can always be found using the ideal 
gas equation on the initial state.

&lt;p&gt;(b)Tf - Ideal gas equation has 
four parameters, only two are known, so we need one more equation.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a reversible 
adiabatic process, the pressure P and Volume V satisfy the relation (P)(V^y) = 
constant throughout. Also, the ideal gas equation is satisfied throughout in any 
reversible process. PV = nrt. Devide the first equation by the second, and 
you'll find that you just eliminated one unknown - P. It is now left to one 
equation, Ti[Vi^(y-1)] = Tf[Vf^(y-1])&amp;nbsp; and one unknown, Tf.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The final calculations require 
a simple use of log tables. In competitve exams however, the paper setter will 
give all the values of the logarithms involved, so you need not concern yourself 
with the complexity of the calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(c)Pf - Now that three 
quantities in the ideal gas equation are known, you can easily find Pf.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could 
directly find Pf through using P(V^y) = constant on initial and final stages of 
the process, and then used the ideal gas equation to find Tf. Notice that we 
avoided finding Pf when we were asked to find only Tf, by eliminating the 
unknown.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(d)Q - In an adiabatic process, 
the heat exchanged with the sorroundings is ________

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(e)&amp;#8710;E - Internal energy is 
fairly simple for an ideal gas, and depends only upon temperature of the ideal 
gas.&amp;nbsp; It is nCvTf at Tf, and nCvTi at Ti. So the change, then, is 
nCv(Tf-Ti). Try to relate it to the expression for heat gained and heat lost 
learnt in thermal physics in the eleventh and ninth standard in Indian Schools.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(f)w - It is the aditive 
inverse of &amp;#8747;PextdV in Chemistry conventions. In Physics, it is the same as 
&amp;#8747;PextdV. See below on how to find &amp;#8747;PextdV, that is the work done by the gas 
during the change in volume.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(g)&amp;#8747;PextdV - Well, performing 
the whole integration by substituting P is a good idea. P = nrt/v will not work 
because even T will vary. We cannot integrate two variables in this way. 
Instead, substitute P as [Constant]/(V^y) and carry out the integration. After 
the integration is done, substitute the value of constant as Pf(Vf^y) and 
Pi(Vi^y) to get the result in terms of known quantities.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;But, the same work can be done 
in an easy manner! Use the first law, Q = &amp;#8710;E + &amp;#8747;PextdV. You will find that in an 
adiabatic process, since the heat exchanged is 0, &amp;#8747;PextdV becomes the aditive 
inverse of the change in the internal energy. In laymen's terms, since in an 
adiabatic process, the heat input is zero, whatever work that is done by the gas 
comes at the expence of its internal energy (and vice versa). This explaining 
subtly why the First Law Of Thermodynamics is actually the manifestation of the 
law of conservation of energy. &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;**NOTE :: The integral requires 
the value of Pext. In a reversible process, since the External Pressure is the 
same as the internal pressure of a gas, the whole substitution makes sence. 
Remember, Pext is not necessrily equal to nrt/v, but internal pressure = nrt/v.**

&lt;p&gt;(h)&amp;#8710;H - Finally, the enthalpy 
change of the reaction. It is pleasing to know that this again, depends only on 
the change in temperature for an ideal gas. That is, &amp;#8710;H = nCp&amp;#8710;T.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;The First Column, Done!!!
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Column 2 ===

&lt;p&gt;(a)Vi - Use the ideal gas 
equation over the first state.

&lt;p&gt;(b)Tf - Ideal gas equation, 
this time again, will have two unknowns. We need one more equation, which comes 
from (P)(V^y) = constant. Going exactly by the steps in column one, however, we 
won't be eliminating the unknown Vf, while eliminating the known P. Instead, to 
eliminate Vf, while keeping the knowns, raise both sides of the ideal gas 
equation by Y and devide the first equation by the second. You will end up with 
(T^y)[P^(1-Y)] = constant. Use it on the initial and final stages. 

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(c)Vf - Now that three 
quantities in the ideal gas equation are known, you can easily find Vf.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could 
directly find Vf through using P(V^y) = constant on initial and final stages of 
the process, and then used the ideal gas equation to find Tf. Notice that we 
avoided finding Vf when we were asked to find only Tf, by eliminating the 
unknown.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(d)Q - What is the defining 
charachteristic of an adiabatic process?

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(e)&amp;#8710;E - nCv&amp;#8710;T pretty simple. :)

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(f)w - Tip::Throughout the 
table, this column is going to be the aditive inverse of &amp;#8747;PextdV

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(g)&amp;#8747;PextdV - Tip::Although not 
throughout the table, but in any kind of adiabatic process (reversible or 
irreversible), &amp;#8747;PextdV is the aditive inverse of &amp;#8710;E, according to the first law.


&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;**This is because the first law 
of the thermodynamics is universal, and it doesnt matter if the process is 
reversible or irreversible to apply it. 

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;However, the ideal gas equation 
and any results derived from it are applicable only in the case of a 
thermodynamic equilibrium. Since this is not possible in case of an irreversible 
process, we cannot use the mentioned equations over the course of the reactions. 
Even then, the ideal gas equation can be used before and after an irreversible 
process takes place.**&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;(h)&amp;#8710;H -&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8710;H = nCp&amp;#8710;T.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Second column completed as 
well.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
=== The Third Column ===
&lt;p&gt;(a)Vi - the _______ equation, 
fill in the blank mentally.
&lt;p&gt;(b)Vf - Again, two unknowns for 
the ideal gas equation. But is Pf actually an unknown? Remember that this is an 
isobaric process, and that the initial pressure is known, so the final pressure 
is known as well.
&lt;p&gt;(c)Pf - Done
&lt;p&gt;(d)Q - Non zero for the first 
time!! We will use the first law, Q = &amp;#8710;E + &amp;#8747;PextdV. See it again as the law of 
conservation of energy, the heat supplied is used in heating the gas as well as 
doing work. Now find the other two terms.
&lt;p&gt;(e)&amp;#8710;E - nCv&amp;#8710;T :)
&lt;p&gt;(f)&amp;#8747;PextdV - Since this is a 
reversible process, the external pressure is the same as the internal pressure, 
and the internal pressure is constant. It comes out of the integration. So we 
are left with&amp;nbsp; (P)&amp;#8747;dV, which evaluates to P&amp;#8710;V. Do the needful!!
&lt;p&gt;(h)&amp;#8710;H - nCp&amp;#8710;T !!!
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Note : - In evaluating &amp;#8747;PextdV, 
make sure that you use the correct units of each quantity! Since we want the 
answer to be in joules, i.e. SI units, we need to substitute pressure and volume 
in Pascals and Cubic Meters. 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Note : - The enthalpy change of 
a reaction is the heat exchanged in a reaction when a process is carried out at 
constant pressure. This, in our case, means that the Q and &amp;#8710;H entries in column 
three should be same. [Have you convinced yourself why?] But there may be slight 
differences between the two entries, this resulting from the rounding off of 
conversion factors. e.g. 1 atm = 101325 Pascals, but we often substitute 1 atm 
as 1.01 lac pascals. 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Third column done as well. :)
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
=== Column Four ===
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;(a)Pi&amp;nbsp; - ;)
&lt;p&gt;(b)Tf - This question is the 
answer, &amp;quot;what is an isothermal process?&amp;quot;
&lt;p&gt;(c)Pf- The ideal gas equation 
is OK, but observe that the RHS of it is constant. So, even the LHS would be. 
Hence, if the volume doubles up, the pressure reduces to half.
&lt;p&gt;(d)Q - &amp;#8710;E + &amp;#8747;PextdV, now we 
will find both the terms and substitute them.
&lt;p&gt;(e)&amp;#8710;E - Well, if the internal 
energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, and if this is an 
isothermal process, where does it lead us?
&lt;p&gt;(f)&amp;#8747;PextdV - This is a 
reversible process. As explained above, Pext is the same as the pressure of the 
gas molecules at any stage. Substitute Pext as nrt/v. Since the numerator is 
constant, we take it out of integration, and evaluate nrT &amp;#8747;(dV/V) which is 
nrTln(Vf/Vi). Now substitute the values.
&lt;p&gt;(g)&amp;#8710;H - nCp&amp;#8710;T :)
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
=== Column Five ===
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;No additional info. This is a 
clone actually.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
=== Column Six ===
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;We expect the student to be 
seasoned enough now to realize that the gas parameters are found through ideal 
gas equation, and then the thermodynamic Joule values are found simply.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Note : Since the volume remains 
constant, change in volume is 0. i.e. dV=0, so &amp;#8747;PextdV = 0
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Column Seven ===
&lt;p&gt;This is the first irreversible 
process that we are dealing with, in this table. Pf = 1 atm = external pressure 
in the above table means that the gas expands/contracts against a constant 
external pressure of 1 atm, and the final pressure of the gas too is 1 atm. [We 
have some numerical problems where the final pressure isnt equal to the external 
pressure against which expansion/contraction took place, but do not bother 
yourself with it at this moment.]
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Note carefully that all three 
gas parameters are missing for the initial state. That means, apart from the gas 
equation, we will require two more equations to find them all. And since this is 
an irreversible adiabatic process, we cannot use P(V^y)=Constant over the 
initial and final states. That means we have lost an equation!
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;How are we going to deal with 
this situation? The first thing to keep in mind is that every problem asked in 
this book has a solution. And this table, like most of the highschool problems, 
is all about making equations to find unknowns.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;(a)Vf - Use the ideal gas 
equation to get the value.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Now try to relate the final 
parameters to the initial parameters. Obviously, the heat gained, work done, 
change in internal energy put some constraints on the possible values of the 
parameters.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;(b)Ti - &amp;#8710;E is known to us, but 
if we write it as nCv&amp;#8710;T, and equate it to 1000 J, we actually end up with an 
equation. This gives us the value of &amp;#8710;T, which can be use to find the initial 
temperature, because the final temperature is known.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;(c)Vi/&amp;#8747;PextdV - Refer the two 
reversible adiabatic processes in column 1 and column 2 that we studied. We made 
a statement over there, that since the characteristic of any kind of adiabatic 
process is &amp;quot;zero energy exchange&amp;quot;, &amp;#8747;PextdV is always the additive inverse of &amp;#8710;E 
for an adiabatic process. Hence &amp;#8747;PextdV = -1000 J.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not all!! If you 
are thorough with integration, look at the word &amp;#8747;PextdV with some concentration. 
The parameter Pext would jump in and out of the integral in your mind's eye once 
you understand that it is constant for this process. This yields &amp;#8747;PextdV =Pext(&amp;#8710;V). 
Just as you found Ti by finding &amp;#8710;T, find Vi by finding &amp;#8710;V.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Fill up the rest of the entries 
yourself.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is for you to 
ponder. In the reversible adiabatic processes,&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8747;PextdV = -&amp;#8710;E and actually 
evaluating the integral gave the same equation. But in the case of an 
irreversible adiabatic process, evaluating the integral and using the first law 
to find its value gives two distinct equations! This can be used for our benefit 
in problems. Please keep this in mind!
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
=== Column Eight ===
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in Column Seven, we 
lose the equation &amp;#8747;PextdV = nrtln(Vf/Vi), but we can write it as &amp;#8747;PextdV = Pext(&amp;#8710;V).
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;An irreversible isothermal 
process is much shorter than an irreversible adiabatic process to complete.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;(a)Vf - &amp;#8747;PextdV = Pext(&amp;#8710;V) use 
this equation to find the final volume of the gas molecules.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;(b)Tf - Two gas parameters are 
known now, use the ideal gas equation to find Tf. And if this is an isothermal 
process, what does knowing the final temperature mean?
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the entries require 
no new logic, everything has been covered in the above columns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vegetarian version==
Just added a link (via references) to a vegetarian version of Mapo Doufu.  That changes is reflected in the last 3 edits (took me a couple tries to test it &amp; get it right) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:202.86.139.194|202.86.139.194]] ([[User talk:202.86.139.194|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.86.139.194|contribs]]) 2007-09-06T22:30:22.&lt;/small&gt;

:Thanks, I've moved that reference to Notes, tips, variations because it isn't part of the standard recipe. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:55, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

==Order of ingredients==
I reordered the ingredients so that they are in order of use. This is a fairly normal way to write ingredients in recipes. [[User:Quillaja|Quillaja]] ([[User talk:Quillaja|talk]]) 23:34, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

== Servings ==
About how many servings does this recipe make? That info should be included in the recipe. For me, it makes 2 servings, but I'm kinda a big eater, and so serving sizes are almost always too small for me. =P [[User:Quillaja|Quillaja]] ([[User talk:Quillaja|talk]]) 23:38, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

==Amount of sauce or liquid in this recipe==
I've made this recipe twice now, and followed the instructions exactly, but I've found that when I'm finished, the mapo tofu generally seems not to have much of a 'sauce' or 'liquid' portion, as is shown in the picture. Just my observation. The original author might want to change this. It's still tasty in the original form. [[User:Quillaja|Quillaja]] ([[User talk:Quillaja|talk]]) 23:41, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Researching local history ==
Local history research is often taken up as a hobby by people without prior training or experience in the appropriate techniques and approaches. The very nature of local history is such that starting points are always available locally and lay researchers can learn the necessary skills as they study their subject in ever increasing depth. Archivists and societies can provide advice, encouragement, and information; formal courses of study are also widely available. 

Most local history researchers follow a process in which they start from the basic facts offered by the available evidence, make a more detailed analysis of that evidence to explore its implications, and then put that analysis in its wider temporal and geographical context. Some take a more theoretical approach: starting from a hypothesis, which they seek to demonstrate or disprove through evidence.

=== Primary sources ===
These are records that were created at the time of an event. For example, a primary source for a birth date would be a birth certificate. While you can find birth dates on other documents, such as marriage certificates, they would not be primary sources for the birth date, because they were not created at the time of the birth.

The survival and availability of local records differs significantly from area to area. West &lt;ref&gt; J West, ''Village Records''&lt;/ref&gt; is a good guide to what records may exist and how they might be used. Similarly Iredale &lt;ref&gt; D Iredale, ''Enjoying Archives''&lt;/ref&gt; also describes where records may be found and how they can be used, although he originally wrote more than thirty years ago and is somewhat dated in parts. There are numerous guides to individual record categories &lt;ref&gt;NW Alcock, ''Old Title Deeds'' is a particularly good introduction to an under-used source for local history&lt;/ref&gt; which can be found in bibliographies or referenced in more general works.

=== Secondary sources ===
A secondary source is a record that was created a significant amount of time after an event occurred. For example, a marriage certificate would be a secondary source for a birth date, because the birth took place several years before the time of the marriage. However, that same marriage certificate would be a primary source for a marriage date, because it was created at the time of the marriage.

There is often a local studies library which will contain a wealth of local material and web access. Early county historians &lt;ref&gt;Morant, ''History and Antiquities of Essex'' for example&lt;/ref&gt; often provide parish by parish accounts, although they frequently include long descriptions of manorial descents which are of little interest to the current generation of historians. If there is a history of the parish church, this may well contain useful material.

Many books as secondary sources have a tendency to contain information which is of special interest to the author, even if the book titles are broadly similar. When researching a particular topic it is best to consult as many 'histories' as possible for vital clues can lurk in the most unexpected places. It is also true however that mistakes can be repeated through plagiarism by author after author and even exaggerated. This is the ever present problem with secondary sources of information.

===Using paintings, drawings, prints and photographs===
Photographs are usually reliable and can be interpreted directly and with confidence.  (While this is true, remember that sources are created with intent by the author.  Therefore a photo essay of a community may emphasize some areas, and omit others.  As such, the use of photographic images as a primary basis for exploring a community may be limited.  This is why it is always desirable to use multiple sources.) 

Paintings and prints are open to artistic interpretation and / or a formulaic construction. For example the artist Gilpin&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilpin&quot;&gt;Gilpin, William (1786). ''Observations relative chiefly to picturesque beauty on several parts of England. Vol.1. Cumberland and Wrestmorland.'' R.Blamire. London.&lt;/ref&gt; set a fashion for a romantic style of drawing and painting which influenced artists for many years and Billings&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;&gt;Billings, Robert William (1901). ''The Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland''. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt;  is famous for his stylised and romantised representation of Scottish castles, etc. Such sources can only be 'trusted' as factual in generalised terms.

=== Using old maps ===
Privately produced antique maps often go back several centuries, the Ordnance Survey (OS) itself did not start until the 19th-century. Many maps can be found either online[http://www.old-maps.co.uk/] or are available for study at libraries, purchasable at bookshops, etc.

Comparing maps sequentially by age can reveal a great deal of information about place names (etymology), landscape features, natural habitats, changing farming practices, etc. Older OS maps may have many place names which are left out on modern OS maps. 

The 'Name Book' was the written record of the OS and this can be very helpful and informative. The OS is sometimes wrong, with examples of misnamed hills, burns, historical features, etc. which have never been corrected and have been repeated by other 'official' bodies. Such errors can sometimes be identified and corrected by making comparisons with pre-OS maps, an example being where the OS at first used the name 'Drumastle Mill,' then 'Drumcastle Mill,' however a 1747 map gives 'Drumaskus Mill.' An old 'Tower' was nearby and this may have led to the OS error during re-surveying, etc.

Old maps, through comparing various surveys, can also reveal the extent to which geographical features have been altered by the activities of man. Rivers were surprisingly often diverted by natural circumstances, the landowning class, factory owners, etc.; lakes were created through mining, quarrying, road construction, etc.; small hills were removed through quarrying, etc.; lakes drained for agriculture, etc., etc.

===Baronial or manorial records===
The Barony became the principal administrative unit of medieval landed estates in Scotland and its business was carried out in the Barony court before the laird or his baillie. The records of the Barony, and in particular its court, document many aspects of local agriculture, the resolution of disagreements between tenants, the transfer of property amongst tenants, etc.

Many lairds also had a legal heritable jurisdiction which permitted the laird of the barony to deal with certain minor criminal matters and regulate the sale of bread and ale. Baronies continued to function in a minor way until the early 20th century, but by this date the business of the courts had for a long time been dominated by the transfer of tenants' property.

The proceedings of the court and other documents give much information about local agriculture and the management of estates.  Records reveal a great deal about the community living in the barony, its social structure, households, responsibilities, and the local economy.

=== Etymology ===
The names of habitations, hills, rivers, villages, etc. can reveal a great deal about the history of such features, especially if the name can be traced throughout its existence to show subtle changes which help to positively identify the original meaning. Such changes can be very complex and confusing, especially if they involve other languages, such as Cornish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, etc.

Local dialects can lead the local historian astray, as with 'Watermillock' beside Ullswater in the Lake District. The name seems to infer something along the lines of 'The small mill by a stream', whilst it actually involves the dialect word 'wethers' for sheep and 'hillock', or small hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;Lee, Joan (1998). ''The Place Names of Cumbria''. Cumbria Heritage Services. ISBN 0-905404-70-X. P. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Even well established placenames may change with new ownership, such as with the farm 'Sandilands', which was change to 'Bankend' once Lord Torphichen of the Sandilands family, sold the estate on which the farm stood. In such cases extra confusion can effect historical researchers as the farm was renamed after a previous farm which once stood on another site some distance away.

A tradition, particularly in Victorian times, was to enhance the 'image' of a place by renaming it using more upper or middle class names. Maybole in Ayrshire for example had many streets renamed through the influence of a local minister.

A particular tradition that exists in parts of Ayrshire in Scotland and probably elsewhere, is to rename places after old family homes or estates, places of particular personal interest, etc. For example the Fergushill Manse became 'Janburrow' after Janet from Burrowland Farm and Bonnyton became 'Girgenti' after an historic site in Sicily. Landowners often altered names, such as that of Culzean castle, which used to be 'The cove', named after the caves that the castle stood on. Little Dreghorn near Dreghorn in North Ayrshire  was changed to Fairlie after the family's main home on the Ayrshire coast.

Clues can also be found by speaking to local people who may provide the pronunciation of a name from a map, etc. which might be significantly different from the deduced pronunciation.

Another difficulty with the interpretation of placenames, standard expressions, etc. is that the meanings of words may have changed, for example the expression 'Pit and gallows' refers to a pit which was actually a form of dungeon or prison cell, not a pit for drowning the condemned. Words may also take on new meanings which supplant the original, for example a 'turnpike' was used for the spiral stairs in a  tower and became more familiarly a term for the Toll Roads first constructed in the 18th-century.&lt;Ref name=&quot;Mackenzie&quot;&gt;Mackenzie, W. Mackay (1927). The Mediaeval Castle in Scotland. Pub. Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd., London.&lt;/Ref&gt;

Some descriptive terms were used very much in one locality, such as that of 'bastel-house' being confined to the East and Middle March of the Scottish - English border.

Some names can link certain features to industrial activity in the past, such as the name 'Red Boiler' which referred to the manufacture of soap at one particular site. Here the clues were that a plentiful supply of hardwood trees was a pre-requisite, together with a supply of animal carcasses, both of which the site had once provided in abundance. The folk memory of cast iron cauldrons at the site and the characteristic colour added to the circumstantial evidence.

Changes in the spoken language of an area results in the loss of some placenames and the corruption of others. Such changes may reflect such transition as that from Pictish to Gaelic to Scots and finally to English.

===Personal names===
The spelling of personal names, like that of placenames, was highly variable and only became consistent in the 19th century in many cases. Some spelling usages may reflect cadets of a family, such as with the Cunnnighame family, who used Cunninghame for the Glencairn and Corsehill branch; Cuninghame for Caddel and Monkredding; Cunningham for Baidland and Clonbeith; and finally Cuningham for Glengarnock.

When following family trees it is worth noting that many heirs changed their names to retain a traditional surname, as with the branch of the Seton family who inherited the Earldom of Eglinton and took the Montgomerie name associated with that title. This practise was sometimes a condition of inheritance or an act of gratitude.

=== Aerial and satellite imagery ===
Imagery from aerial reconnaissance is especially common from the first and second world wars. Some of which can be viewd in 3D. Such photographs are held by the Imperial War Museum and turn up at antique fairs, through on line auction, sites, etc.
 
Various websites can now provide satellite imagery which gives an overview, often in considerable detail, of areas which are being researched. Many sites additionally have live links on the satellite  image which provide further details and sometimes link to sites such as Wikipedia, often providing much more information to the researcher. Features are usually easy to follow, such as Corpse roads, old railways, castles, rivers, rig and furrow systems, etc. 

Taken together with maps, satellite imagery can clarify or add substantially to existing knowledge on a particular topic. The imagery is however not 'live' and can be several years old. Crop marks are sometimes visible, indicating the course of old roads, the position of old dwellings, etc. Due to the imagery being from above, some vertical structures can be hard to make out, only being visible by the shadows they cast, etc.

===The interpretation of landscape features===
There is no alternative than to keep an open mind and to develop or seek expert advice when making deductions from features in the landscape. Oliver Rackham is well known for his pioneering work on woodlands, leading to a better understanding of previous landscapes, which sustained lost crafts such as sawyers, digging temporary sawpits which collapsed upon themselves to leave 'grave' like features. They are often found in old woods, close to water and occasionally made with stone sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rackham&quot;&gt;Rackham, Oliver (1976). ''Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape.'' Pub. J.M.Dent &amp; Sons Ltd. ISBN 0-460-04183-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Q-pits are another landscape feature, found in woodlands or what has been woodland, they were kilns used to produce a sort of dried wood called 'white coal,' at one time used in the smelting of lead from the ore. Even old land usage can be deduced to some extent through examining the plants present, the form of trees, particular woodland boundary features, the presence or absence of coppicing, etc., etc. Some plants for instance have been known to linger on in one locality from the days of the monasteries and their 'physic' gardens.

=== Site visits and oral information ===
A visit is often essential, although satellite imagery can be a partial substitute. Local people rarely have a deep knowledge of their locality's history, however such information can be invaluable. It is often the case that site visits uncover the existence of primary sources of material such as photographs, deeds, etc. Additionally, personal contact with other local historians may result from meeting people local to an area.

=== Folklore, tradition and oral history===
Many places have a rich folklore and tradition which can be both a help and a hindrance. Usually a kernel of truth is associated with such historical records, however they often suffer from exaggeration, fusion with other events, the 'Chinese whispers' phenomenon and other corruptions of historical accuracy. It is important for the researcher to remain impartial and often the simpler the version the more truth it holds.

False memory syndrome is a very real problem and questions to 'local' interviewees should be framed without any leading facts which could distort the correspondents memory at that time or later.

Selena's Tree is an example of how stories develop. This tree stands near Kilwinning in Ayrshire, Scotland. One legends records that it was the meeting place of lovers; a man from Eglinton castle and a woman from the town. A second legend records that it was where a local witch was burned at the stake. The first story is pure romantic fiction, the second confuses the site with the nearby place of execution where a witch was executed and the truth is that a local lady named Selena walked to this tree every day for many following a stroke at a relatively early age.

=== Sharing information and encouraging others ===
Wikipedia and Wikibook sites enable local historians to make their work available to a very wide audience, inviting the assistance and contributions of others. Contacting 'interested' individuals via email, post, etc. can widen the use of such Wiki sites and actively involve people in the recording of their own local history. Researchers in other countries often have an interest in work done by local historians, leading to productive communications and furtherance of objectives. 

The writers of articles do not have any form of veto and it is inevitable that opinions will sometimes differ, resulting in edits which may or may not be a real improvement. Such is life! The important thing is to keep enthusiastic and pursue the Wikiway (democracy).

One great advantage of writing information on websites such as the various Wiki sites is that it will not get lost or corrupted by accident; it is a secure home therefore. A disadvantage, certainly on Wikipedia, is the less than perfect hard copy provided through the printing options.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Debt Securities==

Another method a corporation can raise capital is through Debt Securities which are also called bonds.  Bonds are loans to the corporation made by the investor to be repaid at a stated future date at a set interest rate.
Although, bonds are not limited to corporations.  The U.S. government can issue government bonds. Also municipalities such as states, cities, and such can issue municipal bonds.  Bonds can also be called funded debt, and are considered long term debt because they are usually issued for at least 5 years or more. Bonds are rated by Moody's, S &amp; P and Fitch.

Each bond has a document or certificate that describes the terms and conditions of the loan.  This document is called an indenture.

Some items to consider when investing in a bond are:

 Reinvestment risk
 Callable risk
 Interest rate risk
 Default risk


Convertible bonds are bonds that corporations issue that give the investor the right to convert the bonds to common stock. 

A corporation can also issue commercial paper, which is generally traded overnight and used to shore up financing and cash, and has a maturity of less than 1 year.

==[[wikt:에서|에서]]==
Why are we adding -에서 onto people in the exercises on the bottom of the page? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Jeff23|Jeff23]] ([[User talk:Jeff23|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jeff23|contribs]]) 2007-09-06T18:38:07.&lt;/small&gt;

: Good point, Jeff.  You are right to note that 에서 is only supposed to be used with inanimate referents.  I suppose we could introduce [[wikt:에게|에게]] or maybe just [[wikt:게|게]] in this lesson and change those exercises to have the student choose between 에서 and 에게 (or maybe 게), depending on the given noun.  Does that seem reasonable?  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 00:33, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;조새프&quot; ==

I don't know if foreign word spelling rules have changed since last time I learned Korean, but I think Korean writing for &quot;Joseph&quot; is much closer to &quot;죠셉&quot; or &quot;조셉&quot; (in Korean Bible, it's actually written &quot;요셉&quot; which is actually more correct (i.e. closer to Hebrew pronunciation) than the ... bastardized English pronunciation). At the very least, it should '''definitely''' be &quot;조세프&quot;, since &quot;e&quot; corresponds fairly well to &quot;ㅔ&quot; sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Action Research: Hearing from Teachers about Improving Practice==
Each of the professional articles just described offers ideas and recommendations that can stimulate reflection about teaching and learning. But they all suffer from a particular limitation: Although they often relate to teachers and classrooms, teachers’ role in influencing in designing and interpreting a study is minimal.  In the world of educational research, persons other than teachers--typically professors, educational administrators, or other professional researchers—tend to speak on behalf of teachers. All three of the articles described earlier in this chapter had this feature.  Persons other than teachers chose the research topics.

The information that emerges from this arrangement often still relates to teaching and learning, and may contain useful insights for classroom work.  But by definition, it is framed by people whose interests and fundamental commitments may not be identical with classroom teachers.  As a result, the studies are somewhat more likely to attend to problems posed by academic disciplines or by educational administrators.  Two of the studies which we described earlier—the ones about moral development and about labels for disabilities—showed this quality. Classroom teachers are concerned, of course, about both moral development and categorizing of students.  But if teachers had designed the two projects themselves, they might have reframed both of them to focus more explicitly on the challenges of classroom teaching.  In studying moral beliefs, for example, teachers might have focused more squarely on how to foster moral beliefs in their students.  In studying inclusive education, they might have focused more fully on the practical difficulties faced by teachers in assessing students’ learning disabilities with validity.

===The Nature of Action Research===
In view of these issues, a particularly important kind of investigation for teachers is '''action research''' (sometimes also ''teacher research''), an activity referring to systematic, intentional inquiry by teachers for the purpose of improving their own practice (Stenhouse, 1985; Brydon-Miller, Greenwood, &amp; Maguire, 2003; Russell, T. &amp; Loughran, J. 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Stenhouse, L. (1985). ''Research as a basis for teaching.'' London, UK: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brydon-Miller, M., Greenwood, D., Maguire, D. (2003). Why action research? ''Action Research, 1''(1), 3-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, T. &amp; Loughran, J. (2005). Self-study as a context for productive learning. ''Studying Teacher Education, 1''(2), 103-106.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Action research is not to be confused with research about teaching and learning, which are investigations by professional researchers on topics of teachers, teaching, or learning. 

Action research has several defining characteristics, in addition to being planned and conducted by teachers.  First, it originates in the problems and dilemmas of classroom practice, or in chronic problems with certain students, materials, or activities.  Second, its outcomes offer information focused on particular teachers and classrooms, rather than about teachers in general or students in general.  Although this feature might make action research seem less useful as a source of advice or knowledge that is truly general, supporters argue that focusing on specific learning contexts makes action research more credible or valid as a source of practical information and ideas. It is, they argue, simply more attuned to the context of real classrooms (St. Clair, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, R. (2005). Similarity and superunknowns: An essay on the challenges of educational research. ''Harvard Educational Review, 75''(4), 435-453.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Third, while the audience for action research can certainly include professors and educational administrators, the audience tends to be other teachers (Fenstermacher, 1994; Ackerman &amp; MacKenzie, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Fenstermacher, G. (1994). The knower and the known: The nature of knowledge in research on teaching. In L. Darling-Hammond (Ed.), ''Review of research in education, Volume 20,'' pp. 3-56. Washington, D.C.: American Educational Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, R. &amp; MacKenzie, S. (Eds.). (2007). ''Uncovering teacher leadership: Voices from the field.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Action research is therefore in an especially strong position to provide &quot;insider&quot; perspectives on educational problems.

===Action Research in Practice===
Action research makes a number of assumptions as a result of its nature and purposes (Richardson, 1994; Schmuck, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, V. (1994). Conducting research in practice. ''Educational Researcher, 23''(5), 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmuck, R. (2006). ''Practical action research for change.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;.  To varying degrees, most such studies support some combination of these ideas:
# that teaching is itself really a form of research,
# that action research, like teaching itself, requires substantial reflection,
# that collaboration among teachers is crucial for making teacher research meaningful, and for the improvement of teaching, and 
# that teachers' knowledge of teaching has to be shared publicly, especially when gained systematically through action research.

To see how these features look in practice, look at several examples of action research studies.

====Example #1: Focusing on Motivating Students====
A number of years ago, Patricia Clifford and Sharon Friesen published an account of their effort to develop a classroom program based on students' out-of-school interests and experiences (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, P. &amp; Friesen, S. (1993). A curious plan: Managing on the twelfth. ''Harvard Educational Review, 63''(3), 339-358.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Clifford and Friesen were co-teachers in a double-sized classroom which deliberately included children from first-, second-, and third-grades.  Their interest in students’ out-of-school experiences grew out of three more basic questions about teaching, which they phrased like this:

* ''How can curriculum remain open to children's unique experiences and connect with the world they know outside the school?''  Too often, the official school curriculum lacked meaning for children because it seemed cut off from the rest of the world.  The result was unmotivated students and poor learning.

* ''Why is imaginative experience the best starting place for planning?''  The teachers felt that imaginative experiences--make-believe play, stories, poems--provided access to children's lives outside school--their make-believe play, or their stories or poems.  Perhaps somehow these could be connected to the goals of the official curriculum.

* ''What happens when teachers break down the barriers between school knowledge and real knowledge?''  In drawing on children's outside experiences, would children actually become more motivated or not?  Would they take over the program, and fail to learn the official curriculum goals?

To answer these questions, the teachers kept extensive diaries or journals for one entire school year. These became the “data” for the research. In the journals, they described and reflected on their daily teaching experiences.  The teachers also talked with each other extensively about classroom events and their significance, and the results of the conversations often entered the journals eventually during the research.  In their journal, for example, the teachers recorded an experience with students about ways of telling time.  In preliminary discussions the students became interested in how a sundial worked.  So the teachers and students went outside, where they created a human sundial, using the students themselves.  The teachers' journal kept a chronicle of these events, and noted the comments and questions which students developed as a result:

:- If you stood in the same place for a whole day you would see your shadow change places because the earth changes position;

:- Why is my shadow longer than I am in the evening, but shorter at noon?

:- Clouds can block the sun's rays so sundials won't work on rainy days;

:- How did people start to tell time?

As the year evolved and observations accumulated and were recorded, the teachers gradually did begin to answer their own three questions.  They found, for example, that connecting the curriculum with children's interests and motives was most effective when they could establish a personal bond with a child.  They also found that imaginative expression helped certain children to feel safe to explore ideas.  And they found that blending school-based and personal knowledge caused children to learn much more than before--although much of the additional knowledge was not part of an official curriculum.  With these conclusions in mind, and with numerous examples to support them, Clifford and Friesen published their study so that others could share what they had learned about teaching, learning, and students.

The study by Clifford and Friesen is interesting in its own right, but for our purposes think for a moment about their work as an example of ''action research''.  One of its features is that it formed part of the normal course of teaching: the authors were simply more systematic about how they observed the students and recorded information about classroom events. Another feature is that the research required conscious reflection over an extended time:  their journals and conversations contained not only descriptions of events, but also interpretations of the events.  A third feature is that the study involved collaboration: it was not just one teacher studying the major questions, but two.  And a fourth is that the teachers not only developed their results and conclusions for themselves, but also shared them with others.  These four qualities make the study by Clifford and Friesen a clear example of teacher research.  Note, though, that sometimes studies conducted by teachers may not show all of these features so clearly; instead they may show some of the key features, but not all of them, as in the next two examples.

====Example #2: Focusing on Development====
Since 1981, Vivian Paley has published a series of short books documenting and interpreting her observations of young children in classrooms (1981, 1986, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2005)&lt;ref&gt; Paley, V. (1981). ''Wally’s stories.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

: Paley, V. (1988). ''Mollie is three.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

: Paley, V. (1991). ''The boy who would be a helicopter.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

: Paley, V. (1998). ''Kwanzaa and me.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

: Paley, V. (2000). ''The kindness of children.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

: Paley, V. (2006). ''A child’s work: The importance of fantasy play.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Paley was interested in how young children develop or change over the long term, and in particular how the development looks from the point of view of a classroom teacher.  In one of these books, for example, she observed one child in particular, Mollie, from the time she entered nursery school just after her third birthday until after the child turned four years old.  Her interest was not focused on curriculum, as Clifford and Friesen's had done, but on Mollie as a growing human being; &quot;the subject which I most wished to learn,&quot; she wrote, &quot;is children&quot; (p. xiv).  Paley therefore wrote extended narrative (or story-like) observations about the whole range of activities of this one child, and wove in periodic brief reflections on the observations.  Because the observations took story-like form, her books read a bit like novels: themes are sometimes simply suggested by the story line, rather than stated explicitly.  Using this approach, Paley demonstrated (but occasionally also stated) several important developmental changes.  In ''Mollie Is Three'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Paley, M. (1988). ''Mollie Is Three.&quot; Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, for example, she describes examples of Mollie's language development. At three years, the language was often disconnected from Mollie’s actions--she would talk about one thing, but do another.  By four, she was much more likely to tie language to her current activities, and in this sense she more often &quot;said what she meant.&quot;  A result of the change was that Mollie also began understanding and following classroom rules as the year went on, because the language of rules became more connected in her mind to the actions to which they referred.

Vivian Paley's book had some of the characteristics of action research--but with differences from Clifford and Friesen’s.  Like their research, Paley's “data” was based on her own teaching, while her teaching was influenced in turn by her systematic observations. And like Clifford and Friesen’s, Paley’s research involved numerous reflections on teaching, and it led to a public sharing of the reflections—in this case in the form of several small books.  Unlike Clifford and Friesen, though, Paley worked independently, without collaboration.  And unlike Clifford and Friesen, she deliberately integrated observation and interpretation as they might be integrated in a piece of fiction, so that the resulting &quot;story&quot; often implied or showed its message without stating it in so may words.  In this regard her work had qualities of what some educators call '''arts-based research''', which are studies that take advantage of an artistic medium (in this case, narrative or story-like writing) to heighten readers' understanding and response to research findings (Barone and Eisner, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Barone, T. &amp; Eisner, E. (2006). Arts-based research in education. In J. Green, g. Camilli, &amp; P. Elmore (Eds.), ''Handbook of complementary methods in education research.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. If you are studying the use of space in the classroom, for example, then aesthetically organized visual depictions (photos, drawings) of the room may be more helpful and create more understanding than verbal descriptions. If you are studying children's musical knowledge, on the other hand, recordings of performances by the children may be more helpful and informative than discussions of performances.

====Example #3: Focusing on Collaboration====
In 1996, an example of action research was published that was intended simultaneously for classroom teachers and for university researchers, and which focused on the challenges of collaboration among educators (Ulichny &amp; Schoener, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Ulichny, P. &amp; Schoener, W. (1996). Teacher-researcher collaboration from two perspectives. ''Harvard Educational Review, 66''(3), 496-524.&lt;/ref&gt;.  A teacher (Wendy Schoener) and a university researcher (Polly Ulichny) explored how, or even whether, teachers and university researchers could participate as equals in the study of teaching.  Wendy (the two used first names throughout when they published their experiences) was a teacher of adults learning English as a Second Language (ESL); Polly was a specialist in multicultural education and wanted to observe a teacher who was successful at reaching the ethnically diverse students who normally study ESL.  Polly therefore asked Wendy for permission to study her teaching for an extended period of time--to visit her class, videotape it, interview her about it, and the like.

What followed is best described as an extended negotiation between teacher and professor for access to Wendy's class, on the one hand, and for mutual respect for each other's work, on the other.  In the published article, the negotiations are described separately by each participant, in order to honor the differences in their concerns and perspectives.  Before, during, and after the observations, it was necessary for Polly and Wendy each to adjust expectations of what the other person could do and was willing to do.  As the authors put it, some things were &quot;easy to hear&quot; from the other and some things were &quot;hard to hear.&quot;  Wendy, as a teacher, found it easier to hear criticisms of her teaching if they came from herself, rather than from the higher-status university professor, Polly.  Polly, for her part, found it easier to hear Wendy's comments if she matched Wendy's self-criticisms and evaluations with some of her own experiences. Polly therefore made sure to tell Wendy about dilemmas and problems she experienced in her own (university) teaching.  Because they needed to adjust to hearing and talking with each other, the two educators eventually focused less on Polly's original purpose--studying multicultural teaching--and more on the problem of how teachers and university researchers might collaborate effectively.

Overall, this study qualifies as a piece of action research, though it is not fully focused on classroom teaching. For example, the teachers did collaborate and reflect on their experiences, but not all of the reflection was about teaching in classrooms.  The rest was about the relationship between Wendy and Polly.  While the problem selected was originally about classroom teaching—Wendy’s—it did not originate with the classroom teacher (Wendy) or concerns she had about her own classroom; instead it was chosen by the university researcher (Polly) and her desire to study multicultural teaching.  The researchers did share what they learned by publishing their observations and ideas, but their published report speaks only partly to classroom teachers as such; in addition it speaks to academic researchers and educators of future teachers. 

By pointing out differences among these examples of action research, we do not mean to imply that one is “better” than another.  The point is simply to show how diverse studies by teachers can be, and to appreciate their differences.  Whatever their specific features, classroom studies by teachers hold in common is a commitment to giving a voice to teachers as they reflect on problems and challenges intrinsic to classroom life.  This goal can be accomplished in more than one way:  through journals and other record-keeping methods, through oral discussions with colleagues, and through written reflections created either for themselves or for others concerned about teaching and learning.  Diversity among topics and methods in action research studies should not surprise us, in fact, since classrooms are themselves so diverse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well and good, you may say.  Action research offers teachers a way to hear each other, to learn from their own and other's experience.  But there are also a few cautions to keep in mind, both ethical and practical. Look briefly at each of these areas.

===Ethical Cautions about Action Research===
One caution is the possibility of ''conflict of interest'' between the roles of teaching and conducting action research (Hammack, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Hammack, F. (1997). Ethical issues in teacher research. ''Teachers College Record, 99''(2), 247-265.&lt;/ref&gt;. A teacher’s first priorities should be the welfare of his or her students: first and foremost, you want students to learn, to be motivated, to feel accepted by their peers, and the like. A researcher’s first priorities, however, are to the field or topic being studied. The two kinds of priorities may often overlap and support each other. Vivian Paley’s observations of children in her classes, described earlier, not only supported her children’s learning, but also her studies of the children.

But situations can also occur in which action research and teaching are less compatible, and can create which ethical dilemmas. The problems usually relate to one of three issues: ''privacy,'' ''informed consent'', or ''freedom to participate.'' Each of these becomes an issue only if the results of a research project are made public, either in a journal or book, as with the examples we have given in this chapter, or simply by being described or shared outside the classroom. (Sharing, you may recall, is one of the defining features of action research.) Look briefly at each of the issues.

====Insuring Privacy of the Student====
Teachers often learn information about students that the students or their families may not want publicized. Suppose, for example, you have a student with an intellectual disability in your class, and you wish to study how the student learns. Observing the student work on (and possibly struggle with) academic activities may be quite consistent with a teacher’s responsibilities; after all, teachers normally should pay attention to their students’ academic efforts. But the student or his family may not want such observations publicized or even shared informally with other parents or teachers. They may feel that doing so would risk stigmatizing the student publicly.

To respect the student’s privacy and still study his learning behavior, the teacher (alias the “action researcher”) therefore needs to disguise the student’s identity whenever the research results are made public. In any written or oral report, or even in any hallway conversation about the project, the teacher/researcher would use a pseudonym for the student, and change other identifying information such as the physical description of the student or even the student’s gender. There are limits, however, to how much can be disguised without changing essential information. The teacher could not, for example, hide the fact of the intellectual disability without compromising the point of the study; yet the intellectual disability might be unusual enough that it would effectively identify the student being studied.

====Gaining Informed Consent====
Students may not understand what is being studied about them, or even realize that they are being studied at all, unless the teacher/researcher makes an explicit effort to inform them about the action research and how she will use the results from it. The same is true for the students’ parents; unless the teacher-researcher makes an effort to contact parents, they simply will not know that their child’s activities are being observed or may eventually be made public. Students’ ignorance is especially likely if the students are very young (kindergarten) or have intellectual or reading difficulties, as in the example we described above. As an action researcher, therefore, a teacher is obliged to explain the nature of a research project clearly, either in a letter written in simple language or in a face-to-face conversation, or both. Parents and students need to give clear indications that they actually understand what class activities or materials will constitute data that could be made public. In most cases, indicating informed consent boils down to students’ parents signing a letter giving permission for the study. Sometimes, in addition, it is a good idea to recheck with students or parents periodically as the project unfolds, to make sure that they still support participation.

====Insuring Freedom to Participate====
When a student fails to participate in an ordinary class activity, most teachers consider it legitimate to insist on the student’s participation—either by persuading, demanding, or (perhaps) tricking the student to join in. Doing so is ethical for teachers in their roles as teachers, because teachers are primarily responsible for insuring that students learn, and students’ participation presumably facilitates learning. If a teacher designates an activity as part of an action research project, however, and later shares the results with them, the teacher then also becomes partly responsible for how other teachers use knowledge of the research study. (Remember: sharing results is intrinsically part of the research process.) The resulting dual commitment means that “forcing” a student to participate in an action research activity can no longer be justified solely as being for the student’s own educational good.

Much of the time, a simultaneous commitment to both teachers and students presents no real dilemma: what is good for the action research project may also be good for the students. But not always. Suppose, for example, that a teacher wants to do research about students’ beliefs about war and global conflict, and doing so requires that students participate in numerous extended group discussions on this topic. Even though the group discussions might resemble a social studies lesson and in this sense be generally acceptable as a class activity, some parents (or students) may object because they take too much class time away from the normal curriculum topics. Yet the research project necessitates giving it lots of discussion time in class. To respond ethically to this dilemma, therefore, the teacher may need to allow students to opt out of the discussions if they or their parents choose. She may therefore need to find ways for them to cover an alternate set of activities from the curriculum. (One way to do this, for example, is to hold the special group discussions outside regular class times—though this obviously also increases the amount of work for both the teacher and students.)

===Practical Challenges about Action Research===
Is action research practical? From one perspective the answer has to be &quot;Of course ''not!”''  Action research is not practical because it may take teachers’ time and effort which they could sometimes use in other ways.  Keep in mind, though, that a major part of the effort needed for action research involves the same sort of work—observing, recording information, reflecting—that is needed for any teaching that is done well. A better way to assess practicality may therefore be to recognize that teaching students ''always'' takes a lot of work, and to ask whether the additional thoughtfulness brought on by action research will make the teaching more successful.

Looked at in this way, action research is indeed practical, though probably not equally so on every occasion.  If you choose to learn about the quality of conversational exchanges between yourself and students, for example, you will need some way to record these dialogues, or at least to keep accurate, detailed notes on them.  Recording the dialogues may be practical and beneficial—or not, depending on your circumstances.  On the other hand, if you choose to study how and why certain students remain on the margins of your class socially, this problem too may be practical as action research. Or it may not, depending on whether you can find a way to observe and reflect on students' social interactions, or lack thereof.  Much depends on your circumstances—on the attention you can afford to give to your research problem while teaching, in relation to the benefits that solutions to the problems will bring students later. In general any action research project may require certain choices about how to teach, though it should not interfere with basic instructional goals or prevent coverage of an important curriculum. The main point to remember is that action research is more than passive observation of students and classrooms; it also includes educational interventions, efforts to stimulate students to new thinking and new responses.  Those are features of regular teaching; the difference is primarily in how systematically and reflectively you do them.

=Ruy Lopez Open Defence=

Black has no need to tie herself in knots by moving the knight. After 7...bxa4 8. dxc6 d6, forget about Black's potentially slightly rubbish rook pawns, one of which is an extra pawn anyway - Black has a stable centre with the base of her pawn-chain shielded by White's own pawn, a half-open b-file, a kingside pawn majority that could quite easily wallop White after ...f5 and ...Nf6 and the bishop pair - it's one of those rare positions that are just really good fun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Importance of Significant Figures ==
Significant figures (also called significant digits) are an important part of scientific and mathematical calculations, and deals with the accuracy and precision of numbers. It is important to estimate uncertainty in the final result, and this is where significant figures become very important. 

===Precision and Accuracy===
Before discussing how to deal with significant figures one should discuss what precision and accuracy in relation to chemical experiments and engineering. '''Precision''' refers to the reproducibility of results and measurements in an experiment, while '''accuracy''' refers to how close the value is to the actual or true value. Results can be both precise and accurate, neither precise nor accurate, precise and not accurate, or vice versa. The validity of the results increases as they are more accurate and precise. 

An useful analogy that helps distinguish the difference between accuracy and precision is the use of a target. The bullseye of the target represents the true value, while the holes made by each shot (each trial) represents the validity.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Accuracy_and_precision-highprecisionlowaccuracy.gif|High precision, but unfortunately low accuracy
Image:Accuracy_and_precision-highaccuracylowprecision.gif|High accuracy, but not very good precision
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
As the above images show, the first has a lot of holes (black spots) covering a small area. The small area represents a precise experiment, yet it seems that there is a faultiness within the experiment, most likely due to systematic error, rather than random error.
The second image represents an accurate though imprecise experiment. The holes are near the bullseye, even &quot;touching&quot; or within, though the problem is that they are spread out. This could be due to random error, systematic error, or not being careful in measuring.

=== Counting Significant Figures ===
There are three preliminary rules to counting significant. They deal with non-zero numbers, zeros, and exact numbers.

1) ''Non-zero numbers'' - all non-zero numbers are considered significant figures

2) ''Zeros'' - there are three different types of zeros
*''leading zeros'' - zeros that precede digits - do not count as significant figures (example: .0002 has one significant figure)
*''captive zeros'' - zeros that are &quot;caught&quot; between two digits - do count as significant figures (example: 101.205 has six significant figures)
*''trailing zeros'' - zeros that are at the end of a string of numbers and zeros - only count if there is a decimal place (example: 100 has one significant figure, while 1.00 has three, as well as 100.)

3) ''Exact numbers'' - these are numbers not obtained by measurements, and are determined by counting. An example of this is if one counted the number of millimetres in a centimetre ('''10''' - it is the definition of a millimetre), but another example would would be if you have '''3''' apples.

{{Example| How many significant figures do the following numbers have? Assume none of them are exact numbers.

a) 4.2362 - all numbers, so five

b) 2.0 - zeros after a decimal point count, so two

c) 9900 - only two in this case, because there is no decimal point

d) .44205 - there is a &quot;captive zero,&quot; which means it counts, so five

e) .05 - only the five counts, so one 

f) 3.9400E9 - tricky one, but scientific notation helps make the zeros at the end noticeable; there are five}}

=== The Parable of the Cement Block ===

People new to the field often question the importance of significant figures, but they have great practical importance, for they are a quick way to tell how accurate a number is. Including too many can not only make your numbers harder to read, it can also have serious negative consequences. 

As an anecdote, consider two engineers who work for a construction company. They need to order cement bricks for a certain project. They have to build a wall that is 10 feet wide, and plan to lay the base with 30 bricks. The first engineer does not consider the importance of significant figures and calculates that the bricks need to be 0.3333 feet wide and the second does and reports the number as 0.33, figuring that a precision of &lt;math&gt; \pm 0.01ft &lt;/math&gt; (0.1 inches) would be precise enough for the work she was doing.

Now, when the cement company received the orders from the first engineer, they had a great deal of trouble. Their machines were precise but not so precise that they could consistently cut to within 0.0001 feet. However, after a good deal of trial and error and testing, and some waste from products that did not meet the specification, they finally machined all of the bricks that were needed. The other engineer's orders were much easier, and generated minimal waste.

When the engineers received the bills, they compared the bill for the services, and the first one was shocked at how expensive hers was. When they consulted with the company, the company explained the situation: they needed such a high precision for the first order that they required significant extra labor to meet the specification, as well as some extra material. Therefore it was much more costly to produce.

What is the point of this story? Significant figures matter. It is important to have a reasonable gauge of how accurate a number is so that you know not only what the number is but how much you can trust it and how limited it is. The engineer will have to make decisions about how precisely he or she needs to specify design specifications, and how precise measurement instruments (and control systems!) have to be. If you do not need 99.9999% purity then you probably don't need an expensive assay to detect generic impurities at a 0.0001% level (though the lab technicians will probably have to still test for heavy metals and such), and likewise you will not have to design nearly as large of a distillation column to achieve the separations necessary for such a high purity.

=== Mathematical Operations and Significant Figures ===
Most likely at one point, the numbers obtained in one's measurements will be used within mathematical operations. What does one do if each number has a different amount of significant figures? If one adds 2.0 litres of liquid with 1.000252 litres, how much does one have afterwards? What would 2.45 times 223.5 get?

For addition and subtraction, the result has the same number of '''decimal places''' as the least precise measurement use in the calculation. This means that 112.420020 + 5.2105231 + 1.4 would have have a single decimal place but there can be any amount of numbers to the left of the decimal point (in this case the answer is 119.0). 

For multiplication and division, the number that is the least precise measurement, or the '''number of digits'''. This means that 2.499 is more precise than 2.7, since the former has four digits while the latter has two. This means that 5.000 divided by 2.5 (both being measurements of some kind) would lead to an answer of 2.0.

=== Rounding ===
So now you know how to pick which numbers to drop if there is a question about significant figures, but one also has to take into account rounding. Once one has decided which digit should be the last digit kept, one must decide whether to round up or down. 

* If the number is greater than five (6 to 9), one rounds up - 1.36 becomes 1.4

* If the number is less than five (1 to 4), one rounds down - 1.34 becomes 1.3

What does one do when there is a five? There is a special case that deals with the number five, since, if you have not noticed, it is in the middle (between 1 and 9). Often in primary school one learns to just round up, but engineers tend to do something different, called unbiased rounding.

* If the number before the five is even, then one rounds down - 1.45 becomes 1.4

* If the number before the five is odd, then one rounds up - 1.55 becomes 1.6

* Another case is this: 1.4501, where the numbers after five are greater than zero, so one would round to 1.5

Note: '''Remember that rounding is generally done at the end of calculations, not before the calculations are made.'''

Why is this done? Engineers make many calculations that often matter, since time, money, etc. are being taken into account, it is best to make sure that the final results are not synthetic or untrue to what the actual value should be. This relates back to accuracy and precision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Critical Constants ==

At room temperature (about 298K), it is possible to add enough pressure to carbon dioxide to get it to liquify (some fire extinguishers work by keeping liquid carbon dioxide in them under very high pressure, which rapidly vaporizes when the pressure is relieved &lt;ref&gt; [http://home.howstuffworks.com/fire-extinguisher2.htm how fire extinguishers work] &lt;/ref&gt;. However, if the temperature is raised to higher than 304.2 K, it will be ''impossible'' to keep carbon dioxide in a liquid form, because it has too much kinetic energy to remain in the liquid phase. '''No amount of pressure can turn carbon dioxide into a liquid if the temperature is too high'''.

This threshold temperature is called a '''critical temperature'''. Any pure stable substance (not just carbon dioxide) will have a single characteristic critical temperature. Pure stable substances will also have a single characteristic '''critical pressure''', which is the pressure needed to achieve a phase transition at the critical temperature, and a '''critical specific volume''' which is the specific volume (volume per mass) of the fluid at this temperature and pressure.

Critical pressures are typically extremely large, ranging from 2.26 atm for helium to 218.3 atm for water &lt;ref&gt; see Wikipedia article on [[w:Critical temperature|critical properties]] &lt;/ref&gt;, and about 40 atm on average. Critical temperatures typically range from 5.26 K (for helium) to the high 600s K for some aromatic compounds.

A substance which is at a temperature higher than the critical temperature and a pressure higher than its critical pressure is called a '''supercritical fluid'''. Supercritical fluids have some properties in common with gasses and some in common with liquid, as may be expected since it they are not observed to be liquid but would be expected to be liquefied at extreme pressures.

== Law of Corresponding States ==

Recall from the last section that the ''compressibility'' of any substance (but most useful for gasses) is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Z=\frac{P*\hat{V}}{RT} &lt;/math&gt;

The compressibility of a gas is a measure of how non-ideal it is; an ideal gas has a compressibility of 1. At the critical point, in particular, the compressibility is:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; Z_C = \frac{ P_c*\hat{V}_c}{R*T_c} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Critical constants are important because it has been found experimentally that the following rule is true for many substances:

{{box|'''The Law of Corresponding States''' &lt;br&gt;
Many substances behave in similar manners to each other depending on how far the system conditions are from the critical temperature and pressure of the substance. In particular, the compressibility of a substance is strongly correlated to its variance from the critical conditions.}}

It has been found experimentally that many substances have very similar compressibility at their critical point. [http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/chemistry/3_5/3_5.html]. '''Most nonpolar substances in particular have a critical compressibility of about 0.27.''' The similarity of the critical compressibility between substances is what gives some weight to the law of corresponding states. However, the fact that the critical compressibility is not exactly the same for all substances leads to potential estimation errors if this method is used.

The critical constants are able to effectively predict the properties of a substance without gathering a large amount of data. However, it is necessary to define ''how'' the properties of the substance change as the system variables become closer to or farther from the critical point of the substance. These methods are discussed in the following sections.

=== Compressibility Charts ===

Recall that many substances have similar critical compressibility values near 0.27. Therefore, charts have been developed which relate compressibility at other conditions to those at the critical point. In order to use these charts, the system parameters are ''normalized'' by dividing by the critical constants to yield '''reduced temperature, pressure, and volume''':

{{box|'''Reduced parameters'''


&lt;math&gt; T_r = \frac{T}{T_c} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; P_r = \frac{P}{P_c} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \hat{V}_r = \frac{\hat{V}}{\hat{V}_c} &lt;/math&gt; }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Standard vs. Actual Volume ==

When specifying the volume of a gas, the pressure and temperature ''must'' be specified because the volume of a gas depends strongly on both temperature and pressure (assuming that it is in an expandable container). In order to avoid specifying a different set of conditions for each measurement, an engineer can convert to ''standard'' temperature and pressure (typically 1 atm and 0oC) which is common to all measurements. This allows direct comparisons of volume measurements, but also requires that one convert back to the actual conditions present in the system before the value can be used.

The conversion that is used assumes that the gas is ideal, so that:

&lt;math&gt; PV = nRT &lt;/math&gt;

=== Conversion of volume to volume ===

We wish to compare a ''standard'' state to the ''actual'' state in the system. Let us consider the standard state (state &quot;s&quot;) first. We have the ideal gas law for the standard state:

&lt;math&gt; P_s*V_s = n_sRT_s &lt;/math&gt;

Now let us compare the standard state to the actual conditions in the system. The standard state conditions have been completely specified. The ideal gas law is assumed to hold in the actual system conditions as well:

&lt;math&gt; P_aV_a = n_aRT_a &lt;/math&gt;

Divide this equation by the standard-state ideal gas law gives:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_aV_a}{P_s{V}_s} = \frac{n_aRT_a}{n_sRT_s} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is actual and ''s'' is standard. If we assume that we want to compare the '''same number of moles''' of the substance between the standard and actual states, the following conversion between the states is obtained:

{{box|'''Conversion from standard to actual volume'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; V_a = \frac{P_sV_s}{T_s}*\frac{T_a}{P_a} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;}}

== &quot;Gauge&quot; Pressure vs. &quot;Absolute&quot; Pressure ==

== Different types of moles ==

== &quot;Pound-mass&quot; vs. &quot;Pound-force&quot; ==

= Ruy Lopez:Exchange Variation =
'''5.Nxe5?''' 
This is a poor move as Qd4 forks the knight at e5 and the pawn at e4.  This gives Black control of the centre and an opportunity to do some further damage...

The knight  retreats to f3 or d3 leading to Qxe4! and checks the King any defence means losing the opportunity to castle. Instead White can play 6. Ng4 but 6...Qxe4+ 7 Ne3 still leaves Black ahead in development and with the bishop pair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do you have the entire [[Opening theory in chess]] book on your watchlist? It's often very difficult to tell if an edit is valid or not since (although I play chess), the notation seems highly esoteric. Since you're more likely to know if an edit is good or not, if you could help out the RC-watchers by patrolling this book for bad edits, it'd be appreciated. Thanks!

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a '''[[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]'''. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;empty template|&lt;strong class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;Please subst this template instead by using {{tlx|User:Whiteknight/Simple Subject}}&lt;/strong&gt;}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;
== Purpose ==

This template allows you to easily create a basic [[WB:AS|Subject:]] page with minimal effort. It is not pretty or fancy, but it does create all the elements necessary to organize books by subject and highlight books with special features such as public collections, or books which are featured.

== Use ==

To use this template, add this wikicode to the subject page:

 {{subst:[[User:Whiteknight/Simple Subject]]|subject='''SUBJECT'''|parent='''PARENT'''}}

Make sure to replace '''SUBJECT''' with the name of the subject and '''PARENT''' with the name of its parent in the category hierarchy.
If the books do not appear in the main namespace, such as in the wikijunior or help namespaces, you can specify the namespace you want to use with &lt;code&gt;namespace='''NAMESPACE'''&lt;/code&gt; too.

{{User:Whiteknight/Color|Red|Warning:}} This template must be subst'd or it will not work properly. 

&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;#if:{{{parent|}}}|&lt; [[Subject:{{{parent}}}|{{{parent}}}]] {{subjects|{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;lc:{{{parent}}}}}}}}}

Books in this subject area deal with {{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;#if:{{{subject|}}}|{{{subject}}}|unknown}}.

|}&lt;!--This page was automatically constructed using the template [[User:Whiteknight/Sibling Subject]] created by User:Whiteknight. For more information about this page and how it was constructed ask him on his user talk page.--&gt;
&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

This template is used to create a '''Subject:''' page for a subject where there is significant overlap with another subject. This will list the books that are only in the primary subject and will also separately list books that are cross-listed in the sibling subject as well. To use this template type:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subst:User:Whiteknight/Sibling Subject|subject=&lt;SUBJECT&gt;|parent=&lt;PARENT&gt;|sibling=&lt;SIBLING&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Optionally, styles may be added to both the page lists and to the section labels. To add a CSS style to the page lists, write:

 style=&lt;STYLE&gt;

And to add a style to the column labels, use:

 label=&lt;LABEL STYLE&gt;

This template can only be subst'd.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:science|science]]''': any systematic knowledge-base or prescriptive practice that is capable of resulting in a prediction or predictable type of outcome. Science is a continuing effort to discover and increase human knowledge and understanding through disciplined research. The methods of scientific research include the generation of hypotheses about how phenomena work, and experimentation that tests these hypotheses under controlled conditions. The results of this process enable better understanding of past events, and better ability to predict future events of the same kind as those that have been tested.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:physics|physics]]''': the study of matter and its motion through spacetime and all that derives from these, such as energy and force. Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from the smallest sub-atomic particles, to the largest galaxies. Physics aims to both connect the things we see around us to root causes, and then to try to connect these causes together in the hope of finding an ultimate reason for why nature is as it is.

Hello! I was also an Applied Math major while at Norfolk State! I'm excited to see another mathematician!  With your background, I'm sure you will have plenty to give to your students. You have a beautiful family by the way! [[User:Scopp001|Scopp001]] ([[User talk:Scopp001|talk]]) 00:37, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

I commend you for deciding to teach math. I have always struggled through math classes, but with hard work managed to keep good grades. For me I always had a hard time understanding why a problem was worked the way it was, what purpose it actually served, and it just never really made sense to me. It would have helped me to have teachers in highschool with such a strong, outlined plan for teaching. It sounds like with your disciplined military background, focus, and love of math you will make an excellent high school teacher.

Now that you have done the floor (which I hope you have by now) it's time to move on to another important feature of the room; the walls. You should be able to move and resize brushes by now, so I wont explain that step by step. Anyway, start by making a brush at the side of the edge of the floor brush, it should be one grid snap thick and also be one snap outside the floor brush, not so far that there is a gap, just so far that it touches the floor brush with its edge. You may have to switch view ('''''CTRL+TAB''''') to move the brush in the correct position. Just make sure your brush ''does not'' overlap another brush, as this usually leads to map issues and longer compile times.

After one of the brushes is correctly positioned, you can just duplicate the brush ('''''SPACE''''') and rotate it round the ''Z-axis'' by clicking the [[Image:RotateZRadiant.png|22px]] button. Remember to duplicate the brush '''before''' you rotate it. Repeat this step once for each wall, so once you have placed the first wall, duplicate it while it is still selected and press the [[Image:RotateZRadiant.png|22px]] button to rotate the duplicated piece of wall, then move it to its correct position.
The rule from above applies here as well, the walls should just touch each others edges, they should neither touch each other with a whole side, nor overlap each other.

So, are all the walls at their correct place and they all look alright in the 3D view? If that is the case, let's carry on, if not, read through the lines above once more and try again.
So now that all walls are in their correct place, we just need to texture them. So first, deselect everything so that you don't make any weird mistakes ('''''ESC'''''), then select each of the walls ('''''SHIFT+CLICK''''') and click the [[Image:CaulkButtonRadiant.png|22px]] button to apply the ''caulk'' shader to all the walls. This is because you only want the visible parts to have a texture, this isn't so very important in small maps like this, but when the maps you make grow in size and complexion, this is important to save performances, so, it's better you get into the habit of doing it, so every side (I will call the sides ''faces'' in the future) should be textured with that shader for now.

After all the walls are nice and pink, it's time to apply a visible texture to those faces (remember that means sides) you will see when you play your map, in this case, that would be the faces of the walls only. To put a texture on them, select a texture folder in the folder list, then click a texture and a red rectangle should appear around it, this means that the texture is selected. To apply the selected texture to the surface of the walls, simply hold '''''CTRL+SHIFT''''' and click your mouse wheel on the inner faces of the walls. This should be done in the 3D view.

If you have done everything correctly, you should now see a room with walls and a floor, the only things left now are the ceiling, a spawn point and a light, but those will be covered in the next chapter.</text>

== Re:Getting in contributors for the book ==

Hello Thewinster, welcome to Wikibooks. I saw the note that you sent to [[User:Mike.lifeguard]], I hope you don't mind me eavesdropping. In response to your request, I have posted a message about the [[Inorganic Chemistry]] book on my blog:

http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/2008/03/inorganic-chemistry.html

Hopefully this will generate some support for you and this book. Let me know if you have any other questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:37, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Collaborating - Notes ==

I would be willing to look at your notes and transcribe them into the wiki textbook.  I am student,  I've taken general chemistry and am currently taking Inorganic.  I have a textbook and powerpoint by my professor to refer to for writing.  I'm a physics major, I'm undecided about continuing with chemistry.  I first looked at the physics textbooks for something to edit, but didn't find anything clearly in need of content.

I was reading the wikipedia article on Lewis Structures and I think it could be used with minor changes for the textbook.  I didn't want to do anything because I wasn't sure about the policy on this.  It looks like that the page is a good lesson on how to draw them.  I held off on adding some content because I wasn't sure what was needed.  Could you tell me what pages need to added to and created?

Glad to help out with the project. [[User:Timetraveler3 14|Timetraveler3 14]] ([[User talk:Timetraveler3 14|talk]]) 22:49, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

== Transwikied pages ==

I've started to carefully remove content on the sections that have been copied from wikipedia, removing content that is isn't useful for someone first learning the topic.  Mostly I've deleted pieces about background or that talk about details that aren't relevent. [[User:Timetraveler3 14|Timetraveler3 14]] ([[User talk:Timetraveler3 14|talk]]) 00:39, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

== Work to be done ==

I'm contining to slowly remove content so that the pages seem more like textbook and not an encylopedia.  I don't completly understand how to fully use wikipedia.  What is the best way to comment on things that i see/feel should be changed across the book.  Is there one place with a list of all edits that need to be done.  How should notes be made on future work to be done?  Thanks. [[User:Timetraveler3 14|Timetraveler3 14]] ([[User talk:Timetraveler3 14|talk]]) 17:59, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

== Additional places to get content from ==

I think to add to at least the section on chemical bonding, we should use content from other chemsitry wikibooks.  Basic things like the orbitals that are talked about in Gen Chem we use whats already done. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Chemistry/Atomic_Structure  [[User:Timetraveler3 14|Timetraveler3 14]] ([[User talk:Timetraveler3 14|talk]]) 02:03, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

== IIT JEE Committee scans ==

G'day, regarding the scans you've uploaded from IIT JEE Committee question papers, is this work yours or someone else's? i.e. did you write the papers, or did someone else write them? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:26, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:OK, the hand-written scans I assume are yours. But the typed ones I've tagged as copyvios; it looks like those are scans of a textbook, or a test, either of which would be copyrighted. Please note that transcribing them (if that's the case) would also be a copyright violation. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:06, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

== [[Solved Question Papers - AIEEE]] ==

Is this a real textbook? It doesn't seem like it to me - perhaps example questions would be best included in a pre-existing textbook on the subject. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:29, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

: It is a reference book. Since this is a compendium of questions previously asked in other exminations, it will not make sence if we have them ONLY as a part of other books and not an annual set. --[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 11:19, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
::Do we know who owns the copyright to the questions? Since textbooks are educational, where is there an explanation of the concepts explored by the questions?

: Done. I had hurried up with posting. The further edits will contain solutions as well (as was planned). And since &quot;explanation of concepts&quot; is emphasized, they will not be step by step solutions. As far as copyright is concerned, they do not belong to anyone. These are very fundamental questions. I tried to search for a particular template - which says that the content marked with this template is common human knowledge and one cannot claim authority over that. Basically, these questions belong to that category. --[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 09:31, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

== Chem markup ==

You might be interested in following [[bugzilla:17133|17133 Add support for mhchem package in &amp;#60;math&amp;#62; markup]]. mhchem is a nice package I use for this sort of thing. I have no idea whether that request is doable, but will hopefully get a tech person to look at it at least. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:06, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

== File upload scans ==

I came across your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Thewinster&amp;namespace=6 file uploads] and browsing around started wondering what their precise sources were. Are the hand-written ones notes taken from a course, or gathered from one or more textbooks? There are also a number of scans that seem to be from published works, but their source and authorship is a bit vague. Could you please clarify these? [[:File:1996 IIT JEE Math QP Page 0001.gif]], for example, gives the source as &quot;Question Paper&quot; and the author as both you yourself and &quot;IIT JEE Committee&quot;. Thanks, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:28, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

== Attribution ==

Some of your recent work included a lot of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wikilinks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which makes me suspect that it was copied from Wikipedia (since we don't make as much use of them here other than for linking internally in a book).  If you are taking content from Wikipedia, please consider the work of those that went into it and provide them with attribution by requesting an import of the page's history at [[Wikibooks:Requests for import]].  Thank you. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:09, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

:One thing that you should realize first before engaging in any dialog with a Wikibookian is that they can be very distinct. The common ground of every Wikibookian rests only on the volunteer work they do in the project. Most active Wikibookians on the project are the political or technological dedicated not particularly involved in long term or broad contribution to effective content, most efforts of this section of the community is dedicated to function and standardization. Note also that it is very rare for the ones involved on specific projects to want or see the need to get involved on the political and technological (and maintenance/administrative) side of the project and vice versa those that do active work on maintaining and evolving the project will often cease to produce any content contributions. Because of those facts I don't particularly know who I should recommend you to talk with, since your message is dedicated to those that contribute content but is focused on creating and orienting policy. My best recommendation is that you should be clear and elaborate a proposal on your own userspace and place a summarized notice on the general community discussion area and attempt to contact people you detect as actively contributing content.
: Regarding your proposal there are also some contrasting targets, wikibooks are more often than not, a work of a single &lt;u&gt;author&lt;/u&gt;, in this case the creation of roadmaps will not be helpful or wanted as edits from other are sporadic. On the other side there are a few wikibooks that could benefit from a roadmap to help more complex book communities (like those working on the 3D studio), we also have complex book communities that aren't organized on wikikbooks (for instance those working on the AROS project (I presume they are organizing edits outside of the visibility of the wikibooks project, so far this is not a problem since the scope of the works is very specific), but of course making the structure more visible would create the opportunity for others to join. So as for the creation of roadmaps that is my view, they should be created by and for the specific book communities and so far this hasn't been an issue. In the last years, mostly by my actions in regards to the fork policy, and the recent creation and organization of the subjects namespace we have created the necessity to present a scope for books this in some way is a proto-roadmap...
: On the issue of outcomes I have a difficulty to distinguish what you mean. The outcome is part of the general definition of every Wikibook and often expressed on the the declaration of scope/intentions of a Wikibook, and in view of you intention to define a roadmap, the establishing of goals is indispensable. In any case goal setting can only go so far on volatile volunteer base, I often reformat books that have been abandoned, that have a valid structure and even content but no defined goal or objectives. (Example [[House_Construction]])  
: Providing links and annotations on the construction of a Wikibook is extremely dangerous, for instance it can be used as covert a form of pressure and attack or simple malicious interference. My experience in this regard is extensive, I've been accused of plagiarizing, and copyright infringement getting to the point of having one of the works going through a RfD ([[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/C++ Programming|and surviving]]). Being transparent in regards to sources creates the possibility for comparison, I'm a strongly defendant that one can turn most copyrightable material into something freely usable but see that since editors rarely have time and have no editorial control the chance that someone without the necessary understanding (or by malice) to come and create issues is extremely problematic but some wikibookians do that (mostly in low evolving works that permit close scrutiny for instance [[Data Compression]] mostly a single author work by DavidCary, most sections start by a simple annotations/references (I have discussed with him some issue privately since a book community doesn't exist) or even my work [[The_World_of_Peer-to-Peer_(P2P)]], I often copy web sources into TODO boxes for latter expansion of content. In any case my view is that most of the Wikibook community dislike public interaction that goes beyond the book creation. This was most visible in the not so old discussion regarding the Questions and Answers pages some books support or even the suppression of non-Wikibooks specific questions that sometimes are posted on the general community discussion areas that are summarily deleted by some as being out of context.
: The part about tweaks and fixes in regards to crowdsourcing may be the strongest point but the hardest to realize, for instance the evolution of the Wikimedia software is too much centered on the needs of Wikipedia, Wikibooks shares most of the necessities with Wikisource. Even a better interaction between Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects would help. For instance we recently concluded our move and cross dependency with Commons but [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals#User:CommonsDelinker|some problems exist when images are deleted at commons without considering that some times a replacement image exists]] or a local resistance to use wikilinks to Wikipedia...
: I read the Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg but most concepts seem to me to be commonsensical, I think that the solution to issues is not exclusively technical, for instance as an editor/author at Wikibooks my major problem was issues of the legal ambiguity, that leads to the usurpation, attacks of reputation and general diminishing returns in regards to the work performed. Volunteers at Wikibooks contribute because the love the subject matter, like to share information, seek to improve or contest someone viewpoint, seek recognition and to establish to others they have knowledge (or a mixture of these motivations at various degrees).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:02, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
:You may also take a look into what seems to me a failed experience called [[Wikibooks:WikiProject]]s and if you have the time try to talk with users of the projects that have made use of it (especially the chess community), the lack of participation in regarding to [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] (I dislike this particular methodology but see the objective as valid). You should also attempt to try to contact with [[User:Robert Horning]] (use email) and post something on the Wikibooks mailing lists (most others you have already bumped). Take special notice of Jomegat (extremely old, contemplative Wikibookian, than can probably give you good insights)‎‎ and Adrignola‎‎ (especially for his extensive work on organizing the subject and categories sections of Wikibook will certainly have a good general view on trends and how volunteers engage the project).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:09, 27 September 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--The diminutive suffix can show shortness, smallness, affection or can be condescening. The emperor [[w:Romulus Augustus|Romulus Augustus]] had a diminutive nickname that showed the latter. ''Augustulus'' was meant to show how insignficant he was. On the other hand, emperors like [[w:Caligula|Caligula]] had affectionate ones (Caligula means &quot;Little sandal&quot;). The diminutive will often just be a nickname (which will often be in the [[Latin/Lesson 5-Vocative|Vocative]]) for example ''Iacobule'' would be a nickname for ''Iacobus''. &quot;''-lus''&quot; and &quot;''-la''&quot; are generally the ending forms throughout the declensions. &quot;''-olus''&quot; is given after a vowel (''Gladius'' → ''Gladiolus'')&lt;ref name=&quot;EnWIKI&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations used in the tables below are &quot;'''Nom.'''&quot; = [[Latin/Lesson 1-Nominative|Nominative]], &quot;'''Gen.'''&quot; = [[Latin/Lesson 2-Genitive and Dative#The Genitive|Genitive]] and &quot;'''Dim.'''&quot; = Diminutive.

==In nouns==
The diminutive form of a noun takes the gender of the word of origin e.g. ''Vicus'' (masc.) becomes ''Viculus'' (masc.) Some irregular forms are ''Conventus'' (masc.) which becomes ''Conventiculum'' (neu.) and ''Nux'' (fem.) which becomes ''Nucleus'' (masc.)

===The first and second declensions===

|+ style=&quot;font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;|
|-style=&quot;background:#ccccff;&quot;
! rowspan=2| Word&lt;br&gt;Form !! 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; declension !! colspan=3| 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; declension
|-style=&quot;background:#ccccff;&quot;
! &lt;small&gt;Feminine&lt;/small&gt; !! colspan=2| &lt;small&gt;Masculine&lt;/small&gt; !! &lt;small&gt;Feminine&lt;/small&gt;

| '''Dim.'''  || Porc-ella&lt;ref name=&quot;mys&quot;&gt;http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/classics/latin/latin13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; || Vic-ulus || Libr-ellus || Dōn-ulum
|}

In proper names of the first declension, &quot;''-ia''&quot; can sometimes become &quot;''-illa''&quot; (''Lucia'' → ''Lucilla''). An exception to the rules above is &quot;''-ina''&quot; which becomes &quot;''-ella''&quot;. So ''femina'' (lady) would drop the &quot;''-in-''&quot; and make ''femella'' (meaning &quot;girl&quot;) rather than &quot;''feminella''&quot;. Masculine and neuter &quot;''-in-''&quot; words (ending in ''-inus, -um'') become &quot;''-illus, -um''&quot; like in ''Catillus'', coming from ''Catinus''.

===The third declension===
The third declension is the trickiest of the declensions for adding a diminutive suffix. The many forms each have endings which vary and the gender has to be individually learnt.

|}

===Double diminutive===
[[image:Capitellulum.PNG|200px|right|thumb|Various double diminutive forms of &quot;''caput -itis''&quot; (head) with the infinity sign]]
When the normal diminutive is &quot;''-ulus, -a, -um,''&quot; The double diminutive is &quot;''-ellus, -a, -um.''&quot; Therefore ''Capitulum'' (Little head - The diminutive of &quot;''Caput, -itis''&quot;) becomes ''Capitellum'' (also neuter - probably translating as &quot;tiny head&quot;). The triple diminutive is &quot;''-ellulus, -a, -um,''&quot;, so ''Capitellulum''. It is then possible to make infinite forms (See the image.)

This book is for logic as it relates to computer science. But there is also a book [[Logic for Computer Scientists]]. How are these different?

Good point. I tried to get in contact for a join but got no answer by now.  We ll see.

{{closed|'''Keep'''. No consensus at all to delete, I'll look into a merger with the Cookbook. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:27, 20 August 2007 (UTC)}}
Found this too, it's not a textbook so much as a short page of notes about how to throw a party with wine and cheese. Certainly isn't instructional enough, and doesnt even contain enough information to really throw a good party. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]])

*'''Keep''' - I consider this one a stub, it has some information that can be built upon, or even merged in another book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:02, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - another keep from the resident inclusionist. Contains useful information that could be included in a book on entertaining, or merged into the Cookbook. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:33, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - looks like a How-To to me. I doubt that it really fits in the Cookbook, however this is at least the second time someone has suggested this. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:25, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

This is garbage. Don't take my word for it, however: read it for yourself. It's actually funny, in a way. In the space of about 3 disjointed paragraphs, the reader is told that &quot;dragon&quot; means &quot;serpent&quot; and that therefore dragons must be real (logical falacy), that dinosaurs were killed by noah's flood, dinosaurs are not tall enough to keep their heads above water during the great flood, that combining helium and platinum makes fire (it does not), that scientists have discovered &quot;proof&quot; of fire-breathing dragons because they've found fossils with platinum teeth and helium-filled stomachs (they have not), and that a dragon with helium in it's stomach would have enough lift to fly (it would not). I would have made it a speedy, but it's more funny to actually vote on it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:21, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, to unify everything we have said about electricity and magnetism so far, we will write out Maxwell's equations together.  Taken together, Maxwell's equations describe all of classical electrodynamics.

First we have Gauss' law:

&lt;math&gt;\oint_{S} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

Gauss' law for magnetism is

&lt;math&gt;\oint_{S} \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Ampere's law is

&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} \vec{B} = \mu_0 I_{encl}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, Faraday's law is

&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} \vec{E} = -\frac{d \Phi_B}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, imagine a parallel plate capacitor.  If we apply Ampere's law around the wire, and take the surface so that the wire cuts through it, we get one answer.  But if we take the surface so that it goes ''in between'' the parallel plates, we get 0 for the surface integral!  We have to revise our laws.  Maxwell added in a term which essentially implies that when charge builds up, current has flowed in -- the conservation of charge.  This manifests itself as a new term in Ampere's law (you can actually show that in order to have charge conserved, this is the ''only'' possible term that is legal and able to be measured):

&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} \vec{B} = \mu_0 I_{encl} + \epsilon_0 \mu_0 \frac{d \Phi_E}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

Look at the equations; there are two contour integral equations and two surface integral equations.  The Ampere-Maxwell law and the Faraday law both have the derivative of the flux of the opposite field in them.  It is not difficult to imagine that if we had a magnetic charge, Maxwell's equations would be completely symmetrical, up to the constants in front of terms.

Also, we can apply Green's Theorem to Maxwell's equations and obtain them in another form:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot B = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times E + \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times B - \epsilon_0 \mu_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = \mu_0 J &lt;/math&gt;.

Helmholtz's theorem states that a function is uniquely defined by it's divergence, curl, and suitable boundary conditions.  If we play around with that theorem a little bit, we can show that Maxwell's equations completely specify all of electromagnetism.

&lt;!-- should also discuss the potential formulation, the complete solutions to maxwell's equations, solutions to a moving charged particle at constant velocity, relativistic notation, relativity, gauges, electromagnetic tensor, the classical wave equation, radiation, behavior of light (refraction, defraction, least time, index of refraction), momentum of fields, energy of fields, electromagnetic mass, Poincaré stresses and the failure of electromagnetism --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few of the many versions of Linux are designed for embedded systems.

Unlike the majority of &quot;desktop&quot; or &quot;server&quot; distributions of Linux,
these versions of Linux either
* (a) support [[Embedded Systems/Real-Time Operating Systems|real-time tasks]], or
* (b) run in a &quot;small&quot; embedded system, typically booting out of Flash, no hard drive, no full-size video display, and take far less than 2 minutes to boot up, or
* (c) both.

== Linux and MMU ==

Linux was originally designed on a processor with a memory management unit (MMU).
Most embedded systems do not have a MMU, as we discussed earlier ([[Embedded Systems/Memory]]).

Benefits of using a processor with a MMU:
* can isolate running &quot;untrusted&quot; machine code from running &quot;critical&quot; code, so the &quot;untrusted&quot; code is guaranteed (in the absence of hardware failures) not to interfere with the &quot;critical&quot; code
* makes it easier for the OS to present the illusion of virtual memory
* can run &quot;normal&quot; Linux (could also run &quot;μClinux&quot;, but what's the point?)

Benefits of using a processor without a MMU:
* typically lower-cost and lower-power
* can still run the &quot;μClinux&quot; version of Linux specifically designed to run on processors without a MMU.

== Linux and real time ==

People use a variety of methods to combine real-time tasks with Linux:
* Run the real-time tasks on a dedicated microcontroller; communicate with a (non-real-time) PC that handles non-real-time tasks. This is pretty much your only choice if you need real-time response times below 1 microsecond.
* Run the real-time tasks in a &quot;underlying&quot; dedicated real-time operating system; run Linux as a &quot;nested operating system&quot; inside one low-priority task on top of the real-time operating system. Some of these systems claim real-time response times below 500 microseconds.
* use a Linux kernel designed to emphasize real-time tasks, and run the real-time tasks with a high priority (perhaps even as a kernel thread). As Linux develops, it seems to be getting better response times (''[http://web.archive.org/web/20020214003420/http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3989618385.html &quot;Preemptible kernel patch makes it into Linux kernel v2.5.4-pre6&quot;]''; ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20061015193307/www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9566944929.html Linux kernel gains new real-time support]'').

Typically embedded Linux needs a minimum of about 2 MB of RAM, not including application and service needs[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECos].

* non-real-time Linux distributions designed for embedded systems:
** [[Wikipedia: uClinux]] (&quot;MicroController Linux&quot;) is a version of the Linux kernel that supports Altera NIOS, ADI Blackfin, ARM, ETRAX, Freescale M68K (including DragonBall, ColdFire, PowerQUICC and others), Fujitsu FRV, Hitachi H8, MIPS, and Xilinx MicroBlaze processors.
** [[Wikipedia: Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset]] (ELKS) is a small subset of Linux that, like uClinux, can run even on machines that lack a MMU. It apparently only supports x86 machines (including the 8088-based original IBM PC, the 80286-based original IBM PC/AT, the NEC V30H-based Psion Series 3, etc.)
* [http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~bruyninc/rthowto/ &quot;Real Time and Embedded Guide (&quot;rtHOWTO&quot;)&quot;] by Herman Bruyninckx 2002 claims that standard Linux (in 2002) is not a true real-time OS nor an embedded OS.
* The coreboot project (formerly known as the &quot;LinuxBIOS&quot; project) is developing firmware that replaces a standard &quot;BIOS&quot;, boots out of motherboard Flash just like standard BIOS, and boots into almost any modern 32-bit operating system much faster than a standard BIOS (by cutting out most of the &quot;device detection&quot; and &quot;hardware initialization&quot; a standard BIOS does, since the OS needs to do that all over again anyway).

http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/6300/areaportalin7.jpg
'''areaportal'''
Blocks vis when a door is closed, to function the brush has to be textured with the &quot;skip&quot; shader and ONE face has to be textured with the &quot;areaportal&quot; shader, then the face with the &quot;areaportal&quot; shader has to be exactly in the middle of the door.



http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/3453/caulkbk5.jpg
'''caulk'''

This is the most common system shader, this shader is invisible and all faces with this shader wont be drawn by the engine, therefore this shader should be on any face the player cant see.



http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/3453/caulkbk5.jpg
'''caulk_noclip'''
Same as caulk, but this one also makes the brush non-solid i.e. you can walk though it.


http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/3453/caulkbk5.jpg
'''caulk_water'''
Same as the normal caulk, but this one gives the brush water properties i. e. Splash sounds, drowning and stuff like that.


http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/4692/clipdy0.jpg
'''clip'''
This shader is completely invisible ingame and will block players, NPCs and BOTs, but missiles, blasters and grenades will get though. This is useful for making stairs and stuff like that.


http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/8865/cushionxg9.jpg
'''cushion'''
If a player lands on a brush with this shader he will not take any falldown damage. '''Caution:''' this will also remove any landing sounds, so use carefully.




http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/2305/hintuf0.jpg
'''hint'''
This shader is used to block vis around corners, it has to be placed so that it is overlapping 8 units with structural brushes in all directions. for further information check [http://tremmapping.pbwiki.com/Understanding%20Vis%20and%20Hint%20Brushes this] tutorial.



http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/343/insideuj7.jpg
'''inside'''
If you have any weather effects(like rain, snow) in your map, you should place this brush everywhere you don't want the weather effect to appear, like inside buildings. ''Note: This CANT be used in combination with the &quot;outside&quot; shader.''



http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/6498/nodroput5.jpg
'''nodrop'''
This nonsolid shader will prevent players who die ''when they are inside a brush textured with this shader'' from dropping their weapons. This is useful in pits-of-death to stop the models in the pit stealing FPS.



http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/8391/noimpactsi7.jpg
'''noimpact'''
No explosions occur when projectiles strike this surface and no marks will be left on it. Sky textures are usually marked with this texture so projectiles will not hit the sky and leave marks.



http://img151.imageshack.us/img151/701/originiz5.jpg
'''origin'''
This shader is used on brushes to specify the center(or just the place the engine is supposed to think the center is) of some entities, like func_statics or func_trains. All rotating things will rotate AROUND the origin brush and moving things will move the origin brush(and because its connected to the rest the rest will move too).



http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/3382/outsidegf1.jpg
'''outside'''
Same as the &quot;inside&quot; shader, but this time it specifies where to play the rain effect, place this shader where you want to have rain. ''Note: This CANT be used in combination with the &quot;inside&quot; shader.''



http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/4503/physicsclipqg9.jpg
'''physics_clip'''
Same as clip, except this one blocks everything except visibility, this is very useful to clip models.



http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/5699/rainsurfup5.jpg
'''rainsurf'''
Surfaces with this texture on them will(should) enable that rain-splatter effect. Although Smoke says it does not work.




http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/3538/shotonlyclipzu4.jpg
'''shotonlyclip'''
Same as clip but only blocks blaster shots. Rockets, and grenades will pass.



http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/4386/slickqa4.jpg
'''slick'''
This shader will make the surface its on slick, that means you will glide and cand change direction.



http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/1606/triggerhx7.jpg
'''trigger'''

A player inside this shader will be able to trigger a event. the event is specified in the map editor.



http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/6841/terrainql4.jpg
'''terrain'''
This is one of the most complex shaders, it will allow you making nice terrains with blended textures.
To see how this is used, go Help &gt; General &gt; Terrain Manual in GtkRadiant.



http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/1546/weatherzonera2.jpg
'''weatherzone'''

If you have inside or outside shaders in your map, try to enclose them into brushes textured with the &quot;weatherzone&quot; shader. This isn't necessary but will improve the FPS.</text>

Retexturing a model is very useful sometimes, for example if you have a rock, and want it to be out of ice or so..&lt;br&gt;

to do it, just add:&lt;br&gt;

key: &lt;tt&gt;_remap&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
value: &lt;tt&gt;*;[texture]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt;
key: &lt;tt&gt;_remap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
value: &lt;tt&gt;*;textures/hoth/ice2&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Per - surface model remapping===

If you don't want to retexture the whole of the model with one texture, you can use per-surface model remapping.

To do this, use:

key: &lt;tt&gt;_remapNN&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
value: &lt;tt&gt;[old texture];[new texture]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

NN is the surface of the model - you can probably find this by looking at it in a text editor.

Example:&lt;br&gt;
key: &lt;tt&gt;_remap01&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
value: &lt;tt&gt;textures/hoth/ice;textures/hoth/ice2&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Rotating a model==

Most people know how to rotate a model around the z-axis, just press the angle buttons.
But, if you want to rotate the model around the x or the y axis you will have to use:

Key: &lt;tt&gt;angle&lt;u&gt;'''s'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;Z&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;angle&lt;u&gt;'''s'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;90 75 60&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Autoclipping/Lighting a Model==

Autoclip(Should not be used on small models with many polys):&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;spawnflags&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Autolight:&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;spawnflags&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

These can be combined to:&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;spawnflags&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Scaling Models==

Scale on all Axes:&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;modelscale&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;[Multiplier]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example (makes model 1.3 times bigger):&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;modelscale&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;1.3&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Scale on specific axis:&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;modelscale'''_&lt;u&gt;vec'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;[Multiplier X] [Multiplier Y] [Multiplier Z]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt;
Key: &lt;tt&gt;modelscale_&lt;u&gt;'''vec'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Value: &lt;tt&gt;1.2 0.7 2.1&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;</text>

      <comment>Is multithreading entirely outside the scope of this book?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:''One simple solution to this is to ensure that any pointer is set to a null pointer immediately after being freed''
I thought you should not do that this way, because another thread could access that memory after being freed by us and before we assign it the NULL value , which would lead to an unexpected behavior.

I would rather use
 p = NULL;
 free (p);

instead of
 free (p);
 p = NULL;

trosos [[User:213.220.245.54|213.220.245.54]] 12:14, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

:That won't work. By assigning NULL to p before freeing, p no longer points to the memory location to be freed. This means you've created a memory leak, free may crash your program or cause your program to do strange things (this is known as &quot;undefined behavior&quot;). Also its just as likely that another thread will access p while its set to NULL before free is called, perhaps making p point to something else and causing whatever p points to now to be freed instead, which may not be whats wanted. Better solution is to lock access to the variable so its unaccessible by other threads until after the free is complete. Something like:
  thread_lock(p);
  free(p);
  p = NULL;
  thread_unlock(p);

I agree with Darklama that calling free() with the argument 0 can't possibly work.
The free() library routine needs to know *which* of many blocks of memory I've malloc()ed that I want to free.
If I always call free() with the same argument (zero), no matter which block of memory I really wanted to free, then there's no way for the implementation of free() to guess which of those blocks I really wanted to free.

Dealing with multi-threaded programming is already tricky, even without trying to give 2 different threads access to the same piece of malloc()ed memory.

A freed block of memory may be immediately re-used and overwritten by some other process.
Freeing that memory can be considered a very special variation of writing to that memory.
So I think the same techniques used to deal with one or more threads writing to a block of memory and one or more threads reading that same block of memory also apply when one of those threads wants to free that memory.

The general problem is the [[w: readers-writers problem]].
Locking that block so only one thread at a time can access it is *one* good solution.
But I think that solution (and others) should be discussed under the topic of multithreading, not under the topic of malloc() and free().

Is multithreading entirely outside the scope of this book?
If so, what other book is appropriate for discussing multitasking in C -- perhaps [[Parallel Computing and Computer Clusters]]?

If multitasking is in the scope of this book, do we need yet another chapter in this book, analogous to [[C++ Programming/Threading]]?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Read the paragraph in &quot;The Setup&quot; section and answer the questions that follow it. This question is supposed to replace a theory part explaining obvious facts with an interactive session.

== The Setup ==

A horizontally aligned cylinder is divided into two sections by a vertical massless frictionless sliding adiabatic piston. Both the left and the right sections have one mole each of an ideal gas (whose molar specific heat is 20 J/mol K) at 300 K and 2.0 L. The ideal gas in the right section is maintained at a constant temperature by means of a diathermic contact with some external agent. The ideal gas in the left section, however, is in contact with a heater, which heats it slowly so that the left section expands. By the time the heater stops supplying heat, the volume of the right section has decreased to 1.0 L.

Now answer the accompanying questions.

*Note - Before solving the problem, make sure that you understand the whole of it. This problem is of intermediate level. Like most questions in physical chemistry, it seems tough only because of its length. To understand the whole scenario in this (and every other) question, note down the necessary data and diagrams where you are solving the problem. Doing so will familiarize you with the problem, and give you some mental exercise.

*So before you start to solve, draw a cylinder resting on its curved surface, divided into two parts. To each part assign the values of the gas parameters, and note which section will be heated and which one will be maintained at a constant temperature.

== The Questions ==
=== Question 1 ===
'''What process is the gas in the right section R undergoing?'''

Since it is maintained at a constant temperature, it is undergoing an isothermal process. Also, since the volume change is taking place slowly (quasi-statically), it is a reversible process. It is thus, a reversible isothermal process. The diathermic contact with an external agent just means heat can be exchanged between section R and the external agent. This is used to maintain the constant temperature in section R.

=== Question 2 ===
'''What is the significance of the adiabatic piston in between Sections L and R?'''

The adiabatic piston ensures that heat does not flow between the two sections. That is, the heat supplied to section L is utilized in heating the gas and doing PV work only, and is not passed on to section R.

=== Question 3 ===
'''What is then, the work done by the gas in the section R?'''

Use the expression/formulae for isothermal process ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV = nRTln(Vf/Vi). All of the values are known, n=1, T = 300 K constant, Vf = 1.0 L and Vi=2.0 L. The answer comes out to be -1.73 x 10^3 J. Since by IUPAC convention, work done by the gas has the same magnitude but opposite sign as ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV, the final answer is 1.73 x 10^3 J.

=== Question 4 ===
'''∆E and q for the gas in section R are ___J and ___J respectively.'''

Well, in an isothermal process, ∆E is always zero, because for an ideal gas, Internal energy depends only on temperature, and the temperature remains constant. q is to be found using the First Law Of Thermodynamics, and it comes out to be -1.73 x 10^3 J

=== Question 5 ===
'''When the heating stops, the piston stands still. What does this tell us about the pressures of the ideal gases in the two sections?'''

If the piston stands still, it means it is in a state of mechanical equilibrium. (Can you explain satisfactorily the difference between mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium?  Refer any textbook or wikipedia and note the answer just now if you cannot.) This makes us conclude that the net force acting on it is zero.

In other words, the force from the gas in section R and the force from the gas in section L are same in magnitude and opposite in sign. Equating their magnitudes, P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; x Piston Area = P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; x Piston Area. That is, the pressures of ideal gases in both the sections are same! This is a very important result, do remember how we concluded it.

=== Question 6 ===
'''If the piston had some finite mass, and the cylinder was aligned vertically, would the pressures be same in case of equilibrium?'''

Definitely not! You can draw a free body diagram of the piston and check. The ideal gas in the bottom section has to counterbalance the force due to the gas above, as well as the gravitational force acting downward. This means, the gas below will be at a higher pressure, by an amount (Piston Mass)g/(Piston Area) pascals. (Convince yourself about this point.)

=== Question 7 ===
'''By performing actual integration, find the value of ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV for the gas in Section L.'''

This is a very nice question, because it helps to clarify the significance of each and every variable. P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; for the gas in section L is nothing but the pressure against which it is expanding. This pressure is the pressure of the gas in section R.

∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV = ∫P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;

Now we substitute P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; as nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.

∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV = ∫P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = ∫(nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)(dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;) = nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;∫(dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;)/(V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)

(The numerator was taken out of integration, because it is a constant)

Now comes the main step of the question. Can we integrate the variable V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the variable V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;? Definitely not. So we substitute the variable V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; as [4.0 L - V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;] and carry out the integration from limits 2.0L to 3.0 L. This is because, the total volume of the cylinder will remain constant at 2.0 + 2.0 = 4.0 L, and if the volume of one section increases by some amount, the volume of the other section decreases by the same amount.

(The substitution V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.0L - V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is similar to the case of evaluating ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV for an ideal gas in an isothermal process. There, since we could not integrate P wrt V, we substituted it as nRT/V)

The definite integration yields the value of the integral to be (nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)(-1)(ln[{4-3}/{4-2}]) = nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;ln2 = 1.73 x 10^3 J &lt;u&gt;same in magnitude, but opposite in sign, as ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV for section R. Note this point carefully&lt;/u&gt;.

=== Question 8 ===
'''We substituted P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. = nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/(4.0 - V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;). But we do know that since this is a quasi static process, the piston is always in mechanical equilibrium and hence the pressures of gases in both the section are always same. So why did not we substitute P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = nRT/V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;?'''

Definitely we could have done this. But take a look back at Q7. The numerator nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; was constant an could be taken out of integration. Is this the case with nRT&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; as well? No. We would again need to substitute T&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; as some function of V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, so that we could carry on with the integration. All in all, what we did was correct.

=== Question 9 ===
'''Prove that the values of ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV for the two sections are always going to be the additive inverse of each other for this scenario.'''

Consider ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; + ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;. To prove our point, we will prove this expression to be zero, no matter what. The first point is, as we discussed above, the P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; for one section is the pressure of the ideal gas in the other section. Now, both are equal at any point of time in our case (because the process is quasi static, both mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium are maintained at every stage. Convince yourself that this statement leads to our conclusion.}

Also, we have already proved before that the change in the volume of one section is the aditive inverse of the change in the volume of the other section. See Q7, and by the way, this is obvious. So, 

dV&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = -dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;.

Hence,  ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; + ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;. = ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; - ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

=== Question 10 ===
'''Find the work done w by the gas in section L, its ∆E and the heat supplied by the heater.'''

*w = - ∫P&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;dV = -1.73 x 10^3 J

*∆E = nCv∆T. Now finding the change in temperature is a different task altogether. But use the skills that you derived from solving the table. The initial temperature is known to us. But for the final state, we only know the volume. The temperature and pressure are not known. We need two equations then. The first is the ideal gas equation. The second is obviously, P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. = nRT&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. 

*Substitute this value of P&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; in the ideal gas equation (do not obtain the numerical value, it will just increase some calculation). After a lot of cancellation (to our satisfaction), we obtain T&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 600K. n=1 moles, Cv = 20.0 J/K mol and ∆T = 300K. This gives the answer to be 1.20 x 10^4 J

*The heat supplied by the heater is nothing but q for section l, which is to be found using the first law of thermodynamics and is found equal to, after rounding off, 1.4 x 10^4 J.

All the walls should be textured and done by now, and be in their correct positions, if not, go back to  the last chapter and repeat it. So, if you're done, lets make the ceiling.
The first way to do this would be to make a completely new brush, texture one side of it and caulk the other ones, but, I guess you have enough of caulking and texturing by now, so let's do it in another way. So start by selecting the floor ('''''SHIFT+CLICK''''') and duplicate it ('''''SPACE'''''), now, switch to the side view and drag the duplicate of the floor all the way to the top of the room where the ceiling should be. But now, the texture is still on the wrong side, right, so we need to flip the whole brush around to make that the texture is on the correct side, to do so, click the [[Image:FlipZRadiant.png|22px]] button on the toolbar. This should flip the brush around the Z axis which means that the brush is now upside-down and the textured surface is the one facing the room. Just make sure the brush is in the correct position as brushes sometimes move a bit during a flip or rotate, when you are sure the brush is in the correct position, we can go on to making the light.

To make the light, right click somewhere on the 2D grid on and select light in the context menu that appears, a dialog should pop up asking you about the light intensity i.e. how strong the light is, in most cases the default is a good value, but if you want to make dimmed or super bright areas, you can adjust it here, so, for now, simply click the ''OK'' button and a small, diamond-shaped thing should appear, and you have created your first entity. An entity is something that interacts with the game or the compiler or both. Our light in this case interacts with both, anyway, an entity can have many different properties, for example the light entity can flicker, be colored etc. 

You could try to make a flickering light by selecting the light (if it isn't already selected) and opening the entity window ('''''N'''''). You should now see the [[GtkRadiant/Entity Window|entity window]] which contains an explanation of the current entity, a list of properties assigned to it and some buttons and fields which you can read about [[GtkRadiant/Entity Window|here]]. To make the light flicker, just type &lt;tt&gt;style&lt;/tt&gt; into the textfield labeled ''Key'' and &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; into the field labeled ''value'', then press enter and you will see that a new property has been assigned to the light entity called ''style'', which has the value ''1''. So make sure the light is inside the room and not in the walls or outside it. If it's inside the room and looks alright, the light is done.

Now the light is done, so let's go on to the spawn point. A spawn point is an entity as well, just like the ''light'' entity, which means that it's something that interacts with the game. A spawn point simply tells the game where you will spawn when you join the game. To place one, right click the 2D grid again, but this time hover over the sub menu called ''info'' and select ''info_player_start'' or  ''info_player_deathmatch''. A red or pink box should appear where you clicked, move that box somewhere in the room, it must not be inside a wall or floor, it should be on the floor.
The size of the box is also important as it is the same size as a player in the game. You may also have noticed the arrow on the side of the box. This arrow indicates the direction which the player will face upon entering the game. This can be changed by selecting the entity and clicking the [[Image:RotateZRadiant.png|22px]] button.</text>

Everything should be set and done by now and you are probably full of eager to actually try the map out ingame. To begin, we need to compile the map. This means that the simple code a ''.map'' file is in will be translated into code the ''id Tech 3'' or ''Quake 3'' engine can understand. Compiling a map will also render shadows and lights round the map. Compiling this small room should just take a few seconds, but compiling larger, more detailed maps can take longer, much longer, sometimes even days. 

Starting the compile process is simple, just open the ''Build'' (in GtkRadiant 1.4 this is called ''Bsp'') menu and select any of the entries with ''(test)'' in them. If you have not yet saved the map, you will have to do this now. Later you will learn about the different options, but this should do it for now. When you click the menu item three console windows should open, one for each compile stage. They won't open all at the same time, but after the previous one is done. 

After all three have closed, check the folder where you saved the ''.map '' file, there should now be a ''.bsp'' file in the same folder with the same name as the map. If this is the case, start up the game you are mapping for, in this case ''Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy'' and get into the ingame console ('''''SHIFT+KEY BELOW ESC'''''). Here, type &lt;tt&gt;/devmap mapname&lt;/tt&gt; where you replace &lt;tt&gt;mapname&lt;/tt&gt; with the name of your map file without the extension. So if your compiled map file would be called ''firstroom.bsp'' you would type &lt;tt&gt;/devmap firstroom&lt;/tt&gt; and hit enter.

Your map should now load and you should spawn where you placed the spawn point. If you spawn but can't move, the spawn point is probably halfway inside the floor or the wall. If you get an error message, write about it on my [[User_talk:Yzmo|talk page]] and I will add it to an error section of this book.

If it all works, then &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''Congratulations'''&lt;/font&gt;, you have just made your first map! You should also have gotten some experience with GtkRadiant so i guess you can make other maps pretty soon. Good Luck!

===Troubleshooting===
====Ingame Errors====
* &lt;tt&gt;Can't find maps/yourmap.bsp&lt;/tt&gt;
:This means that there is no file called &lt;tt&gt;yourmap.bsp&lt;/tt&gt; in your GameData\base\maps folder. Remember that the .bsp file is not the same as the .map file. When compiling the map, that's what you do when that DOS window appears, the .map is turned into a .bsp, which the game can load. So usually, this error means something went wrong during the compile. Check the compile log ('''O''') log for errors.

OR type this in console:

/sv_pure 0

====Compile Errors====
* &lt;tt&gt;Map Leaked&lt;/tt&gt;
:This means that your map isn't totally closed off from the {{GtkRGloss|void|void}}. Or a part of your entities is outside the map. A red line should appear telling you what and where.</text>

Before learning about the entities, take a look at the entity window which is opened by pressing '''''N'''''. Here you can set all the properties of an entity, for example light strength, door speed, in fact everything that you can set.

|width2=70%
|label2=Properties Window
|text2=&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the different properties assigned to the entity, the name of the property called ''Key'' is to the left, the ''Value'' to the right. The checkboxes highlighted in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00;&quot;&gt;'''red'''&lt;/span&gt; color are also properties you can, these properties are called ''spawnflags''. To add a property which isn't a ''spawnflag'', type its ''Key'' and its ''Value'' in the boxes highlighted in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00c;&quot;&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; color. &lt;/p&gt;

'''Migration of a hard drive in MS Windows XP (or 2000)'''

''(Verified under Windows XP Professional SP2[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_xp] and Windows 2000 Professional SP4[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000])''

Ever tried to move a hard drive containing a Windows installation from one PC to another, and ran into the BSOD[http://en.wikipedia.orЧg/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death].

'''I will not be responsible for any direct or indirect damage to hardware, software OR for any loss or damage to data resulting from following these procedures - You've been warned!'''

== Pre-requisites: ==

1. Source [[Wintel]] machine (Windows computer you want to migrate the hard drive from)

2. Destination [[Wintel]] machine (computer you want to move your hard drive to)
3. List of all components and their manufacturers in both source and destination machines, this is usually listed in hardware manufacturer manuals (This is important!)

4. Administrative access to your machines, or at least access to make changes in Device Manager (Go to Start-&gt; Run-&gt; type compmgmt.msc, under System Tools you will see Device Manager)

5. Ensure you have all the compatible (XP or 2000) drivers (including [[Chipset]] and especially network card) for your destination hardware (I recommend downloading and saving them to your source machine under a &quot;Drivers&quot; folder that you will be able to find later)

6. Ensure your destination PC supports your hard drive Controller (i.e. cannot plug in IDE/PATA drive into SATA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA] controller), and power requirements (not exceeding power supply wattage, which generally should not be a problem)

* If you are having problems garnering information on all components, you may want to try Everest Home Edition 2.20 (free for non-business PCs) available at Major Geeks[http://www.majorgeeks.com], a good place to start is the Manufacturer's website

'''NOTE: 

1. This is not an alternative to a fresh installation, it is merely intended as a mechanism to save time migrating programs, documents and settings relatively painlessly.

2. This is not intended as a method to improve performance.
'''


== Procedure: ==
----

1. Cross-reference your lists from pre-requisite #3. Note ALL differences between the two machines.

2. Start up your source machine and log in to Windows.

3. Backup ALL your data including Bookmarks and Mail folders using your method of choice. (beyond scope of this article) 

4. Launch Device Manager and check through your differences. 

5. Navigate to the right-hand pane. (You should see your computer's name at the top of the device tree next to a little computer 
icon)
''During this process do not &quot;click Scan for hardware changes,&quot; or you might have start all over again.''
 a. For each device that is different 
 b. Click that device, go to the Actions menu and select Uninstall
 c. DO NOT restart your computer when prompted, go to step 5a.

Important devices to watch out for: 
  •  Hard drive controllers (IDE ATA/ATAPI, SATA or SCSI)
  •  Display Adapters
  •  System Devices
  •  Processor
  •  Monitor
  •  Network Adapters

6. When you are satisfied that everything different has been uninstalled. (Since conflicting drivers could cause the dreaded BSOD)
   SHUTDOWN your source PC properly (Start--&gt;Shutdown, don't just unplug it or force a shutdown). Unplug it from the electrical source.

7. Remove your hard drive carefully noting the power and data cable positions.

8. Check that your jumper settings match your destination configuration (i.e. master/slave/cable select), usually explained by hard drive manufacturer's manual.

9. Insert your hard drive into your destination PC.

10. Power up your destination PC. Log in to Windows and allow hardware to be detected.  If Windows is unable to detect your hardware,  direct the &quot;Found New Hardware Wizard&quot; to the &quot;Drivers&quot; folder created earlier. (Be prepared for multiple reboots)

11. Open Device Manager once your reboots have subsided and look for any yellow &quot;?&quot; marks. This usually means some drivers could not 
be properly detected. Check that you've downloaded / installed all the recommended drivers.
  a. Run Windows / Microsoft Update[http://update.microsoft.com] to update/resolve driver issues. Keep your fingers crossed.


'''Hopefully, you've had a relatively painless experience getting your destination pc up and running.'''

== [[Growing Edible Sprouts]] ==

I'm glad to see so much work done so quickly. I hope you stick around wikibooks for a while. I removed the &quot;bookify&quot; and &quot;adopt&quot; tags from the top of this page since those have been done. When [[USer:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] removed all the wikilinks (remember all the red text?), he bookified it. And when you  moved it to it's new home, you adopted it. Done and done.

In reality, some bookifying still needs to be done. You have one page of good content, but we try to write [[WB:WIW|textbooks]] here - it still looks and feels like a Wikipedia article. It needs a table of contents, chapters, sections... - it has to ''teach'' something. It's in no danger of being deleted tomorrow or anything, but it's not really a textbook right now, although it's a '''great start'''. I'm sure you already have plans for expansion, but I recommend doing a quick organizational outline of the book to give you a framework within. Take a look at how some of the [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured books]] are organized for some ideas. If you need help, feel free to ask me, or continue asking the community at [[WB:SL|the staff lounge]]. Happy editing!

Acid is a substance which contains replaceable hydrogen ions or furnish hydronium (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in an aqueous solution.
In general it is colourless and sour in taste.
It changes colour of indicators. E.G. It changes blue litmus paper red.
Dilute acid can conduct electricity which is why it is an electrolyte.
Acids reacts with bases to produce salt and water.
It is corrosive. Common acids and their trivial names include Hydrochloric (Muratic), Sulfuric (Oil of Vitrol), Nitric, Acetic and Phosphoric. 

====Arrhenius Acid====
An acid increases of the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
====Bronsted-Lowry Acid====
An acid is a substance that can donate a proton.
====Lewis Acid====
An acid is an electron pair acceptor


Sulfuric acid is used in the manufacture of such a large number of products that it is one of the highest volume chemicals made.It can be used as an economic indicator. Acetic acid is found in vinegar. Hydrochloric acid is used to clean masonary.</text>

== Author Response ==


Well I admire the fact that you have not fallen to the pressures of drinking. I think more people should follow by your example, like myself lol, but I didn't start drinking until I turned 21 so I do feel proud about that. But I completely agree with your educational philosophy. Because if you read my brief bio, you will see that I'm a History Major, and my teaching philosophy is to make history fun. I want my students to wake up and not dread coming to Mr. Billups' class. Alot of kids don't like history because their teachers don't know how to make the students interested in it. So our teaching philosophy's are the same. [[User:Jbill007|Jbill007]] ([[User talk:Jbill007|talk]]) 17:02, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

=Hi Jferi002!=
Thanks for your response! I can certainly relate to the child calling his/her teacher &quot;mom.&quot; My youngest daughter has called me by a teacher's name before. She's like &quot;Ms. Martin, I mean Mom&quot; I just smile and go on! Like you mentioned, it's no wonder for the mix-up as much time as the child spends with his/her teacher. It was nice to meet you and I look forward to having ECI301 with you!!

==Introduction==

This is a glossary of Celestia terminology. 
Many of the terms used with Celestia are very similar to the corresponding astronomical 
terminology. For a glossary of astronomical terms, see the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Astronomical_terms Astronomical Terms: Appendix to the Wiktionary]

==Glossary==


===Barycenter===
:A (possibly moving) invisible position in space defined in an STC catalog file, around which other STC and SSC objects can orbit.

===catalog===
:A text file used to define objects and their positions. Different catalogs are used to define a '''Star''' (STC), a planetary system which orbits around a '''Star''' (SSC) and objects not associated with a '''Star''' (DSC).

===CMOD===
:Celestia MODel file: a proprietary format used to define a 3D object.

===DSC===
:Deep Space Catalog; used to define glowing Nebulae or Galaxies or invisible OpenCluster objects around which nothing can orbit. Celestia v1.6 adds Globular Clusters.

===EllipticalOrbit===
:One of several different types of periodic trajectories, defined using traditional Keplerian parameters. Used in STC and SSC catalog files.

===Galaxy===
:A glowing object defined in a DSC catalog file using a PNG template and astronomical coordinates.


===GlobularCluster===
:A spherical group of dots defined in a DSC catalog file using parameters which determine how tightly grouped the dots are.

===Hipparcos===
:An astrometric satellite and the database created from its observations; used to define the positions of more than 100,000 stars in Celestia.

===Horizons===
:JPL's on-line solar system data and ephemeris computation service. Often used to generate orbit and trajectory data files.

===Julian Date===
:Julian dates are a continuous count of days and fractions since noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE (on the Julian calendar). Almost 2.5 million days have transpired since this date. Julian dates are used in Celestia's SSC and STC catalogs  for the fields Epoch, Beginning and Ending. These fields use 64-bit floating point (double precision) variables, and can represent a Julian date to about 1 millisecond of precision. The time scale that is the basis for Julian dates is Universal Time. Starting with v1.5, Celestia uses TDB internally and UT for its on-screen display. 0h UT corresponds to a Julian date fraction of 0.5: Julian days go from Noon to Noon instead of from Midnight to Midnight. This is so that the date doesn't change in the middle of nocturnal observations.

===Location===
:A Celestia object: defines a label for a position on a body.

===map===
# An image file providing information about the visual characteristics of an object.
# A mathematical transform between the geometry of a spheroidal object and a flat surface. The mapping known as &quot;simple cylindrical projection&quot; or &quot;Plate Carré&quot; is used by Celestia to map between flat images (surface texture files) and spherical planets and moons.

===Mesh===
# A 3D model used to display an object with an arbitrary shape.
# A list of connected vertices specified in a CMOD 3D model file.

===NAIF===
:NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility. A source for SPICE trajectory files.

===Nebula===
:A glowing or invisible object defined in a DSC catalog file by specifying a Mesh and astronomical coordinates.

===normal===
# A vector perpendicular to the surface at a position. ''I.e.'' a surface normal vector. Used to indicate irregularities and provide dynamic shading on surfaces.
# conventional or standard surface texture; not an '''AltSurface'''.

===object===
:A body which has its appearance and position defined in a catalog.

===OpenCluster===
:A labeled, fixed position defined in a DSC catalog file. It is not necessarily associated with any particular glowing object.

===path===
# A line drawn on the screen to indicate the orbit or trajectory of an object.
# The hierarchical list of objects around which the object currently being defined is orbiting.

===position===
:A place in a coordinate system. Not to be confused with a '''Location'''.

===ReferencePoint===
:A (usually moving) invisible position in space defined in an SSC catalog file, around which other SSC objects can orbit. A ReferencePoint has only positional characteristics. It cannot be used to provide any orientation information.

===SPICE===
:Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, C-matrix and Events kernels; not to be confused with Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis. A type of NASA trajectory information file. Use of SPICE ketnels was introduced in Celestia v1.5.0.

===SpiceOrbit===
:A trajectory defined using NAIF SPICE kernels.

===SSC===
:Solar System Catalog; used to define non-glowing objects which orbit around Stars, Barycenters and each other.

===Star===
:A glowing object defined in an STC catalog file, around which STC and SSC objects can orbit. 

===STC===
:STar Catalog; used to define glowing Stars or invisible Barycenter objects around which other objects can orbit.

===trajectory===
:The positions traversed by a moving object.

===Universal Coordinate System===

:The default coordinate system used by Celestia is Ecliptic J2000:
:The fundamental plane is the J2000 Earth ecliptic, and the preferred direction (x-axis) is the J2000 equinox.

My name is Ricardo Zorzetto Nicoliello Vêncio. I'm from São Paulo, Brazil.

B.S. in Physics, M.S. in Statistics and PhD. in [[Bioinformatics]] by the University of São Paulo (USP), I have been working on the creation of mathematical methods for the solution of problems in Biology and Medicine. More specifically, I have been working on transcript enumeration and microarray data, using Bayesian ideas.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Christmas cake''' is a fruitcake traditionally served around [[Cookbook:Holiday Recipes#Christmas|Christmas]] in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], especially after long walks to be had with tea.

This is a traditional, somewhat extravagant recipe which is quite easy to make, but steeping the fruit should be done over a long time for best results. The resultant cakes should last in very good condition for several months if kept whole in air-tight tins.

==Ingredients==
''To make a round 10-inch diameter cake.''

; The fruit

* 600 g currants
* 400 g sultanas
* 400 g glacé cherries, quartered
* 200 g raisins
* 100 g cut candied peel

* 200 ml sherry
* 100 ml brandy
* 50 ml kirsch (or rum)

; The cake mixture

* 4 medium eggs
* 300 g lightly salted soft margarine (The &quot;Stork&quot; brand is traditional)
* 300 g dark brown sugar
* 100 g self-raising flour
* 200 g plain flour
* 100 g finely-chopped almonds
* 2 teaspoons of ground mixed spice
* 2 tablespoons of black treacle

==Method==

; The fruit

Place all the fruit in a large bowl and pour the spirits over the mixture. Cover the bowl in metal foil and leave in a cool place. Mix and stir the fruit every day for at least three days; after a fortnight most of the alcohol will have soaked in and further soaking has no benefit.

; The cake mixture

First beat together the sugar and margarine with the eggs. Add the almonds and black treacle and mix further. Sieve the flours and the mixed spice into the mixture, beating until a smooth mixture results. Then combine with the pre-prepared fruit (above) and place in a tin lined with baking parchment. 

; Cooking

Bake at a low temperature (140C, 275F, Gas mark 1) for at least four hours. It may take up to five hours, depending on the oven. Once a knife comes out clean, remove from the oven and allow to cool fully. Stored in an airtight box the cake should keep for at least four months. Traditionally, the cake is made on the first Sunday of Advent and (once cooled) is 'fed' with alcohol (brandy or rum) every few days until just before Christmas, when it is iced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[Past LSAT Explained]]
LSAT Form 8LSS38

==Section I Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===
Question type: Point at issue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)Freeman does not dispute the numerical figure but rather what it means.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Correct.  Powell says private companies operate more cheaply because they are qualitatively better, but Freeman says it is because they pick and choose their clients.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Tempting, but Powell never mentioned this reason, so they can't disagree about it.&lt;br&gt;
(D)Out of the blue and beyond the scope.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Again tempting, but not the core issue of disagreement between the two.  Powell would say that private companies serve customers of all needs more cheaply because they are better, but Freeman would say they simply avoid high-cost customers.

===Question 02===

Question type: Flaw&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The conclusion that 80% of people don't know enough is based on the fact that 80% of people don't understand DNA properly. Thus, the argument is: Knowing about DNA means you know enough to make good decisions.&lt;br&gt;
(A)This actual helps the argument- it's not a flaw.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Nothing said about collective decisions in the question.&lt;br&gt;
(C)No causal relationship between these two in the question&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)'''Correct.  This is the flaw noted above.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Confusing because the numbers look promising, but it's adding and subtracting stats from different places.

===Question 03===
Question Type: Inference&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yasukawa concludes that size is a determinant of survival.  However, the speaker disagrees, pointing out that size differences are likely caused by age.&lt;br&gt;
(A)This is the opposite of what we need.&lt;br&gt;
(B)This contradicts the prompt.&lt;br&gt;
(C)This is backwards; it reverses the size--&gt;survival relationship incorrectly.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)'''Correct.  The speaker points out that the &quot;size&quot; determinant for survival is probably actually age based, so in group the same age, size is no longer relevant.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Random much?

===Question 04===
Question Type: Weaken (I think)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)'''Correct.  The issue here is size and age, not age among different species.  This choice would be a misunderstanding. Remember that weaken questions often have information that seems outside they scope.  For weaken questions, start with assuming truth in the answer choices and seeing how it affects the validity of the question.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Irrelevant.  Does not address size or age.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;
(D)That would weaken his claim effectively, so it is NOT a misunderstanding.&lt;br&gt;
(E)That would weaken his claim effectively, so it is NOT a misunderstanding.&lt;br&gt;

===Question 05===
Question Type: Strengthen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)Unrelated to both Japan and the 1980's&lt;br&gt;
(B)That might explain how people could afford the paintings, but nothing says that them having the money means they would use it to buy this specific kind of art.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)'''Correct.  Provides support for the assertion that there's a &quot;specific preference...for certain aesthetic attributes&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
(D)It think it's trying to say that they became cheaper in the 1980's, but this does not explain their popularity in Japan.&lt;br&gt;
(E)This does support the argument's conclusion, which is that Japanese collectors prefer these specific paintings.

===Question 06===
Question Type: Structure&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anna analogizes cloudberries and cacao and demonstrates that increasing demand might actually take income out of the hands of gatherers and give it to farmers, thus invalidating Frankie's point.&lt;br&gt;
(A)She never says that this would benefit everyone-quite the opposite, actually.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Frankie doesn't present any evidence for her to reinterpret.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)'''Correct.  She compares the current cloudberry situation with the past cacao situation.&lt;br&gt;
(D)Nope, the argument stays very specific.&lt;br&gt;
(E)She's not comparing cloudberries and cacao as products, just their economic aspects.

===Question 07===
Question Type: Resolve&lt;br&gt;
Important thing to note:it is &quot;most widely read magazines&quot; that are in danger of failing, not magazines in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)That would explain the decrease in revenue but not the financially successful ones.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Off topic&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)'''Correct.  This explains why decreased ad revenue hurts only the most widely read mags and also explains how smaller mags are staying afloat.&lt;br&gt;
(D)This does not explain they there are many financially successful mags.
(E)Explains the number of successful magazines but not does not resolve the discrepancy.

===Question 08===
Question Type: Weaken&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)If owls do not eat red squirrels, the poison doesn't affect them.  This HELPS the argument.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Rodents that will eat the poison will be eaten by owls, so the owls might be harmed too.  This is counterproductive and highlights a weakness in the argument.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Irrelevant.  We only care about the owls.&lt;br&gt;
(D)It still kills the trees and harms the owls. Supports the argument.&lt;br&gt;
(E)This might save other small animals that could eat the poison, but we only care about saving OWLS.

===Question 09===
Question Type: Inference/Resolve&lt;br&gt;
The manager says that the total number of meals increased, but the accountant says individually each restaurant sold fewer.  By simple math, there have to be some new restaurants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)'''Correct.  Just what we were looking for.&lt;br&gt;
(B)This does not explain how they sold more meals.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Since we're only talking about two internal sales figures, competition is irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;
(D)That doesn't help- cheaper would explain the manager, pricier would explain the accountant, but price alone doesn't tell us how both could be right.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Same as B.

===Question 10===
Question Type: Weaken&lt;br&gt;
The accountant's argument: The reason sales are down at all older restaurants is that desirability has decreased.  We need another reason to answer WHY sales are down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)New meals might have been either more or less desirable. This doesn't directly affect the argument.&lt;br&gt;
(B)This says sales might be low, but it does not address WHY, which is what we need to weaken the argument.&lt;br&gt;
(C)These must be new restaurants since we know all older ones did NOT increase sales.  Thus, they are irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;
(D)Since we're speaking of overall sales, the number of a certain type of meals is irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)'''Correct.  This weakens the argument by supplanting the information that the accountant uses as a premise.  Maybe desirability is the same (or better), but people don't have the money to spend on eating out.

===Question 11===
Question Type:Parallel the Reasoning&lt;br&gt;
First diagram the stimulus argument:  X(pesticides) can cause Y(sterility).  Now, Y has happened, so X is definitely causes Y. Now compare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)Way too many elements- horses' tetanus frequency vs. other animals.  Not parallel.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Correct.  X(low calcium) can cause Y(fewer eggs).  Now, Y has happened, so X must be the cause.  Perfect!  You can stop here, but in the support of thoroughness:&lt;br&gt;
(C) If you are X(undernourished) you are likely to have Y(infection).  Certain animals are NOT X, so they must not be Y.  Nope.&lt;br&gt;
(D) X(apes) are defined as having Y(thumbs) and Z(no tail).  This fossil has Y, so it must be an example of X.  Not parallel AND bad logic.&lt;br&gt;
(E)X(track) is only caused by Y(bears).  Since Y does not exist,  X is not really X. Not parallel.

===Question 12===
Question Type: Support&lt;br&gt;
High temps make fibers go to their original states.  Cotton fibers are naturally curly.  Cotton clothes shrink when washed in hot water because their fibers curl up.  Polyester clothes don't.  So, you can figure out their fibers don't go curly, so their natural state must be straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)We don't know anything about fiber behavior at low temps.  Nope.&lt;br&gt;
(B)That doesn't make any sense, since the natural fibers will curl up whether they are part of the garment or all of it.&lt;br&gt;
(C)This makes sense, since they're curly naturally, but it doesn't address most of the stimulus.&lt;br&gt;
(D)This may be true, but we have no proof of that.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)'''Correct.  Exactly what we were looking for.

===Question 13===
Question Type: Assumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)We don't know that developed countries make the money by charging fines.&lt;br&gt;
(B)We are discussing internal pollution problems, so other countries are irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)'''Correct.  The stimulus says that industrial development improves pollution issues once it gets past the early stage, so we have to assume that the $5000 per capita is coming from industry if we want to use that as our solution.  If we don't make this assumption, we could say that Country X is a leading gatherer of, say, cloudberries, and although their GDP might increase, it won't be due to industry and thus will not have a positive effect on pollution.&lt;br&gt;
(D)There is another assumption that X has already begun development, so this doesn't work.&lt;br&gt;
(E)It really doesn't matter what other countries are doing...we only have eyes for X.

===Question 14===
Question Type: Structure&lt;br&gt;
The critic's argument: Although popular theories don't explain the psyche, they have more success therapeutically than more scientific ones.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)There is no evidence give to disprove.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Correct.&lt;br&gt;
(C)The prompt states that popular theories don't explain things, so this isn't it.&lt;br&gt;
(D)The critic never says what he things is most important.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Tempting, but no.  They are powerful, but they do NOT have explanatory power, only therapeutic power.

===Question 15===
Question type: Structure&lt;br&gt;
Argument in a nutshell: Tony says that fewer anarchists are violent than other people, so anarchism and violence don't necessarily go together.  Keisha says that the percentage of violent anarchists might be high because there are fewer of them than other folk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)'''Correct, number vs. proportions is the issue here.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Neither Keisha nor Tony ever offers any factual evidence.  Nope. &lt;br&gt;
(C)She does not argue that there are numerically few violent anarchists, so nope.&lt;br&gt;
(D)She does not compare the groups qualitatively.&lt;br&gt;
(E)She does not question what qualifies as an &quot;anarchist&quot;.

===Question 16===
Question Type: Strengthen&lt;br&gt;
Argument: Recent research contradicts the classical theory by showing that sound change is gradual.  Because the classical theory is wrong, we should toss out all sound-change theory.  The key here is &quot;sound theory in general&quot; as opposed to &quot;classical theory.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)That would support throwing out classical theory, but not ALL theory as the speaker argues.&lt;br&gt;
(B)It doesn't matter if they're random; we're looking at gradual vs. sudden.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Interesting, but &quot;unpredictable ways&quot; does not tell us anything about the focus of the argument (gradual vs. sudden).&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)'''Correct.  This explains why we would need to throw out ALL sound change theory (because it's based on faulty info) instead of just the classical theory.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Irrelevant.  We apparently DO have some info on sound change, enough to spawn a bunch of theories.

===Question 17===
Question Type: Structure&lt;br&gt;
Argument: Laws to make a group happy can only be made if that group has stable goals, and since it is obvious that stable societies have laws that increase people's happiness, therefore stable society depends on its citizens having stable goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)The conclusion is &quot;stable societies depend on citzens' stable goals.&quot; Nope.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Correct.  It is one of the premises.&lt;br&gt;
(C)It supports the argument, so it doesn't need to be refuted.&lt;br&gt;
(D)It is a premise, not a consequence.&lt;br&gt;
(E)There is no underlying principle stated, so no go.

===Question 18===
Question Type: Strengthen&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion: Motion sickness is caused when the inner ear and the eye send conflicting signals to the brain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)'''Correct. In a windowless cabin, the room would look steady, but the ear would sense motion, so motion sickness is likely.  This is an example to support the conclusion.&lt;br&gt;
(B)How often you get motion sickness doesn't explain the cause.&lt;br&gt;
(C)This weakens the conclusion, so no.&lt;br&gt;
(D)This also weakens the conclusion.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Some people being less susceptible does not address the cause of motion sickness.

===Question 19===
Question Type: Inference&lt;br&gt;
Facts: Allergens use histamine to cause symptoms, and antihistamines stop symptoms by blocking histamine and also do other things.  Histamine has nothing to do with colds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)No causal relationship between pollen and colds is mentioned either way.&lt;br&gt;
(B)No evidence for relative seriousness.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Too strong.  Antihistamines could be GREAT for colds, they just don't do it by blocking histamine.&lt;br&gt;
(D)Although antihistamines can cause drowsiness, we don't know that they ''effectively'' treat sleeplessness.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)'''Correct.  Since colds and histamine are unrelated, any good the meds do is unrelated to histamine blocking.

===Question 20===
Question Type: Most supported&lt;br&gt;
Summary: Poem- art using musical aspects of language.  Novels- sometimes art, usually not musical. Symphony- may be art, rarely uses language. Limerick- [poem] may use musical aspects, isn't art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)Nowhere does the speaker claim this is an exhaustive list.  Painting? Sculpture? Concerto? Nope.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Blank verse could use a different musical aspect (such as meter) and still be a poem.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)'''Correct. Since a poem is ANY piece of art that uses musical aspect, yes.  The description of novels says they do not ''usually'' involve musical aspects, not that they can't, so this is not a contradiction.&lt;br&gt;
(D)This is a contradiction since the question defines poems AS works of art.  No such thing as nonartistic poetry, at least not in this question.&lt;br&gt;
(E)The whole definition of symphony is qualified by &quot;may,&quot; so we can't draw any conclusions there.

===Question 21===
Question Type: Assumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)If they hadn't upped the amount, the competition to get the comm equipment in would be even more intense.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Correct. It would only help ease repression if it's used by people who are not the government, so this is an important assumption&lt;br&gt;
(C)Whether or not the legislators like the argument has nothing to do with the logic of the people making it.&lt;br&gt;
(D)They don't say theirs is the most effective, only that it would limit repression.  Maybe there's something else even more effective than communications (weapons?), but it does not affect the validity of the statement that comm equipment would help.&lt;br&gt;
(E)This would strengthen the argument, but it is not an underlying assumption.

===Question 22===
Question type: Inference&lt;br&gt;
Facts: Some people say that being hierarchical completely defines an organization.  Bureaucratic orgs are all hierarchical.  The PWD is bureaucratic [and thus hierarchical], but it is different than most other bureaucratic [and thus hierarchical] orgs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)We don't know what the PWD ''does'' operate like, only that it's different from most.&lt;br&gt;
(B)Faulty backwards logic.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Again, backwards logic.  Maybe we can conclude, maybe not.  It's unclear&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)'''Correct.  Since the PWD is hierarchical and bureaucratic and not like other hierarchical and bureaucratic orgs, some hierarchical ones (ie the PWD) ''must'' be different.&lt;br&gt;
(E)We already know that bureaucratic orgs are hierarchical, so this is clearly false.

===Question 23===
Question Type: Flaw&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)The stat is 90% of insomniacs drink coffee, not the other way around. We don't have any percentages on people who drink coffee.&lt;br&gt;
(B)We don't even need other causes, since not even a single valid cause is presented.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)'''Correct.  We don't know about coffee causing insomnia at all.  Maybe insomniacs drink coffee ''because'' they're tired.&lt;br&gt;
(D)Tom is not part of the class of individuals in the statistic, so this is a moot point.&lt;br&gt;
(E)The &quot;always&quot; is too strong, especially since we're we have a number that does not equal 100.

===Question 24===
Question Type: Strengthen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)Accuracy would seem to support the point about people being confused, but that's misleading.  The confusion in question is due to volume of information, not questionable validity.  Modern readers and writers could be overwhelmed by  large volume of accurate information, which would not cause mental self-reliance.&lt;br&gt;
(B)The folklorist does not say that modern communication is inefficient.&lt;br&gt;
(C)This topic is off topic.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)'''Correct. This is basically a more convincing paraphrase of the last sentence.&lt;br&gt;
(E)The folklorist implies that oral tradition values the useful and relevant; useful and relevant things could be unclear.

===Question 25===
Question type: Flaw&lt;br&gt;
Argument: We should not ask about hobbies because enthusiasm shown for hobbies might indicated lack of dedication to work, even though some people say enthusiasm might carry over to the job. Also, this is an except question, so the wrong answers are ALL flaws, ie reasons we SHOULD ask about hobbies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)Since long-term commitments is good for jobs, asking about hobbies is in order.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)'''Correct. Since a hobby probably gives applicants a boost, fake hobbies make candidates seem deceptively better than they are.  We should avoid the issue and not ask. This strengthens the argument and is thus NOT a flaw.&lt;br&gt;
(C)Honest responses are good, so we should ask about hobbies.&lt;br&gt;
(D)Organizational skills are good, so we should ask about hobbies.&lt;br&gt;
(E)Better choices are good, so...you get the point.

===Question 26===
Question type: Parallel
Diagram the argument: ''Most''dreams don't come true, so a ''few'' positive ones don't mean you're psychic.  The majority of dreams support NOT being psychic, even if a few examples provide evidence you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(A)The question looks at a body of incidences (all the dreams of a person) and shows that the negative events are in the majority.  There is no body of evidence (&quot;more subjects needed&quot;) for this answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
(B)This says ''many'' not ''most''.  Pay attention to qualifiers!&lt;br&gt;
(C)Again, many.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)'''Correct.  ''Most''people don't die of aspirin, so even a ''few'' deaths don't mean aspiring is deadly.  &lt;br&gt;
(E)''Significant number'' is not ''most.''

===Question 01===
IDENTIFY This is a Principle question. 

READ A politician introduces a government tax policy.  He is proposing a [[w:en:sin tax|sin tax]]. 

ANALYZE The passage is short enough to apply to each choice directly.
(A) Incorrect.  We know sugar is bad for your health but the tax regime proposed here is to raise revenue to pay for the health costs arising from consuming sugar.  In fact, people and the government may benefit from increased consumption of sugar products if the negative impact of sugar is offset by the better health care paid by the tax.

(B) Incorrect. The study shows that the tax would not have an effect on the consumption of the pain reliever.  The principle requires the tax discouraging the consumption of an undesirable product.  

(C) Correct. The tax on the pesticide achieves what it is intended- to discourage the continued use.

(D) Incorrect. This is an opposite of the tax regime proposed by the politician.  Tax is not raised to prevent decreased consumption.

(E) Incorrect.  Enticing but here tax is actually lowered.  

CHOOSE
(C) conforms perfectly with the politician's principle.

This section has 28 questions.
===Passage 1 Art/Humanity===
* [[w:en:Phillis_Wheatley|Phillis Weatley]]
* [[w:en:African American literature|African American literature]]
* [[w:en:English poetry|English poetry]]
* [[w:en:African American Vernacular English|Black English]]
* [[w:en:1761|1761]]

* [[w:en:oral tradition|oral tradition]]
====Question 01====
This is a [[Past LSAT Explained/Main Idea(RC)|Main Idea]] and [[Past LSAT Explained/Global(RC)|Global]] question.

(A) Incorrect. This is certainly feasible since Philis Wheatley employed few principles of African oral tradition in her work.  However, this is not what the passage is trying to say. 

(B) Incorrect. This choice fails to mention Wheatley's lack of contribution to the distinct African American literary language.

'''(C) Correct.''' Excellent. This choice expresses Wheatley's accomplishment and shortcoming.

(D) Incorrect. This is not the main idea and not true based on the passage. Line 54 states that her poetry contributed little.  She may have started the Black American poetry but she did not play a role in the development of the distinct voice.  For the most part, her poetry was overwhelmingly conventional.

(E) Incorrect. Her poetry did not contribute to preserving the principles of African oral tradtion since her work reflected little of her experience and heritage.

When you are unsure of the passage's main idea, it may be helpful to answer other local questions first to gain a better understanding of the main point.

====Question 02====
This is an analogy and [[Past LSAT Explained/Local(RC)|Local]] question.

This question asks you to find a parallel situation.  This question is not too difficult because it uses only one example- Italian immigrant in America, instead of using five different examples to confuse the testtakers and to make it hard to contrast among the choices.  If you have a good grasp of Wheatley's approach that she conformed to the conventions without incorporating her nonconventional heritage and experiences.

(A) Incorrect. No translation of the African American traditions.

(B) Incorrect. She was strictly English.

(C) Incorrect. She contributed little as mentioned in Line 54.

(D) Incorrect. She did not do this. If this choice to become true, it should read, &quot;defined artistic expression in terms of eighteenth-century American poetic conventions&quot;

'''(E) Correct.'''

====Question 03====
This is a very [[Past LSAT Explained/Local(RC)|Local]] question.

To answer this question, look at Line 23 where it says &quot;but also exerted demonstrable effects on the manner in which other Americans spoke English.&quot;

(A) Incorrect.

(B) Incorrect.

(C) Incorrect.

'''(D) Correct.'''

(E) Incorrect.

Sugar's medicinal use in treating inflection.

'''ANALYZE'''

Let's find a choice that links sugar with antibiotic property.
Structure is THESIS + ANTITHESIS

'''CHOOSE'''

'''(A) Correct.''' Sugar basically dehydrates bacteria and bacteria need water.

(B) Incorrect. Just throwing some side facts to confuse you.  Who cares if sugar is not available.  We are concerned with sugar's property not its feasiblity as a medical treatment

(C) Incorrect. This strongly weakens the passage. Sugar promotes baterial growth!  This does not explain the passage at all.  This choice might have been correct if this choice was a [[Past LSAT Explained/Weaken(LR)|Weaken]] question.

(D) Incorrect. This choice introduces some complex relationship into the passage. But remember the passage does not mention using the antibiotic and sugar together. Moreover, it does not say that the physicians used some food that contain sugar.  This fact is certainly a concern if the antibiotic is used with the sugar treatment and requires more research.  But this does not explain the phenomenon at all.

(E) Incorrect. The fact that sugar can be used as a crude antibiotic is mentioned in 2007 film [[w:en:Shooter (2007 film)|Shooter]]. Supposedly this practice was common during the Napoleonic Wars. So what?  It only shows the knowledge of sugar's medicinal effect is ancient.  It does not explain why.

Some color blindness discussion.  This could well be a [[w:en:Flaw(LR)|Flaw]] question because there is a flaw  in the reason. This question can be tricky since the answer should contain the same logical error.  By not phrasing this question as &quot;which of the following the similar error in reasoning&quot;, the question does not give you a clue that there is an error.  

'''ANALYZE'''

The flaw is that the red/green color blind people are not the only ones who cannot distinguish between green and brown. There may be some people who are not red/green color-blind and Gerald could be a member of that group.  The logic does not preclude that loophole.

The structure of the argument is: Major Premise, Minor Premise, Conclusion

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect.  This is a sound logic. The structure is same- Major Premise, Minor Premise, Conclusion.  This does not have the flaw discussed earlier. 

(B) Correct. This choice commits the same kind of flaw. People with sinusitis may not be the only one who lose their sense of smell.  Pretend that people who ace the LSAT lose the sense of smell but do not suffer from sinusitus.  Mary may well be a member of this group.  This is a common type of flaw tested in the LSAT over and over. If X→Y. Z→Y. So Z→X. (invalid)

(C) Incorrect. This is a good logic without the flaw. If X→ NOT Y.(Contrapositive: Y→NOT X) Z→Y. So Z→NOT X.

(D) Incorrect. If X→NOT Y. Z→X. So Z→NOT Y.

(E) Incorrect. This choice is a bit strange. This choice has a hidden assumption that there is some special diet consists of small amount of sugar. The conclusion that Freda is on a special diet is not a proper one- a better one would be &quot;Freda cannot have a large amounts of sugar.&quot;

This question is difficult for Number 2 requiring a good knowledge of formal logic and contrapositive. Writing each choice into algebraic logic notation is helpful but not necessary.

'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a [[Past LSAT Explained/Parallel Reasoning(LR)|Parallel Reasoning]] question with some element of a [[Past LSAT Explained/Flaw(LR)|Flaw]] question.

'''READ'''

The author is arguing using an analogy.

'''ANALYZE'''

The analogy employed in the question is that seeing something else being done causes the viewer to be affected in a certain, favorable way.  By doing so, the author is using a supposedly analogous case- someone eating.  This question could very well be a [[Last LSAT Explained/Weaken(LR)|Weaken]] or [[Last LSAT Explained/Strengthen(LR)|Strengthen]] question. The author takes entirely different situations to arrive at his conclusion.  Witnessing violence and watching someone else eat are entirely different situations, as one might argue thus analogy may not work. Your task is to find a choice with a similar structure, preferrably with the flaw.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. A good candidate for the answer- shoplifting and taking supplies at work for own personal use are a bit different. But they are similar enough to not warrant an automatic answer status.  Let's go through all the questions.

(B) Incorrect. No analogy here.  The structure is obviously different.

(C) Incorrect. Wrong.  For this question to be correct, the choice should look like this:

Some people think that boxing and westling matches managed by the same sort of people will be fixed. Are baseball and basketball fixed as they are managed by the exactly same group of people?  

'''(D) Correct.''' Good.  Economists and meteorologists are entirely different. You can cross out Choice A.

(E) Incorrect. For this choice to be correct, it should look like this:

Some people think workholics are compensating for a lack of interpersonal skills. But are the presidents and TV show hosts, who are known to be workholics compensating for their poor interpersonal skills?

== Section I Logical Reasoning ==

There are 25 questions in this section.

# '''Question 1:''' Note the argument is that the increase in demand for printed books showed there was also a corresponding increase in literacy.
#* A is incorrect because it refers only to writing and not to reading. 
#* B is incorrect because, if true, does nothing to explain the difference in those who could read before the use of the printing press versus after. This answer merely states that those who can read can also write.
#* '''C is correct''' because connects the behavior of a group of people from before the use of the printed press to after. It explains that the decreased cost allowed the same number of people to purchase more books. If true, this casts doubt on the original argument that the increased demand demonstrated an increase in the number of purchasers.
#* D is incorrect because, if true, it would not indicate a increased demand in printed books. By sharing/reusing the same book multiple times the demand would actually decrease. Also, it does not mention whether this sharing behavior was equally common before the use of the printing press. This answer focuses strictly on the usage of books after the creation of the printing press.
#* E is incorrect because it does not indicate whether or not the manuscripts were typically heavily illustrated in a way that would be useful to illiterate people. This answer also focuses strictly on the usage of books after the creation of the printing press.
# '''Question 2:''' This question explains how an artificial sweetener was determined to be safe for people by showing that only a vary large quantity would be dangerous.
#* A is incorrect because how quickly the cancer develops does not answer the question.
#* B is incorrect because how dangerous other additives also does not relate to the artificial sweetener being discussed.
#* '''C is correct''' because if people consume far less than the dangerous amount of the sweetener, then the sweetener can be determined safe for common use. Once people begin consuming close to the dangerous amount of the sweetener, then the argument that it is safe is no longer valid.
#* D is incorrect because, even if true, does not answer the question.
#* E is incorrect because it directly refers to studies not relevant the question.
# '''Question 3:''' The question asks about Judith's response to Harry's assertion.
#* A is incorrect because if the majority of the people are rich, then most would be able to afford air travel. This would contradict Judith's response indicating that she believes the opposite to be true.
#* B is incorrect because it discusses whether or not people have the right to air travel, while Judith's response is focused on their financial ability.
#* C is incorrect because it focuses on what areas of the world are accessible by airplane, while Judith's response is focused on on people's financial ability to fly.
#* D is incorrect because extends the scope to other forms of travel and is no longer exclusive to airplanes.
#* '''E is correct'''. When Harry says (in summary) &quot;Anyone can fly&quot;, Judith responds with (again in summary) &quot;Flights are too expensive&quot;. This shows that she interpreted Harry's statement to mean that anyone is financially capable of flight, which is addressed in this answer choice.
# '''Question 4:''' The question asks how an ad is misleading by stating that a pill contains &quot;44% fiber&quot;.
#* A is incorrect because it refers to other products on the market, not the pill in the question.
#* B is incorrect because it focuses on the uses of fiber, rather than whether or not the ad is misleading.
#* C is incorrect because it also refers to other products on the market and not the pill in the question. Also, whether or not the product is addictive would not have any bearing about how the ad was misleading about the product's fiber content.
#* D is incorrect because it shifts the focus to the label on the product, rather than the product's advertisement.
#* '''E is correct'''. This answer states that the recommended daily fiber intake is 20 - 30 grams, so about half of that would be 10-15 grams of fiber. This is much greater than one-third gram, which indicates that although it is possible that 44% of the pill itself is fiber it does not contain 44% of the recommended daily intake of fiber.
# '''Question 5:''' Environmentalists urge consumers to choose products that are not directly nor indirectly harmful to the environment, but the question indicates that it is usually impossible for consumers to determine how harmful each product is. The question asks why there can be no moral duty for consumers to choose products the way that the environmentalists advocate.
#* A is incorrect because it does not address the impossibility of the action in the question.
#* '''B is correct''' because in the second sentence of the question's setup the author indicates that a person cannot be held morally accountable for taking an action they do not know how to avoid.
#* C is incorrect because it focuses on how the products should be produced, not how they should be consumed.
#* D is incorrect because it does not address the impossibility that the setup addresses in the second sentence.
#* E is incorrect because it addresses other types of duties besides the moral duty described in the setup, which is beyond the scope of the question.
# '''Question 6:''' An advertisement establishes that physical exercise improves the condition of a body's lungs, heart, and muscles. It then makes the link that since physical exercise is good for the body, that mental exercise must be good for the brain.
#* A is incorrect because the ad does not cite experimental evidence, rather it cites anecdotal/personal evidence.
#* B is incorrect because the ad does not ridicule anyone.
#* C is incorrect because although the ad makes an analogy between physical and mental exercise, it does not explain why (or if) this analogy is accurate.
#* D is incorrect because the ad does not analyze the concept of exercise.
#* '''E is correct''' because it expounds on the analogy that if physical exercise is good for other organs, then mental exercise is good for the brain.
# '''Question 7:''' First of two questions with this setup. The setup discusses &quot;the problem of reducing health-care costs&quot;. This question asks how the argument proceeds.
#* A is incorrect because although shifting costs is mentioned in the second sentence, the paragraph does not mention what the &quot;premise&quot; of health-care reimbursement would be.
#* B is incorrect because the setup never mentions any fraudulent behavior.
#* '''C is correct''' because after spending the first few sentences explaining how shifting costs prevents the government from truly reducing health-care costs, the example shows an instance where this is true. The analogy is where the author states that &quot;...push in on one part of this ... balloon and an ... bulge pops up elsewhere.&quot;
#* D is incorrect because no alternatives are mentioned. Although the last sentence does provide an example, this example is not an alternative system but rather clarifies the central point of the paragraph.
#* E is incorrect because the example given does not demonstrate cooperation.
# '''Question 8:''' Second of two questions with this setup. Question asks which of the answer choices is supported by the argument made in the setup.
#* '''A is correct''' because it addresses the issue of shifting costs. By mentioning a comprehensive approach, this answer choice directly addresses the problem of the &quot;piecemeal&quot; system described in the original argument.
#* B is incorrect because the setup does not discuss either the resources available for funding nor the cost of health-care professionals.
#* C is incorrect because the funding for the health-care system is not addressed, so there is no way to determine if the costs are expanding to match this change. This answer also contradicts the argument's assertion that shifting costs is the crux of the problem (as opposed to additional funds).
#* D is incorrect because the argument does not mention medical technology nor its associated costs.
#* E is incorrect because the cost of unused hospital beds is not discussed in the original argument.
# '''Question 9:''' The question discusses how the public interprets an event based on its exposure in the commercial news and asks which answer choice is supported by the argument.
#* A is incorrect because it states an alternative form of the media as it is &quot;better&quot; and does not address how the public interprets the commercial news.
#* B is incorrect because it implies that the consumer's desires drive what the media chooses to cover, rather than addressing the question about how what the media chooses to cover affects the consumer. 
#* C is incorrect because it is a statement about how people feel about events they cannot control, in general, rather than how people feel about events in the news. The original argument does not address this issue.
#* '''D is correct''' because is addresses the statement made in the last sentence of the argument. Regardless of the actual risk, consumers will typically infer that more extensively covered event is the most risky - regardless of whether or not this is true.
#* E is incorrect because, rather than answering the question, it offers an inference based on the information in the argument. Even if true this statement does mention how consumers would respond to extensive coverage of cholera instead of another rarer and less serious illness.
# '''Question 10:''' 
#* A is incorrect because even though it is true that the paragraph does not show that the decrease is proportionate, it also does not claim this to be the case.
#* '''B is correct'''. The paragraph studies a group of children, with and without behavioral problems, and then changes the diet of all the children. Without a control group to see if there were any other potential causes for the decrease in behavior problems, the conclusion cannot be drawn that the change in diet is the cause.
#* C is incorrect because, even if true or partially true, the paragraph is discussing the percentage of the children rather than the exact number of children.
#* D is incorrect because the paragraph is discussing children who ''were'' affected by the dietary change, not children who weren't.
#* E is incorrect because it mentions the frequency of behavioral problems, but the paragraph only has two groups: children with or without behavioral problems. The paragraph never discusses the frequency of behavioral problems in the children of the latter group.
# '''Question 11:''' The paragraph describes that 10% of vehicles from the 1970s and 5% of vehicles from the 1960s received engine repairs in 1990, and asks which of the answer choices explains the discrepancy.
#* A is incorrect because it states that all cars must be inspected before prior to registration. In older, and thus more heavily used cars, there would most likely be more problems found. Since the cars from the 1960s are older than the cars from the 1970s, this does not address why fewer cars from the 1960s received repairs.
#* B is incorrect because it states that newer cars are driven more carefully than older cars. This implies that the newer cars would be in better condition and would thus need fewer repairs than older cars. This cannot explain why the newer, 1970s, cars received more repairs than the older, 1960s, cars.
#* '''C is correct''' because it addresses the discrepancy and offers a solution why the older cars, rather than the newer cars, received fewer repairs.
#* D is incorrect because the design of the engine is not discussed in the paragraph. Further, if it is assumed that a simpler engine lead to fewer repairs, it would further obscure why the 1970s cars received more repairs.
#* E is incorrect because it tries to explain how repairs on the 1960s cars could have been avoided, but does not address the discrepancy.
# '''Question 12:''' Shows how the perception of complex computer proofs/computations changed between 1976 and &quot;today&quot;. The question asks which of the answer choices ''must'' be true, assuming all the statements in the paragraph are true.
#* '''A is correct''' based on the first sentence of the paragraph: &quot;No mathematician today would flatly refuse to accept the results of an enormous computation...&quot;. This implies that even if they believe that a simple theorem should have a simple proof, that they would also accept the result of an enormous computation as proof.
#* B is incorrect because, although it may or may not be true, goes beyond the scope of the paragraph and question. The paragraph does not discuss non-mathematicians.
#* C is incorrect because it includes the term &quot;individuals&quot; rather than &quot;mathematicians&quot; specifically. Although there are individual mathematicians, there are also individuals who are not mathematicians so this choice exceeds the scope of this question.
#* D is incorrect because it also uses the group &quot;individuals&quot; and thus, like (C), also exceeds the scope of this question.
#* E is incorrect because it also goes out of the scope of the paragraph and question for the same reason as (B).
# '''Question 13:''' Can be best simplified using variables to represent different statements in the question. This reduces the question to: If X, then ~Y. Z unless X. Thus if Y, then Z.
#* A is incorrect because, following the same X, Y, Z pattern, the statement starts with &quot;If ~X, then ~Y&quot; as opposed to &quot;If X, then ~Y&quot;.
#* B is incorrect for the same reason as (A).
#* '''C is correct''' because it follows the same pattern as the original: &quot;If X, then ~Y. Z unless X. Thus if Y, then Z.&quot;
#* D is incorrect for the same reason as (A).
#* E is incorrect because it is of the form: &quot;If X, then ~Y. Z unless X. If Y, then ~Z.&quot; This is very close to the original pattern, but the last sentence falls short as it should be &quot;If Y, then Z&quot; as opposed to ~Z.
# '''Question 14:''' This paragraph is about lobsters eating one another if caught in a trap.
#* A is incorrect because lobsters not caught in traps are not in the scope of the paragraph/question.
#* B is incorrect because the duration of time not affect the counterclaim.
#* C is incorrect because, even if true, it does not affect the assertion in the paragraph. Whether or not it is unusual to have eight lobsters in a trap does not help or hinder the counterclaim to the biologist's argument.
#* D is incorrect because members of other species, i.e. not lobsters, are not in the scope of the paragraph/question.
#* '''E is correct''' because if the lobsters are not hungry lobsters, then they will not eat each other. Thus, in order for the objection to be valid the lobsters that were in a trap for two months needed to be hungry. If they were not hungry, either because they eat less frequently than every couple months or because there was an alternate food source available, this would not be a valid objection.
# '''Question 15:'''
#* '''A is correct''' because it directly addresses the hunting ban. This answer shows that in similar areas with no hunting ban the deer population has not increased so drastically.
#* B is incorrect because, although it does strengthen the argument in the paragraph, it does not address how the ban affected motor vehicle accidents.
#* C is incorrect because the paragraph does not focus on how overpopulation damages the deer population, but rather on how overpopulation risks the safety of the human population. 
#* D is incorrect because whether or not the humans give salt and etc. to the deer does not relate to how deer overpopulation is dangerous to humans. This answer also does not address whether this behavior started before, or after, the hunting ban.
#* E is incorrect because even if the deer do cause cosmetic damage to ornamental plants, there is no link established between how this is related to the hunting ban or human safety.
# '''Question 16:''' This paragraph is about how Halley's comet reflects less light than was initially assumed.
#* A is incorrect because the paragraph does not directly address the measured brightness of other comets.
#* '''B is correct''' because the paragraph directly states that the material &quot;reflects 60 times less light per unit of mass&quot;. If the material is less reflective, then that means previous estimates were too low.
#* C is incorrect because the amount of light reflected is known. How much light ''per unit mass'' was unknown. (You could also say that the &quot;how much light was reflected ''as a function of mass'' was unknown.)
#* D is incorrect because only Halley's comet is mentioned. Halley's comet could be an anomaly, or the statement could be true, or all comets could reflect less light per unit mass than was thought. The paragraph does not address this.
#* E is incorrect because how much additional information is ''needed'' is not addressed in the paragraph.
# '''Question 17:''' This is a statement by Office Manager about how he sees recycled paper as inferior, and a response by Stationary Supplier.  
#* A is incorrect because the response DOES argue that the office manager's prejudice against recycled paper stems from ignorance.  
#* '''B is correct''' because the claim that &quot;from the beginning, the finest paper has been made of recycled material,&quot; is justified by the next sentence, which is irrelevant because it mentions two materials without making a claim about the quality of either one.  
#* C is incorrect because the supplier response addresses quality, not environmental issues.  
#* D is incorrect because, although it is true that the response deals with paper manufacturing, the response is not invalid because it presupposes understanding of technology.  It's invalid because paper manufacturing technology is irrelevant to the concern that the Office Manager brought up about quality.  
#* E is incorrect because the response does not ignore the concern about quality, it addresses it improperly.  
# '''Question 18:'''
#* A is incorrect because
#* B is incorrect because
#* '''C is correct''' because
#* D is incorrect because
#* E is incorrect because
# '''Question 19:'''
#* A is incorrect because

#* A is incorrect because doesn't address anti theft devices, the subject of the paradox.  
#* B is incorrect because this statement supports one side of the paradox, but is contrary to the other side, and doesn't resolve anything.  
#* C is incorrect because it is irrelevant; we have no data to suggest that either set of data is counting false alarms from audible alarm systems.  
#* '''D is correct''' because it resolves the paradox - while anti theft devices reduce the risk of car theft, the people who buy them and put them in their cars are disproportionately more likely to be at high risk of car theft, so the cars themselves are less safe as a group.  
#* E is incorrect because it would imply that anti theft devices are a non-issue, which both sides of the paradox seem to contradict.

      <comment>/* Question 6 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Section I Analytical Reasoning==
=== Game One ===
Four boys (F, J, M, P) and three girls (N, R, T) will be assigned to a row of five lockers numbered 1-5. &lt;br&gt;
'''RULES'''&lt;BR&gt;
1. Each locker must be assigned to either one or two children.&lt;br&gt;
2. Each child must be assigned a locker. &lt;br&gt;
3. Each shared locker must assigned to one girl and one boy. &lt;br&gt;
4. J must share a locker. &lt;br&gt;
5. R cannot share a locker. &lt;br&gt;
6. N's locker cannot be adjacent to T's.&lt;br&gt;
7. F must be assigned to locker 3. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''WHAT WE CAN INFER'''
1. There are three lockers assigned to one child only (R and 2 boys, which could be F, M, or P)&lt;br&gt;
2. There are two lockers that are shared (J, N, and T).&lt;br&gt;
3. Because N and T must share lockers, shared lockers cannot be adjacent to each other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==== Question 1 ====
'''E''' is the correct answer choice. We found this out by looking at the inferences we made from the rules. If at least one child must be assigned to the locker, that would leave two people who would have to share a locker. We know that R must have her own locker and that J must share a locker (Rules 4 and 5). We also know that since shared lockers must be assigned to one girl and one boy, we know that J will share a locker with either N or T. That's one shared locker down, which leave N or T, one of who must share a locker with one of the following boys F, M, or P. We do not know which boy MUST share a locker out of that group. So that leaves J, N and T as the only children that MUST be assigned to a shared locker. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==== Question 2 ====
We must find what MUST be true when T is assigned to locker 3 and M is assigned to locker 1 alone. Let's draw a diagram.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. M &lt;br&gt;
2.&lt;br&gt;
3. F/T &lt;br&gt;
4.&lt;br&gt;
5.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Rule 6, N cannot be assigned to lockers 2 or 4. We also know from Rule 4 that J must share a locker and if he is sharing a locker then it has to be N because T is sharing a locker with F, who according Rule 7 must assigned to locker 3. That means that J and N must be assigned to locker 5. Answer choice '''(B)''' comes the close to stating that. &lt;br&gt;

==== Question 3 ====
We must find which answer choice which shows which lockers CANNOT be shared, if all of the boys are assigned to consecutively numbered lockers and J is assigned to locker 5. Let's look at what the diagram would look like: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. &lt;br&gt;
2. M or P &lt;br&gt;
3. F &lt;br&gt;
4. M or P &lt;br&gt;
5. J &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to the Rules and the Diagram, R would have to be assigned to locker 1. Since R doesn't share a locker, any answer choice that doesn't contain locker 1 is wrong. We've now narrowed the answer choices down to '''(C)''' and '''(D)'''. Now let's look at what other locker CANNOT be shared. Since Juan must share a locker with either N or T, and he is assigned to locker 5, that means that locker 4 CANNOT be shared because N and T cannot have adjacent lockers. This leaves only answer choice '''(D)''' as the correct answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==== Question 4 ====
At first glance this seems like a difficult question, but it's really not. The trick to Logic Games is to take a deep breath, read the question and know exactly what it says. This question ask you to find the maximum number of lockers J can be be assigned to after R has been assigned a locker. Take a look at the following diagram:&lt;br&gt;
1. R &lt;br&gt;
2. J (possibly)&lt;br&gt;
3. F &lt;br&gt;
4. J (possibly)&lt;br&gt;
5. J (possibly) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
According to the above diagram, if we only know where R and F (because of the rules), then we can try to find out all of the possible lockers J could be assigned to. If we were to say that R was assigned to locker 2, J would still have a maximum of three lockers to choose from. '''(C)''' is the correct answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==== Question 5 ====
This question is asking if the three girls were assigned to the first three lockers, then what MUST be true. Let's take a look at the possible diagram.&lt;br&gt;
1. J/N (or J/T) &lt;br&gt;
2. R &lt;br&gt;
3. F/T (or F/N)&lt;br&gt;
4. M or P &lt;br&gt;
5. M or P &lt;br&gt;
We know that R must be assigned to locker 2 in this scenario, because N and T cannot be assigned to lockers adjacent to each other. We also know that J has to be assigned to locker 1 because according to the rules he must share a locker and locker 3 is at capacity because of F, therefore, '''(A)''' is the correct answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''' is incorrect because the question is asking for what MUST be true not what COULD be true. Looking at the above diagram, it could be true that N is assigned to locker 3, but it doesn't HAVE to be true. &lt;br&gt;
For answer choice '''(C)''' see the above explanation.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''' is incorrect because it COULD be true that J and T share a locker, but it doesn't HAVE to be. J could easily share a locker with N and it would not break any of the rules. &lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' is just flat out wrong. We know that that the first three lockers belong to J, N, R, T, and F only based on the diagram. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==== Question 6 ====
This question asks if lockers 1 and 2 are assigned to one boy each and are not shared lockers, then who MUST be assigned to locker 4? &lt;br&gt;
1. M or P &lt;br&gt;
2. M or P &lt;br&gt;
3. F &lt;br&gt;
4. &lt;br&gt;
5. &lt;br&gt;
What do we know? We know that lockers 3, 4, or 5 must be shared, which means N and T must be assigned to two of the three lockers. Since N and T cannot be assigned to lockers that are adjacent to each other, someone must be between them and that leaves R because J must share a locker with either N or T. So R must belong to locker to 4. See the completed diagram below: &lt;br&gt;
1. M or P &lt;br&gt;
2. M or P &lt;br&gt;
3. F/N or F/T &lt;br&gt;
4. R &lt;br&gt;
5. J/T or J/N &lt;br&gt;
Answer choice '''(C)''' is the correct answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
=== Game Two ===
A store carries ten types of CDs, both new and used jazz, opera, pop, rap, and soul. The store is having a sale on SOME CDs.&lt;br&gt;
RULES&lt;BR&gt;
1. Used pop is on sale, new opera is not&lt;br&gt;
2. If both types of pop are on sale, then all soul is on sale&lt;br&gt;
3. If both types of jazz are on sale, no rap is on sale &lt;br&gt;
4. If neither type of jazz is on sale, then new pop is on sale &lt;br&gt;
5. If either type of rap is on sale, then no soul is on sale &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To make it clearer all of the used CDs will be lower case: j, o, p, r, s and the new CDs will be capitalized: J, O, P, R, S. Now let's make some inferences, shall we?&lt;br&gt;
Rule 2: P and p --&gt; S and s. The contrapositive of this statement would be ~S OR ~s --&gt; ~P (Remember that p is always on sale)&lt;br&gt;
Rule 3: J and j --&gt; ~R and ~r. The contrapositive of this statement would be R or r --&gt; ~J or ~J &lt;br&gt;
Rule 4: ~J and ~j --&gt; P. The contrapositive of this statement would be ~P --&gt; J or j &lt;br&gt;
Rule 5: R or r --&gt; ~S and ~s. The contrapositive of this statement would be S and s --&gt; ~R or ~r &lt;br&gt;
Inference: P and p --&gt; S and s --&gt; ~R or ~r&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 7====
This question asks what could be the complete and accurate list of CDs on sale. These type of questions, you don't necessarily have to make a diagram. You can look at the rules and eliminate any answer choice that breaks the rules. &lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''' is incorrect because it violates rule 3. If both types of jazz are sale then no rap can be on sale. As the answer choices, both types of jazz are on sale as well as new rap.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''' violates rule 5. &lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''' violates rule 4. &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''' violates rule 2. &lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' is the correct answer choice by process of elimination. However, if you really want to know why this is the correct answer choice... The contrapositive of rule 4 states that if new Pop is on sale then either new jazz or used jazz is on sale. This answer choice meets that criteria, while also being in compliance with the rules for this game.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 8====
This asks what must be true if S is not on sale. This is one of the few times that we do not need to draw a diagram because the information is already at hand in the conditional statement diagrams and their contrapositives. Looking at the contrapositive of rule 2. If either soul CD is not on sale, then no new pop is on sale. That HAS to be true because it's part of the rules. '''(E)''' is the correct answer choice. Let's take a look at why the other answer choices were wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 9====
Beware of this question. You have to pay attention. This question is if both types of jazz are on sale then what is the minimum number of NEW CDs that could be on sale. Let's start by assuming that all of the new CDs are sale, and then let's use the rules to eliminate any new CDs that CAN'T be on sale. There are a total of 5 new CDs. We know that New Opera is not on sale, according to rule 1, so that brings us down to four NEW CDs on sale. Looking at the contrapositive of rule 4, we can cross new Pop off the list, so that leaves down to three CDs on sale: new jazz, new rap, and new soul. Looking at the contrapositive of rule 2, if new soul is not on sale, then new pop is not on sale. We already crossed off new pop, and not we can cross off new soul, because by doing so means that we are still in compliance with the  rules. That leaves us with two new CDs on sale: jazz and rap. Let's see if we can cross off rap without violating any rules. Take a look at the contrapositive of rule 3. If we kept either type of rap on sale, then it would violate that rule, therefore, rap cannot be on sale. That leaves us down to only one new CD on sale and that would be jazz. Answer choice '''(A)'''. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 10====
This question asks what CANNOT be true. There are no restrictions, so we need to go through and eliminate all of the incorrect answer choices. &lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': There is no rule regarding used opera, so it is POSSIBLE that used opera could not be on sale. This by itself would make this answer choice wrong. However, we can look at the statement that neither type of rap is on sale. There is no rule that tells us what happens with neither type of rap is on sale.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': If neither type of jazz is on sale, then new Pop must be on sale according to rule 4. Since that would mean that both types of pop are sale (rule 1), then that means all soul is on sale. The first part of this answer choice doesn't violate any of the rules. Looking at the second part of the answer choice, there are no rules governing used opera, we only know that new opera is not on sale. It is very possible that used opera is not on sale as well. Remember we are looking for what CANNOT be true.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': Skipping the part about the opera, let's look at the second part of the answer choice that states neither type of soul is on sale. Remember that on the LSAT, either can mean at least on of the two, possible both. So according to the contrapositive of rule 2, if either type of soul is not on sale then new pop is not on sale. We can say that both new and used soul is not on sale, so that means that there is no new pop on sale. Taking a look at the contrapositive of rule 4, if there is no new pop on sale, then either new jazz or used jazz could be on sale. If both new and used jazz are on sale, then no  rap could be on sale. This scenario doesn't break the rules. &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': If neither type of jazz is on sale, then new pop is on sale and if both types of pop are on sale, then all soul is on sale, but this answer choice states that neither type of soul is on sale and that cannot be true. This is the correct answer choice.
'''(E)''': If neither type of jazz is on sale then new pop is on sale. If both new and used pop are sale then all soul is on sale. If all soul is on sale then neither type of rap could be on sale. This doesn't violate any of the rules. This is not the correct answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 11====
This question asks what CANNOT be true if neither type of jazz is on sale. If neither type of jazz is on sale then new pop is on sale. If both new and used pop is onsale then all soul is on sale. If all soul is on sale, then no rrap is on sale. That leaves only answer choice '''(A)''' as the only option that CANNOT be true.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 12====
This question asks what CANNOT be true if new soul is the ONLY new CD on sale. It is important to look at what the question stems states. Getting the details of the question stem wrong could mean that you get the incorrect answer! &lt;br&gt;
If new soul is the ONLY new CD on sale, then both types of rap cannot be on sale according to the contrapositive of rule 5, so that eliminates answer choice '''(C)'''. If both types of soul are not on sale, then new pop is not on sale, and if new pop is not on sale then either type of jazz is on sale. Since we know that new jazz is not on sale, used jazz HAS to be on sale. Answer choice '''(A)''' states that it is NOT on sale and that cannot be true. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 13====
This question ask what could be true if four out of the five used CDs were the ONLY CDs on sale. Remember to pay attention to the details. We know that used pop is one of the four CDs that would be on sale, so that leaves down to three used CDs.  Let’s start with finding which used CDs could not be on sale. We’ll start with used, because Rule 4 is negative. If both types of jazz are not on sale, then new pop is on sale. Well that violates what the question is stating, so used jazz MUST be on sale. That eliminates answer choices '''(A)''' and '''(D)'''. Looking quickly at answer choice '''(E)''' we can eliminate that right away because if both used rap and used soul are not on sale, then that violates the conditions set forth in the question. That leaves us down to answer choices '''(B)'''and '''(C)'''. Used opera is a free agent. So let’s skip that for a second.  
According to rule 5, if used soul is on file, then neither type of rap could be on sale. '''(C)''' is the correct answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Game Three===
Monday through Friday will only be a total five tours of three divisions, Operations, Production and Sales. &lt;br&gt;
RULES &lt;br&gt;
1. Each division is toured at least once &lt;br&gt;
2. Operations are not toured on Monday &lt;br&gt;
3. Production is not toured on Wednesday &lt;br&gt;
4. Sales if toured on two consecutive days and no other days. &lt;br&gt;
5. If operations is toured on Thursday, then Production is toured on Friday&lt;br&gt;
6. Contrapositive: If Production is NOT toured on Friday, then Operations is not toured on Thursday. &lt;br&gt;
For this particular game, it is best to draw a diagram in order to better visualize the different scenarios required by the questions.&lt;br&gt;
====Question 14====
'''(A)''': Is it possible for the division that is toured on Monday be toured on Tuesday? Well, yes. Sales must be toured on two consecutive days only. That’s the only restriction. So this scenario is entirely possible. &lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': Based on this answer choice, we know that O and S is not the division they are talking about because O cannot be toured on Mondays and S can only be toured on two consecutive days. So that leaves P. Because there are five tours we know that two divisions will be toured twice, one of those will be S, but the other could be either O or P. So it is possible that P could be toured on Monday and Friday. &lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': If the division toured on Tuesday is also toured on Thursday, that would mean S couldn’t be toured on two consecutive days. That would violate the rules and therefore this is the incorrect answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': This means that S has be toured on Monday and Tuesday. Since P cannot be toured on Wednesday, then it means that O is the division that is toured on Wednesday and Friday, which would leave P to be toured on Thursday. Does this break any rules? No. Why? Because according to the contrapositive of rule 5, if P is not toured on Friday then O is not toured on Thursday and this scenario fits that bill. &lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''': According to rule 5 it cannot be rule O that is toured on Thursday and Friday, which leaves P and S. Remember P can toured on Friday, without O being toured on Thursday. Remember your conditional reasoning! Let’s say that it is S that is toured on both days. That would mean P could be toured on either Monday or Tuesday or O could be toured on either Tuesday or Wednesday.  Both of those scenarios could be true. So this is the incorrect answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 15====
This question asks what could be true if Sales and one other division was toured on two consecutive days. You could diagram this easily, but for now, let’s just reason our way through it.&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': If O is toured on Thursday that means that P is toured on Friday. This answer choice states that P is toured on Monday. We concluded from the rules is that either O or P must be toured twice. For this answer choice, P is toured on Monday and Friday, S would be toured on Tuesday and Wednesday. But the question asks what could happen if besides S, that O or P were toured twice consecutively. This answer choice is proven to be wrong because P is not toured on consecutive days.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': This is the correct answer choice. Why? If P is toured on Tuesday and S on Wednesday that means that S is also toured on Thursday. Since O cannot be toured on Monday, due to the rules, it has to be toured on Friday, which means P has to be toured on Monday. So on Monday and Tuesday P is toured and Wednesday and Thursday S is toured and O is toured on Friday. &lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': If O is toured on Tuesday and P is toured on Friday, that means S has to be toured on Wednesday and Thursday. That leaves Monday open for a tour. It can be S because it only has the two consecutive tours and it can't be O because O is not toured on Monday, so that leaves P. The question is looking for the answer choice that shows that either O or P can be toured consecutively along with S, this is not the case. &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': If S is toured on Monday and O is toured on Friday, that means S is also toured on Tuesday. That leaves P to be toured on Thursday, which leaves O to be toured on Wednesday and Friday. Again this violates what the question is asking.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''': If S is toured on Wednesday and P is toured on Friday, that means that O cannot give any consecutive tours. It looks like P can do consecutive tours on Thursday and Friday. However, if that happens then O must be toured on Tuesday, which means S cannot be toured on consecutive days. That breaks one of the rules. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 16====
This question asks which day must P be toured, if there is a division that is toured on Tuesday and Friday. There are two possible scenarios. See Below for Scenario 1: ♥ = day toured; ♦ = day NOT toured&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!DAY !! O !! P !! S
|-
| MON || ♦ || ♦ || ♦
|-
| TUE || ♦ || ♥ || ♦
|-
| WED || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|-
| THU || ♦ || ♦|| ♥
|-
| FRI || ♦ || ♥ || ♦
|}
&lt;br&gt;
In scenario 1, O is not toured at all. If P is toured on Tuesday and Friday, then S must be toured on Wednesday and Thursday. That leaves Monday free and it has to be O. But wait, O can't be toured on Monday, according to the rules. This scenario is invalid. &lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! DAY !! O !! P !! S
|-
| MON || ♦ || ♥ || ♦
|-
| TUE || ♥ || ♦ || ♦
|-
| WED || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|-
| THU || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|-
| FRI || ♥ || ♦ || ♦
|}
&lt;br&gt;
In scenario 2, if O is toured on Tuesday and Friday, then on Wednesday and Thursday S must be toured. That leaves Monday open and P can be toured on Monday. There is no scenario 3, because S cannot be toured on days that are not consecutive. According to this scenario, P MUST be toured on Monday, which is answer choice '''(A)'''.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 17====
This asks what could be true if a division is toured on Monday and it is NOT toured on Tuesday. So let's draw another diagram: &lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! DAY !! O !! P !! S
|-
| MON || ♦ || ♥ || ♦
|-
| TUE || ♥ || ♦ || ♦
|-
| WED || X || ♦ || X
|-
| THU || X || X || X
|-
| FRI || X || X || X
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The above scenario is the only scenario that would work. O can't be toured on Monday, and if S is toured on Monday, then MUST be toured on Tuesday, which defies what the question is asking. We did not have to fill in the rest of the diagram because there would be so many different possibilities. Because P has to be toured on Monday, we can eliminate answer choices '''(A)''', '''(B)''', and '''(C)'''. Looking at answer choice '''(D)''', the question states that if a division is toured on Monday, then it CANNOT be toured on Tuesday, so we can eliminate this answer choice. Late leaves answer choice '''(E)''' as the correct answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 18====
This question asks what must be true if a division is toured on Tuesday and is also toured on Wednesday. So let's take a look at some diagrams, shall we?:&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! DAY !! O !! P !! S
|-
| MON || ♦ || ♥ || ♦
|-
| TUE || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|-
| WED || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|-
| THU || X || X || ♦
|-
| FRI || X || X || ♦
|}
&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! DAY !! O !! P !! S
|-
| MON || ♦ || ♥ || ♦
|-
| TUE || ♥ || ♦ || ♦
|-
| WED || ♥ || ♦ || ♦
|-
| THU || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|-
| FRI || ♦ || ♦ || ♥
|}
&lt;br&gt;
According to the only two scenarios, P is always toured on Monday. People couldn't be toured on Tuesday and Wednesday, because P cannot be toured on Wednesday. In both scenarios where both O and S are toured on Tuesday and Wednesday, P is toured on Monday that is answer choice '''(A)'''.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Game Four===
A crew of up to five members must complete five tasks in at most three days. The tasks have to be completed in the following order: framing, wallboarding, taping, sanding, and priming. &lt;br&gt;
1. G = taping &lt;br&gt;
2. H = sanding and priming &lt;br&gt;
3. I = framing and priming &lt;br&gt;
4. K = framing and sanding &lt;br&gt;
5. L = wallboarding and taping &lt;br&gt;
6. M = sanding &lt;br&gt;
7. O = wallboarding and priming &lt;br&gt;
RULES &lt;br&gt;
1. at least one task is completed a day &lt;br&gt;
2. taping and priming are completed on different days &lt;br&gt;
3. each member does at least one task &lt;br&gt;
4. each member does no more task a day &lt;br&gt;
5. each task is done by exactly one worker &lt;br&gt;
6. each task is completed the day it is started and before the next task begins. &lt;br&gt;
Let's simplify this a bit. taping = I and K; wallboarding = L and O; taping = G and L; sanding = H, K, and M; priming = H, I, and O.&lt;br&gt;
====Question 19====
This answer choice which could be a complete and accurate list of members of the crew. In order to find the correct answer choice, we need to looking at the order in which the work can be done. Framing is the first task only I and K can complete framing. this eliminates answer choice '''(E)'''. Wallboarding is the second task and only L and O can complete this task. This eliminates answer choice '''(A)'''. Taping is the third task and only G and L can complete this task. This eliminates answer choices '''(C)''' and '''(D)'''. That leaves answer choice '''(B)''' as the correct answer. &lt;br&gt;
====Question 20====
This question asks, if the installation takes three days and if the same two crew members work on the first and third days, then which pair of the crew members who could work on those two days. First we need to find out what work could be done on which days. We know that two people will be working on the first and third days, so that means on the first and third days two tasks must be completed, because according to rules 4 and 5 state that each member does no more than one task a day and each task is done exactly by one worker. The tasks also have to be completed in a specific order. So on Monday, framing and wallboarding have to be completed on Monday and on Friday sanding and priming have to be completed. Let's look at the list of crew members who can work on framing and wallboarding. Framing: I, K and Wallboarding: L, O. Now let's look at the list of crew members who complete sanding and priming. Sanding: H, K, M and Priming: P, I, O. Now we look for the common members which would be I, K, O.&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': H cannot complete framing and/or wallboarding, so this eliminates this answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': I and K could work on both days, however only both can complete framing but not wallboarding. This eliminates this answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': While the tasks framing and wallboarding can be completed by I and L, L doesn't not complete neither sanding nor priming. This eliminates this answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': K and O can complete framing and wallboarding as well as sanding and priming. This is the correct answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''': This leaves framing without anyone to complete this task and only priming would the be only task completed as O is the only one that could work on day three.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 21====
This questions what us to find the answer choice that cannot be a complete and accurate list of the crew members.&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': This is the correct answer choice because L or O must be included in the list as they are the only two that can complete the wallboarding task. Neither of them are included in this list and there this cannot be the complete and accurate answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''', '''(C)''', '''(D)''', and '''(E)''' are the incorrect answer choices. Remember in order for the list to be complete we need to have either L or O included in the list. Or we need to have either I or K. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 22====
This answer choice asks what could be a list of all of the crew members that can work on day two, if the installation takes three days and sanding is done on the third day. There are two possible scenarios.&lt;br&gt;
Scenario 1&lt;br&gt;
Day One: framing and wallboarding - [I, K] and [L, O] &lt;br&gt;
Day Two: taping - [G, L]&lt;br&gt;
Day Three: sanding and priming - [H, K, M] and [H, I, O]&lt;br&gt;

According to this scenario, G and L are the only two that can work on day two. Let's look at scenario 2 now. &lt;br&gt;
Scenario 2 &lt;br&gt;
Day One: framing - [I, K]&lt;br&gt;
Day Two: wallboarding and taping - [G, L] and [L, O]&lt;br&gt;
Day Three: sanding and priming - [H, K, M] and [H, I, O]&lt;br&gt;
According to this scenario, the list of everyone who can work on day two is G, L, and O. Any answer choice that includes G, L, or O or any combination of thereof. This leads us to answer choice '''(E)'''.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====Question 23====
This question asks which could be a pair of members of the crew both of whom work on the same days as each other and perform two tasks. We can use the diagram created for the previous question. &lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': is not the correct answer choice because both only complete one task each.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': According to the question, they each have two tasks to complete, that a total of four tasks between the two of them. In this case, H and K complete only three of the four.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': Between the two they can complete four tasks. In order for them to work on the same day taping and priming would have to be completed on the same day and that violates rule 2. &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': This is the correct answer choice. Both K and L can complete a total of four tasks. Both K and L can work on the same day.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''': Between the two of them they could complete only three tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Section II Logical Reasoning==
===Question 1===
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Question Stem&lt;/u&gt;:Point at Issue &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''' is the correct answer choice. &lt;br&gt; Why? Point at Issue questions ask you find the statement or topic that the two speakers disagree with. It means that for every answer choice, one of the speakers has to agree with the statement or topic and the other has to disagree.'''(D)''' does this. The Moralist would agree with this statement, while the TV talk show host would not agree with this answer choice. &lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''' The moralist doesn't mention censorship in his statements at all. He doesn't agree or disagree. The only person affected is the TV talk show host because he would disagree with that statement. &lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''' To some extent both the moralist and the TV talk show host both agree with this statement. Remember, the question stem asks you find what the moralist and TV talk show host disagree with, not what they both agree on. &lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''' This statement only affects the moralist as he would agree with that statement. The TV talk show host never mentions the influence of peoples conception of what is the norm. &lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' This statement only affects the TV talk show host as he implies that it would be wrong to not let viewers decide what they want to see. The moralist never talks about this in his statements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Question 2===
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Question Type&lt;/u&gt;: Assumption &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;...the search for a parasite has so far been wasted effort.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Pre-phrase&lt;/u&gt;: Parasites that kill sweet potato whiteflies will not kill silverleaf whiteflies. &lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''' is the correction answer choice. &lt;br&gt; If we logically negate this statement, it would say that some parasites of the sweet-potato whitefly is also a parasite of the silverleaf whitefly. If that were true then the whole argument would collapse. In order for the argument to be true, No parasite  of the sweet-potato whitefly is also a parasite of the sliverleaf whitefly.&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''' According to the stimulus only one variety of the whitefly has RECENTLY become a serious crop pest. No where in the stimulus does it say or imply that all varieties are serious crop pests. If we negate this statement (Not all varieties of the sweet-potato whitefly are serious crop pests), does it have any effect on the argument? No. ''Sometimes you do not need to negate every single answer choice. Narrow down the answer choices to at most two or three and then negate the sentences''&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''' This is a very general conditional statement. The stimulus was very specific and only mentioned that there was ONE type of whitefly that was becoming a serious crop pest. Anytime the stimulus mentions specifics and an answer choice is very general, unless it is a Principle Question, the answer choice is very much likely to be wrong.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''' Does this statement as it is have any effect on the argument? No. This answer choice is beyond the scope of the argument and is therefore the wrong answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' Regardless of whether or not the entomologist found parasites of the sweet-potato whitefly, it has no bearing on the argument. The stimulus specifically talks about the SEARCH for the parasite.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Question 3===
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Question Type:&lt;/u&gt; Flaw in Reasoning&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; There is none &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Pre-phrase:&lt;/u&gt; Female patients are the best people to poll.
'''(C)''' is the correct answer choice. The question stem asks you to find the flaw in the program's plan, which is to poll doctors and ask whether female physicians are more sensitive than male physicians to the needs of their female patients. The best person to ask this question are the female patients, not the physicians. ''Always try to pre-phrase answer choices. It makes finding the correct answer choice quicker and easier''&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''' is an incorrect answer choice because as our pre-phrase female patients are the best judges of whether female physicians or male physicians are more sensitive to the needs of female patients. &lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''' is an attractive answer choice because how would a woman be able to tell the difference between the type physicians if she has never been treated by a female physician? But the best answer choice still would be '''(C)''' because female patients are the best people to poll to get an accurate reading.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''' is an incorrect answer choice because it is way out of scope. No where in the stimulus is medical research mentioned. &lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' is an incorrect answer choice because again it is out of scope. The stimulus discusses whether or not certain types of physicians are more sensitive to female patients' needs. It does not discuss female patients becoming more involved with managing their medical care.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Question 4===
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Question Type:&lt;/u&gt; Main Point&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/u&gt; &quot;The practice of using this therapy to treat the illness cannot be adequately supported by the claim that any therapy for treating the illness is more effective than no therapy at all.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Pre-phrase:&lt;/u&gt; It is not enough to just treat the illness &lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' is the correct answer choice. By finding the conclusion of the argument for Main Point questions, all you need to do is find the answer choice that rephrases the argument's conclusion. In this case, answer choice '''(E)''' is the only answer choice that rephrases the conclusion. ''On most Main Point Questions, it is tricky finding the conclusion, because it is almost never the last sentence in the stimulus and there is almost never any conclusion indicators''. &lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''' is an incorrect answer choice because the conclusion states that practice of using the therapy cannot be supported by the claim that any therapy for treating the illness is more effective than no therapy at all. This answer choice simple just restates what the author is arguing against. &lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''' is an incorrect answer choice because the stimulus doesn't mention anything about the effectiveness of the treatment. This is slightly beyond the scope of the argument. &lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''' is an incorrect answer choice because this is a restatement of one of the premises. ''Anytime an answer choice repeats or rephrases a premise in the stimulus, it will ALWAYS be the incorrect answer choice for Main Point Questions''.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''' is an incorrect answer choice. Remember the stimulus conclusion. The doctor only states that the expense and complication of the treatment must be taken into account. He makes no claim about the effectiveness of the therapy.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''' is the correct answer choice because it restates the conclusion of the stimulus.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Question 5===
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Question Stem:&lt;/u&gt; Strengthen/Support &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;...so advertising time will be no harder to sell next fall than it was last fall.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Prephrase:&lt;/u&gt; There is something that is happens that makes more people watch television advertising.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Method of Reasoning:&lt;/u&gt;Author concludes that selling advertising won't any harder than before because advertisers will continue to profit despite the increased costs in advertising time.&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': If the costs production and distribution products advertised and along with the increased costs in advertising means that advertisers may not be willing to buy advertising time. This is the incorrect answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': This system for rating audience size is not mentioned in the stimulus. Even if the system changed, the answer choice doesn't specify how it will affect advertisers. This does not strengthen the answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': What does the size of the advertising blocks have on the argument? They don't. This goes beyond the scope of the argument.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': The stimulus doesn't differentiate between advertisers who sell products and those that sell services. This is beyond the scope of the argument.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''': This is the correct answer choice. If people are watching more television, then they are watching more advertising, and if they are watching more advertising, that means that the increased advertising costs are defrayed by the increased number of people watching advertising.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Question 6===
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Question Stem:&lt;/u&gt;Weaken&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Identify the Conclsuion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;...most people can diagnose swimmer's ear in themselves without ever having to consult a physician.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Prephrase:&lt;/u&gt; Show that people did consult with a physician before diagnosing themselves.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Method of Reasoning:&lt;/u&gt; Author bases the conclusion on a study.&lt;br&gt;
'''(A)''': We are looking to undermine the conclusion in the stimulus. This answer choice undermines the person or persons who believe that most people lace the expertise for diagnosing swimmer'sear, which actually strengthens the stimulus's conclusion.&lt;br&gt;
'''(B)''': Believing that they had other ailments that they did not have, is beyond the scope of the argument. The argument concerns itself with patients' diagnosing swimmer's ear. This is the incorrect answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(C)''': This is the correct answer choice. It's the closes to our prephrase. Even if you were unable to prephrase you should know that this is the correct answer choice. Why? If people had swimmer's ear before and was diagnosed by a physician then when they have again, they may be more likely to correctly diagnose themselves with swimmer's ear the second time around. If that is the case, then the patients needed a physician to diagnose them in the first case. This undermines the conclusion.&lt;br&gt;
'''(D)''': Does the stimulus mention anything about doctor's who specialize in ear disease? No. Does this have any bearing on the argument? No. Incorrect answer choice.&lt;br&gt;
'''(E)''': Is the stimulus concerned with the treatment of swimmer's ear? No. This is beyond the scope of the argument.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Please structure your latest contributions to comply with the above.  Also, it'd be nice to not have a class section number in the book title, so that the book can be made to work for a general audience later on.  Similar to what you did at [[The Practice of Learning Theories]].  I wonder if you'd consider expanding [[Instructional Technology]] instead.  Otherwise maybe you could move the pages to [[Instructional Technologies]] or something similar. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:05, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
Mathematics deals with proofs. Whatever statement, remark, result etc. one uses in mathematics it is considered meaningless until is accompanied by a rigorous mathematical proof. This book is intended to contain the proofs (or sketches of proofs) of many famous theorems in mathematics in no particular order. It should be used both as a learning resource, a good practice for acquiring the skill for writing your own proofs is to study the existing ones, and for general references.   

It is not however intended as a companion to any other wikibook or wikipedia articles but can complement them by providing them with links to the proofs of the theorems they contain.     

One note here. There are usually many ways to solve a problem. Many times the proof used comes down to the primary definitions of terms involved. We will follow the definition given by the first major contributor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Analysis has its beginnings in the rigorous formulation of calculus. It is the branch of mathematics most explicitly concerned with the notion of a limit, whether the limit of a sequence or the limit of a function. It also includes the theories of differentiation, integration and measure, infinite series, and analytic functions. These theories are often studied in the context of real numbers, complex numbers, and real and complex functions. However, they can also be defined and studied in any space of mathematical objects that is equipped with a definition of &quot;nearness&quot; (a topological space) or more specifically &quot;distance&quot; (a metric space).

Proofs are arranged in the following sections:

*[[/Metric Spaces/]]
*[[/Real Analysis/]]
*[[/Functional Analysis/]]
*[[/Harmonic Analysis/]] 
*[[/Complex Analysis/]]
*[[/Differential Geometry/]] 
*[[/Topology/]]
*[[/p-adic Analysis/]]
*[[/Non-standard Analysis/]] or model theory 
*[[/Numerical Analysis/]]

Most of the standard proofs of analysis studied at the undergraduate level are in the metric spaces section. This is so because proofs of such results in real analysis, complex analysis and even in topology are similar to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''metric space''' is a tuple (''M'',''d'') where ''M'' is a set and ''d'' is a metric on ''M'', that is, a function 

:&lt;math&gt;d : M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''non-negativity'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''identity of indiscernibles'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''symmetry'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'') &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  (''triangle inequality'').

The function ''d'' is also called ''distance function'' or simply ''distance''. Often ''d'' is omitted and one just writes ''M'' for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.

==Basic definitions==
Let X be a metric space. All points and sets are elements and subsets of X.

#A ''neighborhood'' of a point p is a set &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of all points q such that d(p,q) &lt; r. The number r is called the ''radius'' of &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt;. If the metric space is &lt;math&gt;R^k&lt;/math&gt; (here the metric is assumed to be the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric#Definition Euclidean metric]) then &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''open ball'' with ''center'' p and radius r. The ''closed ball'' is defined for d(p,q) &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; r. 
# A point p is a ''limit point'' of the set E if every neighbourhood of p contains a point q&lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt;p such that q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E.
#If p &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E and p is not a limit point of E then p is called an ''isolated point'' of E.
#E is ''closed'' if every limit point of E is a point of E.
#A point p is an ''interior point'' of E if there is a neighborhood N of p such that N &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; E.
#E is ''open'' if every point of E is an interior point of E.
#E is ''perfect'' if E is closed and if every point of E is a limit point of E.
#E is ''bounded'' if there is a real number M and a point q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; X such that d(p,q) &lt; M for all p &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E.
#E is ''dense'' in X every point of X is a limit point of E or a point of E (or both).

==Basic proofs==

1. ''Every neighborhood is an open set''

:''Proof'': Consider a neighborhood N = &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt;. Now if q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; N then as d(p,q) &lt; r we have h =  r - d(p,q) &gt; 0. Consider s &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;N_h(q)&lt;/math&gt;. Now d(p,s) &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; d(p,q) + d(q,s) &lt; r - h + h = r, and so &lt;math&gt;N_h(q)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; N. Thus q is an interior point of N.

2. ''If p is a limit point of a set E, then every neighborhood of p contains infinitely many points of E''

:''Proof'': Suppose there is a neighborhood N of p which contains only a finite number of points of E. Let r be the minimum of the distances of these points from p. The minimum of a finite set of positive numbers is clearly positive so that r &gt; 0. The neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt; contains no point q of E such that q &lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt; p which contradicts the fact that p is a limit point of E.

3. ''A finite set has no limit points''   

:''Proof'': This is obvious from the proof 2.

4. ''A set is open if and only if its complement is closed.''

:''Proof'': Suppose E is open and x is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt;. We need to show that x &lt;math&gt;\in E^c&lt;/math&gt;. Now every neighborhood of x contains a point of &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; so that x is not an interior point of E. Since E is open it means x &lt;math&gt;\notin&lt;/math&gt; E and so x &lt;math&gt;\in E^c&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed. 

:Now suppose &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Choose x &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E. Then x &lt;math&gt;\notin E^c&lt;/math&gt;, and so x is not a limit point of &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt;. So there must be a neighborhood of x entirely inside E. So x is an interior point of E and so E is open. 

5. ''A set is closed if and only if its complement is open.''

:''Proof'': This is obvious from the proof 4.

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Basis of WC.pdf]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Basis of WC.pdf]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the files included in Wikibooks because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. The file may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. 

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images or files you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images or files without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator.

= Two Knights Defence =
===4. Ng5===

This move is interesting. While some in the past considered it ridiculous, others point out that White wins a pawn in the process.

The White Knight now threatens a fork with Nxf7, yet to do so it's broken a rule of opening development in that the same piece moves twice. Black's only sensible way to defend f7 is to block the bishop access with 4...d5, but the pawn on d5 itself is not fully defensible by Black.

Black has two sensible replies.

:* [[/4...d5/]] The best way for Black to defend is to play d5, blocking the bishop from the weak f7 square.
:* [[/4...Bc5/]]. Ignoring the threat, a risky option is the Traxler Attack. Black can try a bishop sacrifice on f2 if White plays Nxf7. Instead, White will often prefer Bxf7+.

Additionally, black may choose to move the knight on f6. This opens up an attack on the white g5 knight. There are two sensible methods of achieving this:

:* [[/4...Nxe4/]].
:* [[/4...Nd5/]].

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

= Ruy Lopez:Open Game =

White's threatened bishop has five options, but any retreat along the f1-a6 diagonal it travelled on move 3 constitutes a loss of tempo, while [[/6. Bxc6|Bxc6]] gives a bad Exchange Variation where the lack of a fixed centre makes Black's bishop pair a fearsome force. So White is more or less forced to transpose into the Open Variation with [[/6. Ba4|Ba4]]. 

This is a good example of a move-order trick. Fans of the Open Variation can avoid a whole world of nonsense (Exchange Variation, Worrall Attack, 5. d3) by playing 3...Nf6 and transposing later.

Japanese curry sometimes referred to as &quot;wafuu curry&quot;, although similar to curry from other countries has a different taste and texture from curries that hail from India or other South-East Asian countries. Usually a roux is used as a base to give Japanese curry its texture, which is notably thicker then other curries.  

A manufactured &quot;roux&quot; popularized by S&amp;B Foods of Japan simplify curry cooking at home by eliminating the need to make broth.  Homemade curry recipes in Japan vary widely and frequently include ingredients like carrots, potatoes, onion, apple, and honey.

Curry houses in Japan usually serve curry made with chicken, beef or shrimp alongside plain white rice. Some accompaniments include fried egg, grilled sausage, toast, breaded pork chop (katsu-curry) and pickled onions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1984 was written by George Orwell in the 1940's after World War II. It is a dystopian novel depicting a so-called socialist government in Great Britain in the year 1984. In reality, the government is totalitarian, and controls everything from the economy to language.

Orwell is also known for the satirical novel '''Animal Farm'''.

Love is an important theme in the work. Love for a partner, love for a totalitarian regime, love for oneself and one's country and love in general, etc etc. The book ends on a note about love. You will see why if you carefully consider this theme throughout the work.

see also: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak Doublespeak] which is an important defining feature of this work that carefully influenced other works.
see also: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink Doublethink] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak Newsspeak] herein noted and appended.

== Translation ==


I'm starting a translation of this wikibook to Portuguese. Eventually I may feel tempted to add new stuff or improve this English language version, but never without discussing it with its previous authors or other experts first, so I'll appreciate if someone keep an eye in this discussion table.

Gabriel dCF, 09/09/2007

: Hi Gabriel, please feel free to make any improvements you feel need to be made. I've made most of the edits to this book but am always hoping that what is here can be improved by others. I'd hardly call myself an expert, but I hope that what has been written so far is accurate. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:18, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

== Matlab and Excel ==

Hi everyone!
Matlab is propietary software and not very usefull for personal purpouses unless you take it from non-legal sources.
I suggest to include in the table of contents only open-source software as OpenOffice and Octave.
Thanks,--[[User:Lupus|Lupus]] ([[User talk:Lupus|talk]]) 02:23, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:Hi Lupus, the original intent is to include software that someone would likely use in a business or academic environment and as much as I am a proponent of open source, it is still true that MATLAB and Excel are more common in industry (and in academia) than open office or Excel. I have nothing against including some things specific to free software (if you would like to make a note of this I would not object at all) but it does not make sense to me to exclude anything that's not, especially since the proprietary stuff is more commonly used. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 04:21, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
::Hi Mattb112885, I'll try this in the book that we're composing in spanish. In part you're right with Matlab, but maybe in the case of Excel the similarities are nearby and it will be more 'open' to introduce them all as &quot;calulous spreadsheets&quot; (or something like it, I guess you have a word for what in spanish is &quot;hojas de cálculo&quot;). Thanks a lot, and great job, Matt! --[[User:Lupus|Lupus]] ([[User talk:Lupus|talk]]) 12:03, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
::: I agree, I think we can just call them &quot;spreadsheets&quot; and then make a note like (such as Excel, GNUmeric, OpenOffice Calc, etc.) further down the page to let them know that yes it was written for Excel (since that's the most common and it's the one I know best at least, though if someone else knows more about another one's eccentricities they're welcomed to write some stuff about them too) but should be usable with other applications. I'll do this as I have more time, I'm just passing by atm. Do you have a link to the spanish page? I'd be interested in taking a look at it (I do not read or write spanish but that's what google's translator is for!). Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 16:20, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
::::Of course,it's right [[es:Operaciones Básicas|here]]. You'll see that is still in the initial phase, I'm too busy now but it's in my plans to finish it. Regards,--[[User:Lupus|Lupus]] ([[User talk:Lupus|talk]]) 16:54, 20 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

The quality of his life is meager, and he is secretly dissatisfied with Big Brother. He buys a diary from a [[../../Proletariat/]] shop and starts writing in it.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

Also, I saw your message on the talk page to [[Introduction to Chemical Engineering Processes]], I would say that you can make any improvements you want to the book (I've made most of the edits to that book so far), since that's what the wiki is for after all! I'm glad to see someone has found interest in it, and wish you luck in your translation. Unfortunately I don't know a word of Portuguese but I hope the end result is useful to speakers of that language as well. Regards.

Thanks a bunch, Matt! It'll be very nice to discuss with you how can we improve this book. Guess I'll have a piece of talk with the responsibles for the translation os the Spanish language version too, see if we can cooperate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In its most basic and most conceptual form, pressure is force per unit area.  Of course, we all have a basic intuition about what pressure is.  However, it's a little more slippery to define rigorously because we could in principle have a different pressure at every point, then it's not really force per unit area on a macroscopic scale.  Furthermore, what force and what area are we even talking about?

What we really mean is that if we draw a small closed surface around some point in a fluid, then the pressure is the outward force from the fluid inside the surface divided by the area or the surface.  Of course, the surface must be orientable (you can't draw a Klein bottle around it), but more importantly, as the surface you draw gets smaller (say you choose a sphere, then shrink the radius), the pressure calculated must get closer to a definite value.  Of course, these are all mathematical subtleties, and there are many more, all of which may be ignored.

One thing you should realize is that for any given surface, the total force on it is the surface integral of the pressure.  Equivalently, for a small surface (infinitesimal), the force is merely the pressure times the area.

Notice also that pressure cannot produce a shear force, only a normal force.

Now, imagine a small rectangular prism of fluid of dimensions dx, dy, dz.  Let's look at the two opposite sides normal to the x axis, let's call them A, and A'.  Now, we want to find out the total force on this cube from the fluid surrounding it.  The total force in the x direction is the force on A' minus the force on A.  The force on A is the pressure at A times the surface area, let's call it dy dz, so P(x) dy dz.  The force on A' is not quite the same; if we take the linear approximation, which becomes exact as dx, dy, and dz become smaller, then it is

&lt;math&gt; P(x) dy dz + \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} dx dy dz&lt;/math&gt;.  All the higher order terms can be neglected because when they are divided by dx dy dz, they will become zero.

The force in the x direction is then

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} dx dy dz&lt;/math&gt;.

Repeating the process for the other faces gives us

&lt;math&gt; d\vec{F} = (\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial P}{\partial z}) dV&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing through by dV (strictly speaking, we should be using delta's instead of d's, but you get the same result), and changing notation, we get

&lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = \nabla P&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is force ''density.''

&lt;!-- how do you make a script F for force density?--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intention of this book ==

The intention of this book is to provide an open-content, concise textbook on New Zealand history that is easy for anyone who is interested to read.


== A Note to Authors ==

This book is a work in progress, so feel free to contribute to it in places you see as unfinished or lacking information. 

The only major guidelines that authors of this project should follow, are to use New Zealand (British) spelling, follow the Wikibooks rules on unbiased writing, and keep the chapters fairly short and concise. Also, when distinguishing dates, use BC and AD. Otherwise, what authors choose to put in, as long as it is relevant and factual, is up to them.

'''Ropa vieja''', which is Spanish for &quot;Old Clothes,&quot; is a popular [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]] dish consisting of shredded beef (often skirt or flank steak), vegetables, and a sauce.  

The origin of ropa vieja is from the Canary Islands, which are [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] islands off the coast of North Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. The original version of Ropa Vieja contained leftovers, but later became a shredded meat dish with garbanzo beans and potatoes in the Canary Islands. Some versions in the Canary Islands contain beef or chicken or pork, or a combination of any of the three. Ropa vieja is widely prepared in the Caribbean today. Ropa vieja is listed among traditional Panamanian cuisine, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Cuba|Cuban cuisine]], Dominican cuisine and Canarian cuisine. 

Below is a typical Cuban recipe, which does not include [[Cookbook:Chickpea|garbanzo beans]]

==Ingredients==
*1 kg of boiled [[cookbook:beef|beef]] (pref. flank steak, but any meat with long threads will do)
*1/3 cup of [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] 
*1 [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
*3 [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves
*1 green [[cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] 
*1 red bell pepper
*1½ cup of [[cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]] 
*1 tsp of [[cookbook:salt|salt]] 
*1 [[cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]] 
*1 cup of red cooking [[cookbook:Red Wine|wine]] or [[cookbook:beer|beer]]

==Procedure==
#Cut the meat in pieces, not too small, not too big. Using a [[cookbook:Pressure Cooker|pressure cooker]], boil the meat for about 15 minutes. Add a teaspoon of olive oil to the water to avoid foaming, also add a teaspoon of salt. After boiling the meat, save a cup of the broth. 
#Shred the meat in thin strips using a fork. Chop the onion, cut the peppers in thin strips and mince the garlic cloves.
#[[cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] the garlic and the onion for a bit in hot oil, then add the peppers, sauté a bit more. Add the meat and the rest of the ingredients, including the cup of broth.
#Cook the mix low heat for 20 to 30 minutes. Stir a few times. Season to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Scott/Tiger example ==
A classic database widely used in teaching Relational databases concerns Employees, Departments and SalaryGrades. In Oracle training material it is known by the demo username and password, Scott/Tiger.

These three tables converted to XML (via the  XML add-in to Excel  [[XQuery/Excel and XML]] ) are:

Employees  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=1 XML] 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=1 Table] 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=1 MySQL]

Departments [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=2 XML] 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=2 Table] 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=2 MySQL]

Salary Grades [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=3 XML] 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=3 Table] 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=3 MySQL]

A port of the Oracle SQL file to MySQL can be found [http://2sun.org/scott-tiger-port-mysql here].

==  Execution environments ==
The eXist demo server is used for the XQuery examples. These are returned either as plain XML or converted to table format.

The equivalent SQL queries are executed on an [[w:MySQL]] server,also based at the [[w:University of the West of England| University of the West of England in Bristol]]

SQL:  '''select * from Emp where DeptNo=20''' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=4  MySQL]

XQuery:  '''count(//Emp)''' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=4  XML]

===== Task: How many Departments? =====

SQL:  '''select count(*) from dept'''  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=5  MySQL]

XQuery: '''count(//Dept)''' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=5  XML]

=== Selecting records ===

==== Task: Show all Employees with a salary greater than 1000 ====

SQL:  '''select * from emp where sal &gt; 1000;''' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=7  MySQL]

XQuery: '''//Emp&amp;#91;Sal&gt;1000&amp;#93;'''  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=7  XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=7  Table]

==== Task: Show all Employees with a salary greater than 1000 and less than 2000 ====

SQL: '''select * from emp where sal between 1000 and 2000;''' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=8  MySQL]

XQuery: '''//Emp&amp;#91;Sal&gt;1000&amp;#93;&amp;#91;Sal&lt;2000&amp;#93;''' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=8  XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=8  Table]

Here, successive filter conditions replace the anded conditions implied by 'between'. 

Although there is no 'between' function in XQuery, it is a simple matter to write one:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:between($value as xs:decimal, $min as xs:decimal, $max as xs:decimal) as xs:boolean {
  $value &gt;= $min and $value &lt;= $max
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

which simplifies the query to 
//Emp&amp;#91;local:between(Sal,1000,2000)] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=9  XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=9  Table]

and has the advantage that the conversion of Sal to a number is now implicit in the function signature.

==== Task: Show all employees with  no Commission ====

SQL: select * from emp where comm is null;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=10  MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp&amp;#91;empty(Comm/text())&amp;#93; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=10  XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=10  Table] 

Note that empty(Comm) is not enough, since this is true only if the element itself is absent, which in this sample XML it is not.

XQuery: //Emp&amp;#91;empty(Comm)&amp;#93; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=10a  XML]

==== Task: Select the first 5 employees ====

SQL: select * from emp  limit 5; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=42  MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp[position() &lt;=5]  

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=42  XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=42  Table]

=== Selecting Columns ===

==== List Employee names and salaries ====

SQL: Select ename,sal from emp [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=11 MySQL]

Surprisingly, selecting only a subset of children in a node (pruning) is not supported in XPath.  

//Emp/(Ename,Sal) [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=11 XML   ]  retrieves the required elements, but the parent Emp nodes have been lost. 

//Emp/(Ename|Sal) [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=12 XML   ]  is better since it keeps the elements in sequence, but it does not return Emp nodes with only the Ename and Sal children as required.

//Emp/*[name(.) = (&quot;Ename&quot;,&quot;Sal&quot;)] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=12a XML] uses reflection on the element names.


XQuery: 
&lt;pre&gt;
    for $emp in //Emp 
    return 
       &lt;Emp&gt;
         {$emp/(Ename|Sal)}
       &lt;/Emp&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=13 XML]
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=13 Table] 

Here an XQuery FLWOR expression is used to create a new EMP element from the original elements.

=== Computing values ===

==== Computing the Annual Salary ====


Task: Compute the Annual Salaries of all employees. The Annual Salary is computed from 12 times the Monthly salary plus Commission. Since commission may be null, it must be replaced by a suitable numeric value: 

SQL: select 12 * sal + ifnull(comm,0) from emp;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=14 MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp/(12*number(Sal)+(if(exists(Comm/text())) then number(Comm) else 0))
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=14 XML]


The SQL function COALESCE is the same as IFNULL but will accept multiple arguments:

SQL: select 12 * sal + coalesce(comm,0) from emp;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=14a MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp/(12*number(Sal)+ number((Comm/text(),0)[1]))
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=14a XML]

The lack of a schema in this simple example to carry information on the type of the items, leads to the need for explicit conversion of strings to numbers.

Note the XQuery idiom:
&lt;pre&gt;
 (Comm/text(),0)[1] 
&lt;/pre&gt; 

computes the first non-null item in the sequence, the counter-part of COALESCE.

==== Selecting and Creating Columns ====
Task: List the employee names with their Annual Salary.

SQL: select ename, 12 * sal + ifnull(comm,0) as &quot;Annual Salary&quot; from emp;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=16 MySQL]

XQuery: 
&lt;pre&gt;
for $emp in //Emp 
return &lt;Emp&gt;
         {$emp/Ename}
         &lt;AnnualSalary&gt;
            {12*number($emp/Sal)+ 
             (if (exists($emp/Comm/text())) 
             then number($emp/Comm)
             else 0)
            }
         &lt;/AnnualSalary&gt;
       &lt;/Emp&gt; 

&lt;/pre&gt;
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=16 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=16 Table] 

Again we have the problem of tree-pruning, but now with added grafting, which again requires the explicit construction of an XML node.


== SQL Operators ==

=== IN ===
Task: Show all employees whose Job is either ANALYST or MANAGER

SQL: select * from emp where job in (&quot;ANALYST&quot;,&quot;MANAGER&quot;)  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=40 MySQL]


XQuery:  //Emp[Job = (&quot;ANALYST&quot;,&quot;MANAGER&quot;)]
 
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=40 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=40 Table]

=== NOT IN ===

Task :Select all employees whose Job is not  'ANALYST' or 'MANAGER'

SQL:  select * from emp where job not in (&quot;ANALYST&quot;,&quot;MANAGER&quot;)  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=43 MySQL]

This doesn't work:

XQuery:  //Emp[Job !=(&quot;ANALYST&quot;,&quot;MANAGER&quot;)] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=44 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=44 Table]

The generalised equals here is always true since everyone is either not an ANALYST or not a MANAGER.
This works:

XQuery:  //Emp[not(Job =(&quot;ANALYST&quot;,&quot;MANAGER&quot;))] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=43 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=43 Table]

=== Distinct values ===
Task: Show the different Jobs which Employees have
 
MySQL:  select distinct job from emp;     [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=41 MySQL]

XQuery:  distinct-values(//Emp/Job) [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=41 XML]

=== Pattern Matching ===

Task:  List all Employees with names starting with &quot;S&quot;

MySQL: select * from emp where ename like &quot;S%&quot;;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=45 MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp[starts-with(Ename,&quot;S&quot;)] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=45 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=45 Table]

See [http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/xq/fn_starts-with.html starts-with()]

Task: List all Employees whose name contains &quot;AR&quot; 

MySQL: select * from emp where ename like &quot;%AR%&quot;;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=46 MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp[contains(Ename,&quot;AR&quot;)] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=46 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=46 Table]

See [http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/xq/fn_contains.html contains()]

Task: List all Employees whose name contains &quot;ar&quot; ignoring the case

MySQL: select * from emp where ename like &quot;%ar%&quot;;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=47 MySQL]

LIKE in SQL is case insensitive, but fn:contains() is not, so the case needs to be converted: 

XQuery: //Emp[contains(upper-case(Ename),upper-case(&quot;ar&quot;))] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=47 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=47 Table]

See [http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/xq/fn_upper-case.html upper-case()]


More complex patterns need regular expressions. 

MySQL: select * from emp where ename regexp &quot;M.*R&quot;;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=48 MySQL]

XQuery:  //Emp[matches(Ename,&quot;M.*R&quot;)] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=48 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=48 Table]

See [http://www.xqueryfunctions.com/xq/fn_matches.html matches()]

Similarly, SQL's REGEXP is case-insensitive, whereas additional flags control matching in the XQuery matches()

MySQL: select * from emp where ename regexp &quot;m.*r&quot;;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=49 MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp[matches(Ename,&quot;m.*r&quot;,'i')] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=49 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=49 Table]

('i' makes the regex match case insensitive.)

== Table Joins ==
==== Simple Inner joins ====
Task: Find the name of the department that employee 'SMITH' works in:

SQL : &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;select dept.dname 
from emp, dept 
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno  
   and ename='SMITH';
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=56 MySQL] 


XPath : &lt;code&gt;//Dept[DeptNo = //Emp[Ename='SMITH']/DeptNo]/Dname&lt;/code&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=56 XML] 

Perhaps a FLWOR expression in XQuery would be more readable:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
let $dept := //Emp[Ename='SMITH']/DeptNo
return //Dept[DeptNo = $dept ]/Dname
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=59 XML] 

Task: To find the names of all employees in Accounting

SQL: 
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
select emp.ename 
from emp,dept 
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno 
  and dname='Accounting';
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=57 MySQL] 

XPath: &lt;code&gt;//Emp[DeptNo = //Dept[Dname='Accounting']/DeptNo]/Ename&lt;/code&gt; 

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=57 XML]

XQuery: 
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
let $dept := //Dept[Dname='Accounting']/DeptNo
return //Emp[DeptNo = $dept]/Ename
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;  
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=60 XML] 



Note that in this release of eXist, the order of the operands in the equality is significant - to be fixed in a later release.

XQuery: &lt;code&gt;//Emp[//Dept[Dname='Accounting']/DeptNo = //Emp/DeptNo]/Ename&lt;/code&gt;


[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=58 XML]

==== More complex Inner Join ====

Task: List the name of each Employee, together with the name and location of their department.

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
  select ename, dname,location
    from emp, dept
   where emp.deptno = dept.deptno;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=18 MySQL]

Where elements must be selected from several nodes, XPath is insufficient and XQuery is needed:

XQuery:

This join could be written as:

&lt;pre&gt;
  for $emp in //Emp
  for $dept in //Dept
  where $dept/DeptNo= $emp/DeptNo
  return
    &lt;Emp&gt;
      {$emp/Ename}
      {$dept/(Dname|Location)}
    &lt;/Emp&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=18 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=18 Table] 

But it would be more commonly written in the form of a sub-selection:

&lt;pre&gt;
  for $emp in //Emp
  let $dept := //Dept[DeptNo=$emp/DeptNo]
  return
    &lt;Emp&gt;
      {$emp/Ename}
      {$dept/(Dname|Location)}
    &lt;/Emp&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Inner Join with Selection ====
Task: List the names and department of all Analysts

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
  select ename, dname
    from emp, dept
   where emp.deptno = dept.deptno
     and job=&quot;ANALYST&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=20 MySQL]

XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
  for $emp in //Emp[Job='ANALYST']
  let $dept := //Dept[DeptNo= $emp/DeptNo]
  return
    &lt;Emp&gt;
      {$emp/Ename}
      {$dept/Dname}
    &lt;/Emp&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=20 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=20 Table]

==== 1 to Many  query ====

Task: List the departments and the number of employees in each department

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
  select dname,
         (select count(*)
            from emp
           where deptno = dept.deptno
         ) as headcount
    from dept;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=52 MySQL]

XQuery: 

&lt;pre&gt;
  for $dept in //Dept 
  let $headCount := count(//Emp[DeptNo=$dept/DeptNo])
  return  
    &lt;Dept&gt;
       {$dept/Dname}
       &lt;HeadCount&gt;{$headCount}&lt;/HeadCount&gt;
    &lt;/Dept&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=52 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=52 Table]

==== Theta (Inequality) Join ====

Task: List the names and salary grade of staff in ascending grade order

Grades are defined by a minimum and maximum salary.

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
select ename, grade
  from emp, salgrade
 where emp.sal between salgrade.losal and salgrade.hisal;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=21 MySQL]

XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
for $emp in //Emp
let $grade :=  //SalGrade[number($emp/Sal) &gt; number(LoSal)][number($emp/Sal) &lt; number(HiSal)]/Grade
order by $grade
return
  &lt;Emp&gt;
    {$emp/Ename}
    {$grade}
  &lt;/Emp&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=21 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=21 Table]

==== Recursive Relations ====

The relationship between an employee and their manager is a recursive relationship.

Task:  List the name of each employee together with the name of their manager. 

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
select e.ename, m.ename
  from emp e
  join emp m on e.mgr = m.empno
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=30 MySQL]

XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
for $emp in //Emp
let $manager := //Emp[EmpNo = $emp/MgrNo]
return
  &lt;Emp&gt;
    {$emp/Ename}
    &lt;Manager&gt;{string($manager/Ename)}&lt;/Manager&gt;
  &lt;/Emp&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=30 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=30 Table]

The XQuery result is not quite the same as the SQL result.  King, who has no manager, is missing from the SQL inner join.  To produce the same result in XQuery, we would filter for employees with Managers:

&lt;pre&gt;
for $emp in //Emp[MgrNo]
let $manager := //Emp[EmpNo = $emp/MgrNo]
where $emp/MgrNo/text()
return
  &lt;Emp&gt;
    {$emp/Ename}
    &lt;Manager&gt;{string($manager/Ename)}&lt;/Manager&gt;
  &lt;/Emp&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=31 XML] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQueryTable.xq?id=31 Table]

Alternatively, an outer join returns all employees, including King:

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
select e.ename, m.ename
  from emp e
  left join emp m on e.mgr = m.empno
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=32 MySQL]

=== Conversion to an organisational tree ===

The manager relationship defines a tree structure, with King at the root, her direct reports as her children and so on. A recursive function in XQuery solves this task.

XQuery:
&lt;pre&gt;
 declare function local:hierarchy($emp) {
     &lt;Emp name='{$emp/Ename}'&gt;
       &lt;Reports&gt;
       {for $e in  //Emp[MgrNo = $emp/EmpNo]
        return
           local:hierarchy($e)
       }
       &lt;/Reports&gt;
     &lt;/Emp&gt;
 };
 
 local:hierarchy(//Emp[empty(MgrNo/text())])
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=33 XML]

=== Conversion to a Department/Employee Hierarchy ===

For export, a single XML file could be created with Employees nested within Departments.  This is possible without introducing redundancy or loss of data because the Dept/Emp relationship is exactly one to many.

XQuery:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Company&gt;
  {for $dept in //Dept
  return
    &lt;Department&gt;
      {$dept/*}   
      {for $emp in //Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]  
      return $emp
      }
    &lt;/Department&gt;
  }
&lt;/Company&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=50 XML]

With this simple approach, the foreign key DeptNo in Emp has been included but it is now redundant.  The &lt;b&gt;except&lt;/b&gt; operator is useful here:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Company&gt;
   {for $dept in //Dept
    return
       &lt;Department&gt;
          {$dept/*}   
          {for $emp in //Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]  
           return 
              &lt;Employee&gt;
                  {$emp/* except $emp/DeptNo}
              &lt;/Employee&gt;
          }
       &lt;/Department&gt;
    }
&lt;/Company&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=51 XML]

Note that this assumes there are no attributes to be copied.  If there are, these would be copied with 
&lt;code&gt;
$emp/@*
&lt;/code&gt;

== Working with the hierarchical data ==

This hierarchical data can be queried directly in XQuery.  

=== Path to Employee ===
Almost all the queries remain the same (except for the change of element name to &lt;b&gt;Employee&lt;/b&gt;). This is because the path used to select Emps in the Emp.xml document is  &lt;code&gt;//Emp&lt;/code&gt; and is now &lt;code&gt;//Employee&lt;/code&gt; in the merged document.  If a full path had been used (&lt;code&gt;/EmpList/Emp&lt;/code&gt;), this would need to be replaced by &lt;code&gt;/Company/Department/Employee&lt;/code&gt;

=== Simple Navigation ===

Task:  To find the department name of employee 'Smith'

XQuery:  &lt;code&gt;//Employee[Ename='SMITH']/../Dname&lt;/code&gt;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=153 XML] 

Task: To find the names of employees in the Accounting department

XQuery:  &lt;code&gt;//Department[Dname='Accounting']/Employee/Ename&lt;/code&gt;  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=154 XML]

=== Department /Employee Join ===

The main changes are in queries which require a join between Employee and Departments because they are already nested and thus become navigation up (from Employee to Department ) or down (from Department to Employee) the tree.

==== many - one ====
The query to list the Employees and the location of their Department with separate documents was: 

&lt;pre&gt;
 for $emp in //Emp
 for $dept in //Dept
  where $dept/DeptNo=$emp/DeptNo
  return

With one nested document, this becomes:

&lt;pre&gt;
 for $emp in //Employee

    &lt;Employee&gt;
      {$emp/Ename}

using the parent access to move up the tree.

==== 1 - many ====
To list departments and the number of employees in the separate tables is :

&lt;pre&gt;
for $dept in //Dept 
let $headCount := count(//Emp[DeptNo=$dept/DeptNo])
return  
    &lt;Dept&gt;
       {$dept/Dname}
       &lt;HeadCount&gt;{$headCount}&lt;/HeadCount&gt;
    &lt;/Dept&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

which becomes:

&lt;pre&gt;
for $dept in //Department
let $headCount := count($dept/Employee)
return  
    &lt;Department&gt;
       {$dept/Dname}
       &lt;HeadCount&gt;{$headCount}&lt;/HeadCount&gt;

== Summarising and Grouping ==

=== Summary data ===

Task: Show  the number, average (rounded), min and max salaries for Managers.

SQL: SELECT count(*), round(avg(sal)), min(sal), max(sal) FROM  emp WHERE job='MANAGER'; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=22 MySQL]

XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
   (count(//Emp[Job='MANAGER']),round(avg(//Emp[Job='MANAGER']/Sal)),min(//Emp[Job='MANAGER']/Sal),max( //Emp[Job='MANAGER']/Sal))
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=21a  XML]

Better to factor out the XPath expression for the subset of employess:

&lt;pre&gt;
let $managers := //Emp[Job='MANAGER']
return (count($managers),round(avg($managers/Sal)),min($managers/Sal),max($managers/Sal))
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=22 XML]

It would be better to tag the individual values computed:
&lt;pre&gt;
let $managers := //Emp[Job='MANAGER']
return 
   &lt;Statistics&gt;
     &lt;Count&gt;{count($managers)}&lt;/Count&gt;
     &lt;Average&gt;{round(avg($managers/Sal))}&lt;/Average&gt;
     &lt;Min&gt;{min($managers/Sal)}&lt;/Min&gt;
     &lt;Max&gt;{max($managers/Sal)}&lt;/Max&gt;
   &lt;/Statistics&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runQuery.xq?id=23 XML]

===Grouping ===

Task: Show  the number, average (rounded), min and max salaries for each Job.

SQL: SELECT job, count(*), round(avg(sal)), min(sal), max(sal) FROM emp GROUP BY job; [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=24 MySQL]


In XQuery, grouping must be done by iterating over the groups.  Each Group is identified by the Job and we can get the set (sequence) of all Jobs using the distinct-values function:

&lt;pre&gt;
for $job in distinct-values(//Emp/Job)
let $employees  := //Emp[Job=$job]
return 
   &lt;Statistics&gt;
         &lt;Job&gt;{$job}&lt;/Job&gt;
         &lt;Count&gt;{count($employees )}&lt;/Count&gt;
         &lt;Average&gt;{round(avg($employees/Sal))}&lt;/Average&gt;
          &lt;Min&gt;{min($employees/Sal)}&lt;/Min&gt;
          &lt;Max&gt;{max($employees/Sal)}&lt;/Max&gt;
     &lt;/Statistics&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=24 XML]  
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQueryTable.xq?id=24 Table]

=== Hierarchical report ===
Task: List the departments , their employee names and salaries and the total salary in each department

This must generate a nested table.

SQL: ?

XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Report&gt;
  {
  for $dept in //Dept
  let $subtotal := sum(//Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]/Sal)
  return
     &lt;Department&gt;
        {$dept/Dname}
        {for $emp in //Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]
         return
            &lt;Emp&gt;
              {$emp/Ename}
              {$emp/Sal}
            &lt;/Emp&gt;
         }
         &lt;SubTotal&gt;{$subtotal}&lt;/SubTotal&gt;
      &lt;/Department&gt;
   }
   &lt;Total&gt;{sum(//Emp/Sal)}&lt;/Total&gt;
&lt;/Report&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=54 XML]


Note that the functional nature of the XQuery language means that each total must be calculated explicitly, not rolled up incrementally as might be done in an imperative language.  This has  the advantage that the formulae are explicit and independent and can thus be placed anywhere in the report, such as at the beginning instead of at the end:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Report&gt;
  &lt;Total&gt;{sum(//Emp/Sal)}&lt;/Total&gt;
  {
  for $dept in //Dept
  let $subtotal := sum(//Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]/Sal)
  return
     &lt;Department&gt;
         &lt;SubTotal&gt;{$subtotal}&lt;/SubTotal&gt;
        {$dept/Dname}
        {for $emp in //Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]
         return
            &lt;Emp&gt;
              {$emp/Ename}
              {$emp/Sal}
            &lt;/Emp&gt;
         }
      &lt;/Department&gt;
   }
 &lt;/Report&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runXQuery.xq?id=55 XML]

=== Restricted Groups ===

Task: Show  the number, average (rounded), min and max salaries for each Job where there are at least 2 employees in the group.

SQL:

&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT job, count(*), round(avg(sal)), min(sal), max(sal)
  FROM emp
 GROUP BY job
HAVING count(*) &gt; 1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=25 MySQL]

XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
for $job in distinct-values(//Emp/Job)
let $employees := //Emp[Job=$job]
where count($employees) &gt; 1
return 
   &lt;Statistics&gt;
      &lt;Job&gt;{$job}&lt;/Job&gt;
      &lt;Count&gt;{count($employees )}&lt;/Count&gt;
      &lt;Average&gt;{round(avg($employees /Sal))}&lt;/Average&gt;
      &lt;Min&gt;{min($employees /Sal)}&lt;/Min&gt;
      &lt;Max&gt;{max($employees /Sal)}&lt;/Max&gt;
   &lt;/Statistics&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Date Handling ==

===Selecting by Date ===
Task: list all employees hired in the current millenium

SQL: SELECT * from job where hiredate &gt;= '2000-01-01' [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/runSQL.xq?id=26 MySQL]

XQuery: //Emp&amp;#91;HireDate &gt;= '2000-01-01'&amp;#93;

Actually this comparison is a string comparison because of the lack of a schema to define HireDate as an xs:date.

== First European Explorers to Discover New Zealand ==
[[Image:Cook new zealand.jpg|thumb|right|First map of New Zealand, drawn by James Cook.]]

===Abel Tasman===
Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, was one of the first Europeans to discover New Zealand on the 13th of December 1642, in his search for the Great Southern Continent. Tasman noted in his journal that it was a large land, uplifted high (the area he sighted was near the Southern Alps). He called New Zealand 'Staten Landt' which refers to the 'Land of the (Dutch) States-General'.

The first encounter Tasman had with the Maori was on the 18th of December in Taitapu Bay (now Golden Bay), when two canoes from the shore approached Tasman's ship. Communication was not possible, as the Dutch and the Maori couldn't understand each other's languages.

Later, more canoes approached the ship, so the Dutch sent out a boat to tempt the Maori to come on board. One of the canoes rammed the small Dutch boat, killing some sailors. The Dutch, in turn, fired at the Maori when more canoes approached, causing the Maori to retreat to shore rapidly.

After this, Tasman travelled to the tip of the North Island before leaving New Zealand waters.

===James Cook===
British explorer, James Cook, captain of the Endeavour entered New Zealand waters on the 6th of October 1769, and laid anchor at today's Poverty Bay. When Cook saw smoke, he realised the land was inhabited, he and a group of sailors headed to shore, in the hope of befriending the natives and taking on board refreshments. The Maori were hostile, however, and the British had to fire on the Maori in self-defence.

Cook attempted trade with Maori again at a different location, but with no success. He managed to sketch 2400 miles of coastline on the journey and proved New Zealand was not part of a major continent. He returned to New Zealand another two times in the 18th Century.

thanks for editing the kapampangan wikibook I really appreciate any help. 

Your addition of the word &quot;ra&quot;, requires some explanations. In this learning method, we are trying to never use a wrod unless the word has been explaned beforehand. 

Could you explain the meaning of &quot;ra&quot;, and why it is required?

{{thetop|bd=beige|ha1=center|__TOC__|&lt;h2&gt;Wikitext Tables&lt;/h2&gt;

Tables allow us to structure data on a screen into neat rows and columns.   This is useful in many situations. In fact, many other box-like structures on web pages use tables as their basis.

Wikitext tables are based closely on HTML tables. If you are familiar with HTML, you may be happy to learn that you can use HTML tables in Wiki pages. However, the wiki markup code, as it is called, uses fewer characters and does not use closing tags.   Wikitext tables are quite basic in their simplest form, but like their HTML equivalents, they can be formatted to an enormous extent by the addition of HTML attributes and CSS styles.   This page explains how to make tables.

For those who just need a quick Wikitext or HTML table that they can modify for their work, refer to [[../Tables Ready to Use/]].|[[image:Callisto font samples.jpg|200px]]}}

Here is a basic table example:|1='''What you type''':&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1
  |+ Caption

&lt;table border=1 align=center style=&quot;font-size:1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;|3=&lt;big&gt;'''Wikitext Table Symbols'''&lt;/big&gt;
*'''Outer curly bracket-and-pipe symbols''' denote a ''table''.  
*'''Pipe-and-hyphen symbols''' denote a new ''row''.
*'''Pipe symbols on their own''' denote a ''data cell''.  
*'''Exclamation marks''' denote ''heading cells''.
*'''Pipe-and-plus symbols''' denote a table ''caption''.
|trailer=Notice that the table has been given ''all-round borders'', with the addition of the term ''border=1''.   Properties defined elsewhere, in a Wiki style sheet in fact, have centered the heading cells and made them ''bold''.   The same default conditions have made the table's background color ''white'', the text ''black'', and placed its caption at the top.

Notice also that the columns of the basic table expand to accommodate the widest text.  If some table cells are to be left blank then columns might become very narrow.    Users often place special hidden characters into cells to expand such columns.   The character used is the ''non-breaking space'', '''&amp;amp;nbsp;''', so called because its original intention was to keep any two words together that are linked by it.

These simple tables do not have any margins around them to space them from other text.   To make sure that they do not get mixed up with these other parts of the page they can be preceded and followed with the code '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.   This makes sure that both the table and any text that follows it start on new lines of their own.   Tables can also include ''margin'' styles that perform this spacing.               

This simple table code, or any other used in the examples can be can be copied and pasted into the [[wikibooks:sandbox|Sandbox]] or into other pages for testing and extension.   To extend such a table, just add more rows and data cells.}}

{{Thetop|bd=linen|ha1=left|ha2=left|w1=33|w2=34%|w3=33%|leader={{hiddenh2|Alternative Layout}}
There are two other table layouts that work in Wiki pages; both make identical tables to the basic one shown above.   The first listing is fairly similar but writes the ''cell'' code for a row in ''one single line''.   Note that there is a ''double'' pipe symbol used for a cell separator:   When heading cells are arranged in this way, ''double'' exclamations are used instead of double pipes.

The second listing is the HTML equivalent of a wikitext table, and is sometimes easier to use when such a table is to be displayed by a template.   It is a fact that the pipe symbols of Wiki tables can conflict with other such symbols in templates, and the use of HTML tables is one method of avoiding such problems.   When HTML tables are used, they have more liberal formatting rules; for example, they can have line-spacing between their elements whereas wikitext tables cannot.


----
'''Technical note:''' ''It might be as well to know that HTML tables can be made in some HTML editors, and that these are often provided free on the internet.   The internet also provides the use of HTML-to-Wikitext converters for code, but not for the opposite conversion.   So, for the few cases where both a Wikitext and an HTML version of the same table are needed, it might be best to make the HTML version first, then simply convert it to Wiki''.    
----


The term seen in the code, ''border=1'', is called an ''HTML attribute'', and sets all-round borders for the table to make these examples more clear.  Notice also that the formats differ slightly; the HTML table's styles are placed ''within'' the ''opening element tag'', while the Wiki styles are just written ''after'' the element symbol.   Attributes and other styles are discussed in the next section. 

|1='''Another Wiki Format''':&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1
  |+ Caption
|-
  ! Heading 1!! Heading 2
|-
  | A || B
|-
  | C || D
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;|2='''The HTML Format''':
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;|3=&lt;big&gt;'''More Notes on Layout'''&lt;/big&gt;
*'''Table elements''' that start on new lines can be indented.
*'''Line spacing''' between such elements is not generally permitted.  
*'''Tables have modifying ''HTML attributes''''' of their own, e.g. ''border'', ''width'', and ''align'', etc, as do most HTML elements.
*'''Additionally''', tables can be changed with ''classes'', ''IDs'', and ''styles''. See later.
*'''Tables to be displayed in templates''' are best made with HTML. 
*'''Wiki heading cells have built-in styles'''; they are already bold and centered.
|trailer= HTML tables need text in their cells to be properly displayed.   If a blank cell is intended then entering a ''non-breaking space'', '''&amp;amp;nbsp;''', avoids problems.

{{thetop|bd=mintcream|ha1=left|ha2=left|w1=40%|w2=50%|w3=10%|leader=&lt;h2&gt;CSS Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
The simple tables shown above can be used just as they are, but their users will likely need to apply some extra formatting sooner or later.   To extend a table's ''structure'', many just add new rows with their cells, or extra cells in existing rows.   These methods have merit, since colors and ''formats'' can be preserved.   When a more ambitious table is needed then the information in this section will be found useful.
:*Table styles are sets of instructions or rules that add formats to the work,.
:*Styles can be specified and named in style-sheet lists called ''classes''.  Then a ''class- declaration'' is made in the table line, that is, writing the class name calls it into use. The effect of doing so is to apply all of the styles in the named class to the table.  An example of such a table class declaration is ''&lt;nowiki&gt;class=''Wikitable''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.
:*Styles can also be fully specified ''within'' tables; these are called ''in-line styles'', and provided that they are written in the appropriate part of the table, they can override styles contained in classes declared in the table line.
:*Users of Wikitext make use of ''in-line'' styles because there are few useful ''classes'' to format tables; the writing of ''new'' style-sheet classes would be the preferred method but, by necessity, this activity is in the domain of administrators.
:*Style rules can be used to format ''all'' of the table's parts. 
:*HTML ''attributes'' can be used too, but their formats differ from those of CSS styles.
:*Styles and attributes can be used in conjunction to good effect.

The general formats for writing these styles can be found in the drop-box ''Style Formats'' below and a summary of properties can be found in another.   The sections of this page contain numerous code examples that illustrate how styles are placed for a given effect, and the reader new to the subject is advised to follow the wording of the code for the best understanding.   More on the precedence of styles can be found in the Wikibooks page [[The_CSS_Cascade|'''The CSS Cascade''']], though the work might be more than is needed for a basic understanding.     

{{dropimage|align=center|cfs=1em|hfs=1,2em|1=Style Formats|2=&lt;table width=700px align=center&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
'''&lt;big&gt;Where to Place the Styles&lt;/big&gt;'''

Styles are written with a particular table level in mind. For example, a cell background color would be written at cell level, and a more general table background color would be written at table level.   A separate row background could also be set with a style at the row level.

It may be of interest to note that a ''row's style'' can be set to change all of its cells at once but that only ''some'' of the various formats can be used in this way; the others must be applied to every cell.   This can make some work quite laborious.   The formats that permit it are those affecting ''colors'', ''fonts'', and ''text-alignments''; the ones that do not, are the formats that change ''layout'', namely ''borders'', ''cell spacing'', ''cell padding'', ''margins'', and ''text spacings''. 

In Wikitext the ''attribute list'' and the ''CSS style expression'' is placed just ''after'' the symbol that creates that table, row, or cell.  Examples will be found throughout the main text.   When a ''class'' is to be specified for a table, (a prepacked set of styles), it is written in the table line.   This is usually the case even when the class includes styles for lower levels.  The following example shows a sample coding for a table with the WIKITABLE class, and with styles in each of its relevant elements.  It might be of interest to note that were the heading styles omitted in this example that the WIKITABLE's purple coloring would prevail there; that is to say, the in-line style at that level has priority over the style applied to it by the class.   Notice that styles are separated from cell text with a pipe symbol.
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center width=50% style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:maroon;&quot;
   |+ style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;|Caption Text
|- 
   ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;| Heading 1
   ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;| Heading 2          
|- 
   | Cell A1 Text||Cell A2 Text
|-   style=&quot;background:lightgray;&quot;
   | style=&quot;border:3px solid darkred;&quot;|Cell B1 Text
   | Cell B2 Text
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The table looks like this:
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center width=50% style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:darkblue;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption style=&quot;font-weight:bold;color:black;&quot;&gt;Caption Text&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th  style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th  style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;&quot;&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;          
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; Cell A1 Text&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cell A2 Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr    style=&quot;background:lightgray;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;td  style=&quot;border:3px solid darkred;&quot;&gt;Cell B1 Text&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; Cell B2 Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


{{hiddenh3|Alternative Layout for ''All-in-one-line rows''}}
To add styles or attributes to such table cells using the alternative ''all cells in one line'' notation use the following typical format:
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
|-   style=&quot;background:lightgray;&quot;
   | style=&quot;border:3px solid darkred;&quot;|Cell B1 Text || align=left| Cell B2 Text 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that styles and data text are still separated by a pipe symbol, and that a double pipe symbol isolates the details for the next cell.   Other cells of the same row could still occupy the next line if need be.

The same idea applied to the ''headings'' in an alternative format look like this:
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
|- 
   ! align=left| Heading 1 !! style=&quot;font-family:courier;&quot;| Heading 2        
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that a double exclamation separates heading cell descriptions, and that a pipe symbol separates each heading's style from its data.

Numerous examples of HTML tables and their Wikitext equivalent coding can be seen on the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables_Ready_to_Use|Tables Ready to Use]].   


'''&lt;big&gt;The Format for HTML Attributes&lt;/big&gt;'''

HTML attributes include such items as ''cellpadding'', ''cellspacing'', and ''align''.   There are also several others that apply to tables, and a full list of those for tables can be found in an adjacent drop-box summary.  They all use two terms separated by an equals sign, and it is usual for several such items to be set in the table line.   The general format is:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;attribute1=value1 attribute2=value2 attributeN=valueN&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note in the above example that the rules are separated by a space.   Another listing, this time with a practical example for the three mentioned attributes is:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;cellpadding=10px cellspacing=8px align=center&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
  
'''&lt;big&gt;The Format for CSS Styles&lt;/big&gt;'''

CSS styles have many more formatting rules than do the HTML attributes.   They include all of the coloring, fonts, spacing, padding, margin, and other items.   There are often several of these in a table element, with the table line itself containing most.   The general format is:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style = &quot;property1:value1; property2:value2; ... propertyN:valueN;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note from the above general form:
:*'''Each style rule''' ''comprises'' a property and a value.
:*'''Separators ''between'' the properties''' and values are ''full colons''.
:*'''Separators ''between'' the style rules''' themselves are ''semi-colons''.
:*'''The entire set''' of rules is ''enclosed'' in double quotes.
:*'''The set forms''' the right hand side of an expression equated to ''style''.
Another listing, that could be placed in a table element, a row element, or a cell element, to set their background and text colors, is just:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:lightyellow; color:royalblue;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note that the color names have been used, and that they are each spelled as one word.   The two formatting methods are mixed frequently in the same lines as follows:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;align=right width=300px style=&quot;background:lightyellow; color:royalblue;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

'''&lt;big&gt;Punctuation Rules for Style Expressions&lt;/big&gt;'''

Sometimes style rules look a bit compact and need spread out to make them more readable, and to provide convenient break-points for text wrapping.  These notes apply to the punctuation '''within a CSS style expression'''.

&lt;u&gt;'''Main Points to Avoid'''&lt;/u&gt;

:*'''Line breaks are ''not'' permitted ''within'' style expressions'''.
:*'''Colons and semi-colons must ''not'' have a space ''before'' them.'''

&lt;u&gt;'''These have Latitude'''&lt;/u&gt;

:*Spaces ''after'' colons and semi-colons are OK.
:*Space between a table, row, or cell symbol and the word ''style'' is OK.
:*Space around any ''equals'' symbol is OK.
:*Space between the style rules and their bounding quotes is OK.
:*Optionally, a semi-colon can be placed immediately ''after'' the last style rule.

&lt;u&gt;'''In addition'''&lt;/u&gt;

:*Compound values like  &lt;nowiki&gt;''2px solid black''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''must'' be space-separated.
:*Attributes ''must'' be separated from CSS style expressions with space.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;}}

{{tablestyles}}

Numerous examples of HTML tables and their Wikitext equivalent coding can be seen on the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables_Ready_to_Use|Tables Ready to Use]].  At times it is easier to understand a particular point from such examples, or to recall details already learned.   

{{hiddenh3|Style Rule Priorities}}
When styles for similar formats are written into the various parts, (elements), of a table, it is possible for one set of formats to be in conflict with another set. In general, ''any'' formats closer to the cell text will supersede similar formats further away from it.

For example, if the background color of a table is set to ''red'' using a style expression in the table line, then another expression in a cell could specify the cell color ''blue''.   A row's color could be specified differently also.  Subject to the rules of priority , only some parts would be affected and the remaining parts of the table would retain the color set for them in the table line.   These simple priorities are listed here:    

:*'''Styles written in cells''' supersede ''similar'' styles applied at row or table level.
:*'''Styles written in rows''' supersede ''similar'' styles applied at table level.
:*'''A CSS Style is given priority over an ''HTML attribute'' ''' when both are at the same level.   For example, if a CSS ''margin'' property places a table near the left margin of the page, then the additional centering of the table with the attribute ''align'' would be disregarded.   Although these formats are not identical, the ''implied'' CSS positioning has priority over that of the attribute at the same level. 
:*'''Attributes can ''sometimes'' have priority'''.  This can happen ''only'' if the attribute is at a table level that is ''closer'' to the text.  For example: if a table level ''CSS style'' sets text to be right-aligned, and a ''cell'' attribute centers it, the cell will have ''centered'' text while the rest of the table will be right-aligned.
:*'''A class declaration's CSS styles can be modified''' by in-line CSS styles at the appropriate level in the table, though attributes cannot override these. Attributes can of course apply to styles not specified by the class at all.   The nature of classes is described in the WikiBooks page [[Editing_Wikitext/Class_and_Style_Notes|'''Class and Style Notes''']]. 
 
If these priorities seem complicated, they are easier to understand in practice.  In the following table a number of text colors are applied at each of the table, row, and cell levels. To help understand the basic hierarchy, refer to the code module below while following these points. 
:*'''The default color''' for a table's text is ''black''.   ''This is not apparent from the code but is a consequence of the Wiki style sheet.''
:*'''A CSS class declaration''', &lt;nowiki&gt;''class=wikitable''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, applies various styles to the table all at once, including a ''gray'' background.  ''It also uses a black text color.'' 
:*'''A table style''' applies ''red'' text to the whole table.  ''Without other code, all text would be red''. 
:*'''A row style''' applies ''blue'' text to the second row and green to the third.  ''Because the rows have higher priority than the table, they change the text colors''.  
:*'''A cell style''' applies ''maroon'' text for two cells.  ''The cell levels have more priority than the table or row and can change certain parts even more''.
:*'''The closer the style is to the text''', the higher its priority in setting formats.  ''Further formats applied directly to the data with HTML tags or wikitext are also possible''.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
|3=&amp;nbsp;|trailer=This description of CSS priorities has been limited deliberately.   The setting of CSS priorities is complex and is determined by various factors.   The ''place'' that styles are written ''within'' the web page or its various style-sheets has an affect, the so-called ''source'' of the styles, and there is a hierarchy for these sources.   For example, ''user style-sheet important styles'' are set higher than any ''author styles''.   Additionally, ''within'' each collection of styles that exists from a certain source, there are further priorities set; these follow complex rules of precedence; (IDs higher than classes and classes higher than element styles, etc).   There is also a rule for duplicated styles that are in conflict, and at times, it is only the browser's work sequence that decides which of various similar styles is to be used.   An overview of how CSS priorities work for web pages is given in [[The CSS Cascade]].}}

{{Thetop|ha1=left|bd=mistyrose|1=&amp;nbsp;|2=&amp;nbsp;|3=&amp;nbsp;|leader=&lt;h2&gt;The Table Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
Tables coding needs a basic knowledge of the table spaces.

The table spaces are just the main table elements and the adjustable parts within it.  This short section explains the terminology of the table and gives some idea of the nature of its formatting.  

Refer to the drop-box ''The Table Design Spaces'' for the text.
{{dropimage|align=center|width=700px|cfs=1em|hfs=1.2em|hbgc=mistyrose|1=The Table Design Spaces|2=[[image:main table spaces.jpg|600px|center]]

&lt;big&gt;'''The Table Design Spaces'''&lt;/big&gt;
----
Tables have several spaces that require attention in design; in particular, margins, padding, and cell spaces. Refer to the graphic above and the descriptions below for their details.

 
*'''Margins''' set the space between the table and adjacent items on a page, and the four sides of a table can have different margins.   In fact, the margins can be made as negative values to cause tables to partially overlap.   In addition to margin, there are alignment attributes that can center a table or position it to the left or to the right (''&lt;nowiki&gt;align=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.), though this attribute lacks priority over a CSS style.   Margins are not shown on the above graphic, though the style rule for the table line takes this form:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;margin:10px 10px 20px 0px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
:This code applies table margins to all four sides at once.   The sequence of values corresponds to top, right, bottom, then left. This sequence is also used for padding. 


*'''Table padding''' describes an area just within the main table perimeter. (Table space A in the graphic).   It is used to improve the table's appearance when the contents look a bit cramped.   It too can be specified for all sides separately or together.   This property is set in the table line, but can be used only when cell spacing is not collapsed; spurious results are otherwise obtained.   The use of table padding is comparatively rare, unlike the similar property used at cell level.   Some browsers, for example Internet Explorer 6, will not render padding set in the table line at all, though both Opera and Firefox will do so.   Nonetheless, table padding uses this style:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:20px 10px 20px 10px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:This code applies table padding to all sides at once, in the sequence top, right, bottom, then left; it is applied as a ''uniform'' value by using only one figure.  This property affects only  the ''table'' padding when written in the table line.


*'''Cell spacing''' describes an area between all of the tables cell and perimeter borders. (Table space B in the graphic).   It is set independently of any outer table padding.   One value can set the spacing for all of the cells, and the horizontal and vertical spaces can be set separately. This CSS property works with the ''border-collapse'' property and the borders need to be set to ''separate'' for its use.   The style used in the table line for cell spacing is, for example:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:10px&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:''Another'' cellspacing method exists; there is an HTML attribute for ''cellspacing'', that can also set the spacing without the need for a CSS style.   There are times when it is useful and times when it is not.   Its simplicity makes it good for big tables where CSS styles would make for much work.   It applies only ''uniform'' spacing but that is often sufficient. It is not so useful when an HTML table is to go into some sort of template; it can prevent operation at such times.   The attribute applies ''uniform'' spacing in the table line with :
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;cellspacing=10px&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


*'''Cell padding''' describes the space around text in a cell and separates it from the cell border. (Table space C in the graphic). It has an identical code description to ''table padding'' except that it is written in the ''cell'' line.
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:10px 5px 10px 5px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:It ''cannot'' be written in a style within a ''row'', so when there is much custom padding to be done, any number of style statements for cells become necessary.

:There is an HTML attribute that can apply ''uniform padding'' to all of the cells at once, and it written in the ''table'' line.   It has the typical form:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;cellpadding=10px&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


*'''Table caption''' is a line of text that is placed by default above the table and is centered.   This text clearly comes ''inside'' the top margin, so needs to be considered in table layout.  There is a property to position a caption to any side of a table, but not all browsers can handle it.   In Wiki it has its own table element, '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|+&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', and the line is written immediately after the table line.   In HTML it is made by adding text between '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags, again as the second line of the table. 


*'''Borders''' are not strictly table spaces but in addition to their obvious purpose in setting off the various spaces, they are used for decoration in their own right.   Border CSS styles are set in the table line ''only'' for the table perimeter.   For ''cells'', they must be set for each cell.   There is also CSS coding to set each side differently.    

:There is also an HTML attribute for the table line to make simple ''uniform'' all-round borders, and it saves much work for large tables and for less demanding applications.   A typical style  and an attribute is shown below:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border:10px solid brown;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:The attribute is typically:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;border=1px&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

{{thetop|bd=oldlace|1=&amp;nbsp;|2=&amp;nbsp;|3=&amp;nbsp;|leader=&lt;h2&gt;Borders&lt;/h2&gt;Borders are used to set off the table from the other parts of the page, and are often used for decoration.

Borders can be set for the whole table at once,  or for any individual part of it.  The ''thickness'', ''style'', and ''color'' of these borders can all be specified, and there are even  rules for the four individual sides.

This section describes the various options available for making borders and attempts to introduce a few of the lesser known formats.   Refer to the drop-box ''Border Styles'' for a summary of border styles.

'''&lt;big&gt;Notes&lt;/big&gt;
:*'''Border styles''' can be set at ''table or cell level'', and will affect ''only that element''.
:*'''The above border samples''' are made with the supplied styles at ''cell level''.
:*'''Border attributes''' can be set only at ''table level'' and set ''borders everywhere''.
:*'''The borders attribute''' , set in the table line, is just ''&lt;nowiki&gt;border=1px&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.
:*'''Partial border''' styles might need other borders removed for a given effect.
::*''To remove a styled border'', enter ''&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border:none&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' at the same level.  
::*''To remove borders set by attributes'', enter ''&lt;nowiki&gt;border=0&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' in the table line.
::*''Removed borders can be restored in styles that follow the removal''.
:*'''Cell border styles''' superimpose on attribute set borders. 
:*'''For a table perimeter''', use one of the sample styles but in the table line. This perimeter uses:
::: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border:2px solid dimgray&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''
:*'''Borders for separate rows''' are not supported and cell borders must be applied needed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;}}

*'''The example below''' has various borders.   Initially, there are no ''all-round'' borders on this basic table.   An ''outer'' border is set for the table perimeter, and various borders are set for the ''bottom'' of the individual cells.   In addition, the background color of the whole table has been changed to ''lightyellow'', then the heading color changed after that to ''brown''.   The text color of the headings has been set to ''white'' to give better contrast against the new background.   Follow the details in the example below:

:*'''''Cell spacing'' refers to the space that surrounds each cell in a table. It is also called ''border spacing'' '''.
:*It can be made to be zero, but it is more often set to some practical value to space the cells apart, and to improve the layout.
:*Sometimes the borders can be made to ''overlap'' and this is called ''collapsed'' borders.   
:*At times the horizontal and vertical spacings can be made different.
:*There are ''two'' methods in use for spacing borders; the ''HTML attributes'' method and the ''CSS styles'' method.
:*Spacings can only be written into the ''table'' line.

{{hiddenh3|Use Attributes &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; Styles}}
:*'''Mixing style and attribute methods can cause confusion for borders and spacing'''.
:*'''Large tables are best used with HTML attributes''' since they reduce work.

{{hiddenh3|The HTML Attributes Method}}
:*'''This ''cellspacing'' method produces its best appearance for borders made with the ''border'' attribute.'''
:*In this method, applying a value for ''cellspacing'' separates the borders appropriately.   Setting a value of zero for these  ''thin'' internal borders gives a fairly similar result to the ''collapsed borders'' seen in CSS styles, and has a neat appearance for little effort.   If the cellspacing attribute is ''omitted altogether'' a small amount of spacing is nonetheless added.    
:*The borders made with the ''border'' attribute are compound.   That is, they are always made from two different colors.   In HTML the two colors can be specified, but in wikitext they cannot.   The default state sets a lighter color for the bottom and right borders, and the darker color for the left and top.
:*The borders made with attributes apply to the whole table, including the table perimeter.  When the value is varied, the ''outside'' perimeter changes but the ''inside'' borders retain a nominal value. 
:*When more elaborate borders are needed, the border ''styles'' must be used, and to space them the corresponding ''border-spacing'' properties are preferred. 

These are examples of the ''cellspacing'' attribute.

|3=&lt;big&gt;'''Cellspacing Attribute Notes'''&lt;/big&gt;

*The attribute ''cellspacing'' is simple to use.
*Use ''cellspacing'' for large tables to reduce work.
*If the ''cellspacing'' attribute is ''omitted'', a small default spacing is applied.
*The method ''nearly'' collapses attribute-set borders with ''cellspacing=0''. For truly ''collapsed'' borders, i.e., borders that are ''overlapped'',  use CSS styles. See below.
*Thin internal borders made with ''border=1'',nonetheless look reasonable with ''cellspacing=0'', especially when the alternative CSS method involves much work.
|trailer=&lt;br&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
{{Hiddenh3|Collapsed and Separate Borders with CSS}}
The following notes show the intention and appearance of both ''collapsed'' and ''separate'' borders. 

*'''CSS border spacing''' is intended for use with borders made with CSS styles, not ''attributes''.
*'''Collapsed borders are intended to overlap''' and are made by setting ''collapse'' for the ''border-collapse'' property, regardless of ''border-spacing''.
*'''Separated borders do not overlap''' and are made by setting ''separate'' for the ''border-collapse'' property, and by setting an exact amount of ''border-spacing''.
*'''Borders side-by-side''', are made using ''separate'' borders with ''spacing'' set to zero. 
*'''Table-level padding''' can be used only when borders are ''separated''. When they are ''implied as separated by default'', (when cellspacing amount is not given), or when the borders are ''collapsed'', the results will be spurious.
*'''The following formats are however, reliable.'''

&lt;u&gt;'''Collapsed Borders'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Separated Borders'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

|  style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|Text for cell one
|  style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|Text for cell two
|}   
&lt;/pre&gt;


{{hiddenh4|Collapsed Borders in Detail}}
----
Collapsed borders can use ''either'' of these coding forms: 
{{block|ta=left|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
or;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:50px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Both formats give results as follows:


&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:50px;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Collapsed regardless of spacing&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid brown;&quot;&gt;When the borders are '''collapsed''' they will &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; overlap.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid salmon;&quot;&gt;This happens &lt;u&gt;regardless&lt;/u&gt; of any '''border-spacing''' that is set.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


The same example using ''thin'' borders looks like this:

&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:50px;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Collapsed regardless of spacing&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;When the borders are '''collapsed''' they will &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; overlap.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;This happens &lt;u&gt;regardless&lt;/u&gt; of any '''border-spacing''' that is set.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



{{Hiddenh4|Separated Borders in Detail}}
----
Separated borders can have ''uniform'' or ''non-uniform'' spacing: 
{{block|ta=left|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separate; border-spacing:7px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;or:&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separate; border-spacing:7px 14px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

In the first coding form, there is ''uniform'' border spacing given by the single figure. In the second form the two figures produce '''horizontal''' and '''vertical''' spacings respectively.   The ''non-uniform'' results are as follows:


&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:7px 14px;border:1px solid gray;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Separated &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; Exact Spacing&lt;/caption&gt;  
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid brown;&quot;&gt;;'''Separated''' borders &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; overlap, and are distinct.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid salmon;&quot;&gt;'''Border-spacing''' can be set for both the horizontal and the vertical.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


The same example using ''thin'' borders looks like this:

&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:7px 14px;border:1px solid gray;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Separated &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; Exact Spacing&lt;/caption&gt;  
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;'''Separated''' borders &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; overlap, and are distinct.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;'''Border-spacing''' can be set for both the horizontal and the vertical.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


{{hiddenh4|Separated with Border-spacing Zero}}
----
The separated borders state can place borders side-by-side by setting the spacing to zero.  For completion these cases for thick and thin borders are shown:


&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;border:1px solid gray;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Separated with Border-spacing Zero&lt;/caption&gt;  
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid brown;&quot;&gt;'''Separated''' borders &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; overlap, and are distinct.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid salmon;&quot;&gt;'''Spacing''' has vanished.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


The same example using ''thin'' borders looks like this:

&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;border:1px solid gray;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Separated with Border-spacing Zero&lt;/caption&gt;  
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;'''Double thickness''' is noted for the ''inside'' borders.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;'''Best use ''Collapsed''''' for these.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

{{hiddenh3|Spacing with the HTML attribute}}
Borders made with the ''border attribute'' should use the ''cellspacing attribute'' to collapse or space its borders.   Similarly, CSS spacing should be used with borders made with CSS.
Confusion can arise in attempting to integrate these two methods.

'''Problems''' sometimes occur with the cellspacing ''attribute''.   For example, when a table is to be displayed as the ''parameter of a template'', the template is likely to fail.   To avoid it, the table should be made in HTML, the cellspacing attribute should be removed, and the CSS styles  should be used instead.  In addition, wikitext should be changed to HTML.   At other times the attribute form can be useful since it gives a good effect for little coding work.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

{{thetop|w1=33%|bd=linen|w2=33%|w3=33%|leader=&lt;h2&gt;Cell Padding&lt;/h2&gt;
:*'''Cell padding''' refers to the space that surrounds the text in a cell. It can also be applied to a table, to pad the space just inside its perimeter.
:*'''Padding''' is maintained even when the cell width changes.
:*'''Single words''' of text are usually handled with alignment rather than padding.   
:*'''All four sides''' of a cell can be padded differently.
:*'''Table padding''' can be applied in ''some'' browsers provided that the borders are not collapsed.
:*'''There are ''two'' methods''' for padding; the ''HTML attributes'' method and the ''CSS styles'' method.
:*'''Attributes are written''' in the table line, and the CSS styles are written in the cell or the table line, depending on the formatting intention.

{{hiddenh3|Use Attributes and Styles}}
:*'''Cell styles and the table attribute ''cellpadding''''' can be used together in the same table without confusion.
:*'''Uniform cell padding''' for cells uses the HTML attribute ''cellpadding'' in the table line.
:*'''Non-uniform padding''' for cells uses styles in the cell lines.
:*'''Table padding''' of any kind needs a style in the table line, but can only be used without difficulty when the borders are ''separated''.  Some browsers, for example Internet Explorer 6, will not render padding set in the table line at all, though both Opera and Firefox will do so.   

{{hiddenh3|The HTML Attributes Method}}

These are examples of the ''cellpadding'' attribute.
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| width=100% border=1 cellpadding=15px  
|+ Uniform: ''Cellpadding=15px''

|}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|1=&lt;table width=100% border=1&gt;  
&lt;caption&gt;''Cellpadding'' omitted&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;td width=50% &gt;This is an example without cell padding.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% &gt;The text is placed hard against the cell borders.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|2=&lt;table width=100% border=1 cellpadding=15px&gt;  
&lt;caption&gt;Uniform: ''Cellpadding=15px''&lt;/caption&gt;

{{Hiddenh3|Cell Padding and Table Padding with CSS}}
The following notes show the coding for the two methods. 

{{hiddenh3|Where to Place the Code}} 

&lt;u&gt;'''Cell Padding'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{|  border=1

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Table Padding''', (some browsers).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;

|}   
&lt;/pre&gt;


{{hiddenh4|Cell Padding in Detail}}
----
Cell padding and for that matter, table padding too, can be specified in one of three ways:
:*'''When a single value is quoted''' it refers to ''uniform'' padding; the same on each side.
:*'''When two values are quoted''', the first sets the ''left'' and ''right'', and the second sets the ''top'' and ''bottom''.
:*'''When all four values are quoted''', they apply in the order ''top'', ''right'', ''bottom'', and ''left''.   The style expression can be one of these three: 
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
or;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:5px 10px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
or;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:5px 10px 15px 8px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
These formats have a similar behaviour to the attribute version apart from their ability to set ''non-uniform'' padding.

When an attribute is set for cellpadding, a style within a cell or in the table line will have priority.   In this way the general padding can be set by an attribute and the variations from it by cell styles. 


{{Hiddenh4|Table Padding}}
----
Table padding uses the same CSS style as for cell padding except that it is placed in the table line.   The main difference is that the borders must be separated for its use.   Some browsers, for example Internet Explorer 6, will not render padding set in the table line at all, though both Opera and Firefox will do so.  The following style sets table padding: 
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separated; border-spacing:7px;padding:20px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

The table ''without'' table padding is shown in the first example, and ''with'' table padding in the second.   Notice that table padding exists in addition to any cell spacing near the perimeter.

&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:7px;border:1px solid gray;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; Without table padding&lt;/caption&gt;  
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid brown;&quot;&gt;'''No table padding'''.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid salmon;&quot;&gt;'''No table padding'''.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table align=center width=70% style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:7px;border:1px solid gray;padding:20px;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;caption&gt; With table padding&lt;/caption&gt;  
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid brown;&quot;&gt;'''With table padding'''.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=50% style=&quot;padding:15px;border:10px solid salmon;&quot;&gt;'''With table padding'''.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

where ''background'' is the background color of the element and ''color'' is the color of text.

These colors can be set in any of the table, row, or cell elements, and follow the usual CSS style priorities discussed previously. 

There are at least three ways to specify a color:
:*Use the color name, for example; red, blue, mistyrose, etc.
:*Use the RGB value for the color; for example; RGB(140,100,65).
:*Use the HEX notation for the color; for example, (includes the semi-colon); &lt;nowiki&gt;#f8a4c8;&lt;/nowiki&gt;      

To further emphasise the point, the following three style expressions for black text on a beige-like background are equivalent:
{{block|ff='Courier New', Courier, monospace|fs=1.1em|ta=left|background=whitesmoke|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:Linen;color:black&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;or;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:rgb(250,240,230);color:rgb(0,0,0)&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;or;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:#faf0e6;;color:#000000;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note that the use of the HEX notation has a trailing semi-colon.   Since a semi-colon is also used as a separator for style rules, it is entirely likely that two semi-colons will appear in code together.   Neither of these should be omitted.

Tables that have the same number of columns in each row, and for the sake of argument, the same number of rows in each column, are referred to as ''uniform tables''. However, ''non-uniform'' tables can be made by merging cells, that is referred to in wikitext and HTML as ''spanning''.

There are ''three'' distinct behaviours for tables when content is added to the cells; this assumes that there is more that a few characters.

*The ''first'' case is the most common; that is, for ''unformatted text''.  That is, text that depends on the software to wrap its lines.

*The ''second'' kind of behaviour is for ''pre-formatted'' text within  pre-formatting tags, or the addition of ''box-like structures'', such as other ''tables'' or ''images''.   This second set is characterised as having ''default widths'' or ''assigned widths'' of their own.

*The ''third'' kind of table content is a very long character string without spaces in it, of the kind sometimes seen in program listings.

These three cases are explained in more detail below.             

{{hiddenh3|Unformatted Text Behaviour}}
Consider the case of unformatted text.   When the ''width'' settings of a table and its cells are not set in code , the text added to cells causes the cells and table to expand to the full width of the page before any text wrapping takes place.   In the absence of width settings a full-width table might be produced.

When the width of a table and the widths of its cells are fully specified, the cell text will start to wrap when the text of individual cells reaches their cell borders.   Then, at some stage with increasing text, the cell will extend downward, while maintaining its width setting.   This behaviour is apparent even when the height of cells has been specified.

{{hiddenh3|Formatted Text and Boxes}}
Consider the case where the cell contents have either a default width or a preset width of their own.   Let us assume that the content is to be an image.   ''Whether or not'' the widths of the cells are set in code, the image ''will expand the cell'' to accommodate itself.   If the ''table'' width was set then the other cells might even be narrowed or extended in height to maintain the intended table width and its contents.   When the table width ''cannot'' be maintained in this way, the table is extended, perhaps beyond the right margins of the page.   This behaviour is often seen for text in pre-formatted text tags.   To avoid these problems simply ''limit the content's width'', within its own coding.     

{{hiddenh3|Long Text Strings without Spacing}}
Table cells often contain code listings as text so that users can see how code is written.  Some of these code lines are quite long and ordinarily would be wrapped in the width set for the table.   However, because ''unspaced text is treated as a singe word'', the table cannot break it in the middle for wrapping.   In this case the table is extended, regardless of the width settings. This lack of wrapping can be a puzzle elsewhere, even where long-line wrapping has been planned.   The problem is avoided by placing an adequate number of spaces in long text strings.  For example, a CSS style expression allows spaces at many points, provided that they are not placed immediately ''before'' either a semi-colon or a full-colon.          

{{hiddenh3|Relative Width Example}}
*'''Width''' uses ''absolute'' units like pixels, or ''relative'' units like ''percentage''.
*'''Relative units''' are useful since the page width need not be known.
*'''Relative width''' relates to a percentage of the ''page's width'' in the case of a table, or to the ''table'' if the width setting is for a cell.
*'''Height''' need ''never'' really be fixed, though it sometimes helps to give some minimum height to the work.   


A table set with ''relative widths'' can be seen below.   The table is set to occupy ''half of the  page width'', (''&lt;nowiki&gt;width=50%&lt;/nowiki&gt;''),  and the two leftmost columns are each to take up twenty-five percent of ''that''.   Note that the cell widths are to become twenty-five percent of whatever width is given to the table, and that neither the width of the page nor the eventual width of the table need ever be known.   The image uses its own dimensions to  occupy the remaining width and is also centered with its own code.   Notice that although both rows have been specified to have the same height, the image has made the top row deeper. Advantage is also taken of this layout to show the basic horizontal and vertical text alignments.

{{thetop|bd=papayawhip|leader=&lt;h2&gt;Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Table Alignment}}
Tables can be aligned ''horizontally'' on the page with the ''HTML attribute 'align' '', with the ''CSS style 'float' '', and with the ''CSS style 'margin'''.   In each case these style-rules are placed in the table line.   The crude ''vertical'' alignment of tables is accomplished by the use of the text line break, while fine adjustments can be made with CSS margin styles.

*'''The HTML attribute method''' makes use of the ''align'' attribute in the table line to position the table at ''left'', ''center'', or ''right'' of the available space, and examples of its use can be seen in table code throughout this  page.   The only point to note is that for the centering of tables, margin ''CSS styles'' in the same table line will take priority over ''align''.  Top and bottom margins will not cause problems but the use of left or right margins will. Text can float around such a table with the exception of the centered case. 
*'''The CSS style 'float' ''' cannot place a table in the center of the available space but is limited to ''left'' and ''right''.   It has the advantage that text can float around the table.
*'''The CSS style 'margin' is best''' and by its settings can place a table anywhere in the horizontal alignment.   When the ''margin'' property is set to  ''auto'' the table is placed at the center of the horizontal containing space.   The same result can be obtained with the judicious use of relative measurements(%).   The extent to which text floats around a table positioned with ''margin'' depends on how much space remains.

See the examples in the drop-box below.
{{dropimage|align=center|hbgc=papayawhip|1=Table Alignment|2=&lt;table width=700px&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''Table Alignment Examples'''&lt;br&gt;In the examples that follow you should regard the positions assumed by the tables in the drop-box's width as representing the way that they would be seen on the usual Wiki page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''This first table uses only attributes''' to set the width and to position the table at the center of the page.   
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1 align=center width=70% style=&quot;background:papayawhip;&quot;
|+ Centered and sized with attributes

&lt;caption&gt; Centered and sized with attributes&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Table Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


'''The second table centers a table using the ''auto'' value of the CSS ''margin'' property'''.   When combined with relative measure for the width of the table, there is reasonable adjustment for changed screen sizes.   Because it is centered, any adjacent text must follow-on and cannot wrap.  The table and margins occupy the whole width of the table's container, and with this method the top and bottom margins become zero. 
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1 style=&quot;width:70%; margin:auto;background:lightgrey;&quot;
|+ Centered using the ''auto'' value of the CSS property ''margin''.

&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;width:70%; margin:auto;background:lightgrey;&quot;&gt;

&lt;td&gt; Table Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


'''The third table simulates a centered table for any screen width''', but like all centered tables is suitable only for follow-on text. The table and margins occupy the whole width of the table's container. 
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1 style=&quot;width:70%; margin:0 15% 0 15%;background:mistyrose;&quot;

&lt;caption&gt;Centered using relative width and margin CSS styles&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Table Text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;br clear=all&gt;
'''The fourth table places the table at the right of the page''' and sizes it using CSS styles 'width' and 'float'.
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1 style=&quot;width:70%;float:right;background:lightyellow;&quot;
|+ Floated right using 'float'

&lt;br clear=all&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt; 


{{hiddenh3|Content Alignment}}
As is the case for most table styling, there are two main methods; ''HTML attributes'' and ''CSS styles''.

:*'''All ''text'' can be positioned using attributes'''. ''See the table below for the examples''.
:*'''The ''vertical positioning'' of images''' and other box-shapes needs the style property ''vertical-align'', with ''horizontal'' positioning using their own coding. 

'''The attribute alignment summary is as follows:'''
:*'''Align''' sets the horizontal alignment of text.   It has values of ''left'', ''center'', or ''right''. For example ''align=center'' to center text (or a table).
:*'''Valign''' sets the vertical alignment of text.   It has values of ''top'', ''middle'', and ''bottom''.   There is no equivalent use in the table line.
:*'''Vertical alignment of text''' uses ''valign'' at cell level, or the CSS property ''vertical-align''.
:*'''Vertical alignment of images and nested tables''' uses only the CSS property ''vertical-align'' at cell level.
:*'''Images and nested tables''' set their horizontal alignments ''within their own coding''.
:*'''Vertical alignment''' cannot be set at table level.

The following tables show the styles to use for a given effect and in particular the use of the HTML attributes ''align'' and ''valign''.   In addition, the vertical alignment of images and nested tables is shown in the code block and table that follows.

{{thetop|bd=oldlace|leader=&lt;h2&gt;Sorting and Hiding &lt;/h2&gt;
Tables can be made so that when displayed on the page, clicking a link will sort the table.   Clicking it again will sort it in the opposite direction.   Each column is given a sorting link, so sorting can be done on any column.   The method allows the user to view the data from different viewpoints.  

Tables can also hide their contents.   These tables are called ''collapsible''.   Collapsible tables resemble a simple box in the ''collapsed'' state; then, when the box is clicked with the mouse, the table reverts to the ''expanded'' state, and is revealed.   The link has a toggle action; clicking the link again hides the contents.   Such tables help to unclutter the page, and so avoid distraction from the main themes.   They are of particular use for supplementary information.

{{Hiddenh3|Sortable Tables}}
In its simplest form, adding the class declaration ''&lt;nowiki&gt;class=&quot;sortable&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' to the table line of any table makes a sortable table, regardless of other classes and styles applied.
The following code illustrates the method, and the result is shown below.
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| class=&quot;sortable&quot; border=1 cellpadding=5px
! One!!Two!!Three!!Four
|-
| M||A||K||E
|-
| E||N||D||S
|-
| M||E||E||T
|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt; }}
Click the links in this resulting table to see how sorting works:

&lt;table class=&quot;sortable&quot; border=1 cellpadding=5px&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;One&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Two&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Three&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Four&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;M&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;M&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;    
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
For a more extensive treatment of this topic, readers should go to the Wikimedia site [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Sorting '''Help:Sorting''']. 

{{Hiddenh3|Collapsible Tables}}
The code for a collapsible table much resembles the code for an ordinary table, with the addition of a class declaration.   (Some Internet Explorer browsers experience faulty links).

This is also a good example of how to declare multiple classes.   The basic shell coding for a collapsible table and the result can be been below.
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;poem style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:1.1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| class=&quot;wikitable collapsible&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot;
! Click Here for Contents
|-
| This contains the hidden content.
|}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The result is:
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable collapsible&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Click Here for Contents&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;This contains the hidden content.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Whether or not the ''wikitable'' class is included, the purple heading is a default feature. HTML attributes and CSS styles can however, be applied to the heading as with all other parts.

'''When the ''width'' attribute is used''', the expanded width and the initial width will be the same and fixed by it.   In this condition, ''unformatted'' text will wrap in the set width.   ''Preformatted'' text will extend the box to the length of its longest line.   Box structures such as HTML tables and images will expand the drop to the enclosures' width.

If the intention is to display ''unformatted'' text but to have an ''initial'' box width that is narrower than the ''open'' box width, then the displayed contents should be placed within a nested table cell of its own, and that table set to the required ''open'' width setting.   Note also that the default text alignment for this collapsible table is ''center''.      

'''When the ''width'' attribute is ommitted''', the initial width is set by the width of the heading text. In this condition, ''unformatted'' text will expand the box to the available width of the page, and   ''Preformatted'' text will extend the box to the length of its longest line.   Box structures such as HTML tables and images as always will expand the drop to the enclosures' width. 

'''An alternative to making your own collapsible table''' can be had using the template [[template:Dropimage|'''Dropimage''']].   This template has a comprehensive set of options, including the options to change an entire style expression, and class.   It is based on the ''Collapsible'' class.   The result of using ''Dropimage'' can be seen by reviewing the effects of the drop-boxes on this page.   Readers who need more information on collapsible tables, and in particular for information on combining sortable and collapsible tables, should go to the Wikimedia site for [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Collapsing '''Collapsible Tables'''].|1=&amp;nbsp;|2=&amp;nbsp;|3=&amp;nbsp;}}

This is a Strengthen/Weaken question.

READ 
This passage introduces[[w:en:Synesthesia|synesthesiacs]] who defies the traditional notion of senses. 
 
ANALYZE 

(A) '''Correct''' If this is true, the synesthesiacs' response that suggest their ability to transcend the usual boundaries is no longer reliable.  Because they cannot express what they are sensing, we cannot base our conclusion on their reponses.

(B) Incorrect. The existence of the sixth sense is irrelevant. The passage concerns with the five senses known and how those of the synesthesiacs differ from those of normal people. 

(C) Incorrect. Whether their experiences form a pattern or not does not matter. 

(D) Incorrect. This may in fact strengthen the argument by providing some historical basis for synesthesia.

(E) Incorrect. Some side fact that do not really impact the argument. 

CHOOSE

Response (A) weakens the argument by invalidating the synesthesiacs responses.

READ

The author is trying to lead us to believe that the difference in the lense resolutions don't matter.

ANALYZE

To find the answer, it is helpful to negate each choice and see whether it negatively impacts the argument.
(A)Incorrect. The definition does not really matter.

(B)Correct. This must be assumed. If this is not assumed, then the difference in resolution does matter since it determines the deficiencies of available film. We would need to worry about the resolution of the lenses when we buy a camera.

(C)Incorrect. Even if this is not true, the effect will be uniform on all the films.  It does not   weaken the argument.  

(D)Incorrect. So what? Photographic technique is outside the scope.

(E)Incorrect. Only is the key here. Even if there are many important factors beside these two, the argument may still make sense. Why?  Because those other factors may be same for all cameras and films so they are constant (fixed). 

CHOOSE
(B) is the best answer.

==Section II Logical Reasoning==
===Question 1===
IDENTIFY

This is a Conclusion question.
* [[w:en:Labour productivity|Labor productivity]]

READ

The economist discusses how efforts to increase productivity can be counterproductive.  He says &quot;But not all efforts to increase productivity are beneficial to the business as a whole.&quot;  

ANALYZE

(A) Incorrect. This response goes too far. It sounds quite ambitious and makes an unwarranted claim that the action cannot be good for the business.

(B) '''Correct.''' Good because the passage supports this claim.  Some measures, as mentioned in the passage, are decreasing the number of employees.  It fails to benefit the business beccause it affects the morale.

(C) Incorrect. Nothing in the passage discusses the ownership issue. This is certainly plausible but not supported by the passage at all.  Watch out for this kind of sound-good responses.

(D) Incorrect. This is a sweeping claim and not supported by the passage. This claim sounds not right because not all businesses try to boost productivity as in the communist countries.

(E) Incorrect. This is one of the premises but not the main conclusion. The economist uses this fact as the evidence to conclude what was said in response (B).

CHOOSE

This is an easy question to start with.  Choose (B) and move on.

===Question 2===
IDENTIFY

This is a Parallel reasoning question. The question discusses the types of dog so it helps a bit if you are familiar with them.  They also appeared in the logic games section so review them.  The question is lengthy but not very challenging.
* [[w:en:Labrador Retriever|Labrador Retriever]]
* [[w:en:St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]]
* [[w:en:dog|dog]]

READ

The passage introduces a logic. While reading and understanding the logical structure, identify the flaw.

ANALYZE

 All L bark a lot.
 All S bark little.
 R are L + S.
 Therefore, R bark moderately.
The flaw is that 1 plus 0 is not necessarily 0.5. 

CHOOSE

(A) Incorrect. This one is flawed but does not parallel the relationship mentioned in question 2. Why? Because in the passage, R is a mix between L and S, meaning that R is produced by physically integrating two different things.  Moreover, the second sentence says &quot;some student&quot; instead of &quot;all&quot;.  Jane is not. If this choice to be true, it has to be like this.

 All students in the Dumbledore clan make good grades.  
 All students in the Gaunt clan make poor grades.  
 Jane's father is from Dumbledore's and mother is from Gaunt's.  
 Therefore, Jane makes somewhat good grades.

(B) '''Correct.''' This response parallels the stated relationship well.

(C) Incorrect. The conclusion is different. While Rosa's dogs have the averaged attribute of the two, the Perry family have both without compromise.  If this choice were to become true, it has to be like this:

 All students at Hanson School live in Green County.
 All students at Edwards School live in Winn Country.
 The joint summer program of Hanson and Edwards Schools draw an equal number of students from two schools only.
 Perry who is in the summer program live in Gwrienn Country which is between Green and Winn Country.

This passage is still not as strong as the response (B) however.

(D) Incorrect. Bob is a member of both distinct groups- transcriptionists and engineers. Bob's skills are not diminished by his dual membership as it was the case for barking.  Transcription and engineering do not have the opposite relationship as is in barking frequently and infrequently.

(E) Incorrect. Wrong. Below is an improved version.

 All of Kenisha's dresses are very well made. 
 All of Connie's dresses are very badly made. 
 Conisha's dresses, which copied the style of Kenisha's and Connie's 
 and made of the exact same fabrics as those two, are of average quality.

===Question 3===
IDENTIFY

This is a Conclusion question.

READ

Remember the [[w:en:Millennium|millennium]]?  This discusses the people's attitude towar the century's end.

ANALYZE

Draw a conclusion that best conmpletes the passage.  The passage introduces an analogy that people near the end of their life often spend time looking back on the old events. Then it suggests that it would be similar- &quot;century ... is like a life&quot; from the century's end.

CHOOSE
(A) Incorrect. Consider this analogy- Century : Life :: end of century : end of life. If you further extend this analogy it becomes- end of life : look back on the events of their lives :: end of century : look back on the events of the century.

(B) Incorrect. Nowhere it is implied that they fear something.

(C) Incorrect. Some attractive but remember the passage did not say that people look foward to what the afterlife will bring when they die.

'''(D) Correct.''' Bingo. It fits perfectly with the analogy.

(E) Incorrect. This is too specific.

===Question 4===
* [http://www.consumerreports.org Consumer Report]

(Stim Breakdown) One report implies that Company A meals are without nutritional value.  But the report given by company B, company A's biggest competitor approved the report.  Because of the obvious biasness Company A meals are not really nutritous.

(Explanation) The apparent flaw in this argument is that the author assumes that just because of the bias nature of the situation then obviously the polar opposite is true - un-nutritional to nutritional.  You can not assume this to be true because their is a possibility that it is un nutritous.  Also the author cant base his argument solely on the representation of Company B's obvious bias motivation. Therefore, the correct answer is '''A'''

===Question 5===
* [[w:en:global warming|global warming]]

Conclusion from stimulus: GW is primarily the result of minor gases.
Cause: Minor gases 
Effect: Global warming

Which answer choice WEAKENS the scientist?

A) The stimulus does not mention industrial pollution as the cause of minor gas build-up.

B) CORRECT This answer negates the causation, because the effect (warming) preceded the presumed cause (minor gas build-up)

C) Certain years warmer than others does not affect the causation.  It does not state that the sun's effect was any different than past centuries.

D) Volcanic dust reflecting warmth does not deal with either cause or effect.

E) This actually supports the conclusion.

===Question 6===

This is an Assumption question, which asks which answer choice is sufficient enough to make the conclusion valid.

Premise 1: Undergrad degree AND no felony conviction are required to be on the executive board.

EB --&gt; UG + &lt;s&gt;felony&lt;/s&gt;

Premise 2: Murray has degree but he has a conviction.

Conclusion: Murray can NOT be an Executive Administrator.

ANALYSIS: The premises involve a jump in logic, they describe the requirements for the Executive Board, but NOT for the position of Executive Administrator.  The correct answer choice will remedy this jump.

A) Discusses requirements for the Board, not Exec Administrator.

B)CORRECT This applies the criteria for the EB to the position of EA, which disqualifies poor Murray and makes the conclusion valid.

     EB --&gt; UG + &lt;s&gt;felony&lt;/s&gt;      Contrapositive: felony or &lt;s&gt;UG&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; &lt;s&gt;EB&lt;/s&gt;
     EA --&gt; EB                     Contrapositive: &lt;s&gt;EB&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; &lt;s&gt;EA&lt;/s&gt;
     M --&gt; felony

     Therefore: M --&gt; felony --&gt; &lt;s&gt;EB&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; &lt;s&gt;EA&lt;/s&gt;

C) This does not apply to Murray, he has an UG degree.

D) Does not make conclusion valid.

   &lt;s&gt;felony&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; eligible for EA
   
E) This does not address the assumption needed.

===Question 7===
[[w:en:ethics|ethics]]

Advanced Moral Motivation (AMM) --&gt; abstract principles (AP) + &lt;s&gt;calculated self-interest (CSI)&lt;/s&gt; + &lt;s&gt;social norms (SM)&lt;/s&gt;

Contrapositive: &lt;s&gt; AP&lt;/s&gt; or CSI or SM --&gt; &lt;s&gt;AMM&lt;/s&gt;

Which person shows advanced moral motivation?

A) Bobby adhered to social norms.

B) Wes is self-interested.

C) Donna is self-interested.

D) CORRECT Jadine has principles and no CSI or SM.

E) Leigh is conforming to social norms.

===Question 8===
[[w:en:electric car|electric car]]

Must Be True question.

Proponents: When tech problems are gone, electric cars will be popular and will halt all environmental impact by cars.

Author: Electric power sources will produce considerable environmental damage.

A) CORRECT Impact '''may''' be greater than proponents believe.  Low threshold for this to be true, supported by the passage.

B) Not supported by passage, author is discussing environmental impact, NOT popularity.

C) Not supported by passage, the author is not discussing this.

D) Not supported by passage, author does not provide premises to support such a strong conclusion.

E) Not supported by passage, author does not provide premises to support such a strong conclusion.

===Question 9===
[[w:en:video game|video game]]

Premise 1: Video game sales have gone up in last 3 years.

Premise 2: Since the dawn of time, 13-16 year-olds have purchased 75% of games.

Premise 3: 13-16 demographic will shrink in next 10 years.

Conclusion: Video game sales will NOT continue to increase.

Which answer choice weakens conclusion?

A) Strengthens 

B) Rentals are not relevant to discussion.

C) Unrelated to the topic, and strengthens the conclusion.

D) No impact on conclusion

E) CORRECT This qualifies premise 2 and presents new information that may suggest that the increase was from people over 16 purchasing video games.

===Question 10===
[[w:en:Blind experiment|blind experiment]]

Conclusion? It is in the first sentence, all other statements support this conclusion.

B) CORRECT

===Question 11===

Role question.

Quote provides an example of change that did not negatively impact the human minds.

Correct: C

===Question 12===

Parallel Question

Principle A: Keep a promise
Principle B: Answer questions truthfully

Mantra: Principle A and Principle B are both expected, but you can not do one without violating the other.

A)CORRECT
   Principle A: say whatever we want
   Principle B: be civil
   You can not do one without violating the other.

B) No two principles

C) Two options, each with undesirable consequences. These are not conflicting principles.

D) Two if/then statements, no principles in conflict.

E) Describes considerations when extending business hours.  They come to a conclusion, not an irreconcilable impasse. 

===Question 13===

Assumption question: Answer needs to be '''necessary''' to make conclusion valid.

Premise 1: Aluminum soft-drinks all have same amount of aluminum.

Premise 2: 50% of Al in M came from L

Premise 3: All of L was recycled into M

Premise 4: Basically nothing but Al in cans

Conclusion: M has twice as many cans as L

Look for answer choices where if you negate it, the conclusion is no longer valid.

A) Negation does not impact the conclusion. (M can be recycled more does not negate conclusion)

B) Negation does not impact the conclusion. (Recycled Al is higher quality does not negate conclusion)

C) CORRECT Premise: All Al is recovered in recycling.  If this was negated, the conclusion would be false.
   Ex. if L had 100 cans, but only 20% could be recovered, then M would have 40 cans. This negates the conclusion.

D) Negation does not impact the conclusion. (All of group L comes from recycled cans does not negate conclusion)

E) Negation does not impact the conclusion. (Al cans are harder to recycle does not negate the conclusion)

===Question 14===

===Question 15===

Assumption: This answer needs to be '''sufficient''' to make the conclusion true.

Premise 1: High risk = 65+ or chronic disease

Premise 2: Each year vaccine is ONLY against flu strain expected to be most prevalent

Conclusion: Every year high risk people get vaccinated against a different flu strain.

The missing information is why is it for a different flu strain? Premises only support the one most expected to be prevalent.

A) high risk category does not satisfy the gap in reasoning

B) likelihood of epidemic does not fill the gap in reasoning.

C) the limits of the vaccine does not fill the gap in reasoning.

D) CORRECT This answer choice fills the logical gap and necessitates that each vaccine is DIFFERENT.

E) side effects are irrelevant to the passage.

===Question 16===

Taylor: exact claims could NEVER be established by science

Sandra: some science can achieve precise results

Correct: D

===Question 17===

Stimulus: Computer experts said the MOST significant threat (of any possible threat, even nuclear meltdown, famine, invasion by a rat army) is unauthorized access to confidential data.

Computer experts are not qualified to determine the MOST significant threat of all potential threats in the universe.

This is why their expertise is not broad enough to support the claim.

Correct: B

===Question 18===
Argument claims that there is nothing that brings more recognition to modern science than to overthrow conventional wisdom to scientists. We know that scientists are thus skeptical of the theory behind global warming; why? Well because they want some kind of recognition. 

(B) Their motivation is recognition. Thus, they want to find some kind of evidence that overthrows global warming hypothesis.

===Question 19===


===Question 20===

Describe

Munoz: SW Hopeville Neighbors Association oppose water system, therefore the whole town doesn't want it.

Gamba: Only 25 people were in that vote, and 15 opposed vs 10 support.  We shouldn't base the whole town's opinion on that.

Gamba's argument attempts to cast doubt on Munoz's evidence.

E) Correct

===Question 21===

Friends tell driver he may wreck his sports car because he drives recklessly. Driver reads report that minivans have lower accident rates.  Driver thinks he may trade in his sports car for a minivan to minimize risk of accident.

What is the flaw?

A) CORRECT Correlation does not equal causation. If driver still drives like an asshole, having a minivan probably won't change his risk of accident. 

B) We don't know the sample size and thus can't pass judgement on sample size.

C) Driver doesn't make this mistake, he consistently refers to his &quot;risk&quot; and not in absolutes.

D) There are no necessary/sufficient conditions discussed, only a correlation and causation.

E) We don't know about the sources.

===Question 22===

Causes: News doesn't cover local politics AND local politics is secretive

Effect: Reduce the chance an act of participation will get a positive official response.

Which is most true?

A) Only addresses one of the causes.

B) Author did not present their opinion.

C) We don't know if it's the most important factor

D) CORRECT This would eliminate AL LEAST ONE cause.

E) This reverses cause and effect.

===Question 23===

Assumption Question: Which answer is '''sufficient''' to allow the conclusion to be true.

Premise 1 Increase well-being --&gt; Morally right

Premise 2 Decrease well-being --&gt; Morally wrong

Conclusion: Unchanged well-being --&gt; Morally right

We can recognize the jump in logic, because premise 1 said only that which increases well-being is morally right.  The answer needs to expand the definition of morally right actions.

A) Does not expand morally right

B) This excludes the possibility that things can be neutral.  Does not expand morally right.

C) CORRECT This creates a condition that expands what is &quot;morally right&quot; and allows the conclusion to be correctly drawn.

D) Does not expand morally right

E) Does not help reconcile the jump in logic

The experimental (unscored) section appeared in the same place for nearly all test takers. Section 3 was experimental on most forms, but Section 2 was experimental on some. The June LSAT had a total of 100 scored questions— 23 in Games, 25 in each Arguments section, and 27 in Reading Comprehension. 

Games - 23 questions  
Overall, test takers rated the June Games section as similar in difficulty to the December 2006 Games section. Most test takers classified the first game as easy and the next three as medium. Though there was no killer game, figuring out the best setup took time on several of the games. 

Passage  Topic Test Takers' Rankings 
Passage One  Arts/Humanities  easy  
Passage Two  Science (Comparative) medium  
Passage Three  Law medium-difficult  
Passage Four  Social Science  medium-difficult

The book of Phaedrus, by Plato. Recites a conversation between Phaedrus and Socrates on a walk outside of town. Phaedrus outlines his position on the concept of love and relationships in ancient Athens. Homosexuality is used to describe the relationship between the lover and beloved. Socrates argues as to whether the lover or the beloved is the more fulfilling side of the relationship.

The art of Plato is such that the intricate cohesion of word and action reveals itself through many layers. Plato writes; and as a writer he has the time and the means (written letters) to compose. But what is Socrates doing? He does not have the leisure to compose over a long period of time. He is responding to particular individuals, in particular circumstances, in the moment. He is thinking on his feet. One might claim that this is actually the first deficiency of the dialogues, that they are artificial and unrealistic in this way. If the written text reveals itself as finely crafted in the subtlety of its inner connections, how seriously can we take the apparent spontaneity of the spoken discourse? This may be Plato’s supreme irony—the evocation of truth through artificiality. (requirement 3)

      <comment>uploaded a new version of &quot;[[Image:PotentialDivider.png]]&quot;: Same image as before but the background has been whitened to aid page integration.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==
A potential divider diagram made by myself to replace the copyright-unknown image VoltageDivider.jpg.

I will upload this file to commons once i have learnt how to make scalable vector graphics, at which time i will remake and upload it. Until then i hope it will stay here.

&lt;big&gt;'''Porocarcinoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Rare malignant tumor arising from the intraepidermal portion of the eccrine sweat gland duct epithelium; there are several histologic varieties
*May arise from preexisting benign eccrine poroma, with increase in size, tenderness, and sometimes odor
*~300 cases reported in the literature; incidence estimated at 1 in 25,000 skin biopsies
*Most often occurs in the elderly, age at diagnosis 60-80 years
*Risk factors may include exposure to UV light, immunosuppression, and prior RT
*Distribution appears to have no correlation with sweat gland density: ~50% lower extremities, ~20% H&amp;N and upper extremities, ~12% trunk and abdomen
*Can show early invasion of dermal lymphatics and multiple epidermotropic metastases
*Has metastatic potential (~20%), and poor prognosis once metastatic
*Treatment of choice is wide local excision; lymph node dissection beneficial, since ~50% can experience local recurrence and/or LN disease
*There are only a couple of reports using adjuvant RT; dose given ranges 55-70 Gy

==Literature==
*'''Witwatersrand; 2007''' (South Africa) PMID 17704263 -- &quot;The squamous variant of eccrine porocarcinoma: a clinicopathological study of 21 cases.&quot; (Mahomed F, J Clin Pathol. 2007 Aug 17; [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 21 cases with squamous differentiation. Equal gender. Mean age 61.5 years. Average size 4.6 cm, 48% occurred in Black patients. 53% in extremities. 7 patients other skin tumors, 3 patients renal transplant
**Outcome: LR in 1/21, LN recurrence 1/21, 2/21 both LR+LN; 2 ultimately developed DM

*'''Nottingham; 2006''' (UK) PMID 16638385 -- &quot;We present an unusual case of eccrine porocarcinoma in that diagnosis was delayed for many years after the initial lesion appeared, resulting in relatively large tumor.&quot; (Affleck AG, Dermatol Online J. 2006 Jan 27;12(1):17.)
**Case report

*'''MSKCC; 1971''' (1934-1969) PMID 5100098 -- &quot;Sweat gland carcinoma: a clinico-pathologic study of 83 patients.&quot; (el-Domeiri AA, Ann Surg. 1971 Feb;173(2):270-4.)
**Retrospective. 83 patients. Gender comparable. Most common 50-70. Most &lt;5cm, largest 15cm. Present &gt;5 years in 23% patients. Prior RT: 8/83 (10%), range 6-40 years later. Treated with 48% WLE, 36% inital/subsequent LND, RT in 6% with widespread/metastatic disease
**Outcome: LN: 15% initially positive; additional 28% developed LN+ after primary treatment, but 20% had recurrent local disease prior to LN+. DM in 68%, vast majority had LN+ first. 5-year DFS 38%
**Conclusion: WLE appropriate only in low-grade disease, should do LND. Tumor considered radioresistant
 


==RT Literature==
*'''Spain; 2003''' PMID 14725669 -- &quot;Metastatic eccrine porocarcinoma: a 5.6-year follow-up study of a patient treated with a combined therapeutic protocol.&quot; (Gonzalez-Lopez MA, Dermatol Surg. 2003 Dec;29(12):1227-32.)
**Case report; right thigh and inguinal nodes, two separate RT treatments for complete local control
**RT used 55 Gy (Co-60 to 45 Gy AP/PA, followed by 10 Gy electron boost)

*'''Brussels; 2002''' (Belgium) PMID 11937963 -- &quot;[Eccrine porocarcinoma with extensive cutaneous metastasis] [Article in French]&quot; (Ghislain PD, Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2002 Feb;129(2):225-8.)
**Case report. Metastatic lower leg
**RT used successfully for palliation of lymphedema symptoms
 
*'''Louisville; 1996''' PMID 8812539 -- &quot;Vulvar eccrine porocarcinoma.&quot; (Katsanis WA, Gynecol Oncol. 1996 Sep;62(3):396-9.)
**Case report; vulvar neoplasm with 2cm inguinal LN+
**RT used 50.4 Gy whole pelvis and 60 Gy inguinal region

*'''Munster; 1993''' (Germany) PMID 8463101 -- &quot;[Metastasizing eccrine porocarcinoma] [Article in German]&quot; (Langfritz K, Hautarzt. 1993 Mar;44(3):176-9.)
**Case report; left leg with metastatic skin noduls 
**RT with fast neutrons and Co-60 resulted in partial regression; death from tumour cachexia

*'''Arizona; 1990''' PMID 2156600 -- &quot;The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant sweat gland neoplasms.&quot; (Harari PM, Cancer. 1990 Apr 15;65(8):1737-40.)
**Case report, 3 patients. Surgery + RT 70 Gy to surgical bed + 50 Gy to regional lymphatics. 
**Outcome: 2 DFS at 27 and 35 months, 1 dead of systemic disease

*'''Germany; 1987''' PMID 2820158 -- &quot;[Eccrine porocarcinoma (malignant eccrine poroma)--a follow-up study] [Article in German]&quot; (Doring HF, Z Hautkr. 1987 Jul 15;62(14):1051-2, 1055.)
**Case report; recurrent disease treated with RT, death

*'''1986''' PMID 3771857 -- &quot;Radiation therapy and chemotherapy in malignant sweat gland tumors.&quot; (Whittington R, J Am Acad Dermatol. 1986 Nov;15(5 Pt 2):1093-7.)

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:philosophy|philosophy]]''': the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Many other disciplines study such things. However, philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument rather than, for example, experiments.

 |description=The books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:language|language]]s''', in particular foreign language learning. The study of individual modern and classical languages forms the backbone of the modern study of the [[Subject:Humanities|humanities]], while the scientific study of language is known as [[Subject:Linguistics|linguistics]] and is a [[Subject:Social sciences|social science]]. Since many areas of the humanities such as [[Subject:Literature|literature]], [[Subject:History|history]], and [[Subject:Philosophy|philosophy]] are based on language, changes in language can have a profound effect on the other humanities.

== A New Economy Introduced to New Zealand ==

For 50 years after Sydney was founded 1788, New Zealand became an economic outpost of New South Wales. New Zealand's main European based economy at the time was built around whaling, sealing, farming and trade with the Maori people.

===Whaling in New Zealand===

For the first forty years of the 19th Century, whaling was the biggest economic activity for Europeans that came to New Zealand.

At the time in Europe, whales were needed for their oil (street lighting, frying food, oiling instruments), so the whaling industry in New Zealand was highly successful. The first whaling ship, the ''William Ann'', was in New Zealand waters by around 1791–92, and many whaling ships arrived at New Zealand by the year 1800, most of them being British, American or French.  Even some Maori joined whaling crews for new experiences.

===Sealing===

The first major sealing operation in New Zealand was in Dusky Sound, November 1792, in which men were dropped off from the ship ''Britannia'', to gather skins of Fur Seals for the China market as payment for tea. By September 1793, when the men were picked up again, they had 4500 skins.

Sealing was revived in 1803, when the seal colonies in Bass Strait, Australia, had been exhausted. Seals were still in high demand, for hats, and the leather for shoes. Futhermore, seal oil burned without smoke or smell and was needed for lighting and some industrial processes.

There was a rush for seals in Dusky Sound and the West Coast in the early nineteenth century, and the seals were hunted to the verge of extinction by 1830. Sealing in New Zealand was finally outlawed in 1926.

===Trade with the Maori People===

The first European ‘town’ grew at Kororāreka, when European whalers started calling into the Bay of Islands for food and water. From the 1790s Maoris started to produce pork and potatoes to trade to the Europeans. The presence of Europeans drew Maoris to European towns. The Maoris were quick to catch on the benefits of trade and were eager for Europeans to live among them. They were especially interested in acquiring firearms.

== Missionaries Dispatched to New Zealand ==
The Church Missionary Society, was one of the earliest organisations to dispatch missionaries to New Zealand. In 1807, one of New Zealand's well known early missionaries, Samuel Marsden, asked the CMS to fund a mission to New Zealand. He had been impressed with the Maoris he had met in England on an earlier occasion, and felt that they needed to be evangelised. He succeeded in gathering together a band of settlers to accompany him, including a teacher and a joiner. However, Marsden had to finance his own ship to New Zealand.

Due to bureaucratic problems, the earliest missionaries arrived in New Zealand at the Bay of Islands in 1814. The mission had two main goals: Christianisation of the Maori people and the attempt to try and keep law and order among the European settlers.

The first Christian Mission Station in New Zealand was set up by Marsden in the Bay of Islands, the same year they arrived. However, the missionaries arrived to a violent atmosphere. Maori were busy trading with settlers for muskets to use on other tribes, and even the missionaries were beginning to argue amongst themselves. Marsden was also experiencing problems with the governor in New South Wales, who was treating the Mission as a bit of a joke. The missions became more successful, however, as time progressed.

In 1819, a block of land in Kerikeri was purchased to set up a new Mission Station at Paihia, which Reverend Henry Williams operated. Williams became highly respected among Nga Puhi, and prevented fighting on several occasions. Missionary influence also put an end to slavery and cannibalism among the Maori. The first baptism of a Maori in New Zealand was conducted in 1825.

Between 1834 and 1840, Mission Stations were established at Kaitaia, Thames, Whangaroa, Waikato, Mamamata (which was abandoned during tribal wars in 1836-37), Rotorua, Tauranga, Manukau and Poverty Bay. By 1840, over 20 Stations had been established, many of which were based in the North Island.

Maori learnt much from missionaries. Not only did they learn about Christianity, but they also learnt European farming techniques and trades and how to read and write. Missionaries also transcribed the Maori language into written form. For many Maori, missionaries were the first contact they had with Europeans, so the missionaries wanted to leave a good impression with the Maoris. 

In 1838, a report indicated that the Church Missionary Society stations were staffed with five ministers, 20 catechists, a farmer, a surgeon, an editor, a printer, a wheelwright, a stonemason, two assistant teachers and two female teachers.

Mission Stations customarily consisted of a house for the Missionary's family, a school room, a chapel, a sleeping quarters for school children and Maoris who were being trained as teachers. A farm and orchard were often attached. From the Mission Stations, Missionaries could visit a circuit of Maori villages by foot.

The Missionary William Yate began printing in Maori in the early 1830s. The Church Missionary Society later sent a trained printer, William Colenso, and a printing press to Paihia, enabling Maori bibles to be printed in New Zealand. The first complete New Testament bible in Maori was printed in 1837. By 1840, much of the Old Testament had also been translated into Maori by William Williams and Robert Maunsell. Many copies of the translated bible were distributed direct from the printing press in Paihia.

== French Missionary Efforts ==
In the 1830s, French missionaries introduced Catholicism to the Maoris. Jean Baptiste François Pompallier was one of the main missionaries behind this movement. Pompallier was appointed the first vicar apostolic of Western Oceania, and arrived in New Zealand at Hokianga on the 10th of January 1838. He came with one priest, one brother, a small supply of goods, but very little money. Unfortunately for Pompallier, most of the Maoris around Hokianga were already Methodists, and were openly hostile towards the recently arrived Catholics. 

By 1840, the headquarters of the mission had changed to Kororareka. Additional Catholic Mission Stations were soon set up at Whangaroa, Kaipara, Tauranga, Akaroa, Matamata, Otaki, Rotorua, Rangiaowhia and Whakatane.

In 1840, Pompallier was present at the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, and it is thanks to him that the fourth article, involving freedom of religion, is present.

In 1841, a report showed 164 tribes as Catholic.

Many missionaries were opposed to the colonisation of New Zealand, because they wanted to avoid conflict between Maori and Europeans for land and resources, but were gradually convinced it would be for the best, and in turn convinced many Maori Chiefs to sign the Treaty of Waitangi between the British Crown and Maori.

==Synopsis==
\string

==Description==

\string accepts a single token (a command sequence, a letter, a other character, including special characters like {, $, } and converts it into a string of characters. The escape character is controlled by the register \escapechar and is &quot;\&quot; in standard TeX. If it's equal -1 \string outputs nothing as escape character.

All characters except the space (code=32) are output with category 12 (other character), even if they're letters or special characters. As an exception space gets the category 10 (space character) but still concatenated spaces are not merged to one space

==Synopsis==
\atop

==Description==
\atop is the basic TeX command for stacking mathematical text. Printing
 a\atop b
produces the stack &lt;math&gt;a\atop b&lt;/math&gt;. Grouping may be required to make sure that not too much is included. A good rule of thumb is to simply put braces around any such stack as in
 {a\atop b}

==Description==
\over is the basic TeX command for making fractions. Printing

==Synopsis==
\above[dimen]

==Description==
\above is TeX's more general command for making fractions. Printing
 a\above 0.5pt b
produces the fraction &lt;math&gt;a\over b&lt;/math&gt; where the separating bar has thickness 0.5pt. Grouping may be required to make sure that not too much is included in the numerator and denominator. A good rule of thumb is to simply put braces around any fraction as in
 {a\above 0.5pt b}
The primatives \over and \atop can be replicated in terms of \above as
 \over = \above 0.4pt
 \atop = \above 0pt

==Synopsis==
\overwithdelims[delim1][delim2]

==Description==
\overwithdelims is one of TeX's general commands for making fractions. Printing
 a\overwithdelims(] b
produces the fraction &lt;math&gt;\left({a\over b}\right]&lt;/math&gt; where it has delimiter ( on the left and ] on the right. The delimiters are treated as if \left precedes the left delimiter and \right precedes the right delimiter, and hence the delimiters scale based on the size of the contained text. A null delimiter can be used by putting a period . in for one of the delimiters. Hence \over can be replicated as
 \over = \overwithdelims..

==Description==
\atopwithdelims is TeX's general command for stacking. Printing

One important use of \atopwithdelims is in the definition of the Plain TeX command \choose
 \choose = \atopwithdelims()
and each produces &lt;math&gt;a\choose b&lt;/math&gt;

\dump

==Description==
\dump is valid only when running INITeX, and most users of TeX will never have to use it. It essentially replaces \end when writing a format file, and tells TeX to output all previous coding in a .fmt file that TeX can quickly read in while processing a document.

==Description==
\global is a TeX command that declares the following definition or assignment to be global, meaning that if TeX is currently inside a group, the definition or assignment will still remain valid when the group is over. Commands that can follow \global include \def, \edef, \let, \count, \countdef, etc. Also, TeX provides the following abbreviations as primitives:
 \gdef = \global\def
 \xdef = \global\edef

==Synopsis==
\globaldefs

==Description==
\globaldefs is a TeX internal parameter. Normally set to 0. If set equal to a positive number, all following definitions and assignments are treated as if preceded by \global. If set equal to a negative number, none of the following definitions or assignments are global, meaning that an explicit \global is ignored. This remains in effect until \globaldefs is explicitly set to 0 again, or the group containing the \globaldefs reassignment ends (assuming it was not made global as well).

==Synopsis==
\catcode`\[char]=[num]

==Description==
\catcode is the command that's used to change the category code of a character. The category code tells TeX what to do when it encounters that character later in the text. A general assignment looks something like
 \catcode`\@=11
which defines the @ character to be a letter.

The category codes in TeX are as follows:
* 0 = Escape character, normally \
* 1 = Begin grouping, normally {
* 2 = End grouping, normally }
* 3 = Math shift, normally $
* 4 = Alignment tab, normally &amp;
* 5 = End of line, normally &lt;return&gt;
* 6 = Parameter, normally #
* 7 = Superscript, normally ^
* 8 = Subscript, normally _
* 9 = Ignored character, normally &lt;null&gt;
* 10 = Space, normally &lt;space&gt; and &lt;tab&gt;
* 11 = Letter, normally only contains the letters a,...,z and A,...,Z. These characters can be used in command names
* 12 = Other, normally everything else not listed in the other categories
* 13 = Active character, for example ~
* 14 = Comment character, normally %
* 15 = Invalid character, normally &lt;delete&gt;

Using category codes, it is possible to completely reconfigure TeX and allows support for international users.

A character of code 13 is called active. In a sense it is treated as if it were a command sequence in of itself, and definitions can be given in the normal fashion. Hence to define ~, Plain TeX has
 \def~{...}

“Perhaps the most important factor to why they were successful in becoming an eco-municipality were study circles…It’s a question of taking control over their own situation and their own future.” – ''Torbjorn Lahti, Project Leader Swedish Eco-Municipality movement''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== '''Background''' ==

The Natural Step for Communities study circle is a program developed by [http://www.SustainDane.org Sustain Dane]. The inspiration for this study circle came from the experience of Swedish eco-municipalities, communities that have successfully offered similar study circles as a tool for beginning education and community conversation related to sustainability community topics. Another inspiration for this program comes from the Northwest Earth Institute; a Portland, Oregon based non-profit organization that has been offering discussion courses locally and nationally through affiliate organizations for the past 13 years. Since 1993, over 75,000 individuals have participated in one of the seven discussion courses offered by the [http://www.nwei.org Northwest Earth Institute].

== '''Study Circle Overview''' ==

Sustainability may seem like one more buzzword, and cities and towns like the last places to change, but The Natural Step for Communities provides inspiring examples of communities that have made dramatic changes toward sustainability, and explains how others can emulate their success. 

== '''Objectives''' ==

&gt;To build a network or community of people conversant in the area of sustainability &lt;BR&gt;
&gt;To become familiar with The Natural Step framework and have examples for a base of communication with others&lt;BR&gt;
&gt;To have an opportunity to learn about your community so that you can lay a foundation for future action&lt;BR&gt;
&gt;To be motivated to engage in actions personally and with others to move toward a sustainable future.

== '''Format''' ==
A study circle format allows you to better understand the different perspectives and approaches to the complexity of sustainability. In addition, this study circle is intended to be a supportive learning experience, so please ask questions of clarification and share insights with one another. Whether you agree or disagree, you will have an opportunity to talk about an important subject with others who share your concerns, and hopefully have fun along the way!

The book used for this study circle first clarifies the concept of sustainability, offering guiding principles –The Natural Step framework __ that help identify sustainable action in any area. It then introduces the sixty-plus eco-municipalities of Sweden that have adopted changes to sustainable practices throughout municipal policies and operations. The third section explains how they did it, and outlines how other communities in North America and elsewhere can do the same. Key to success is a democratic “bottom-up change process, and clear guiding sustainability principles such as the Natural Step framework.

== '''General''' ==
This section contains a list of suggested guidelines to help ensure a successful, positive study circle experience for every participant. Please review them before the first discussion session.

* Read the study circle materials and review questions before each session. A better prepared group will have a better discussion.&lt;br&gt;

* Begin and end each session on time. Your session will go by very quickly. To make the most of each session, make sure to begin and end on time.

* Self-monitor your own time. All participants want a chance to enter the discussion.

* If you know a fair amount about the discussion topic, try using this opportunity to listen to what others know about this issue.  You can then use this knowledge to help you clearly state your perspective on the issue in future conversations with other community members and leaders.

* Please keep the discussion positive. At times, the issues and challenges we face can seem overwhelming, especially in the context of sustainability.

* If you are unclear of a term being used, seek clarification right away.

* Don’t get stuck on the authors’ writing style or the format of the book.  The book was not intended for a study circle.

* Don’t spend too much time or detail on problem-solving.  If possible, note ideas for potential solutions or actions and move on to the next discussion question. It is best to revisit these potential solutions or actions at the study circle celebration.

* Please reserve comments on others participant’s responses to the circle question.

* A response is not mandatory for each question. If you do not have a response for a particular question, simply say “I pass.”

If you have concerns about your discussion course experience, please discuss these issues immediately with your facilitator or contact [http://www.sustaindane.org Sustain Dane].

== '''Facilitator''' ==

Each session of the Natural Step for Communities study circle is facilitated by a volunteer. The facilitator is not the “teacher” but is there to assure the process below is followed in the study circle. 

* The facilitator’s principal role is to stimulate and moderate the discussion by asking questions identifying key points, and managing the group process. The facilitator is not an expert, does not have the answers or may even not be the most knowledgeable person about the topic for the week. &lt;br&gt;
*The facilitator will keep the discussion focused on the sessions’ topic. &lt;br&gt;
* Some questions are designed to be answered as a group, others by each individual participant. The facilitator will look for and acknowledge questions to be answered by the group as a whole.&lt;br&gt;
* A primary goal is for everyone to participate in each session. The facilitator will try to draw out quiet participants by creating an opportunity for each person to contribute. &lt;br&gt;
* On the other hand, an important role of the facilitator is to restrain a domineering participant.&lt;br&gt; 
* The facilitator will make opportunities for others to join the discussion. &lt;br&gt;
* The facilitator will start each session by calling on the designated participant volunteer(s) to do the Opening before the start of the discussion. &lt;br&gt;
* The facilitator will follow the opening with the Circle Question. &lt;BR&gt;  
* Evaluations of the readings and discussions should be completed each week. The facilitator should remind each participant to fill out their weekly evaluation form at the end of each session.&lt;br&gt; 

== '''Opening''' ==

Many U.S. communities are now implementing some form of sustainable development, for example climate change initiatives, green building programs, brownfields redevelopment, open space preservation, and affordable housing. These are largely occurring on a project-by-project or issue-oriented approach – sometimes called the “silo approach” to sustainable development. 

At the study circle introductory session, participants should volunteer to identify* a sustainable development project or initiative in your community or region that relates to a specific session. At the beginning of sessions two thru six, the Opening volunteer(s) for that sessions’ topic should explain,** in no more than five minutes, a sustainable project or initiative that they have researched . The presentation should cover what the project or initiative is, who is involved, where is it happening, when it started and how it is intended to benefit the community. The facilitator will demonstrate an opening in the first session. 

*If you are not familiar with a project or initiative in your community that relates to the particular session topic, ask the facilitator for some suggestions. 

*If time permits, the opening volunteer(s) are encouraged to research the project or initiative by conducting an interview, visiting the site or obtaining related documents.

== '''Circle Question''' ==
 
After the Opening, the facilitator will ask the Circle Question, “The book introduces several examples of the session themes. What personal reactions or new insights did you have to what you read in this section of the book?” Each participant should provide an answer without comments or questions from others.

== Session 1: Introducing Natural Step Framework and Sustainability (Chapter 1, 2 &amp; 3) ==
Begin with Circle Question: (Reminder: Each participant should provide an answer without comments or questions from others.)

* Can you think of a principle (ecological, ethical, etc.) that helps guide you in making decisions? What is the principle? How is it helpful?

* Can you identify and describe an experience you have had defining or explaining the concept of sustainability to people for the first time? Or, what have been your own challenges in understanding the concept? How might the sustainability objectives of The Natural Step help address these challenges?

* The authors talk about the importance of using an upstream approach to dealing with problems. Think of some of your community’s or region’s approaches in dealing with community or regional problems such as traffic congestion, challenges in education, homelessness, unemployment, or high health care costs. As a group, determine three examples of “downstream approaches” and three examples of “upstream approaches” to these problems? 

* The authors in the book note that “communities are complex systems…this complexity often results in actions or policies that can work cross-purposes or compete with each other.” Have you experienced a similar situation in community? Explain.

* From what you have learned thus far about the Natural Step framework and what you know about your community already, to which issues in your community could the framework be applied to; immediately and easily? With the most significant impact? 

* Did reading this section make you want to do something differently or to take some action in your life? If so, explain.

== '''Session 2: Changing to Renewable Energy Resources and Alternative Transportation (Chapter 5 &amp; 6)''' ==
''Begin with the Circle Question''

* As explained in the book, different Swedish communities use different sources of energy. From what energy sources is your local power company producing energy? From what you now know about the types of renewable energy available and your communities access to these energy resources (i.e. solar, wind, biomass), what combination of renewable energy sources do you think might work well in your community? Explain.

* Are green energy pricing programs are offered in your area? If so describe them. Have you chosen to participate in these programs? Why or why not?

* Besides decreasing emissions, can you identify other benefits to the development of a less fossil-fueled dependent transportation system? 

* Describe the physical, social and economic barriers in your community may that prevent people from getting to places other than by car. 

* Are there alternative transportation options in your community, and how are they working? How can your community support the development of such options?

*Did reading this section make you want to do something differently or to take some action in your life? If so, explain.</text>

== '''Session 3: Eco-Housing and Green Building/Businesses (Chapter 7 &amp; 8)''' ==

''Begin with the Circle Question''

* Think of a building in your community (i.e. your home, library, church, etc.) that you liked to spend time in. What are the characteristics of the building that make it enjoyable for you?

* What features of your current dwelling encourage or discourage alteration to a more sustainable habitat?

* In light of the fourth system condition, what factors should be considered when determining an affordable housing policy for your community?

* In light of the Natural Step framework, if you were a business owner, what steps would you take to determine how to make your business greener?

* The book highlights a number of types of businesses (fast-food restaurant, hotel, auto dealer, tanning company, construction, etc.) that have created a market advantage because they have gone green. What businesses or types of businesses in your community do you think could benefit most from incorporating green practices such as co-location, waste and pollution reduction, recycling, green building, etc? Explain.

* Did reading this section make you want to do something differently or to take some action in your life? If so, explain.</text>

[[Image:Par_summer_block_450.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. Parallel voltage summer = V-to-I converters + current summer + I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== A problem: ''the common ground'' ==

[[Image:Ser_summer_loop_1000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. Where to ground the circuit?&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Kirchhoff's Voltage Law'' has already given us an idea how to create the simplest [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer|series voltage summer]]. Unfortunately, it had a lot of disadvantages; maybe, the most crucial of them was the problem of the [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer#Flying sources|common ground]].

Do you remember? [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer#Flying sources|First]], we grounded the common point between the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and the load; as a result, the sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; became flying. [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer#Flying source and load|Then]], we tried to ground the common point between the input sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;; now, the source V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; and the load became flying. [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer#Flying load|Finally]], we were forced to use only two grounded sources and a differential load.

Only, Kirchhoff has formulated another law - ''Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)''. Maybe, it can help us to create a perfect voltage summer having no problems with the common ground? Let's try this speculation!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Deriving the simplest current summer from KCL ==

[[Image:Par_summer_current_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. In order to sum currents, we have just to connect in parallel the input current sources to the load.&lt;/center&gt;]]

First, we can apply directly KCL to create a current summer. For this purpose, we have just to connect in parallel the input current sources I&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (let's for concreteness assume again that we have three sources) to the ''current load'' L&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 3). Let's first assume that it is a perfect ''current load'' having zero resistance (e.g., just a piece of wire). The output current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; flowing through the load is the sum of the input currents: I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt;.

We can ask ourselves again, &quot;Only, what is actually the summer here?&quot;, &quot;Where is it?&quot; The input current sources and the load are external components; so, the rest (the bare node or the junction point) serves here as a summer!

&lt;center&gt;''The simplest current summer is just a node.''&lt;/center&gt;

Wonderful! We have another &quot;ideal&quot; device - the current summer. It is apparent device because there is not actually a device:)!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Building a parallel voltage summer ==

[[Image:Par_summer_voltage_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. We can build a parallel voltage summer, if we connect V-toI converters before the inputs and I-to-V converter after the output of a current summer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, we want to sum input voltages; so, we have to convert them into currents. For this purpose, we connect [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|voltage-to-current converters]] between the input voltage sources and the inputs of the current summer (Fig. 4). Also, we need a voltage output; so, we have to connect the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|current-to-voltage converter]] at the current summer output. In this way, we have assembled a composed voltage summing circuit:

&lt;center&gt;''Parallel voltage summer'' = ''V-to-I converters'' + ''current summer'' + ''I-to-V converter''&lt;/center&gt;

Let's compare the two viewpoints: From the classical viewpoint, the parallel voltage summer consists of a few resistors; from our viewpoint, it contains voltage-to-current converters, a current summer and a current-to-voltage converter. The use of applying such a system approach is that we see the function of the resistors in the circuit; we ''see the forest for the tree''!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Exploring the circuit ==

[[Image:Par_summer_operation_1000.jpg|thumb|right|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Visualizing the circuit operation by voltage bars and current loops.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let's now see how the circuit operates. Attractive voltage bars will help us to visualize the invisible voltages and voltage drops (Fig. 5); current loops will show us where the currents flow (remember: every current returns where it has begun flowing).

The input voltage sources V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; produce voltages, the resistors R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; convert them into currents, the junction point sums the currents and finally, the resistor R converts back the current sum into an output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;.

Only, the output voltage introduces an error because it subtracts from the input voltages. Now, the effective voltages V&lt;sub&gt;R1&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;R3&lt;/sub&gt; create the currents instead the whole input voltages V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt;:

I&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R1&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

I&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

I&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

How do we remove the error?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Do we really need an I-to-V converter? ==

[[Image:Par_summer_short_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. The circuit continues working fine even, if we remove the I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Maybe, you have already noted the contradictory role of the resistor R.

In order not to disturb the input sources (see [[#Exploring the circuit|above]]), we want the resistance R to be as small as possible (preferably R = 0). As a result, the input voltage-to-current converters become each other independent; only, the output voltage decreases:( We will use this technique later when we build an [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Summer|active parallel voltage summer]].

But why do not we increase the resistance R up to infinity (i.e., just to remove the resistor R)? In this case, the input voltage-to-current converters become each other absolutely dependent but we obtain a maximal output voltage. We can use this solution when the load has an infinite internal resistance ([[Circuit_Idea/Simple_Op-amp_Summer_Design#Op-amp_non-inverting_summer|e.g.]], when we have buffered the passive summer by a non-inverting amplifier).

Only, there is a sound reason to connect the &quot;unnecessary&quot; resistor R - it can add the input coefficients up to 1 (see more [[Circuit_Idea/Simple_Op-amp_Summer_Design#Passive_summer|explanations]]). We will use this technique below to build a simple [[#Digital-to-analog converter|digital-to-analog converter]].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Applications ==

The parallel voltage summer exists in many analog circuits considered in electronics books; only, authors do not discern and do not pay attention to it. As a result, it is presented rather implicitly than manifestly. In this section, we will do our best to show its presence in various electronic circuits. This famous circuit deserves our attention.

=== Op-amp inverting voltage summer ===

[[Image:Par_summer_active_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. We can build an op-amp inverting summer by connecting a passive parallel voltage summer and an op-amp.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Maybe, the most important application of the passive summer is building an op-amp active summer. Only, what is the idea behind such an op-amp inverting summing circuit (Fig. 7)?

From the classical viewpoint, an op-amp inverting summer consists of input resistors Ri, a negative feedback resistor R and an op-amp. Only, thinking of the active circuit in this way we can't discern the basic idea behind it; we ''do not see the forest for the tree''.

From our fresh viewpoint, an op-amp inverting summer consists of a passive parallel voltage summer and an op-amp:

&lt;center&gt;''Op-amp inverting summer  = parallel voltage summer + op-amp''&lt;/center&gt;

More precisely speaking, an ''n-input'' op-amp inverting summer needs an (''n+1)''-input passive parallel voltage summer. For example, in order to build a 3-input op-amp inverting summer (our case) we have to add an additional fourth input IN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. A properly supplied op-amp serves as an additional input voltage source that adjusts its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; (the &quot;input&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN4&lt;/sub&gt;) so that to zero the passive summer's output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the virtual ground). As a result, the op-amp's output voltage represents the sum of the input voltages V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Let's repeat again:

''We (i.e., the op-amp) introduce(s) an additional &quot;compensating&quot; input and make its voltage equal to the sum of the rest &quot;true&quot; input voltages. Then, we abandon the &quot;genuine&quot; summer's output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, it serves only as an indication of an equilibrium) and begin using the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN4&lt;/sub&gt; as an output.'' 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Digital-to-analog converter ===

[[Image:Par_summer_dac_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. A parallel voltage summer with binary weighted input coefficients can serve as a DAC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)? It is just a circuit that materializes an abstract digit (most frequently, converting it into a voltage). A parallel voltage summer having binary-weighted inputs can do this work.

In this example (Fig. 8), a 3-bit digital device drives the DAC. Here we suppose that the high voltage levels of the three digital outputs are relatively equal; this voltage serves as a reference V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;. The output voltage is:

V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1 x b0 x V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.2 x b1 x V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; +  0.4 x b2 x V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;

For [http://www.daqarta.com/dw_ggdd.htm example], you can connect such a simple DAC to the parallel computer port (such as a printer port).

The resistor R is absolutely necessary in this application; it adds the sum of the input coefficients up to 1 (according to [[Circuit_Idea/Simple_Op-amp_Summer_Design#Passive_summer|Daisy's theorem]]). You can use the nice [http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/Brandy.html Brandy's formula] to calculate the resistances. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Audio mixer ===

[[Image:Par_summer_mixer_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. A parallel voltage summer can mix audio signals.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Another popular application of the parallel summing circuit is [[w:Audio_mixing|audio mixing]] of analog signals from a few voltage sources.

Note again that the parallel summer not just sums the signals; it also attenuates them. In this case, this feature is useful.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Parallel versus series summer ==

We can do a few remarks about the parallel voltage summing circuit in comparison with the series one.

• The output voltage of the parallel voltage summer is a weighted sum of the input voltages; the output voltage of the [[Circuit Idea/Series Voltage Summer|series voltage summer]] is a sum of the whole input voltages.

• The input sources and the load of the parallel voltage summer are grounded; only two devices (sources or a source and a load) of the series configuration can be grounded, the rest remain flying.

“Perhaps the most important factor to why they were successful in becoming an eco-municipality were study circles…It’s a question of taking control over their own situation and their own future.” – ''Torbjorn Lahti, Project Leader Swedish Eco-Municipality movement''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== '''Background''' ==

The Natural Step for Communities study circle is a program developed by [http://www.SustainDane.org Sustain Dane]. The inspiration for this study circle came from the experience of Swedish eco-municipalities, communities that have successfully offered similar study circles as a tool for beginning education and community conversation related to sustainability community topics. Another inspiration for this program comes from the Northwest Earth Institute; a Portland, Oregon based non-profit organization that has been offering discussion courses locally and nationally through affiliate organizations for the past 13 years. Since 1993, over 75,000 individuals have participated in one of the seven discussion courses offered by the [http://www.nwei.org Northwest Earth Institute].

== '''Study Circle Overview''' ==

Sustainability may seem like one more buzzword, and cities and towns like the last places to change, but The Natural Step for Communities provides inspiring examples of communities that have made dramatic changes toward sustainability, and explains how others can emulate their success. 

== '''Objectives''' ==

&gt;To build a network or community of fellows conversant in the area of sustainability &lt;BR&gt;
&gt;To become familiar with The Natural Step framework and have examples for a base of communication with others&lt;BR&gt;
&gt;To have an opportunity to learn about your community so that you can lay a foundation for future action&lt;BR&gt;
&gt;To be motivated to engage in actions personally and with others to move toward a sustainable future.

== '''Format''' ==
A study circle format allows you to better understand the different perspectives and approaches to the complexity of sustainability. In addition, this study circle is intended to be a supportive learning experience, so please ask questions of clarification and share insights with one another. Whether you agree or disagree, you will have an opportunity to talk about an important subject with others who share your concerns, and hopefully have fun along the way!

The book used for this study circle first clarifies the concept of sustainability, offering guiding principles –The Natural Step framework __ that help identify sustainable action in any area. It then introduces the sixty-plus eco-municipalities of Sweden that have adopted changes to sustainable practices throughout municipal policies and operations. The third section explains how they did it, and outlines how other communities in North America and elsewhere can do the same. Key to success is a democratic “bottom-up change process, and clear guiding sustainability principles such as the Natural Step framework.

== '''General''' ==
This section contains a list of suggested guidelines to help ensure a successful, positive study circle experience for every participant. Please review them before the first discussion session.

* Read the study circle materials and review questions before each session. A better prepared group will have a better discussion.&lt;br&gt;

* Begin and end each session on time. Your session will go by very quickly. To make the most of each session, make sure to begin and end on time.

* Self-monitor your own time. All participants want a chance to enter the discussion.

* If you know a fair amount about the discussion topic, try using this opportunity to listen to what others know about this issue.  You can then use this knowledge to help you clearly state your perspective on the issue in future conversations with other community members and leaders.

* Please keep the discussion positive. At times, the issues and challenges we face can seem overwhelming, especially in the context of sustainability.

* If you are unclear of a term being used, seek clarification right away.

* Don’t get stuck on the authors’ writing style or the format of the book.  The book was not intended for a study circle.

* Don’t spend too much time or detail on problem-solving.  If possible, note ideas for potential solutions or actions and move on to the next discussion question. It is best to revisit these potential solutions or actions at the study circle celebration.

* Please reserve comments on others participant’s responses to the circle question.

* A response is not mandatory for each question. If you do not have a response for a particular question, simply say “I pass.”

If you have concerns about your discussion course experience, please discuss these issues immediately with your facilitator or contact [http://www.sustaindane.org Sustain Dane].

== '''Facilitator''' ==

Each session of the Natural Step for Communities study circle is facilitated by a volunteer. The facilitator is not the “teacher” but is there to assure the process below is followed in the study circle. 

* The facilitator’s principal role is to stimulate and moderate the discussion by asking questions identifying key points, and managing the group process. The facilitator is not an expert, does not have the answers or may even not be the most knowledgeable person about the topic for the week. &lt;br&gt;
*The facilitator will keep the discussion focused on the sessions’ topic. &lt;br&gt;
* Some questions are designed to be answered as a group, others by each individual participant. The facilitator will look for and acknowledge questions to be answered by the group as a whole.&lt;br&gt;
* A primary goal is for everyone to participate in each session. The facilitator will try to draw out quiet participants by creating an opportunity for each person to contribute. &lt;br&gt;
* On the other hand, an important role of the facilitator is to restrain a domineering participant.&lt;br&gt; 
* The facilitator will make opportunities for others to join the discussion. &lt;br&gt;
* The facilitator will start each session by calling on the designated participant volunteer(s) to do the Opening before the start of the discussion. &lt;br&gt;
* The facilitator will follow the opening with the Circle Question. &lt;BR&gt;  
* Evaluations of the readings and discussions should be completed each week. The facilitator should remind each participant to fill out their weekly evaluation form at the end of each session.&lt;br&gt; 

== '''Opening''' ==

Many U.S. communities are now implementing some form of sustainable development, for example climate change initiatives, green building programs, brownfields redevelopment, open space preservation, and affordable housing. These are largely occurring on a project-by-project or issue-oriented approach – sometimes called the “silo approach” to sustainable development. 

At the study circle introductory session, participants should volunteer to identify* a sustainable development project or initiative in your community or region that relates to a specific session. At the beginning of sessions two thru six, the Opening volunteer(s) for that sessions’ topic should explain,** in no more than five minutes, a sustainable project or initiative that they have researched . The presentation should cover what the project or initiative is, who is involved, where is it happening, when it started and how it is intended to benefit the community. The facilitator will demonstrate an opening in the first session. 

*If you are not familiar with a project or initiative in your community that relates to the particular session topic, ask the facilitator for some suggestions. 

*If time permits, the opening volunteer(s) are encouraged to research the project or initiative by conducting an interview, visiting the site or obtaining related documents.

== '''Circle Question''' ==
 
After the Opening, the facilitator will ask the Circle Question, “The book introduces several examples of the session themes. What personal reactions or new insights did you have to what you read in this section of the book?” Each participant should provide an answer without comments or questions from others.

== Session 1: Introducing Natural Step Framework and Sustainability (Chapter 1, 2 &amp; 3) ==

Begin with Circle Question: (Reminder: Each participant should provide an answer without comments or questions from others.)&lt;br&gt;

* Can you think of a principle (ecological, ethical, etc.) that helps guide you in making decisions? What is the principle? How is it helpful?&lt;br&gt;

* Can you identify and describe an experience you have had defining or explaining the concept of sustainability to people for the first time? Or, what have been your own challenges in understanding the concept? How might the sustainability objectives of The Natural Step help address these challenges?&lt;br&gt;

* The authors talk about the importance of using an upstream approach to dealing with problems. Think of some of your community’s or region’s approaches in dealing with community or regional problems such as traffic congestion, challenges in education, homelessness, unemployment, or high health care costs. As a group, determine three examples of “downstream approaches” and three examples of “upstream approaches” to these problems? &lt;br&gt;

* The authors in the book note that “communities are complex systems…this complexity often results in actions or policies that can work cross-purposes or compete with each other.” Have you experienced a similar situation in community? Explain.&lt;br&gt;

* From what you have learned thus far about the Natural Step framework and what you know about your community already, to which issues in your community could the framework be applied to; immediately and easily? With the most significant impact? &lt;br&gt;

* Did reading this section make you want to do something differently or to take some action in your life? If so, explain.&lt;br&gt;

== '''Session 2: Changing to Renewable Energy Resources and Alternative Transportation (Chapter 5 &amp; 6)''' ==

''Begin with the Circle Question''

* As explained in the book, different Swedish communities use different sources of energy. From what energy sources is your local power company producing energy? From what you now know about the types of renewable energy available and your communities access to these energy resources (i.e. solar, wind, biomass), what combination of renewable energy sources do you think might work well in your community? Explain.

* Are green energy pricing programs are offered in your area? If so describe them. Have you chosen to participate in these programs? Why or why not?

* Besides decreasing emissions, can you identify other benefits to the development of a less fossil-fueled dependent transportation system? 

* Describe the physical, social and economic barriers in your community may that prevent people from getting to places other than by car. 

* Are there alternative transportation options in your community, and how are they working? How can your community support the development of such options?

*Did reading this section make you want to do something differently or to take some action in your life? If so, explain.

== '''Session 3: Eco-Housing and Green Building/Businesses (Chapter 7 &amp; 8)''' ==

''Begin with the Circle Question''

* Think of a building in your community (i.e. your home, library, church, etc.) that you liked to spend time in. What are the characteristics of the building that make it enjoyable for you?

* What features of your current dwelling encourage or discourage alteration to a more sustainable habitat?

* In light of the fourth system condition, what factors should be considered when determining an affordable housing policy for your community?

* In light of the Natural Step framework, if you were a business owner, what steps would you take to determine how to make your business greener?

* The book highlights a number of types of businesses (fast-food restaurant, hotel, auto dealer, tanning company, construction, etc.) that have created a market advantage because they have gone green. What businesses or types of businesses in your community do you think could benefit most from incorporating green practices such as co-location, waste and pollution reduction, recycling, green building, etc? Explain.

* Did reading this section make you want to do something differently or to take some action in your life? If so, explain.

{{Cuisine|Belarus}} | [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European cuisines]]

Although '''Belarusian cuisine''' derives from the same common sources as those of its neighbours -  Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles, and in later times Russians - it is sometimes considered as somewhat less rich and impressive than those of its imposing neighbours. In fact, however, this may result from the general lack of national identity which still continues to hold back the development of a nation and also led to the loss of many culinary traditions in the last 100 years. The history of gastronomy in Belarus reveals a highly exotic rather than a poor cuisine. 

Aside from its predominantly Ruthenian roots, Belarusian cuisine is very close to Lithuanian. After the union with Poland in 1569, Polish influence became strong in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Though both the Polish elite and the Belarusian nobility borrowed much from Italian, German and French cuisines, this influence hardly made itself felt in the diet of the serf peasant majority until the abolition of serfdom.  Some of the borrowed dishes, however, spread throughout the society, such as lazanki (a mixture of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] [[Cookbook:Dumpling|dumplings]] and stewed meat, related to Italian [[Cookbook:Lasagna|lasagna]]) and, above all, various dishes made of grated potato, typical for German cuisine.

Since wheat does not grow well in a cold and wet climate Belarusians were always fond of a kind of somewhat sour rye bread, and the most traditional hard drink, harelka, closely related to Russian vodka, was distilled primarily from a rye malt.

Belarusians can boast of a huge variety of bliny (pancakes) of various thickness, plain and filled, made mostly of wheat or buckwheat flour, but also using oatmeal (tsadaviki).

Various kinds of cereal especially barley, oatmeal and buckwheat were common. Belarus was the likely centre of Europe’s buckwheat culture, and dishes made with this healthy grain used to be very popular: various kinds of buns, cakes and dumplings which, except for the well-known &quot;kasha&quot;, no longer exist today.

The main vegetables were cabbage (often made into sauerkraut) and beets, while turnips, swedes, parsnip and carrots both stewed and boiled (with the addition of a small amount of milk) were somewhat less popular. As elsewhere in Europe, legumes were the main source of protein, mainly in the form of kamy (puree of peas or beans with melted lard).



[[Haladnik]], a cold sour soup of beet, beet tops or [[rumex|dock]] (a sour plant of the buckwheat family, growing everywhere in the wild) served with [[sour cream]], boiled [[egg (food)|eggs]] and potatoes) for a long time was the subject of jeers from Belarus' Polish neighbours – until they borrowed this dish in the late 18th century, when it became a fixture in Polish cuisine.


[[Kalduny]], small boiled dumplings related to [[Russian cuisine|Russian]] [[pelmeni]] and Italian [[ravioli]], were produced in endless combinations of dough, filling and sauce. Especially popular were Count Tyshkevich’s kalduny (filled with a mixture of fried local mushrooms and smoked [[ham]]). In the late 19th century kalduny began to be made with grated potato rather than with a flour-based dough and, unfortunately, the former huge variety of fillings shrank considerably. Today, kalduny have to struggle vigorously to regain their former popularity, now overtaken by Russian pelmeni. Sadly, this is true of many traditional Belarusian dishes which lost their places both on tables and in minds to the standardized and faceless cuisine of the Soviet period.

The main [[dairy products]] include a kind of [[cottage cheese]], once a common offering to [[Paganism|pagan]] deities, and sour cream which is widely (if not ruthlessly!) used in cooking. Only in the mid-19th century was fermented [[cheese]] was borrowed from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]], and the local version of [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] was very popular for decades in the [[Russian Empire]]. Sour [[butter]] from the former [[Dzisna]] county was proudly exported to [[England]], where it continued to be the most expensive variety up to [[World War I]]. Today, however, these traditions have become a thing of the past.

Traditional drinks include [[biarozavik]], a fermented [[birch sap]]; thick [[saladukha]], made of [[rye]] floor and [[honey]]; [[kisiel]], the traditional jelly drink of all Slavonic peoples, previously made of oatmeal floor, now is made with potato flour flavoured with pulp of various [[forest berries]].

[[Image:Babka Potato Dish-2.jpg|thumb|200px|Babka]]

Belarusian cuisine owes much to [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish cooking]], since for centuries [[Jews]] had a virtual monopoly on inn-keeping. In the 19th century Jewish influence was especially noticeable in bringing in potato dishes of German origin, such as [[babka]] (the [[kugel]] of the Jewish cuisine). This was a two-way gastronomic street, for the famous bulba latkes, the potato pancakes of the East European Jews, bear a Belarusian name, since Belarusians prefer to call them [[draniki]]; both draniki and bulba [[latkes]] are Belarusian words, but &quot;latkes&quot; is now primarily used to describe the dish in Jewish cuisine. The potato became so common in 19th century – there are some 300+ dishes recorded in Belarus – that it came to be considered the core of the national cuisine. In the [[Soviet Union]], Belarusians were scornfully called [[bulbashi]], potato-eaters; today this humiliating cliché of the Soviet times is beginning to fade. Another important minority ethnic group which influenced Belarusian cuisine were the [[Tartars]], whose cuisine was especially strong in various cakes with fillings, mutton and vegetable dishes.

The political upheavals of the 20th century completely wiped out the former privileged classes, gentry and bourgeoisie, the bearers of more sophisticated and western-oriented spiritual and material culture. Many traditional upper and middle class dishes went down the path of oblivion. The very idea of a separate Belarusian cuisine was treated with suspicion. Only after World War II did it occur to the communist authorities that the proclaimed ‘flourishing of national culture’ ([[Stalin]] even thrust Belarusian puppet ‘state’ upon the founders of the [[UN]] in [[1945]]) should also be evident in the cuisine. The only source which was permitted for such a culinary reconstruction, however, was the heritage of the poorest peasants as of the [[1880s]], a time when primitive rural lifestyle was already on the wane. Chefs were instructed by the Party, however, to create the new Belarusian cuisine from scratch. And so it was. Dish names, recipes, kitchenware – all were reinvented anew, as though ten centuries of history had never existed. Only the sudden and (for many) unexpected advent of independence in [[1991]] brought an opportunity to restore these lost traditions, and a great deal still remains to be done here.

Modern Belarusian cuisine is still heavily influenced by its recent Soviet past, and many local restaurants feature Russian, or Soviet dishes rather than true specialties of local cuisine. Belarusians are far are more concerned with getting to know Italian, [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] cuisine than with the careful restoration of their own culinary heritage. However, draniki (both plain and stuffed), boršč, haladnik, mačanka, zrazy, cold meat rolls, eggs stuffed with mushrooms, [[halubtsy]], fried ‘shoved-with-a-finger’ pork sausage and bliny are likely to be found everywhere, as well as sour rye bread.

Typical salads are made of a fairly short list of ingredients: endless combinations of boiled beef or [[chicken]], potato, beet, carrot, [[apple]], [[herring]], diced cheese, canned [[pea]]s and [[sweetcorn|corn]], canned fish, ‘crab fingers’, [[onion]]s and mushrooms, and are generously seasoned with [[mayonnaise]] or [[sunflower oil]]. Soups are much more authentic, both hot ([[shchi]], boršč, [[sorrel]] soup) and especially cold sour soups which provide cooling relief during the hot summer. Pork dishes are usually fried or stewed, with cheese or mushrooms seasoning. Beef steaks are also quite frequent, but mutton, once very popular, is almost entirely limited to Caucasian or Central Asian restaurants.

Historically, Belarusians had little contact with fish from the sea, and this is still evident in the cuisine. The most common sea fish (after herring, which has been the most common appetizer all along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast and its vicinity ever since the 14th century) are [[hake]] and [[cod]] and there are relatively few dishes with such fish. Much more traditional and common are lake fish, notably [[zander]], cooked in endless ways, and [[carp]] (especially the famous stuffed carp, the gefilte fisch of Jewish cuisine). [[Eel]]s, smoked or stuffed, are the specialty of the lake country in the northwestern part of Belarus, adjacent to [[Latvia]] and Lithuania.

[[Garnish]]es are usually boiled, fried or mashed potatoes, [[rice]] or [[pasta]]. Meat dishes are frequently served with bliny or draniki in rounded clay pots. While Belarusians consider kasha (cereals) as rather ordinary dishes and cook them frequently at home, they are more rarely found in restaurants.

Kvass is still the main local soft drink, although it is increasingly made of [[sugar]]s and flavorings which imitate natural flavorings rather than with genuine rye malt. Every small town boasts a local variety of [[mineral water]], which is probably the country’s main mineral resource. Belarusians prefer carbonated water. Local harelkas (vodkas) are very good, notably those with birch sap or various forest [[herb]]s, and are popular with lovers of strong drink. Mead and many other similar drinks made of honey and spices, which were very common up to the 19th century, and then were more or less rarely found until the present, are mainly represented by [[krambambula]], perhaps better known for its odd name than for its specific taste. Which also contains fried salmon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About ==
'''Inkscape''' is a free open source scalable vector graphics (svg) editor application. Its stated goal is to become a powerful graphic tool while being fully compliant with the [[XML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[HTML5]] standards. 

Inkscape is for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X (under X11), and other Unix-like operating systems. As of 2013, Inkscape is under active development, with new features being added regularly. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is not at svg 1.1 standards; most notably, it does not support animations, and SVG fonts. However, complete support for both is on the [http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap roadmap].  As of this writing inkscape is at version 0.48.  The version numbering goal is to release a fully svg 1.1 compliant editor, labelled inkscape 1.1.

Inkscape has good multi-lingual support particularly for complex scripts, something currently lacking in most commercial vector graphics applications. 

=== History ===
Inkscape began in 2003 as a fork of the Sodipodi project.  Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was itself based on Gill, the work of Raph Levien.

The fork was led by a team of four former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, Nathan Hurst, and ''MenTaLguY'') who identified differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and SVG compliance as their reasons for forking. Inkscape, they claimed, would seek to focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development had emphasized creating a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Initial announcement of Inkscape fork on Sodipodi mailing list | url = http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3416220&amp;forum_id=3970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since the fork, Inkscape has, among other things, changed from using the C to [[C++|C++]]; changed to the GTK+ toolkit C++ bindings (gtkmm); redesigned the user interface and added a number of new features.  Its implementation of the SVG standard has shown gradual improvement, but is still incomplete.

Rather than top-down governance, its developers claim to encourage an equal culture where authority stems from an individual developer's abilities and active involvement in the project.  As a result, the project places special emphasis on giving full access to its source code repository to all active developers, and on participation in the larger open source community (often in the form of inter-project initiatives and secondary projects like the Open Clip Art Library). While the project founders are still well-represented in the decision-making process, many newcomers have also come to play prominent roles. Among them is &quot;bulia byak&quot;, architect of the profound user interface changes that have given Inkscape its present appearance.

Inkscape is currently a Google Summer of Code and linuxfund.org projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Google Summer of Code entry in the Inkscape developers' wiki | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interface and usability ===
One of the priorities of the Inkscape project is interface consistency and usability. This includes efforts to follow the GNOME Human interface guidelines compliance, universal keyboard accessibility, and convenient on-canvas editing. Inkscape has achieved significant progress in usability since the project started.

The interface of Sodipodi (Inkscape's predecessor) was partly based on those of CorelDRAW and GIMP. The current Inkscape interface has been partially influenced by that of Xara Xtreme.

The number of floating dialog boxes has been reduced, with their functions available using keyboard shortcuts or in the docked toolbars in the editing window. The tool controls bar at the top of the window always displays the controls relevant to the current tool. 

All transformations (not only moving but also scaling and rotating) have keyboard shortcuts with consistent modifiers (e.g. Alt transforms by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom, Shift multiplies the transformation by 10, etc.); these keys work on nodes in Node tool as well as on objects in Selector. The most common operations (such as transformations, zooming, z-order) have convenient one-key shortcuts. 

Inkscape provides floating/mouse-over tooltips and status bar hints for all buttons, controls, commands, keys, and on-canvas handles. It comes with a complete keyboard and mouse reference (in HTML and SVG) and several interactive tutorials in SVG.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Kinetic Theory==

An ideal gas is one which has molecules of negligible size, and with negligible interactions, excluding elastic collisions with each other and perhaps the walls of the container.  Furthermore, when dealing with ideal gases, we assume that they have a uniform pressure, temperature, and that they fill up the container (although there are times when we will drop this assumption, but we will always assume it is true for a sufficiently small volume).  We will also neglect gravitational potential energy.  While it seems that we are placing too many restrictions on the gas, it is gives very accurate results when applied to gases of relatively high temperature and relatively low pressure -- that is, the molecules are far apart and moving quickly.  For example, it would be a good approximation of neon at atmospheric pressure and 20 degrees Celsius.  

From our postulates, we will derive some useful information about ideal gases.  First, let's look at pressure.  If we have a piston, and molecules are colliding with it (i.e. there is a pressure on it), how much force do we need to keep it in place?  If during each second, the piston were to gain some momentum from the molecules, it is the forces job to impart the same momentum the other way.  In other words, the momentum per second delivered by the molecules is the force we need to apply.  We know this is equal to the pressure times the area (we assumed the pressure is uniform).  If the molecules make perfectly elastic collisions, then the total momentum delivered is &lt;math&gt;2mv_x&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, nothing heats up; when the piston is in thermal equilibrium with the environment, then the collisions are essentially elastic, because nothing is getting hotter.

Now, we will find how many molecules hit the piston in a given time dt.  If the molecules are traveling in the x direction with velocity &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;, and there are n molecules per unit volume, then there are &lt;math&gt;1/2 n v_x A dt&lt;/math&gt; collisions.  You can easily see this by imagining a rectangular prism of area A and thickness v_x dt, and since half (because half are going the other way) of these molecules are going to hit the wall, you get the desired result.  Therefore, the collisions per second is &lt;math&gt;1/2 n v_x A&lt;/math&gt;.  By multiplying the momentum per collision by the collisions per second, we get momentum per second, &lt;math&gt; n A m v_x^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The pressure is therefore &lt;math&gt;nmv_x^2&lt;/math&gt;.  However, this is only true if all the molecules have the same x-velocity component.  If we average the force over all the different speeds the molecules could have, we get &lt;math&gt; nm &lt;v_x^2&gt; &lt;/math&gt;.  This is ''not'' the same as &lt;math&gt;nm &lt;v_x&gt;^2&lt;/math&gt; because the second one is zero!  It is important that we find the pressure, ''then'' average, because the average momentum per collision times the average collisions per second is ''not'' the average momentum per second.

In any case, the pressure is

&lt;math&gt;P = nm &lt;v_x^2&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the gas is uniform, &lt;math&gt;&lt;v_x^2&gt; = &lt;v_y^2&gt; = &lt;v_z^2&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;P = 1/3 nm &lt;v^2&gt; = 2/3 n (1/2 m &lt;v^2&gt;) = 2/3 n U&lt;/math&gt;

where U is the total internal energy of the gas.  Actually, this is only true if there is no machinery inside the molecule, like vibrations and the sort.  Replacing n by N/V, we have

&lt;math&gt;PV = 2/3 U&lt;/math&gt;.

Per [[WB:AN]], let's get consensus before deleting this book.
WK's comments:
{{TextBox|This book has been transwikied to the Simple English wikibooks, and now somebody is nominating the pages in it for deletion. I personally am against deleting this book for a number of reasons. Just because they have a copy of it doesnt mean that we can't have a copy of it as well. I would like to ask all admins to refrain from speedy deleting any of these pages until we can get some kind of consensus on it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:01, 17 August 2007 (UTC)}}

: I was considering doing the same thing. I'd say we should '''Keep''' it because it's got pretty substantive content and it has a different audience (ESL) from the other math books so I think it qualifies as a worthwhile fork, if you can even call it that. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:07, 25 August 2007 (UTC)

'''Delete''': There are very few active contributers to this book and forking it into two projects will only harm the progress of the book.  There can always be a link on the Math bookshelf to the version on SE Wikibooks.  A good compromise may be to keep the book, but include a message at the top saying something like: {{TextBox|This is an archived version of this book, the current version can be found on [[:simple:Algebra_I|Simple English Wikibooks]].  If you would like to contribute, please make your edits there.}}  I would also suggest protecting the page from editing to encourage only one active version of the book. --[[Ezrakatz|Ezra Katz]] 17:49, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' (or merge) - I'm strongly against any option that forces Wikibookians to work on a specific version, we should give incentive for merging when possible, not go and impose it on users. If the book is stale (as in no one is working on it) mark it for a merge (if you can't commit to it).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:27, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Its well within the project scope and doesn't violate any policies. I don't think enough time has passed yet to say its doomed here or that new contributers won't want to work on it, nor is it in such a state that it would be unlikely anyone would want to contribute to it. The book could be renamed such as &quot;Basic Algebra&quot; to remove Simple English from the title and any conjunction that may be associated with it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:25, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Please note that the import of this book has '''not''' been completed yet, so don't delete it here (if that's what you decide to do) until that happens.  Thanks!  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]]|[[Special:Contributions/Cromwellt|contribs]] 21:12, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. In response to [[User:Ezra Katz]], above, I don't feel that forking this book will have a negative impact on the book whatsoever. I would say that en.wikibooks and simple.wikibooks share few contributors, and an effort on that website to write a version of it won't impact our ability to maintain a version here. Furthermore, if we want to talk about the raw benefit to the book based on it's location, I would say that en.wikibooks is the winner hands-down: we have more editors, more active editors, and are more likely to attract contributors to the book then the simple english project is. If the book can only be in one place, and we want the book to succeed, it should be here.  That much aside, I can see that there is some conflict between the book's title &quot;...in simple english&quot; for which the solution is to rename the book to &quot;simple algebra&quot; or something similar. Nowhere on en.wikibooks is it written that books may not use various english-subsets (such as simple english). In fact, we encourage book authors to specify what language will be used throughout the book, because there is no single &quot;standard&quot; english dialect among wikibooks contributors. It is perfectly acceptable for a book here to specify that it is written in a simplified english dialect, and that does not mean we are going to transwiki it to a different project and delete it here. As an aside, if we are going to talk about unnecessary forking of material between projects, this might be a good moment for simple.english contributors to consider moving their efforts to en.wikibooks where we can avoid all forks. We could even make a &quot;Simple English&quot; bookshelf or whatever else was needed to keep related materials organized. I doubt there will be any takers for this proposal, but it's worth a try. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:20, 27 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' There's no reason to have two versions of this book. [[User:Cybiko123|Cybiko123]] 04:13, 30 August 2007 (UTC)
**To be fair, there aren't two versions of it here. We only have one version, and we have no policy that forbids materials to be forked to an external site. We cannot be making deletion decisions here based on what content other websites chose to keep. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:46, 31 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I don't see any need to delete en.wikibooks' fork of this textbook. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:54, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

==A New Course in Mandarin==

===An Introduction===
(tones, initials, finals)

*[[Chinese/Pinyin Pronunciation]]
*[[Chinese/Pronunciation of Initials]]
*[[Chinese/Pronunciation of Finals]]
*[[Chinese/Using Tones]]

===First Words in Mandarin===

These first words you'll learn are called ''pictographic characters''. They are characters that look similar to what they represent (although over the years they may have deformed slightly). Numbers, although not pictographic, will also be introduced.

''Numbers''
# 一 yī
# 二 èr
# 三 sān
# 四 sì
# 五 wǔ
# 六 liù
# 七 qī
# 八 bā
# 九 jiǔ
# 十 shí
100. 百 bǎi

If you want to go over 10, just do (for example, 15, 21, 99): 十五  shíwǔ (ten-five), 二十一 èrshíyī (two-ten-one), &amp; 九十九 jiǔshíjiǔ (nine-ten-nine)


''First Words''
*人 rén person
*土 tǔ earth, land
*大 dà big
*木 mù wood**
*目 mù eye**
*王 wáng king
*口 kǒu mouth
*小 xiǎo small
*手 shǒu hand
*月 yuè moon***
*日 rì sun, day***
*田 tián farmland

.* *You may have noticed that and are pronounced the same, but are different characters. This happens frequently in Chinese, since there are only a limited amount of combinations that can be used with tones, initials, and finals.

.* * *These may be used in dates (三月二日 sānyuè èrrì [third moon, second sun] March 2nd)

===The use of radicals===

===1. Greeting People===

===2. Nationality and Status===</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Heilbronn_Handkran_20050828.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A 19th century crane on a canal in Germany.]]A pulley is a wheel with a groove along its edge, that holds a rope or cable. Usually, two or more pulleys are used together. When pulleys are used together in this way, they reduce the amount of force needed to lift a load. A crane uses pulleys to help it lift heavy loads. Pulleys are one of the six simple machines.

== Who invented it? ==
The origin of pulleys is not known, but there is evidence that they were used in the building of Stonehenge, in England.  One of the first names we associate with pulleys is that of Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist born in Syracuse (a Greek seaport colony).  Archimedes studied many areas of science and invented many devices, and it is said that he used pulleys to drag a ship out of the ocean and onto land. Archimedes did not hold public office but devoted his entire lifetime to research and experiment.  He was educated at Euclid's school in Alexandria, a major world city of the time, located in modern-day Egypt.  Many of Archimedes' experiments impact on our daily lives today...

== How does it get power? ==
[[Image:Polispasto2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A compound pulley.]]It gets its power by trading distance for effort. With a 2 pulley system, you can use half as much force to lift something, but you have to pull the rope two meters to lift an object one meter.

Why does that work?  It's actually because of a concept called work.  You know that if you walk 2 miles (3km) to school, it's harder than if you had to walk 1 mile to school.  How much effort does each step take?  The effort is however much it takes to move your body.  Scientists and engineers call how much effort you use over a distance '''work'''.  A real rough equation is to say '''&lt;math&gt;W=F*d&lt;/math&gt;''' (this isn't exactly true).  So, if you pull the rope in a 2 pulley system 2-ft (60cm) (. with 1-lb force, then you did 2-ftlbs. (read &quot;foot pounds&quot;) of work, which is the same amount of work as pulling just a rope 1-ft. with 2-lb force.  One consequence of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics is doing the same process (like lifting a box 1 ft) takes the same amount of work, no matter what.  So you can use any force you want, as long as you do the same amount of work.

== How does it work? ==
A pulley is a rope wrapped around a wheel. It changes the direction of force. A basic compound pulley has a rope attached to a stationary point looped around one wheel and then around a second wheel. Pulling on the rope pulls the two wheels closer together.

[[Image:HMCS_Oriole_lines_2.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Block and tackle on a sailing ship. Pulleys are used on a ship to adjust and tighten the sails.]]
== How dangerous is it? ==
Care must be taken to avoid getting fingers, loose clothing, and hair caught in its workings.  Also since pulleys are often used to lift heavy objects one should be careful.  If the rope, cable, or hardware which mounts a pulley were to fail, serious injury could result if you happen to be under the load.  One must be careful not to exceed the documented rating of lifting equipment.

== What does it do? ==
It is used to pull two things closer together.  It can be used to lift heavy objects (by pulling the heavy object closer to something above). It is sometimes used as a trap. the person would hook a net to the pulley's rope and then the person would wait until what he wanted to catch is caught.

== How does it vary? ==
[[Image:Crane_Pulley.jpg|thumb|255px|left|Pulleys on a crane are used to lift building materials high in the air in order to build tall buildings.]]You can add or subtract pulleys from the system.  More pulleys makes it easier to pull (or they allow you to pull a heavier load), but you have to pull more rope to move the load by the same amount.

Many different types of pulley systems exist.  For an example, the average sailboat may have 3 or 4 different pulley systems (boomvang, cunningham, outhaul, mainsheet), all doing different things.

== How has it changed the world? ==
Pulleys allow people to pull heavier objects around than they could using only their muscles.  This allowed ancient countries to build large sailing ships and explore the world, because people would not be able to pull the sails into the right place without them.  Pulleys can also pull large stone blocks upward, and so they help people to build large buildings.

== What ideas and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==
Rope and the wheel.

Form 1LSS51
==Section I Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===
IDENTIFY 

This is a Conclusion question.
* [[w:en:Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Mozart]]

===Question 02===
===Question 03===
===Question 04===
===Question 05===
'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a Method of Argument question.
* [[w:en:gamma ray|gamma ray]]
* [[w:en:salmonella|salmonella]]

'''READ'''

Proponent and Opponent discusses the merit of gamma ray radiation of food.

'''ANALYZE'''

Your task is to evaluate how the opponent's argument proceeds.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. There is no ambiguity in a crucial term here.

(B) Incorrect. No self-contradition mentioned.

(C) Incorrect. The proponent only proposes one remedy which is irration by gamma ray.

(D) Incorrect. Safety with respect to producers is not discussed at all in the passage.

'''''(E) Correct.''''' This response suggests an alternative means- using a safe chemical dip. This method without the particular disadvantage which is leaving Salmonella intact.

===Question 12===
* [http://library.thinkquest.org/19037/therapy2.html gene splicing]

===Question 13===
===Question 14===
'''IDENTIFY'''

This is an Assumption question. You need to analyze the formal logic strcture of this passage to answer the question.
* novelist
* academia

'''READ'''

Some difficult words are here such as intersperse.

'''ANALYZE'''

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. This response introduces a foreign concept of impartiality which is irrelevant in the passage.

(B) Incorrect. the powers of observation and analysis is only useful but not required.  This needs not be assumed.  The passage focuses on the intuitive grasp of the emotions and response (B) does not impact the central logic.

(C) Incorrect. Participation in life is not required at all. The logic of the argument hinges on the intuitive grasp which does not require participation.

'''(D) Correct.''' To see if this assumption is vital, suppose this reponse is negated.  Novelists can be great without an grasp of the emotions.  The factor which prevented the people in the academia from becoming a great novelist is gone! The author can no longer argue that you can't be great if one remain in the academia.

(E) Incorrect. This one is an attractive choice.  The key here is the difference between knowledge and an intuitive grasp. The passage leads us to differentiate the aspects of emotions that can be grasped by observing and analyzing them as a dutiful scholar would do.  The author argues that there are intangible aspects of the emotions that the scholars miss and that aspects had to be experienced by immersing oneself in real life.  Just like you can read about law school but it is nothing like experiencing one.

* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073122/tracheophyte tracheophyte]
* [[w:en:Pteropsid|Pteropsida]]
* [[w:en:Hominidae|Hominidae]]

The argument follows:
* c --&gt; ~t
* p --&gt; t (cpositive:  ~t --&gt; ~p)
* ~p --&gt; h

So it leads: c --&gt; ~t --&gt; ~p --&gt; h, thus All members of the family H are C.

Passage 4 Law
* Ronald Dworkin
* natural law
* legal positivism

===Question 21===
===Question 22===
===Question 23===
===Question 24===
I can NOT figure out why the answer is E here. Can anyone help??

Another reminder why reading a sentence for its ''full'' meaning is so important on the LSAT. Look at line 27. &quot;According to Dworkin, this account is incompatible with the actual practice of judges and lawyers, who act as if there is a fact of the matter even in cases where there is no consensus. The theory he proposes seeks to validate this practice without falling into what Dwokin correctly sees as the error of natural law theory.&quot; 

Reading the entire sentence gives you E, and helps on question 25 as well.

As with all games, the key to understanding this game is to understand the rules behind it. Because the explanation of the rules can be confusing I will lay them out in an easier format.

1. &quot;A train makes 5 stops around a loop through 5 stations P Q R S T, in that order - stopping at exactly three of the stations on each trip.&quot; Because the game does not state which states are stopped at first, any 3 of the 5 options can be picked as the first stations. Even though this is a 'loop' do not bother yourself with drawing a circle describing the stops. Simply write five vertical lines of the stations that are stopped at during each trip.

2. &quot;The train stops at any given station on exactly 3 trips, but not on three consecutive trips.&quot; This is says the train will hit every station exactly 3 times in the course of 5 stops, but will not stop at that stations 3 times in a row.

3. &quot;The train stops at any given station at least once in any two consecutive trips.&quot; This says that the train must stop at least once, could be more than once, at a station within two trips.

The inferences on this game are tricky, but try to map it out on paper. If you try to move more than one station per trip, you end up over lapping too many stations by the 5th trip and you are left with stations that have 3 consecutive trips. You can only move one station per trip to keep the rules in line.

==Section I Analytical Reasoning==
===Game 1===

This is an easy game. Each person needs to be assigned a food.  There are six people and five entrees. 


====Question 01====
This is an elimination question. In this case a subset of the foods he could eat isn't sufficient -- the correct answer will have all possible foods.
 
Pork chops is in all answers, so forget about it-- he can eat it.

Roast beef from answer A  -- going through the rules one by one, there is no reason he can't eat it. This eliminates answer B which doesn't have roast beef. A is still in the running. 

Sword fish from C -- Lewis' wife is Marie, Marie orders swordfish, and two people in a couple can't order the same food. This eliminates answer C and E. 

This leaves us with B and D. If Lewis can eat either tilefish or veal cutlet, D is the answer. Going through the rules, there is no reason he couldn't eat either. 

(Two rules to watch out for here is the one specifying that neither John nor Nat orders fish, and that none of the men order the same thing.  This could run into a situation that once Lewis chooses a non-fish entree, such as veal cutlet, that either John or Nat have to choose a fish dish. This is not the case, however, as there are two other non-fish entrees. This could have been important, and will likely prove critical later in the game.)

The answer is D.

====Question 02====
 
A - John can't order fish. False. &lt;BR&gt;
B - No obvious problem with this -- Kate and Nat aren't married and there aren't other restrictions on her.&lt;BR&gt;
C - Two men can't eat the same thing. False&lt;BR&gt;
D - Marie order swordfish, Olive roast beef. False&lt;BR&gt;
E - Nat and Olive are married and can't order the same thing. False.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The answer is B.

====Question 03 ====

A - Neither John nor Nat order fish dishes. Thus they must order from among pork chops, roast beef and veal cutlet. They can't order the same thing as each other, and Nat can't order roast beef. Thus Nat must order veal cutlet or pork chops. A is true.&lt;BR&gt;
B - Since A is true, we don't have to go further, but if you want to confirm, Nat must order veal or pork chops. John can order pork chops, roast beef or veal cutlet. We know from 1 that Lewis can order four different dishes. False.&lt;BR&gt;
C - one woman orders roast, one orders swordfish. False.&lt;BR&gt;
D - Lewis can order a fish entree. False.&lt;BR&gt;
E. We know Marie orders swordfish, and Olive doesn't order fish.Could Kate order a fish entree? There's no reason why she couldn't from the rules. False.&lt;BR&gt;

The answer is A.

====Question 04====

A  - If John orders veal cutlet, Kate could order roast beef. Does she have to? No.&lt;BR&gt;
B - Same as A.  Not necessarily true.&lt;BR&gt;
C - Lewis can eat all the things in 1D, but not veal cutlet now because John ordered it and no men can order the same entree.&lt;BR&gt;
D - Lewis can't order what John orders. False.&lt;BR&gt;
E - Working from reasoning in Question 3, Nat must order veal or pork chops. If John has already ordered veal, Nat must order pork chops. Must be true.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The answer is E.

'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a [[Past LSAT Explained/Formal Logic(LR)|Formal Logic]] &amp; [[Past LSAT Explained/Parallel_Reasoning(LR)|Parallel Reasoning]] question.

'''READ'''

This is an argument about your money and spending power.

'''ANALYZE'''

A→B B→C A→C

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect.

(B) Incorrect.

(C) Correct.

(D) Incorrect.

(E) Incorrect.

===Question 02===
* astrology
* Gemini
* personality test
* poll
* correlation

IDENTIFY

This is a Flaw question.

READ

A reporting about a survey to uncover a relationship between two factors.

ANALYZE

The first part of the passage describes a survey and how it was done. The last sentence, the conclusion claims that one's astrological birth sign influence one's personality.  You need to find a choice that discredits the survey result since the conclusion bases its validity on it.

CHOOSE

(A) Incorrect. This is not a flaw. We need a further evidence that the scorers were incompetent or the administration suffered from poor management.  The passage provides none of such evidence.

(B) Incorrect. This strengthens the argument. Remember this is not a Strengthen/Weaken question.

(C) Incorrect. This does not address the flaw and somewhat strengthens the argument.

(D) Incorrect. This does not address the flaw but somewhat strengthens the argument since it provides some credence to the survey result.

'''(E) Correct.''' If the survey result is not representative of the whole population that it is skewed. This type of question appeals often on the LSAT.  For instance, when a political party surveys voter's preference using online survey, it is going to overpresent younger and more tech savvy  people who tend to be more liberal.

===Question 03===
* [[w:en:calisthenics|calisthenics]]
* [[w:en:education|education]]

'''IDENTIFY'''

This is an [[Past LSAT Explained/Assumption(LR)|Assumption]] question.

'''READ'''

The author is arguing for the merit of calisthenics in improving the American kids' physical fitness.  
* indispensible

'''ANALYZE'''
To show that, you need to prove that there are some causal link between calisthenics and improved fitness. A good test is to see if the argument still stands if you falsify the choice.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect.  This is not necessary.  What if a majority or significant number of students still benefit from calisthenics?  The author's argument still works. So when you see a choice like this, pay attention to words like &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Every&quot;.  These words should ring a bell to you.

(B) Incorrect. 

(C) Incorrect. This choice is totally out of scope.  It is so important to not bring in any preconception or bias into the question.  Maybe we are not concerned about health really- you could say we want the children to be fit to train them as better solders.  

(D) Correct.

(E) Incorrect.

==Section I Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===
* [[w:Mars|Mars]]
* [[w:technology|technology]]
* [[w:Breathing apparatus|Breathing apparatus]]
'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a Main Point/Conclusion question.

'''READ'''

This is a long stimulus discussing human technology and Mars.  The author is arguing in favor of research on how to change the Martian climate.

'''ANALYZE'''

Your job is to find the main conclusion of the argument.  All the points are leading you to endorse the Project Mars- Make it Livable. Why? The author is saying that even if the effort fails to produce the end result, we will gain something.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. This is only a premise of the argument. It only restates the first sentence of the passage. For this choice to be correct the stimulus should look like this:

It is probably within the reach of human technology to make the climate of Mars inhabitable. After several centuries of efforts, humans built great temples and cathedrals that were deemed impossible when they began. As the human triggered global warming shows that humans are capable of changing the climate of Earth, we are more than capable to change the clmate of Mars, which is only a fraction in size compare to Earth.

(B) Incorrect. This is another point discussed in the passage. The sentence 2 states that &quot;It might be several centuries before...&quot;.  For this choice to be correct, the passage should look like:

It is probably within the reach of human technology to make the climate of Mars inhabitable. But some of the world's great temples and cathedrals took centuries to build and it might take more than that to alter the climate of Mars. Based on the current technology we have available, we estimate that it would take 1000 years of continuous efforts before the Martian climate becomes similar to the climate of Earth. 

(C) Incorrect. This is an analogy mentioned in the passage. This statement is too un-conclusion like to be considered the main point.  Rarely an argument is constructed to argue that A is like B.  One is a traditional construction project while the other is space science project.

'''(D) Correct.''' The sentence 3 nicely expresses the main point. Note that the main point is located in the middle of the passage. 

(E) Incorrect. This is a premise that preempts any counterargument that the effort to change climate is wasted.  OK, the isuccess rate is so low that we may never succeed but we will learn something along the way that is worthwhile.  Good.

''Additional Questions''

'''The claim that some temples and cathedrals took centuries plays which of the following roles in the argument?'''

(A) Provides an example of a project that took a long time to complete

'''Which of the following weakens the argument?'''

(B) Any human effort to influence the climate of Mars is so destructive to the planet that it makes it even less inhabitable.

===Question 02===
* [[w:adult|adult]]
* [[w:adolescent|adolescent]]

'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a first part of Dual question.  You need to identify the hidden assumption.

'''READ'''

The question discusses two things- adults and adolescents. 

'''ANALYZE'''

The key to look for is the link between the premises and conclusion. If you severe that link, the argument collapses. The structure of the argument is like:

 AT has v so AS should have v too.
 AT and AS are not same so AT can't represent the aspect of AS that is different.
 If AT cannot represent the interests of AS, then AS should have v.

A and B are different.
Sentence 4 say &quot;If adults cannot represent the interests of adolescents..&quot; 

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. This is a sweeping claim that has inadequate support in the passage. There are people other than adolescents and adults such as infants. Moreover, your instinct should tell you that this argument is not true in reality because minors usually do not have the right to vote.  

(B) Incorrect. 

(C) Correct.

(D) Incorrect. 

(E) Incorrect.

Additional question

'''The main point of the argument is that'''

Adolescents should be allowed to vote.

'''If the statement above is true, which of the following must be true?'''

(A) Adults can represent the interests of adolescents if adolescents cannot vote.

(B) If adults cannot represent the interests of adolescents and adolescents are not allowed to vote, the interests of adolescents will not be represented. 

(C) Though superficially different, adults and adolescents are similar in one crucial aspect.

===Question 03===
IDENTIFY

This question is a Method of Argument question.

READ

Same as the question 02.

ANALYZE

The sentence 2 says &quot;Admittedly&quot;. The author ''concedes'' that they are not the same.

CHOOSE

(A) Incorrect. The passage is not about proving that adults and teenagers are different.

(B) Incorrect. Nowhere there is any clarification. For this choice to be true, the passage should say something like &quot;Admittedly, adults include anyone over the age of 18 while adolescents are anyone between 12 to 18.&quot;

(C) Incorrect. This choice is tempting but see Sentence 2 actually weakens the main point. AT and AD aren't same so why give AD what AT has?

(D) Incorrect. It addresses a point but it does not distract.  The point is actually relevant.

'''(E) Correct.''' 

Additional Questions
'''
The main point of the argument is that
'''
Adolescents should be given the right to vote just like adults.

===Question 04===
'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a discrepancy question.

'''READ'''

Not being close to market or raw material can be reason for businesses to leave while high business tax isn't.  That is strange. So your job is to find the reason why is so.

'''ANALYZE'''

Your job is to find the reason that resolves the paradox.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. So what? The share in the city's revenue does not explain anything.

'''(B) Correct.''' This statement converts high tax rate into a plus. So tax wasn't bad after all.

(C) Incorrect. Pay attention to the word &quot;sometimes&quot;. You don't expect the businesses to stick with the city for eternity.  They could leave the city for some other reason. This is not a communist country.

(D) Incorrect.

(E) Incorrect.

* [[w:arabica|arabica]]
* [[w:coffee|coffee]]
* [[w:robusta|robusta]]
* [[w:decaffeination|decaffeination]]

'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a Conclusion question.

'''READ'''

For decaf coffee, people prefer robusta (inferior) over arabica (superior).  Making decaf coffee involves removing some coffee flavor. 

'''ANALYZE'''

Your job is to draw a valid inference based on the passage.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. The passage does not discuss the world output of arabica beans. Out of the scope.

(B) Incorrect. This is factualy true but not necessarily supported by the passage. You must not draw any conclusion based on your prior knowledge. Moreover, It does not explain why people prefer robusta over arabica when it comes to decaf coffee.

(C) Incorrect. This choice is not supported by the passage. Be careful with the word &quot;exclusively&quot;.

(D) Correct. Sound reasonable.

(E) Incorrect.  The passage mentions nothing about which is more pricey. (In reality, arabica is more expensive.) So not supported.

* [[w:history|history]]

'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a strengthen question.

'''READ'''

A history book contains inconsistencies and the author argues that it is because the author used info from divergent sources.

'''ANALYZE'''

You need to find the choice that strengthens the argument.

'''CHOOSE'''

(A) Incorrect. This choice is, tempting but contains ambiguous word &quot;generally&quot;.  What if authors sometimes do not reconcile discrepancies and leave then as they are?

(B) Incorrect. This is irrelevant. The inconsistencies may not be apparent to the laymen but obvious to professinal historians.

'''(C) Correct.''' If the author used sources that contained consistencies, then the inconsistencies are not due to the use of divergent sources. So this must be true.

(D) Incorrect. Even if the author did not know that the inconsistencies could arise, the argument still holds.  The fact that the inconsistencies occurred as a result of the historian's practice of using several sources does not change.

(E) Incorrect. OK, but so what?

This logic games asks us to order six factories on six consecutive days numbered 1-6. &lt;br&gt;
Each factory is inspected only once during those six days: F, G, '''H''', J, Q, R (Bold is the unaffected factory)&lt;br&gt;
This is a simple linear order problem &lt;br&gt;

Rules:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. F is inspected on day 1 or day 6 &lt;br&gt;
2. J is inspected on some day earlier than Q &lt;br&gt;
3. Q is inspected the exactly one day before R &lt;br&gt;
4. If G is inspected on day 3, then Q is inspected on day 5 &lt;br&gt;

Deductions: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Because Q is immediately inspected before R, then we can add this statement (statement 3) to statement 4 and statement 1: If G is inspected on day 3, then Q is inspected on day 5 and R is inspected on day 6 and F is inspected on day 1. &lt;br&gt;

==Section IV Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===

The advertisement erroneously concludes that all Sturdimades can drive long distances because some Sturdimades have driven for at least 100,000 miles.  The flaw in the advertisement's logic is similar to one thinking that because some highschool graduates have gone to Harvard, all highschool graduates will go to Harvard.

Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.  As the answer says, the advertisement draws a general conclusion (that any Studrdimade one purchases can be relied upon to drive for a very long distance) from cases selected only on the basis of having a characteristic that favors that conclusion (the cases were selected from a group of cars belonging to the &quot;long distance&quot; club). 

Choice B - This choice is wrong because the conclusion doesn't actually restate the evidence.  It just uses the evidence to make an illogically drawn recommendation.

Choice C - This choice is incorrect because there is no ambiguous term used in the premises that is in need of clarification.

Choice D - This choice is incorrect because even though the evidence doesn't logically support the conclusion (it is flawed), it doesn't undermine it either.

Choice E - This choice is incorrect because there is no mention of popular opinion in the advertisement.  While members of the &quot;long-distance&quot; club are said to boast about how long they have driven their Sturdimade, no opinion is offered as evidence.  The only opinions offered are those by the advertisement--&quot;Among popular automobiles, Sturdimades stand apart.&quot; and &quot;Clearly, if you buy a Sturdimade you can rely on being able to drie it for a very long distance.&quot;

===Question 02===

As the question indicates, this is an assumption question.  Basically, the conclusion of this statement is that the university's computer center will not be able to operate for the coming year.  The evidence given to support this is that the university's board of trustees reduced the computer center's budget from $4 million to $1.5 million and that the center cannot operate on less than $2.5 million.  One other fact that is mentioned is that the board cannot divert funds from other programs to the computer center, but this fact is irrelevant because we've already been told that the budget was cut from $4 million to $1.5 million, which is a given.  So, we have to assume that if funds could be diverted, this option would have already been used.

Choice A - Although this choice may be plausible, it should be put on hold until the other choices are considered.  Once the other choices are considered this can be eliminated because it's not the BEST choice.  Besides, even if this is assumed, it would not guarantee the conclusion to be properly drawn.

Choice B - This choice is incorrect because the conclusion is not affected by whether or not one assumes the budgets of other programs at the university were also reduced.  If this assumption is not made, one can still conclude based on other assumptions that &quot;there is no way that the center can be kept operating for the coming year.&quot;

Choice C - This is the correct choice because the statement says that the center cannot operate on less than $2.5 million.  Assuming this is true and knowing that the board of trustees reduced the computer center's budget to $1.5 million, then the only way that the board could operate is to receive funding from another source.  Assuming that this is not a possibility, the statement's conclusion can be properly drawn.

Choice D - This choice is incorrect because the statement actually says that the board cannot divert funds from other programs to the computer center.  Because it is stated explicitly, it is not something that must be assumed for the conclusion to be logically drawn.

Choice E - While this statement may be true, it is not relevant and, therefore, is not a necessary assumption for the conclusion to be logically drawn.

===Question 03===

According to Muriel's statement, she does not consider Favilla to be a great writer because her subject matter is not varied enough. John argues that Muriel is wrong to use that criterion because a great writer doesn't need varied subject matter. According to John, a great writer needs to have the ability to explore a particular theme deeply. The question asks what is a point at issue between Muriel and John. Before reading the answer choices, you should be able to sift through the extraneous information to get to the core difference in John and Muriel's statements. Muriel thinks it is necessary for a writer to have varied subject matter in order to be great; whereas, John thinks it is necessary for a writer to explore a particular theme deeply in order to be considered great.

Choice A - This choice is incorrect because even though Muriel mentions that Favilla's subject matter is not varied enough, John never mentions whether or not he believes Favilla's subject matter to be varied or not.

Choice B - This choice is incorrect because even though it is not clear whether or not Muriel believes this to be a measure of a great writer, it is certain that John never mentions whether Favilla should or should not be a great writer or that he believes Favilla's style to be distinctive.

Choice C - This is the correct choice because it is clear that they represent opposing view points on this issue. Muriel says that Favilla does not deserve to be considered a great writer because her subject matter is not varied enough. John responds by stating that he believes she is wrong to use that criterion. He then says, &quot;A great writer does not need any diversity in subject matter.&quot; Thus, Muriel believes this to be a necessary or &quot;prerequisite&quot; for someone to be considered a great writer, and John thinks that it is not.

Choice D - This choice should be eliminated immediately because it mentions &quot;the number of novels&quot; as an issue, and the two statements never make mention of anything related to the number of books a writer produces.

Choice E - Like choice D, this one can be eliminated immediately. While Muriel does state that Favilla does not deserve to be considered a great writer, there is no other mention of any author, let alone many authors, deserving or not deserving the status of great.

===Question 04===

See question 3 for a summary of the two statements.

The question asks to which one of the following positions would John's statements commit him.  Remember, John argues that an author does not have to be diverse in subject matter to be considered great.  This does not mean that he believes a writer cannot be diverse in his/her subject matter.  Also, John says that a great writer must have (at least) have the ability to explore a particular theme deeply.

Choice A - This is the correct choice because John states that an author does not have to have diverse (or varied) subject matter to be considered a great writer.  Therefore, one should conclude that he does not believe that Favilla should be excluded from being considered a great writer based on this writing style alone.  Notice, that this choice doesn't say that John would consider Favilla a great writer; based on the statements, that would be concluding too much.  It simply notes that he would not exclude her from consideration.

Choice B - This choice directly contradicts John's criterion for a great writer.  According to his standard, if Favilla cannot explore any particular theme deeply in her writings, then she could not be considered a great writer.

Choice C - This statement might trick some, but one should notice that it concludes too much.  Yes, John believes that it is necessary for a writer to explore some particular theme deeply to be considered great, but John never says that this is sufficient.  Therefore, one cannot assume that based on this criterion alone, John would considered Favilla great.

Choice D - This choice is wrong because it does not follow logically from John's statement.  We know that Muriel believes varied writing is a requirement for a great writer, and we know from John's statements that he doesn't believe varied writing is a necessary condition to be a great writer.  But, it is important to realize that just because John doesn't believe it's a necessary condition doesn't mean that it is a disqualifying condition.  John never says that a writer with a varied writing style does not deserve to be considered a great writer.  He just says it's not necessary to be considered a great writer.

Choice E - Muriel uses this phrase--a distinctive style--to describe Favilla's novels.  Neither Muriel nor John indicate that a distinctive style is a necessary condition to be considered a great writer.

===Question 05===

This is an assumption question.  To know what is assumed, one should first determine what is concluded.  The statement concludes that the moons in solar system S4 all orbit the planet Alpha.  This conclusion is based on the premise that any moon orbits some planet in a solar system.  To get from this premise to the conclusion something has to be assumed, and the question asks you, the test taker, what is the assumption?

Choice A - Even if choice A is true, it would not mean that that one moon in the entire solar system would orbit the planet Alpha unless something else is assumed.  So, this choice can be eliminated.

Choice B - This choice simply restates the conclusion, and even if this were true, one could not properly conclude that all moons in the solar system orbit Alpha unless something else is assumed.  So, this choice can be eliminated.

Choice C - This is the correct choice.  If one knows that any moon by definition, orbits some planet in a solar system, then one must assume that Alpha is the only planet in S4 in order to conclude that all the moons in solar system S4 orbit planet Alpha.

Choice D - Assuming every planet in S4 is orbited by more than one moon would actually contradict the conclusion that all the moons in S4 orbit the planet Alpha.  This choice can be eliminated.

Choice E - Assuming that there is at least one moon that orbits Alpha, would not ensure that all the moons in S4 orbit the planet Alpha.  This choice can be eliminated.

'''Question type: Semi-flaw'''

'''Argument''':
Premise- Because a runner's feet remain in contact with the ground for shorter period of time on a hard running surface than on a softer one.
Conclusion- Running tracks with a hard surface allows you to run faster, under dry conditions.

You're looking for an answer that shows that the argument provided only partial evidence for the conclusion.

'''Correct answer''' (C): This answer choice tells us that hard tracks affect the posture of the runners which minimizes wind resistance.  This shows that the time a runner's feet remains on the surface isn't the only reason why hard surfaces allows runners to run faster.

A) Incorrect, since the conclusion already stated 'under dry conditions', we're looking for something that would affect running speed on hard surfaces in dry conditions.

B) Incorrect, irrelevant to the argument since it's stating differences between runners, not the running surface.

D) Incorrect, tempting since it seems to give another reason for running speed variations, but remember, we're looking for something that explains why running speed varies between hard and soft surfaces.  Also remember, we're not looking to disprove the original argument, we're looking for another explanation with which to prove the argument.  If we go with this answer choice, then the argument would fall apart, since we would ask ourselves, 'would a soft surface track at high altitude allow runners run faster than a hard surface track at sea level?'

E) Incorrect, all this answer choice does is try to throw us off, does nothing to the argument.

===Question 01===

Joanna: The only way for a company to be successful, 
after emerging from bankruptcy, is to produce the same 
goods or services that it did before going bankrupt. 
It is futile for such a company to try to learn a whole 
new business.

Ruth: Wrong. The Kelton Company was a major mining operation
that went into bankruptcy. On emerging from bankruptcy, Kelton
turned its mines into landfills and is presently a highly 
successful waste-management concern. 
   
Ruth uses which one of the following argumentative techniques 
in countering Joanna's argument?

(A) She Presents a counterexample to claim.
 
(B) She offers an alternative explanation for a phenomenon

(C) She supports a claim by offering a developed and relevant analogy

(D) She undermines a claim by showing that it rests on an ambiguity
 
(E) She establishes a conclusion by excluding the only plausible alternative to that conclusion

Answer: In this question, Joanna advances a principle about business that her interlocutor, Ruth, attempts to refute. Making a claim about businesses, she proposes the following principle: that if a company emerges from bankruptcy, the only way for it to emerge successfully is to produce the same goods as it did before bankruptcy. The reasoning that underlies this argument, as stated by Joanna, is that, presumably, it will be too hard for a company emerging from bankruptcy to start over and produce all new goods and services, so their best bet is to stick to what they were doing before. 

In order to refute this principle, there are several techniques that one could employ. One could, for example, provide a counterexample which could undercut the principle. And this is precisely what Ruth does. She argues that this principle is false by referencing the Kelton Company, a company that went through bankruptcy but emerged very successfully by changing what they used to do. Thus, the answer is A. 

This is a fairly easy question

===Question 19===
Which could be a complete &amp; accurate list of the fish selected:

(a) 3 J, 1 K, 2 M: If she selects M, she must also have 2O and 1P.

(b) 1J, 1K, 1M, 3O: Cannot have K and O.

(c) 1J, 1M, 2O, 1P: This is the correct answer.

(d) 1J, 1N, 1O, 2P: Cannot have only 1O; must have 2. 

(e) 1M, 1N, 2O, 1P: Cannot have M and N.

===Question 20===
If she does not select P, what could she select: 

Since P is required to select O, M, and N, that leaves J, K, and L. Option (a) J and K is the only option which includes ONLY J, K, or L.

===Question 21===
There is no limit to the number of fish Barbara can select, so the only thing to consider in this question is Not Laws. If she wants as many types fish as possible, she needs to select O, since M, N, and P all require the selection of O. If she selects K, she cannot select O, so the species she cannot select is K.

===Question 22===
The question asks which '''must''' be false.

(a) Barbara selects 4 fish, at least one is J: She can select 4 J fish.

(b) 4 fish, at least one L: Again, she can select 4 L.

'''(c) 3 fish, at least one is M: If she selects M, she must select O and P, and if she selects O, she must have 2. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, because she cannot select M without having at least 4 fish.''' 

(d) 3 fish, at least one is O: She can select 2 O and 1 P. 

(e) 3 fish, one is P: Same scenario as in answer (d).

===Question 23===
If you diagrammed potential selections in Question 21, that diagram should have the answer for question 23: minimum of 1 fish, maximum of 5. (M or N, O, P, J, L). It is a maximum of five because you cannot select K and O, or M and N, which leaves 5 options without any Not Laws.

===Question 14===

In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage. 

Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?

A) Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades 

B) New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined. 

C) only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species 

D) The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage 

E) The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations.

==Section II Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===
'''IDENTIFY'''

This is a Weaken question.

'''READ'''

Conclusion: Carl is incompetent.
Premise: Lowest rate of solving cases- a statistic- among the detectives.

'''ANALYZE'''

The logic hinges on the job performance statistic for Carl.  How shall we attack this statistic? We need to find a way to discredit this statistic or make it irrelevant.

'''CHOOSE'''

'''(A) Correct'''. This fact makes the statistic loses its force.  He was assigned to the toughest cases because he was the best.  A similar example- because there are fewer A grades given at MIT than at LSAC Community College does not mean the MIT students are worsen than those of the LSAC College.  

(B) Incorrect. This is not relevant.  Carl’s performance after he became a detective is the issue here and he being respected by the resident isn’t outside the scope.  We can use this fact to strengthen the argument, saying that he is incompetent because he is unwilling to risk his reputation among the residents and always plays Mr. Nice guy to everyone.

For Choice B to be correct, the passage should look something like this:

* Carl is clearly the most competent detective.  Though he has been a detective for less than a year, he is by far the most respected detective on the police force, which includes many who have been detective for more than ten years.  Since people generally show the greatest respect to the most capable detectives, Carl’s excellent reputation can only have come from the display of his extraordinary ability in such a short period of time.
   
(C) Incorrect. Since Carl and other detectives are provided with the same kind of resources, it does not weaken the conclusion (and thus defending Carl’s position within the police force) necessarily.  Carl performed miserably despite having all the same resources as the others.  

* Detectives on the police force must be clairvoyant.  They seem to know everything about the suspects and all the relevant information that can potentially lead to the solution.  A normal person is incapable of remembering and keeping track of all the information that detectives handle daily and this can only be possible if the detectives have some supernatural powers.

(D) Incorrect.  This fact only shows that he improved but does not show that he is not incompetent.  We can actually use this fact to argue that Carl is truly helpless.  You can say his rate of improvement is so low and performance so dismal for someone with 4 years of prior detective experience. 

* Carl is clearly an extremely competent detective.  No other detective on the police force has solved a greater percentage of the cases assigned than Carl- 1 out of 25- despite that he has been on the police force only for three years.  His impressive performance despite of his relative inexperience now rivals those of detectives who have worked for more than 7 years. 

(E) Incorrect. Promotion is totally out of scope. We can concerned with competence here.  Moreover, promotion is not always based on merit- in many government organizations, it is based on seniority.  

* This yellow page, only six years old, has so many typographical errors.  I’ve called dozens of people on the police department using the number on the page and they were all wrong.  Carl who is a detective on the police department said that the department always submits the correct and up to date contact information to the publisher.

READ

The passage presents a hypothesis.

ANALYZE
The structure of the passage is:
Premise 1. Old fact (established)
Premise 2. New fact (newly revealed)
Conclusion. A hypothesis which incorporates the old fact and new fact.

An example of an argument parallel this structure is:

It is well documented that people who take an intensive LSAT coaching course have a strong aversion to the analytical reasoning section.  Recently, the LSAC research data have revealed that people who self-study without any outside help also dislike the analytical reasoning section very much.  This shows that people's preferences for a certain LSAT section are conditioned not only by some LSAT prep courses but also by independent study.

A typical medical topic question.

ANALYZE

A correlation is shown on the first sentence and the second sentence establishes a causal relationship.  An LSAT favorite- correlation and causation aren't the same!

CHOOSE

(A) Incorrect. The passage does define the term &quot;hypertensive personality&quot; to be the personality combination of nervousness and anxiousness.  Moreover, even if the passage doesn't define the term, it is still incorrect because the flaw is not in the absence of adequate definition.  Imagine having to define every single term in any argument if failing to do so would make the argument vulnerable to criticism.  

(B) Incorrect. Nowhere in the argument you see the world &quot;permanent&quot;.  The passage does not presuppose it at all so it is a completely groundless criticism so you can safely ignore it.

(C) Incorrect. The argument goes further than simply restating the claim that hypertensive personality exists.  It links it to development of high blood pressure.  A nice try but it tackles a flaw that does not exist.

'''(D) Correct.'''  Exactly what we are looking for.

(E) Incorrect. This is an attractive choice but it does not address the critical flaw of the argument. Moreover, the argument does not preclude other personality traits from causing high blood pressure.  The argument did not say &quot;is the only cause of high blood pressure&quot;.

Passage 1:
Science Passage: Oil Well Drilling
===Question 01===
This is a Main Idea question.

(A) Incorrect. &quot;...without appropriate safeguards, wells that penetrate both groundwater and oil or saline water formations inevitably contaminate the groundwater.&quot; (Lines 30-33)  This implies that there exist safe guards, and in fact, the passage goes on to describe a safeguard that protects and groundwater contamination--hence, the contamination is not &quot;inevitable whenever drilling for oil occurs&quot;.

(B) Incorrect.  This is a restatement of the last sentence of the passage, and this topic is not addressed in any of the other paragraphs.

(C) Incorrect.  The passage does not state the hindsight has been the only reliable way, it says &quot;most attempts to regulate the industry have relied on hindsight.&quot;

(D) Correct.  This correctly summarizes the main point of the passage.  This can be seen by examining the first paragraph.

(E) Incorrect.  The passage states that this used to be the case, but no longer is.

The first paragraph of the passage can often, especially in a scientific article, help key one into the main point of the passage (Consider the five paragraph essay format).

===Question 02===
(A) Incorrect.  There is no evidence provided in the passage for this statement.

(B) Incorrect.  There is no evidence provided in the passage for this statement; in fact, the passage discusses several oil wells in or near coastal regions.

(C) Incorrect.  There is no evidence provided in the passage for this statement.

(D) Incorrect.  &quot;...regulations reflected the industry's concern for the purity of the well's oil&quot; (12-14).  This does not necessarily mean that oil wells are usually contaminated.

(E) Correct.  &quot;...groundwater is usually found...near the earth's surface, whereas petroleum...[is] generally found in similar formations but at greater depths&quot; (24-28).j

===Question 03===
Author's attitude

(A) This response is too restricting by limiting it to &quot;without international concern.&quot;  The last paragraph gives example of undesirable events that will/did lead to more research, but these are not restricted to events causing &quot;international concern&quot;.

(B) There is no evidence in the passage to suggest the author thinks this, in fact, the last paragraph clearly shows the authors concern that more undesirable events will occur.

(C) Correct.  This is best gleaned from the tone and examples from the last paragraph.

(D) Incorrect.  &quot;...there is no guarantee that wells drilled in compliance with existing regulations will not expose a need for research in additional areas&quot; (52-54).  The author seems to think the opposite, that an event will show that regulation is inadequate and spur research.

(E) Incorrect.  &quot;...there is no guarantee that wells drilled in compliance with existing regulations will not expose a need for research in additional areas&quot; (52-54).

This question is asking what you can infer from the passage about the author's viewpoint.

(A) This is the credited response. Line 56-58 state that &quot;most major institutions behave in the ways that maximize university ownership and profit participation.&quot;

(B) Lines 4-7 point out that &quot;many institutions have invested heavily  in the...infrastructure to develop...these discoveries&quot;, implying that their mission is in line with making the discoveries, not antithetical to it (against it).

(C) The purpose of the quote in lines 16-19 is to show that if universities don't consider their policies, they could lose their professors to institutions &quot;responsive to their commercialized desires&quot;.  This implies that the policies do have an impact on the research of the faculty.

(D) Just because the policies generally work to the benefit of the universities doesn't mean they will definitely harm the professors, just that they will tend to benefit the universities more than the professors. A counter-example could be a resource-provider university (line 40), where it certainly seems to be more of a gray area.

(E) Line 52 points out that this is an area of uncertain legal boundaries, so it may or may not be illegal - we don't know.

===Question 04===
===Question 05===
===Question 06===
===Question 07===

This question is a must be true inference question.  In other words, the answer must be an inference that '''must be true''' in all possible situations.  The stimulus gives a number of details regarding crops and vegetables.  There is no conclusion here, just information.  This question is made difficult by the length of the stimulus and the confusing conditional statements.  We learn the following details from the stimulus:

• Unless preventative measures (left unspecified) are taken, failure to rotate crops will lead to a depletion of soil nutrients.

• If the soil's nutrients are completely depleted, fertilizer is necessary to grow crops.

• If vegetables are grown in fertilized soil instead of non-fertilized soil, they are more vulnerable to pests and must be treated with more pesticides.

• The more pesticides used on veggies, the greater health risks to humans eating the veggies.

The prompt then asks what must be true for some vegetables that were grown in unfertilized soil.

'''(A)''':  This answer is incorrect because the scenario given in this answer could never be true.  The second conditional statement says that fertilizer is necessary to grow crops in the case of nutrition depletion in the soil.  The prompt states that the soil is not fertilized.  Therefore, if the soil was depleted of nutrients, no crops (including vegetables) could have grown.  

'''(B)''':  If the crops have been rotated, then we know that there will not be a depletion of soil nutrients due to a failure to rotate crops.  This leaves open the possibility of the soil nutrients remaining.  This possibility does not conflict with any of the other conditions given in the stimulus or prompt.  Therefore, (B) is incorrect.  There is nothing in the stimulus that makes this scenario impossible.  

'''(C)''':  This is guaranteed by the conditions given in the stimulus.  The first condition states that if the crop rotation failure will lead to soil nutrition depletion &quot;'unless preventative measures are taken.'&quot;  In other words, a failure to rotate crops need not inevitably lead to the nutrients being depleted from the soil.  We know that there are nutrients in the soil because the vegetables are being grown without fertilizer.  If the nutrients were completely depleted, the second conditional statement would be violated.  The fact that there are nutrients in the soil, however, does not tell us for sure whether or not someone rotated the crops.  It may be that someone failed to rotate the crops but performed preventative maintenance.  The given information is not enough to know if the crops were rotated.  Therefore, the possibility invariably exists that the crops weren't rotated but the soil still has nutrition.  Therefore, (C) must be true.

Identifying the correct answer here is made a little more difficult by the fact that choosing (C) as the correct answer is basically saying, &quot;The possibility that the vegetables were grown in soil of crops not rotated is guaranteed to be true.&quot;  Guaranteeing the ''possibility'' of something is a lot less directing than simply guaranteeing that something is true.  

'''(D)''':  There are two main ways in which this answer is incorrect.  Although the the third condition of the stimulus guarantees that more pesticides would be used on vegetables grown in fertilized soil, there is nothing stating that no pesticides would be used on vegetables in non-fertilized soil.  It could be that a ton of pesticides are already used on veggies in non-fertilized soil, and just a little bit more than a ton is used on veggies in fertilized soil.  &quot;More&quot; is an ambiguous term because it is relative.  It tells us nothing about the absolute values.  Furthermore, we don't know the amount of pesticide applied to vegetables in non-fertilized soil is below the threshold of toxicity to humans.  In other words, it could be that even a tiny amount of pesticide use is toxic to humans, and that toxicity goes up as more pesticide is used (as stated in the fourth condition).  Since the scenario given in the prompt leaves open the possibility that any amount of pesticide could be used on the vegetables grown in non-fertilized soil and that the tiniest amount of pesticide is a health risk to humans, (D) may or may not be true.  Thus, (D) is incorrect.  (Remember, the correct answer must be guaranteed to be true)

'''(E)''':  Again, we have no idea what amount of pesticides will be applied to these vegetables in non-fertilized soil.  Thus, we can't make any kind of comparisons with other vegetables.  (E) may or may not be true is thus, incorrect.

===Question 14===
This is a strengthen question.  That is, what information, if added, would support the given conclusion.
The conclusion of the argument is that &quot;residents of this locale should not consider their loss of farming as a way of life to be a tragedy.&quot;  The evidence is that it was economically depressed when it was a rural area, but now it is a high tech area that supports many jobs.

(A) This answer is outside the scope of the argument, ie, it is irrelevant to the conclusion.

(B) Again, this is irrelevant. We don't know or care about national security.

(C) This is the credited response. This is correct because it fills in a major gap left by the argument, that is, regardless of their newfound prosperity, do they have any other reason to miss farming as a way of life? Since this statement is that they don't (inherently) value farming any more than economic prosperity, it strengthens the argument.

(D) This is the sucker punch - many readers will assume that this is an improvement, and therefore strengthens the argument.  Although it is more evidence along the same lines as that already given in the passage, it doesn't help to directly support the conclusion that &quot;residents should not consider the loss of farming as a...tragedy&quot;

(E) This would actually weaken the argument. Even though no financial hardship is resulting, if this were true, the farmers would definitely still consider the loss of their way of life a tragedy.

===Question 15===
This is a resolve question. There is an apparent contradiction between the two statements, so you are looking for an additional piece of evidence that makes the other two statements work together.

(A) This is the opposite of what both statements are arguing - they are saying cigarette ads shouldn't be illegal because fatty foods ads aren't illegal, not that both should be illegal.

(B) This doesnt resolve the contradiction, it merely offers additional support for cigarette ads being blocked and fatty foods not being blocked, which doesnt help because fatty foods are still unhealthy.

(C) The first statement implies the government should have some kind of moral responsibility, not the advertisers, so this doesnt resolve anything.

(D) This is the credited response. This is what would really resolve the idea. The two statements are saying that the government is justified in trying to limit the numbers of ads, but it making them illegal would be going too far.  The solution of providing financial disincentives would fulfill the government's obligation to try to prevent ads that encourage people from engaging in an unhealthy practice (statement 1), but still not make it illegal because there are other unhealthy practices that can be legally advertised (statement 2).

(E) This doesn't resolve the contradiction in the idea that if government is trying to keep ads from encouraging people to participate in unhealthy practices, then they should discourage cigarette ads as well as fatty foods ads. It is correct in that it is saying they should restrict but not prevent, another element of the two arguments, but it isnt quite there.

===Question 16===
This is a necessary assumption question.  The correct answer will be a piece of evidence that is required for the claim to stand.  Without the correct answer, the argument falls apart.

In the stimulus, an environmentalist argues that &quot;government mandated environmental protection can help those regions' economies overall, even if such protection harms some older local industries.&quot;  This claim is based off of the following premises:

• Many people prefer living in regions of natural beauty.

• These regions often have an influx of new residents.

• Population growth encourages businesses to relocate to these regions.

The environmentalist has made quite a jump to make claims about helping the economies overall, even if the older local industries are harmed.  The correct answer will probably address these new elements.  

'''(A)''': Adding this piece of evidence to the argument would destroy the argument.  If (A) were indeed true, then government mandated protection could not help the economies overall because new businesses would stop relocating to the region if older local industries were harmed.  The environmentalist has claimed that the economy would be helped notwithstanding the harming of local industries.  Therefore, (A) is incorrect.

&quot;'(B)'&quot;:  Even if the economies of these regions were based primarily on local industries that would be harmed by the government mandates, the argument can still stand as long as the new incoming businesses buoy up the economy enough to make up for the damages to the local industries.  If there weren't enough new incoming businesses, (B) might be a necessary assumption but that's not good enough to make (B) the correct answer.  A necessary assumption is an assumption that is guaranteed in all cases to be required.  (B) is incorrect.

&quot;'(C)'&quot;:  The environmentalist's argument never required encouraging an influx of new businesses to be the primary means for a govt mandate to help a region's economy.  A government mandate for environmental protection could help a region's economy in many other ways.  The environmentalist has only addressed one potential outcome of such a mandate.  There are many other possible outcomes that the environmentalist never denied the existence of.  (C) is not required to be true and is thus, incorrect.

&quot;'(D)'&quot;:  The environmentalist never stated that a government mandated protection of the environment was the ''most'' beneficial to a region's economy.  Other means could be more beneficial and the argument could still stand.  Therefore, (D) is not a required assumption and is incorrect.

&quot;'(E)'&quot;:  If it was true that a factor harmful to some older local industries in a region &quot;discouraged&quot; other businesses from relocating to the region, then the argument would not stand.  The environmentalist has made an assumption that a potential side effect of the government mandate will not prevent the desired boost to the economy.  If the environmentalist is wrong, then the given premises can no longer support the claim.  (E) is required and is the correct answer.

===Question 25===
This is a parallel reasoning question.
The reasoning in the given argument is one of mutual exclusivity. If good things cause no harm at all, and wealth is often harmful to people, then it is impossible for wealth to ever be a good thing. So we have to find an answer that uses that same line of reasoning. 

(A) This is the credited response. Alex loves to golf, and no one in the chess club loves to golf, so it is impossible for Alex to be in the chess club, since he loves to golf.

(B) There is no exclusivity here; Isabella can be a contented, smiling, hardly ever crying baby, and therefore be like happy people.

(C) This doesn't state what would be mutually exclusive. LSAC wants us to assume that industry's growth would cause unbearable levels of pollution, and they want us to assume that would be a bad thing for the town. But they don't say either of those things, so as far as we know, none of those things are true, and there is nothing mutually exclusive here.

(D) This one matches on the structure of the sentence, but its reasoning is not the same.  Even if most daschunds hunt poorly, that still leaves room for some that could hunt well (like Sarah's).

(E) Even though there is usually more traffic at this time of day, there can still be little traffic.  Who cares if it is surprising or not: there is nothing that makes it impossible to happen.

One scored Arguments section had 25 questions, and the other had 26. Test takers rated the Arguments sections as harder than usual. Most said the 25-question section was harder than the 26-question section, largely due to the mix of question types. The 26-question section had a more typical distribution of question tasks, and the 25-question section had a relatively large number of tough flaw and principle questions. Overall, there were fewer inference questions than usual.

Reading Comprehension  
Instead of the usual breakdown of topics - science, law, social science, and arts/humanities, the December RC section had one law, one science, and two social science/policy passages. Though the passage distribution was atypical, the questions tasks and answer choices were comparable to those on other recent exams. Examinees varied in their assessment of passage difficulty, but many said the law passage had the most difficult questions. The first passage had eight questions and advocated changes to the provision of relief after natural disasters. The second passage had six questions, and the author responded to those who criticize the relevance of the Hippocratic Oath in contemporary medicine. The third passage had five questions, and it described how new research into the DNA of the fungi in lichen has led to new insight into the evolutionary path of lichens. Eight questions accompanied the last passage, which dealt with provisions in the Canadian constitution that protect aboriginal rights.

(C) Incorrect.  This is not true.

(D) Incorrect.  This statement can be inferred from the second sentence but it is not what the author is leading us to.

(E) Incorrect. Maybe, but the author does not make this argument.  He only discredits the economists obsession.

The following is a parallel question.

The obsession of the generals with manpower as a measure of military strength has prevented us from understanding the true nature of military power. Having a huge number of poorly trained and unequipped soldiers contribute little to the military power and the need to feed them can be a drain to national resources.

The author arguing that

(A) military strength cannot be defined solely in terms of manpower

(B) military power can be measured without considering manpower 

(C) valid measures of military power cannot be formulated

(D) a large army of poorly equipped soldiers is a drain to the nation

Politician: Many people argue that the news release of the senator's misconduct into the media is distablizing the government and thus hurts the national interest.  But 30 years ago a similar political scandal involving the president erupted in the country with no significant effect on our country's political stability.  Because the president's scandal was far more serious than the secretary's today, there is no reason to think that the current news is affecting the country significantly.

Which one of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the politician's argument?

(A) Scandals involving the government officials tend to occur less often than those involving the celebrities.

(B) Loss of popularity among people continue to damage the president's prestige.

(C) People 30 years ago had much greater trust and faith in the government officials than we do now.

(D) The reputation damaged by scandals recovers at a slow rate, barring any chance for reelection.

(E) The country changed from a dictatorship to a democracy during the period the president was in power 30 years ago.

===Question 03===

A reason the physcist cannot give an expert opinion on the damage of the ozone layer is that she does not have necessary background knowledge in atmospheric science. On the other hand, a reason the biologist cannot is that he does not quite have the training in using the mesasurement tools.  So, the task must be assigned to the chemist, the only scientist in the city other than the sciologist and biologist.

The argument depends on assuming which one of the following?

(A) The physicist has the proper training in using the measurement tools.
(B) The expert opinion cannot be given by anyone other than a scientist in the city.
(C) The biologist could have give an expert opinion if

Dioxins, which cannot be synthesized except in the paper mills, is found in all fish noted for reproductive abnormalities whether they are from fresh water or ocean. However, the abnormalities in fresh water fish, such as loss of fins and inability to swim quickly, emerge only when the fish is infected with a LSAC virus which make them suspectible to dioxins to penetrate their body. Therefore, if fresh water fish have an abnormality,  they must have infected with the virus at some point letting dioxins enter their body.   

If the statements above are true, then which one of the following must also be true?

(A) A fresh water fish with no contact with a LSAC virus will not suffer from reproductive abnormality.
(B) In the context of all reproductive abnormalities, paper mills resuppose dioxins.

The government's action to require all the shoe factories to clean up the water in the nearby wetland has often been criticized on the grounds that it hurts the shoe industry, but that is not a fair evaluation.  The government action in fact benefits the industry in the long run. The cleaner wetland will promote tourism in the area bringing many people to shop at the local shoe stores which helps the industry to sell many more shoes.

Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument?

(A) It is impossible to tell wehther the government is more committed to the interests of the industry than to the enviromental cause.
(B) The government has often been criticized for hurting the local industry.
(C) The requirement to clean up the water will add costs to making shoes.

==Section I Reading Comprehension==
This section is more difficult than the other recent exams.
many said the humanities and law passages had the most difficult questions. They rated the section as more difficult than those on other recent exams. The first passage had seven questions and critiqued economists’ definitions of prosperity. The second passage had eight questions, and it analyzed the structure and symbols in a book about the Japanese Canadian's experience during World War II. The third passage had six questions, and it dealt with the evolutionary factors that may explain why modern pronghorns can run extremely fast, even though they don’t need great speed to elude predators. Six questions accompanied the last passage, which dealt with legal theory regarding whether punishments for criminals were just.

Must be True Question

Must be true questions require that the test taker select an answer choice that is proven by the information presented in the stimulus. 

The stimulus to this question does not contain a conclusion, it is  fact set. Most question that contain only fact sets are Must be True question stems or Resolve the Paradox question stems. 

The correct answer to this question is answer choice (C): Shakespeare wrote neither the love poetry nor the dramas attributed to him. 

Many test takers select answer choice (E): Shakespeare may have written the love poetry but did not write the dramas attributed to him. 

This answer choice is incorrect because it is not a logical consequence of the facts presented. At no point in the argument did the Literary historian discuss weather the works were written by various artist. Remember in Must Be True questions all the information necessary to answer the question resides in the stimulus and the details are what the test makers aim to test. Test takers can not generalize or go beyond the scope of the information presented in the stimulus.

===Question 03===

===Question 04===
===Question 05===
Art Patrons 

Strengthen Question 

Strengthen questions ask you to support the argument in any way possible. This type of answer has great range, the answer choice that strengthens the argument weather it be by 1% or 100% is correct. 

The use of the words &quot;most support&quot; and the sufficient indicator word &quot;if&quot; allow test takers to correctly identify this question as a Strengthen question. 

Strengthen question are considered amongst the most difficult questions types because of their great range of answer choices. 

The stimuli for strengthen and weaken questions tend to be similar, both often contain faulty reasoning. 

Conclusion of the argument: art in the next century will rarely express social and political doctrines that are perceived to be subversive of that social order. 
Premise: Artist in the next century will be supported largely by private patrons. 
Premise: These patrons will be supporters of social order - whatever it may be at the time- 

Correct Answer choice (A): Art Patrons tend not to support artists whose art expresses social and political views that are in opposition to their own. 

In strengthen questions it is important to focus on the conclusion. Strengthen question will always contain an argument. 

Answer choice (A) is correct because it eliminates a possible problem with the facts presented. If Patrons did tend to support artist whose art expresses social and political views in opposition of their own then there would be a problem in the reasoning of the argument and would thus weaken instead of strengthen the argument. 
 
Incorrect Answer choice (D): Artist ten to become more critical of contemporary social and political arrangements after they are freed of their dependency on private patrons. 

Incorrect Answer choice (D) is incorrect because it is out of the scope of the argument. This answer choice supports an issue that is tangential to the argument

===Question 06===

Artificial Turf/Natural Grass 

Resolve the Paradox Question 

Resolve the Paradox questions:
Resolve the paradox questions do not typically contain a conclusion or an argument. The correct answer will address both sides of the paradox. The correct answer will either explain how both sides came into being or provide new information that allows both occurrences to coexist. The stimulus contains a contradiction by the use of the following words: 

However, nevertheless, but, in contrast, yet, although, paradoxically, surprisingly...   

Answer choice (B) is the correct answer.

===Question 07===
===Question 08===
===Question 09===
===Question 10===
Air Traffic Nuclear Power and Physicians 

Assumption question: 

An assumption is an unstated premise. It is a piece of information that the conclusion rest upon. Conclusion Valid --&gt; Assumption true. For many students assumptions questions are the most difficult Logical reasoning question type? The correct answer in an assumption question is a statement the author must believe in order for the argument to be correct. 

Answer choice (A) is correct: There is no indispensable aspect of residency training that requires resident physicians to work exceptionally long hours. 

Note an assumption can be consider a minimalistic answer and assumption question can not contain extraneous information. Answer choice (A) is a defender answer choice. The defender role protects the argument by ruling out other scenarios that weaken the argument. 

Answer choice (C) is incorrect: The more hours one works in a week, the less satisfactorily one performs one's work. This answer choice is incorrect because it is out of the scope of the argument. The argument states that air traffic controllers and nuclear power plant operators are not allowed to work exceptionally long hours. No where does it state the relationship between work hours and performance.

===Question 11===
Self-deprecating humor 

Weaken Question 

Weaken question and strengthen question tend to have holes in the argument. In weaken question the stimulus is suspect and the answer choices are taken as fact. 

The correct answer is (A): bases a conclusion about how one group will respond to self-deprecation on information about how a different group responds to it. 

This argument contains an improper comparison. The first sentence states career advice for employees and the last sentence describes a study of employers who use self deprecating humor in front of their employees. The comparison is not valid.

===Question 12===
Researcher: Inducing Deep Sleep 

Strengthen question 

Focus on the conclusion, similar to weaken question. Cause and effect principals. 

Correct answer choice is (E): Raising body temperature slightly by taking a warm bath just before bedtime will likely result in increased deep-sleep

Strengthen questions can either strengthen the argument by 1% to 100%. Answer choice (E) is correct because it strengthens the conclusion of the argument. Remember all strengthen questions will contain a conclusion. The conclusion to this argument is in the final sentence. Exercising in the afternoon tends to raise body temperature slightly until after bedtime, and this extra heat induces deeper sleep. 

Answer choice (E) shows that when the cause occurs the effect occurs, when body temperature increases before bedtime (cause) individuals get experience deeper sleep (the effect). 

Answer choice (C) is incorrect because it is out of the scope of the argument. In no place of the argument did the Researcher discuss which are the best methods of inducing deep sleep. Note that reading this answer choice quickly and not reading all the answer choices can cause test takers to incorrectly select (C) as the correct answer choice.

===Question 13===
===Question 14===
Roger Bacon vs Authorities 

Flaw in the reasoning

The information in the stimulus is regarded as fact and the answer choices are under suspicion. Good test takers should be able to find the flaw in the reasoning before reading the answer choices. 

The correct answer choice is (E): Criticizes Bacon's character in order to question his scientific findings 

This is a source argument question, the argument attacks the person or source or source instead of the argument they advance.

===Question 15===
===Question 16===

Visually impaired computers

strengthen question:

Focus on the conclusion. What ever strengthens the argument by 1 to 100% is correct. Beware of shell game, opposite, out of scope or strengthening a sub conclusion answers.

The correct answer is (B): Relatively easy-to-use computer systems that can read information aloud, display it in large type, or produce a braille version of it are widely available. 

The conclusion of the argument is in the last sentence: Thus, visually impaired people can now access information from computers more easily than they can from most traditional sources. 

The correct answer choice (B) proves that the information presented in the argument is correct and accurate.

===Question 17===
Legislator vs Analyst

Method of reasoning question 

Stimulus is fact, answers choices are under suspicion. Method of reasoning questions are simply abstract must be true questions. It is important to read closely in these questions, generalization can be very harmful. The details are all the test taker have to test. 

Correct answer (E) implying that the legislator has drawn a conclusion about cause and effect without considering how often the alleged effect has occurred in the absence of the alleged cause. 

The terms clearly shows introduced the cause and effect relationship. 

The correct answer showed that although the effects occurred the cause did not, this disproves the causal conclusion.

===Question 18===
Quantum mechanics may complete physical theory

Parallel Reasoning Questions: 

Parallel reasoning questions have been known to be quite time consuming. If a parallel reasoning question contains flawed reasoning it will be stated in the question stem, if the question stems does not discuss flawed reasoning then the stimulus does not contain flaws. 

Parallel reasoning questions are the most abstract type of question on the LSAT.

Correct answer choice is (C): Your sister is a very good chess player but she has never won a chess tournament; therefore, she will not win this chess tournament.

===Question 19===
Musical Intervals with 6 month old babies 

Strengthen Question 

An effective method of attacking a strengthen question is to look for weaknesses in the argument. Address a weakness in an argument will strengthen that argument. 

Remember to focus on the conclusion and to stay within the scope of the argument. 

The correct answer is (B): None of the babies in the experiment had previous exposure to music from any culture. 

Answer choice (A) is incorrect because it is out of the scope of the argument.

the experimental section appeared in Section 2. Ratings of this administration placed its difficulty on par with other recent exams. 

Princeton Review students rated the difficulty of this section as similar to games sections that have appeared on exams within the past year. 

The first game involved determining the order in which six animals appeared on six signposts. 

In the second game, four cassette tapes each held songs on their front and back sides. There were four types of songs that could appear. 

The third game involved determining in which order five cities experienced storms and what type of precipitation fell on each city. 

In the last game, six committee members had to be assigned to three subcommittees with three members each. 

Test takers rated the first and third games as easier and the second and fourth games as harder. Our students found that their familiarity with the games and experience with making deductions helped them set up the games and work the questions efficiently.

===Question 01===
IDENTIFY

This is a [[Past LSAT Explained/Flaw(LR)|Flaw]] question.
* police patrol

READ

This is an LSAT's perennial favorite. This is a typical causation problem.  A causes B not B causes A.  Having many crimes causes the number of the police to rise.  Maybe the police reinforcement has occurred only recently to have any effect on crime.  

ANALYZE

This is the first question and a repeat from previous LSAT tests.  You need to be able to do this around half a minute.  

CHOOSE

(A) Incorrect. No emotional appeal here.  If there was, the passage will look like this:

While it might be expected that those neigborhoods most heavily patrolled by police have the least crime, they in fact have the most. Just look at the brutal and heinous murder of children by ruthless Dr. El Saat.  With his freightening look and psychopathic behaviors, his dark presence instills fear to all.  Therefore, the presence of police does not decrease crime in a neighborhood.

(B) Incorrect. We are only concerned with a particular neighborhood in question. We don't have to worry about whether the same criminals commit something else outside our jurisdiction- none of our business period. For this choice to be correct, it has to be like given that answer (D) does not appear:

While it might be expected that those neigborhoods most heavily patrolled by police have few criminals, the statistical evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that such neighborhoods have the most.  This shows that the presence of police does not decrease the number of criminals in the neigbhorhood.

(C) Incorrect.

While it might be expected that those neigborhoods most heavily patrolled by police the least crime, the frontpage of LSAC Times recently reported a theft of the LSAT material by a group of pre-law students.  Since stealing the LSAT is the most heinous crime of all, this shows that the presence of police does not decrease crime in the neigbhorhood.

'''(D) Correct.'''

(E) Incorrect. Wordy choice but wrong.
 
===Question 02===
IDENTIFY
This is a [[Past LSAT Explained/Weaken|Weaken]] question.
* [[w:en:endangered species|endangered species]]
Premise: There have been increased international efforts to protect habitats of endangered species.

Premise: Rate that species goes extinct still rising.

Conclusion: Efforts to protect endangered species have been wasted.

Choose the answer that WEAKENS the argument:

A) It doesn't matter if they can preserve habitats any better now, their PAST efforts could still have been wasted.

'''B) CORRECT''' This shows that despite the extinction rate, their efforts were not entirely wasted.

C) Confirms the rate, does not impact argument.

D) The argument does not mention economic benefit.

E) Like A, it doesn't matter what they may do in the future.  The argument is about what has been done in the past.

===Question 03===
* psychology
* academic department

===Question 04===

DISAGREE QUESTION

Aaron: Judge's statements were irresponsible.

Belinda: They were natural and truthful.

A) Aaron's opinion, Belinda doesn't address this.

'''B) CORRECT''' The explicitly mention opposing viewpoints.

C) Tricky, but Aaron never states that he condones the lawyer's actions, just that he disagrees with the judge's statement.

D) This is not addressed by either.

E) This is not a point of contention.

===Question 05===

Principle consists of two parts:

1. People believe only real things can evoke emotions.

2. Sometimes they have real emotions to things they know are not real.

The correct answer choice will have both parts.

'''A) CORRECT''' 1: Fred didn't expect to be scared. 2: He was actually scared, even though he knew it was fake.

B) No emotions discussed.

C) It wasn't real, but Raheem didn't know.  Doesn't satisfy either part.

D) This may be representative of part 2, but definitely missing part 1.

E) No emotions discussed.

===Question 06===
* earthquake
* seismic shock

===Question 07===
insurance
bicycle

===Question 08===
fortune telling
psychic
extrasensory perception (ESP)

===Question 09===

Premise: Historians have 2 criticisms

Premise: First, uncritical of status quo

Premise: Second, self-indulgent with own dreams.

Premise: Moviemakers gave audience what they desired.

Conclusion: Second can't be true.

This question asks us to find the assumption that would be '''sufficient''' to make the argument true.

A) Does not make the second criticism not true.

B) Only discusses the reasonableness of criticism 1

C) Only discusses criticism 1

D) Totally unrelated to criticism 2.

'''E) CORRECT''' This explains why criticism 2 is unfounded.

===Question 10===
* volunteerism

A) Editorial does not claim there is no causality, just that it &quot;may not&quot; be true.

B) No specific example is cited.

C) This claim was not in the argument.

'''D) CORRECT''' The author suggests another interpretation.

E) Author did not attempt to prove anything.

==Section II Reading Comprehension==
Reading Comprehension - 26 questions  
the humanities and science passages had the most difficult questions. 

The first passage had described New York African-American ministers’ leadership role in a protest during the early 1960s. 

The author of the second passage argued that China’s Cultural Revolution, which attempted to restrict expression that defied centrally defined values, paradoxically inspired divergent artistic movements. 

The third passage contrasted approaches to family law and contended that mediation was superior to court proceedings. 

The last passage discussed new evidence about the relationship between a pathogen and its host; it concluded that a pathogen that it is easily transmitted or can survive outside the body can kill its host and still reproduce successfully.

the difficulty of this section as similar to games sections that have appeared on exams within the past year. They felt it was slightly harder than the June 2005 Games section, but quite manageable. The first game involved determining the order in which seven elements were placed. In the second game, you had to determine whether each of seven switches was in the On or Off position, according to a set of complex conditional rules. The third game involved figuring out which one or more of four music genres were sold at each of five stores. In the last game, six employees, three of whom were supervisors, had to be assigned to a Monday-to-Friday work schedule. Two people worked each day, and at least one had to be a supervisor. Test takers rated the first and fourth games as easier and the second and third games as harder.

the difficulty of this section as easier than Games sections that have appeared on exams within the past year. 

In the first game, a student in a dorm room had five appliances, but they could not all be used at once. The conditions listed appliances that could not be plugged in at the same time, and test takers had to determine how many and which appliances were used in various scenarios. 

The second game involved determining the order in which a farmer plowed each of his eight fields. 

The third game asked test takers to determine which one or more of three appliance types five workers were able to repair. 

In the last game, three folk bands and three rock bands each had to be scheduled for one of six time slots on two concert stages. The complexity of the setup and conditions made this the most challenging game. Overall, test takers rated the first and second games as easier and the third and fourth games as harder.

==Section I Logical Reasoning==
===Question 01===
The question asks to identify a statement that will weaken the argument. The conclusion stated that lie-detectors that can detect the physiological reaction are a &quot;sure&quot; way of determining when someone is lying. One way to weaken this conclusion is to break the relationship. Answer D shows just that physiological reaction is not necessarily a result of lying.

===Question 02===
This question asks us to identify a flaw in the argument. The publishing executive states that the company needs to sell at least 100,000 books to make a profit. And his conclusion is that because the best selling of the 12 books is unlikely to sell over 100,000 copies, the company will not make a profit. The flaw is obvious. We are not concerned of the number of copies sold for ONE book, but instead, a total of ALL books from the company. Answer D identifies just that.

Examinees varied in their assessments of passage difficulty, but many said the humanities and science passages had the easiest questions. 

The first passage described prehistoric cave paintings and speculated about their purpose. 

The second passage discussed the work of contemporary poet Louise Gluck. While some critics have argued that Gluck should write from a distinctively female perspective, Gluck contends that great poetry deals with universal subjects. 

The third passage reviewed native Canadians’ efforts to win property rights by getting the courts to recognize communal ownership as a viable legal concept. 

The fourth passage examined how embryonic polarity differs among species—a somewhat surprising feature because other developmental processes are more similar across species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Summary  
As always, test forms for the June 2006 LSAT included an experimental (unscored) section. On most test forms, the experimental section appeared in Section 2. Be aware, however, that LSAC often administers a few selected forms with identical scored sections, but with their experimental sections in a different location. Ratings of this administration placed its difficulty slightly above that of other recent exams. Princeton Review students report being pleased with their overall performance. 
Games - 22 questions  
Princeton Review students rated the difficulty of this section as on par with Games sections that have appeared on exams within the past year. In the first game, you had to determine the order in which six foreign language films were shown at a film festival. Twelve films were available, two each in six languages. The second game concerned five types of mail that were delivered to one of three people. The third game asked test takers to determine which of seven courses were offered during a summer term. In the last game, eight computer chips had to be ranked in order from fastest to slowest. Our students found that their familiarity with the games and experience with making deductions helped them set up the games and work the questions efficiently. 

Scored Arguments - 25 questions in each section  
One scored Arguments section had 26 questions, and the other had 25. Test takers rated the 26-question section as harder than the 25-question section. The 26-question section included an unusually large number of long and densely-worded arguments and answer choices, and it had several challenging questions. Test takers cited careful use of process of elimination (POE) as the most helpful technique. Overall, Princeton Review students found the techniques they had learned in class worked well on the exam. They reported that their ability to spot language shifts, recognize common flaws, and diagram conditional statements were the most useful tools for analyzing arguments. Broad experience with past exams was invaluable to test takers, and smart pacing choices were required to get the best possible results. 

Scored Reading Comprehension - 28 questions  
The reading comprehension section offered the usual breakdown of topics—science, law, social science, and arts/humanities. Examinees found the law passage easiest and the science passage hardest. The first passage dealt with the use of computer-assisted crime reenactments in the courtroom. The author discussed the benefits, described potential problems, and suggested ways to prevent those problems. The second passage argued that because African artists alter their styles to suit consumers from other ethnic groups and regions, scholars can’t reliably draw conclusions about an object’s origins based on fine style distinctions. The third passage argued that though the historical evidence is limited, source records clearly indicate that ancient Greek and Roman societies had female physicians. The author supported this contention by citing examples of Classical writers who referred to female physicians in a matter-of-fact way. The fourth passage explained why maize’s method of photosynthesis makes it such a productive crop. Overall, this section demanded the skills of mapping the passage well, paraphrasing its contents, searching for specific evidence in support of answers, and eliminating choices judiciously.

Form 6LSN70
==Section I Reading Comprehension==
The experimental section appeared in Section 2. Ratings of this administration placed its difficulty slightly above that of other recent exams. 
Scored Reading Comprehension - 28 questions  
Examinees found the arts passage easiest and the science passage hardest. 

On the whole, Test takers found this to be a difficult section because of the number of questions, difficulty of the questions, and complexity of the passages. 

Passage 1
The first passage discussed Mexican-American writers and argued that their writing displays a fusion of language and theme unique to their experiences. 

Passage 2
The second passage reviewed changes in bankruptcy law, noting a shift in emphasis from punishment to restitution. The author viewed the change as beneficial because those who declare bankruptcy can better repay their debtors. 
Passage 3
The third passage addressed the malleability of cultural identity. It used historical examples to illustrate how one culture can engulf another and cause identity shifts. 
Passage 4
The last passage dealt with chaos theory, specifically the idea that you can predict a future state but not how something will get to that state. It described recent work in the field that challenges the reproducibility of scientific results and has the potential to undermine some of science’s core tenets. 

==Section II Logical Reasoning==
Most examinees found one of the sections harder than the other, though the difference in difficulty was less pronounced than on some other recent exams.

Games - 22 questions  
Princeton Review students rated the difficulty of this section as easier than Games sections that have appeared on exams within the past year. 

In the first game, you had to determine at which of four airports six flights, ordered 1 to 6, landed. 

The second game involved selecting a panel of five people from a group of three parents, three students, and four teachers. 

The third game asked test takers to determine in which of five years three students graduated and in which of those years they purchased cars. 

In the last game, a child eating alphabet soup decided to eat from one to three of six remaining letters in three spoonfuls. You had to determine which letters were in each spoonful.

The experimental section appeared in Section 1. 

==Section I Logical Reasoning==
22 questions  
Princeton Review rated the difficulty of this section as similar to that of Games sections that have appeared on exams within the past year. 

The first game concerned the colors of a clown’s jacket and overalls. Two arrangements were possible: Either the jacket had three colors and the overalls one color, or the jacket had a single color and the overalls two colors. 

The second game involved ranking six hotel suites in order from most to least expensive. 

The third game asked test takers to determine in what order seven songs were placed on a CD and whether each song was new or classic. 

In the last game, you had to determine the order of delivery for eight parcels based on clues that specified the relative order of the elements.

==Section IV Analytical Reasoning==
===Question 01===

A clown will select a costume consisting of two pieces and no others: a jacket and overalls. One piece of the costume will be entirely one color, and the other piece will be 
plaid. Selection is subject to the following regulations:

If the jacket is plaid, then there must be exactly three colors in it.
If the overalls are plaid, then there must be exactly two colors in them.
The jacket and overalls must have exactly one color in common.
Green, red and violet are the only colors that can be in the jacket.
Red, violet, and yellow are the only colors that can be in the overalls.

We can diagram all of the possibilites:

&lt;pre&gt;
Plaid Jacket                Plaid Overalls&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;V&lt;/u&gt;            &lt;u&gt;R/V&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Y&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Solid Jacket                Solid Overalls&lt;/pre&gt;
   &lt;u&gt;G/R/V&lt;/u&gt;                       &lt;u&gt;R/V/Y&lt;/u&gt;

===Question 02===
===Question 03===
===Question 04===
===Question 05===
===Question 06===
&lt;pre&gt;Six hotel suites--F, G, H, J, K, L--are ranked from most expensive (first) to least expensive
(sixth). There are no ties. The ranking must be consistent with the following conditions:

H is more expensive than L.
If G is more expensive than H, then neither K nor L is more expensive than J.
If H is more expensive than G, then neither J nor L is more expensive than K.
F is more expensive than G, or else F is more expensive than H, but not both.

This convoluted question consists of two scenarios based on the following constraints defining 
which room is the most expensive (Most expensive always to the left):

H &gt; L
if G &gt; H then J &gt; K
if G &gt; H then J &gt; L
if H &gt; G then K &gt; J
if H &gt; G then K &gt; L
F &gt; G / F &gt; H
F is never greater than G and H (F is always between G and H)

The constraints can be diagrammed into two diagrams as follows (Where those letters further to the
left are more expensive than the letters to the right connected either with a &quot;-&quot; or a &quot;/&quot; or a
&quot;\&quot;. The ellipses denote that it cannot be determined from the constraints what comes after a 
particular letter, and letters on different lines who are not connected can also not be said to be 
more or less expensive than one another unless they are directly connected through either one or a 
series of lines from left to right.):

1)

...G - F - H - L...
              /
          ...J - K...

2)
...H - F - G...
    \
     L...
    /
...K - J...


Thus when we examine all of the choices in question six against the two diagrams, we find that the
only possible answer is:

B. (H, K, F, J, G, L)&lt;/pre&gt;

===Question 07===

Using the diagram from Question 6 above...

If G is the second most expensive suite, then which one of the following could be true?

The question states that G is the second most expensive suite. Looking at our two diagrams, we can see that only in the first diagram can G be the second-most expensive suite (remember expense is left to right, more expensive to less). That being said, we can quickly compare each of the answers to the first diagram. The only possibility is

C. (K is more expensive than F)

because while our lines denote that K must be less expensive than J, we do not know anything about the relation of the second line of the diagram to the first except that J is less expensive than L. This allows J to fall anywhere on the continuum so long as it does not fall to the right of L. While K must come after J, there is no problem with J and K falling to the left of F in the first diagram.

===Question 08===

Using the diagram from question 6...

Which one of the following CANNOT be the most expensive suite?

This question could be answered independently from the diagrams based only on the final constraint. &quot;F is more expensive than G, or else (in the event that it is less expensive than G) F is more expensive than H, but not both.

We can take this to mean that F is always situated between G and H in some fashion, meaning that it will never be the most expensive suite in any situation.

A. (F)

===Question 09===

Using the diagram from question 6...

If L is more expensive than F, then which of the following could be true?

Only in diagram 2 can L be more expensive then F because in the first diagram L must be less expensive than H which is less expensive than F. Therefore, we are to use our second diagram to answer this question.

Because J is not in any way directly connected to L (which now falls between H and F), it is entirely possible for G and J to be interchangeable as the least expensive suite. Therefore, it is entirely &lt;u&gt;possible&lt;/u&gt; for G to be more expensive than J.

D. (G is more expensive than J)

===Question 10===

Using the diagram from question 6...

If H is more expensive than J and less expensive than K, then which one of the following could be true?

Only in diagram two is it possible for H to be simultaneously more expensive than J and less expensive than K, because K can move indefinitely to the left, and J can move indefinitely to the right. Therefore, we are to use our second diagram.

Knowing that K is more expensive (farther to the left) than H, we can plausibly form the chains KHJLFG or KHLJFG. Only the first 4 letters are relevant to the question, and given the question's constraint, we can see that it is possible to get the answer

D. (J is more expensive than L)

===Question 11===
===Question 12===
===Question 13===
The answer to this question requires all the clues.

You know every rock song must have new composition track before it (rule 5). Therefore, track 5 must be a new composition because, as stated in rule 4, track 6 is a rock classic. 

You also can conclude track 7 is a new composition because it would be impossible for track 7 to be a rock classic. For track 7 to be a rock classic, track 6 must be a new composition (rule 5). Because track 6 is a rock classic and not a new composition (rule 4), track 7 is a new composition.

So! So far, we know tracks 5 and 7 are new compositions and track 6 is a rock classic.

We know that VXZ (in some order) must be tracks 5-7 (rules 1-3). According to rule 6, Z is a rock classic. Therefore, both V and X must be new compositions. 

Lucky X is choice D.

== The Treaty of Waitangi ==

The Treaty of Waitangi was an agreement between the British and about 540 Maori chiefs, in which the Maori people gave their sovereignty to the British Crown. Today, it is seen as the founding document of New Zealand.



===An Overview of the Treaty===

----

Prior to 1840, the British Government was at first uninterested in annexing the country, but with New Zealand settlers becoming lawless and reports of the French planning to take control of the country, the British finally decided to act. Once the treaty had been authorised by British authorities, the English draft of the treaty was translated overnight by the missionary Henry Williams and his son, Edward, into Maori on the 4th of February 1840. 

The treaty was then debated by about 500 Maori over the course of a day and a night, with Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson, who had been appointed the task of securing British control over New Zealand, stressing the benefits to the Maoris of British sovereignty. Once the chiefs were reassured that their status and authority would be strengthened, about 40 chiefs signed the treaty at Waitangi on the 6th of February 1840. After this, the document was taken all over the country, and about 500 more chiefs signed.


The English Version and the Maori Version are as follows:


===The English Version of the Treaty===

----

[[Image:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg|thumb|right|The original English version of the Treaty of Waitangi.]]
The actual draft for translation into Maori  and dated 4th February 1840 was as follows:
Her Majesty Victoria, Queen of England in Her gracious consideration of the chiefs and the people of New Zealand, and Her desire to preserve to them their lands and to maintain peace and order amongst them, has been pleased to appoint an officer to treat with them for the cession of the Sovereignty of their country and of the islands adjacent, to the Queen. Seeing that many of Her Majesty's subjects have already settled in the country and are constantly arriving, and it is desirable for their protection as well as the protection of the natives, to establish a government amongst them.
Her Majesty has accordingly been pleased to appoint Mr. William Hobson, a captain in the Royal Navy to be Governor of such parts of New Zealand as may now or hereafter be ceded to Her Majesty and proposes to the chiefs of the Confederation of United Tribes of New Zealand and the other chiefs to agree to the following articles.
'''Article first'''
The chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes and the other chiefs who have not joined the confederation, cede to the Queen of England for ever the entire Sovereignty of their country.
'''Article second'''
The Queen of England confirms and guarantees to the chiefs and the tribes and to all the people of New Zealand, the possession of their lands, dwellings and all their property. But the chiefs of the Confederation of United Tribes and the other chiefs grant to the Queen, the exclusive rights of purchasing such lands as the proprietors thereof may be disposed to sell at such prices as may be agreed upon between them and the person appointed by the Queen to purchase from them.
'''Article third'''
In return for the cession of their Sovereignty to the Queen, the people of New Zealand shall be protected by the Queen of England and the rights and privileges of British subjects will be granted to them.
Signed, William Hobson
Consul and Lieut. Governor.
Now we the chiefs of the Confederation of United Tribes of New Zealand assembled at Waitangi, and we the other tribes of New Zealand, having understood the meaning of these articles, accept them and agree to them all. In witness whereof our names or marks are affixed. Done at Waitangi on the 6th of February, 1840.

===A Literal Translation of the Maori Text===

----

Here's Victoria, Queen of England, in her gracious remembrance towards the chiefs and tribes of New Zealand, and in her desire that the chieftainships and their lands should be secured to them and that obedience also should be held by them, and the peaceful state also; has considered it as a just thing, to send here some chief to be a person to arrange with the native men of New Zealand, that the Governorship of the Queen may be assented to by the native chiefs in all places of the land, and of the islands. Because too many together are the men of her tribe who have sat down in this land and are coming hither.

Now it is the Queen who desires that the Governorship may be arranged that evils may not come to the native men, to the white who dwells lawless. There! Now the Queen has been good that I should be sent, William Hobson, a captain of the Royal Navy, a Governor for all the places in New Zealand that are yielded now or hereafter to the Queen. She says to the Chiefs of the Assemblage (Confederation) of the tribes of New Zealand, and other chiefs besides, these laws which shall be spoken now.

Here's the first: Here's the chief of the Assemblage, and all the chiefs also who have not joined the Assemblage mentioned, cede to the utmost to the Queen of England for ever continually to the utmost the whole Governorship of their lands.

Here's the second: Here's the Queen of England arranges and confirms to the chiefs, to all the men of New Zealand the entire chieftainship of their lands, their villages, and all their property.

But here's the chiefs of the Assemblage, and all the chiefs besides, yield to the Queen the buying of those places of land where the man whose land it is shall be good to the arrangement of the payment which the buyer shall arrange to them, who is told by the Queen to buy for her.

Here's the third: This, too, is an arrangement in return for the assent of the Governorship of the Queen. The Queen of England will protect all the native men of New Zealand. She yields to them all the rights, one and the same as her doings to the men of England.

-William Hobson, Consul and Lieutenant-Governor.

Now here's we: Here's the chiefs of the Assemblage of the tribes of New Zealand who are congregated at Waitangi. Here's we too. Here's the chiefs of New Zealand, who see the meaning of these words, we accept, we entirely agree to all. Truly we do mark our names and marks.

This is done at Waitangi on the six of the days of February, in the year one thousand eight hundred and four tens of our Lord.


===A Comparison of the English and Maori Versions===
----
The final draft of the treaty was done by William Hobson and James Busby
Although the English and Maori versions of the treaty are mostly the same, there are some subtle differences. 

In the First Article, the English Version stated that the chiefs should give all rights and powers of sovereignty to the Queen. In the Maori Version it states that Maori give up government to the Queen. There is no direct translation for sovereignty in Maori, because the Maoris had individual tribes instead of an overall ruler.

In the Second Article, the English Version stated that the Crown had the sole right of purchase to Maori land. It is not certain if the Maori Version conveyed this message properly.

==Introduction==

''Physical Modelling synthesis'' is not confined to a particular technique, but rather represents a family of approaches to synthesis. Physical modelling systems attempt to ''model'' the propagation of sound energy in a system, typically starting with a mathematical model or algorithm that is often recursive. Physical modelling techniques often start by attempting to replicate the basic structure of an acoustic instrument and hence mimic the sound it makes when 'excited'. This excitation normally comes in the form of an initial ''impulse'', typically a short burst of noise.

The main advantage of this system is that one can generate convincing acoustic sounds, such as a plucked string or drum hit. Aside from this, other advantages include the ability to tweak parameters (e.g. instrument body density, string length) in order to create specific types of instrument from a ''generic'' model. In the extremes, one can specify strange and unrealistic parameters in order to create models of instruments that are impossible to realise physically! Physical modelling systems typically employ ''delay lines'' in their structure and this can mean that the output of the system can go out of control and create unwanted feedback.

==The Karplus-Strong Algorithm==

Alexander Strong and Kevin Karplus developed software and hardware implementations for this algorithm, naming it &quot;Digitar&quot; synthesis.

==Theory==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The board has 42 spaces: 7 columns (vertical lines) and 6 rows (horizontal lines).  When all 42 spaces are empty, it is the first player's (Red) turn to move.  It is Red's turn again when there are 40 empty spaces, and again when there are 38 empty spaces.  There is a pattern: &lt;u&gt;when the number of empty spaces is even, it is Red's turn to move&lt;/u&gt;.  Conversely, &lt;u&gt;when there are an odd number of empty spaces, it's Black's turn&lt;/u&gt;.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Often there are certain spaces that both players want to occupy and don't want the opponent to occupy.  These shall be referred to as  &quot;critical&quot; spaces.  A wise player will never move under a critical space, but instead wait for the opponent to do so.  If both players play this way, no critical space will be playable until one player is ''forced'' to move under it due to having no other options (this situation is known as &quot;zugzwang&quot;).  Who gets to occupy critical spaces depends, of course, on whose turn it will be when the only playable spaces are those directly below the critical spaces.  This depends on the number of empty spaces remaining on the board when the only playable spaces are those directly below the critical spaces.  Whether or not that number is even or 
odd can be predicted based on how many spaces are above the above the critical spaces (whether the critical spaces are on even rows or odd rows*), and how many critical spaces there are.  *Note: &quot;odd rows&quot; refers to the 3rd and 5th row up, and excludes the bottom row because its spaces are always playable.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A critical space on an even row has an even number of empty spaces above it.  For instance, the 2nd row has four rows above it, therefore any space on the 2nd row has 4 spaces above it.  A critical space on an odd row has an odd number of empty spaces above it.  

*If the only critical space is even (on an even row), the number of empty spaces remaining when a player is forced to move underneath the empty space is even.  For example, if the critical space is on the 2nd row, there will be 6 empty spaces remaining (one full column) when the move underneath the critical space is forced.  An even number of empty spaces means it is Red's turn, therefore Red must move under the critical space and Black will occupy the critical space.  

*If there are multiple critical spaces and all of them are even, the number of empty spaces remaining when ''Zugzwang'' occurs is: (even #) + (even #) = '''(even #)'''   and therefore it will be Red's turn when ''Zugzwang'' occurs and Black will occupy the critical spaces.

*If the only critical space is odd (on an odd row), there will an odd # of empty spaces when Zugzwang occurs.  Therefore it will be Black's turn, and therefore Red will get the critical space.

*If there are 2 critical spaces and both are odd, the sum of empty spaces when Zugzwang occurs will be: (odd #) + (odd #) = '''(even #)'''    and therefore it will be Red's turn to move, allowing Black to occupy whichever critical space Red move under.  If Black's occupation of that critical space does not end the game, the game will continue until another zugzwang occurs.  In that situation, there will be one critical space on an odd row, which is the same situation as previously described.  Red will therefore occupy the 2nd critical space.  The following generalization can be made: &lt;u&gt;For any even # of odd-row critical spaces, Black will get the 1st, 3rd, etc., and Red will get the 2nd, 4th, etc.&lt;/u&gt;

*If there are 3 critical spaces and all 3 are odd, the sum of empty spaces when Zugzwang occurs is: (odd #) + (odd #) + (odd #) = '''(odd #)'''   resulting in Black's turn and therefore Red's occupation of whichever critical space Black chooses to give Red.  If Red's occupation of that critical space does not end the game, the game will continue until the previous situation occurs.  So another generalization can be made: &lt;u&gt;For any odd # of odd-row critical spaces, Red will get the 1st, 3rd, etc., and Black will get the 2nd, 4th, etc.&lt;/u&gt;  (Note that each generalization is implied by each other)

*If there are 2 critical spaces, one being odd and the other being even, the following will result from Zugzwang: (odd #) + (even #) = '''(odd #)'''    and therefore Red will get the first (decided by Black) critical space.  Thus only odd-row critical spaces influence the result; even-row critical spaces have no affect because even #'s do not change the evenness/oddness of the sum of the empty spaces remaining.  

==Theory-based strategy for 7x6 board==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Expert players attempt to create a long-term attack that one's opponent will be forced to move under late in the game when the board is nearly filled.  There is a rule of thumb that can be used to tell which kinds of attacks are good long-term attacks (leading to victory), and which attacks the opponent will get to block.  Red needs one more unshared attack on an odd row than Black in order to win, or and odd number of shared odd-row attacks.  Black needs either an even-row attack or a combination of odd-row attacks.  If Black is to win via odd-row attacks, Black needs 2 odd-row attacks, each on a different column, and Red must have no odd-row attack on any column separate from Black's 2 columns, and no even threat below either of Black's odd-row attacks.  A draw results if Red has an odd-row attack in a separate column from Black's odd-row threats (separate attacks like these will hereby be referred to as “unshared” as earlier).  When Black wins, it is usually by an attack on an even row because those attacks are easier to obtain.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If both players play flawlessly, Red wins.  Therefore, in short, &lt;u&gt;Red's strategy is to play offense&lt;/u&gt; and seek an odd-row attack while preventing Black's odd threats (and even threats below his own odd threats).  &lt;u&gt;Black's strategy is primarily to defend&lt;/u&gt; Red's odd-row attacks and then to obtain (usually) an even-row attack.  The major reason Black is on defense is that if Red has an odd-row attack and Black has an even-row attack, Red wins.  &lt;u&gt;Black should be content to earn a draw against Red&lt;/u&gt;, because it often means Black outplayed Red since Red has the advantage.

Both provide pictures and examples.  Allis' tutorial takes a unique approach and presents nine fundamental rules which are the basis of Allis' Connect Four engine ''Victor''.  Allen's has brief discussion of early-game moves.  The authors are the first to solve the game, having solved it independently in 1987 only weeks apart from each other.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

==Strategy for any board size, 2D or 3D==
Note: Any board size’ strategy can be derived using the method of the &quot;Theory&quot; section.  The same generalizations cannot always be made, but using the same method, one will arrive at the correct new generalizations and understand why the bullet-rules below are true.

*For a list of win/loss results for 2D boards, see [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~tromp/c4/c4.html John Tromp's webpage]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;While expert players on LittleGolem believe 8x8 to be a second player win, no proof is known.

Note:
*For 3D &quot;boards&quot;, assume a box shape.
*The bullet-rules below assume attacks that are not immediately playable.
*A 2D board's area, or a 3D board's volume, will be referred to as its &quot;domain&quot;.

====Even Height====
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With these boards, everything is the same is in 7x6 since 7x6 falls in this category. The only difference between 7x6 and other board sizes of this category is the win/loss results, depending on the board size.  The strategy section above is summarized below:

For Red to win: 
*1 more unshared odd-row attack than Black, or
*the same # of unshared odd-row attacks as Black, plus an odd # of shared ones, or
*an odd # of odd-row attacks (whether shared or unshared), if Black has no unshared ones

For Black to win:
*an even-row attack, if Red has no odd-row attacks, or
*two more unshared odd-row attacks than red, or
*the same # of unshared odd-row attacks as Red, plus an even # of shared ones, or
*one more unshared odd-row attack than Red, plus any # of shared ones, or
*one unshared odd-row attack plus any number of shared ones, if Red has no unshared ones, or
*an even # of odd-row attacks (whether shared or unshared), if Red has no unshared ones

====Even domain, odd height====
*Red: 1 more unshared even-row attack than Black to win, or odd # of shared even-row attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
*Black: odd-row attack or even # of even-row attacks (2 more unshared than Red, or the same # of shared) to win.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red and Black have the same # of unshared even-row attacks, the game is drawn.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red has 1 even-row attack and Black has 1 odd-row attack, Red wins.

Remark: The even rows in these types of boards are like 7x6's odd rows.

Note: the situation described in the &quot;Tactics&quot; section applies to (even)by(odd) boards if one reads the section replacing &quot;odd&quot; with &quot;even&quot; and vice versa.  (&quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; stay the same)

====Odd domain====
*Red: odd-row attack or even # of even-row attacks (2 more unshared than Black, or the same # of shared) to win.&lt;br /&gt;
*Black: 1 more unshared even-row attack than Red to win, or odd # of shared even-row attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red and Black have the same # of unshared even-row attacks, the game is drawn.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Black has 1 even-row attack and Red has 1 odd-row attack, Black wins.

Remark: The even rows in odd-area boards are like 7x6's odd rows, and Red in odd-area boards is like Black in 7x6 (but the win/loss results vary with size).

Note: the situation described in the &quot;Tactics&quot; section applies to (odd)by(odd) boards if one reads the section replacing &quot;Red&quot; with &quot;Black&quot; and vice versa, and replacing &quot;odd&quot; with &quot;even&quot; and vice versa.

==Theory and strategy for selected variants==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The theory of the following variants is, as you will see, derived using the same principles as used for regular Connect Four and its board size variations.

===Edge (4-way/6-way) gravity===
[http://www.itsyourturn.com/t_helptopic2070.html#helpitem1222 Click for explanation of the game rules (on a 2D board).] (referred to as &quot;Stack 4x4&quot;)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Red moves when the number of empty spaces = even.  There are two types of long-term 3-piece attacks: &quot;even zugzwang value&quot; and &quot;odd zugzwang value&quot;, whose meanings will be explained.  Furthermore, there are 2 ways to make attacks: orthogonally (horizontally or vertically) or diagonally.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An orthogonal attack can create up to 2 critical spaces.  If it only forms one, the zugzwang situation will be such that one player will be forced to move to one of 4 spaces--2 spaces in the column where the critical space lies and 2 spaces in the row where it lies.  Spaces like these---which, when filled, allow the critical space to be occupied on the next turn---will hereby be referred to as &quot;zugzwang spaces&quot;.  So orthogonals with one end and discontinuous (unconnected/gapped) form 4 zugzwang spaces and 1 critical space, which means when Zugzwang occurs, 5 empty spaces remain.  This sum will be referred to as a &quot;zugzwang value&quot; for convenience.  Single critical space orthogonals, as shown, have a zugzwang value of 5--or more importantly, an odd zugzwang value.

An orthogonal can form 2 critical spaces by one of two ways: an open-ended connected line (being at least 3 spaces from either perpendicular edge of the board or 2 spaces from any legal move in the extension of the line), or a discontinuous line with two gaps.  In both cases, there are 6 zugzwang spaces.  Its zugzwang value (ZV from now on) is 8, hence is even.  Note, however, that once the 1st critical space is occupied by one player, the 2nd one is immediately playable by the other.  Therefore in some situations, an open-ended orthogonal attack can be thought of as forming 1 critical space with 4 zugzwang spaces, and thus having an odd ZV (the &quot;one&quot; critical space could be on either side of the line, depending on which one the opponent chooses).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Diagonals, whether continuous or not, form 4 zugzwang spaces for each critical space they create.  A discontinuous diagonal forms 1 critical space and therefore has an odd ZV (five).  A continuous, open-ended diagonal has a ZV of: (2 critical spaces) + 4 + 4 = 10, which is of course even.  Notice that this is a combination of 2 odd-ZV attacks.  A closed-ended diagonal, for example, has only 1 critical space and 4 zugzwang spaces, and therefore has a ZV of 5 which is odd.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For 3D, box-shaped boards with 6-way gravity, the only thing that changes is that 2 more zugzwang spaces are created by each kind of attack.  Adding an even # to another # does not change the evenness/oddness of it.  Therefore, the evenness/oddness of the ZV's will be the same, and each player will need the same attacks as in 4-way-gravity.

From these facts, the following conclusions can be drawn.

====Boards with even domain====
*Red needs 1 more unshared odd-ZV attack than Black to win, or an odd # of shared odd-ZV attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
**Any attack will accomplish this.&lt;br /&gt;
*Black needs an even-ZV attack to win or an even # of odd-ZV attacks (2 more unshared than Red, or the same # of shared).&lt;br /&gt;
**A 2 critical space orthogonal, a 2-critical-space diagonal, or 2 of any other type of attack will achieve this.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red and Black each have 1 unshared odd-ZV attack, and Black has no even-ZV attacks, the game is drawn.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red has an odd-ZV attack and Black has an even-ZV attack, Red wins.

Note: shared attacks are probably rare situations in the edge-gravity variant, but they are possible.

====Boards with odd domain====
*Red needs an even-ZV attack to win or an even # of odd-ZV attacks (2 more unshared than Black, or the same # of shared).&lt;br /&gt;
**A 2 critical space orthogonal, a 2-critical-space diagonal, or 2 of any other type of attack will achieve this.&lt;br /&gt;
*Black needs 1 more unshared odd-ZV attack than Red to win, or an odd # of shared odd-ZV attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
**Any attack will accomplish this.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red and Black each have 1 unshared odd-ZV attack, and Red has no even-ZV attacks, the game is drawn.&lt;br /&gt;
*If Red has an even-ZV attack and Black has an odd-ZV attack, Black wins. 

(In other words, what a color needs for boards with odd domain is the opposite of what that color needs for boards of even domain.)

===Two-move turns===
====Stacking (downward gravity)====
Rules: Red's 1st turn is one move.  Then every turn after that (including Black's first turn) is 2 moves.  Other than that, same rules as standard Connect Four.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this variant, which rows each player needs depends not on whether they are even or odd, but on which player moves last (and on the board dimensions).

Who moves first depends only on how many turns it takes to fill the entire board.  '''If the # of turns is even''', then each player has the same # of turns and therefore '''Black moves last'''.  &lt;u&gt;If the # of turns is odd&lt;/u&gt;, Red gets 1 more turn than Black and therefore &lt;u&gt;Red moves last&lt;/u&gt;.

For boards with even domain, the last move is the first and only move of the last turn.  On boards with odd domain, the last move is the 2nd move of the last turn.  This is important because it determines which zugzwang-values each player needs.

Consider, for example, the 8x8 board.  Red moves last and takes the top row; he moves when there is 1 space left.  Before that, Black moves and takes the 6th and 7th row; she moves when there are 2 and 3 spaces left.  The alternation continues and the following list can be generated:
*Red moves when there are: 1, 4,5, 8,9, 12,13, 16,17, 20,21... spaces left. 

If the board were instead 9x9, Red moves last and takes rows 8 and 9, thus moving when there are 1 and 2 spaces left.  This will change the list to:
*Red moves when there are: 1,2, 5,6, 9,10, 13,14, 17,18, 21,22... spaces left.

To see why this is important, consider some attacks.  It has been demonstrated that on an 8x8 board, a 6th-row attack is good for Black.  It has a ZV of 5 (4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th row are empty when Zugzwang occurs) and notice from the list that Red moves when there are 5 empty spaces left.  One 6th-row attack would therefore be useless for Red.  But what if Red had two 6th-row attacks?  The combined ZV would be 10, and notice from the list that Black moves when there are 10 empty spaces left.  On Red's turn there would be 9 empty spaces left, and Red would move twice in one column and make Connect Four with one of the 6th-row attacks, so two -6th row attacks are good for Red in 8x8.  The complete strategy for the 2-move-turn variant can be solved using this method.

The strategy will now be categorized by board dimensions.  But note that the bottom 2 rows are never included in the list of strategic attacks since they are always immediately playable.  Strategic rules of thumb only apply to critical spaces that will not be filled until immediately after Zugzwang.

=====Even domain=====
* # of turns = &lt;math&gt;(area/2)+1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**Alternate: if the area is a multiple of 4 (meaning, if area/4 = an integer), Red moves last.  If not a multiple of 4, Black moves last.&lt;br /&gt;
*Last turn consists of 1 move.&lt;br /&gt;
*Last mover moves when # of empty spaces = (''any multiple of 4'' + 0 or 1) = {1, 4,5, 8,9, 12,13, 16,17, 20,21, 24,25...}&lt;br /&gt;
*2nd-to-last mover moves when # of empty spaces = the combination of the sets {2,3} and {''any multiple of 4'' + (2 or 3)} = {2,3, 6,7, 10,11, 14,15, 18,19, 22,23...}

======Even height======
Last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*any even row being the top row or a multiple of 4 rows (2 even rows) down from the top row (note: 4 rows down from the top = 5 rows down, 8 rows down from the top = 9 rows down, and so on).&lt;br /&gt;
*1 more unshared good odd row than 2nd-to-last mover---good being a multiple of 2 odd rows down from the top row (meaning, the 4th row down or any multiple of 4 rows down from the 4th row down)---or an odd # of shared ones. (If equal # of unshared ones, a draw results.)&lt;br /&gt;
*the combinations of bad attacks listed 2 paragraphs below which result in &quot;+&quot;

2nd-to-last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*any odd row being the 2nd-to-top row or a multiple of 4 rows (2 odd rows) down from the 2nd-to-top row&lt;br /&gt;
*1 more unshared good even row than last-mover---good being the 3rd-to-top row or a multiple of 2 even rows down from the 3rd-to-top row---or an odd # of shared ones. (If equal # of unshared ones, a draw results.)&lt;br /&gt;
*an odd # (&gt;1) of bad even rows (3 more unshared than last-mover, or the same # of shared).&lt;br /&gt;
*the combinations of bad attacks listed in the paragraph below which result in &quot;-&quot;

The following situations are solved by adding the ZV's of each attack together and knowing which player benefits from the new ZV that results.&lt;br /&gt;
*Good even-row attack for last-mover (which will be referred to as &quot;+even&quot;) + bad even-row attack for last-mover (&quot;-even&quot;, aka &quot;good even-row attack for 2nd-to-last mover) = good for 2nd-to-last mover.  Summarized: (+even) + (-even) = -&lt;br /&gt;
*(-even) + (-even) = + equivalent to (+odd)&lt;br /&gt;
*(+odd) + (+odd) = - equivalent to (-odd)&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (+odd) = -&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (-odd) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+odd) + (-odd) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+odd) + (-even) = +

(For the situations above where the 1st attack is + and the 2nd is -, the same results apply whether the last-mover has both of the mentioned attacks (1 good and one bad) or whether the last-mover has the first attack and the 2nd-to-last mover has the second attack (meaning, each player has 1 good attack). For the situations with 2 good attacks or 2 bad attacks, the result assumes that the corresponding player has both of the attacks.)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;Result for 7x6 board: Black wins.

======Odd height======
Last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*any odd row being the top row or a multiple of 4 rows (2 odd rows) down from the top row.&lt;br /&gt;
*1 more unshared good even row than 2nd-to-last mover---good being the 2nd-to-top row or a multiple of 2 even rows down from the 2nd-to-top row---or an odd # of shared ones. (If equal # of unshared ones, a draw results.)&lt;br /&gt;
*the combinations of bad attacks listed 2 paragraphs below which result in &quot;+&quot;

2nd-to-last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*any even row being the 2nd-to-top row or a multiple of 4 rows (2 even rows) down from the 2nd-to-top row.&lt;br /&gt;
*1 more unshared good odd row than last-mover---good being the 3rd-to-top row or a multiple of 2 odd rows down from the 3rd-to-top row---or an odd # of shared ones.&lt;br /&gt;
*an odd # (&gt;1) of bad odd rows (3 more unshared than last-mover, or the same # of shared).&lt;br /&gt;
*the combinations of bad attacks listed in the paragraph below which result in &quot;-&quot;

Other notable situations:&lt;br /&gt;
*(-odd) + (-odd) = + equivalent to (+even)&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (+even) = - equivalent to (-even)&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (+odd) = -&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (-even) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (-odd) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+odd) + (-odd) = -&lt;br /&gt;
*(+odd) + (-even) = +

=====Odd domain=====
* # of turns = &lt;math&gt;[(area-1)/2]+1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;(area+1)/2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Last turn consists of 2 moves.&lt;br /&gt;
*Last mover moves when # of empty spaces = 1,2, (''any multiple of 4'' + 1 or 2)&lt;br /&gt;
*2nd-to-last mover moves when # of empty spaces = 3,4, (''any multiple of 4'' - 0 or 1)

Last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*any even row being the 2nd-to-top row or any even row a multiple of 4 rows (2 even rows) down from the 2nd-to-top row&lt;br /&gt;
*1 more unshared good odd row than 2nd-to-last mover---good being the top row or a multiple of 4 rows (2 odd rows) down from the top row---or an odd # of shared ones.&lt;br /&gt;
*an odd # (&gt;1) of bad odd rows (3 more unshared than 2nd-to-last mover, or the same # of shared).&lt;br /&gt;
*the combinations of bad attacks listed 2 paragraphs below which result in &quot;+&quot;

2nd-to-last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*any odd row being the 3rd-to-top row or any odd row a multiple of 4 rows (2 odd rows) down from the 3rd-to-top row.&lt;br /&gt;
*1 more unshared good even row than last mover---good being the 4th-to-top row or a multiple of 4 rows (2 even rows) down from the 4th-to-top row---or an odd # of shared ones.&lt;br /&gt;
*the combinations of bad attacks listed in the paragraph below which result in &quot;-&quot;

*(+odd) + (+odd) = - equivalent to (-even)&lt;br /&gt;
*(-even) + (-odd) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + (-even) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+even) + -(odd) = +&lt;br /&gt;
*(+odd) + (-odd) = +

====Four-way/6-way gravity====
This (non-existent, but possible) variation is a combination of the 4-way/6-way gravity variant and the 2-move turn variant.

Who moves last is relevant.  The same 2 (4 condensed to 2) formulas apply for figuring out the # of turns as with the regular 2-move-turn variant:&lt;br /&gt;
*Even domain: # of turns = (''#spaces''/2)+1&lt;br /&gt;
*Odd domain: # of turns = (''#spaces''+1)/2

Critical spaces in this variant have higher ZV's than those in 1-move-turn edge gravity.  There are three different base ZV's that can be created: 9, 14, and 16.

*ZV's of 9 are created by any attack that creates just one critical space.  ZV's of 18 are created by open-ended connected diagonals, and 2-critical-space discontinuous diagonals whose 2 critical spaces are separated by 2 diagonal spaces.

*ZV's of 14 are created by 2-critical-space orthogonals.

*ZV's of 16 are created by 2-critical-space diagonals whose 2 critical spaces are separated by only 1 diagonal space.

The kinds of attacks needed for each player are ''equivalent'' to those needed in the regular 2-move-turn variant in the corresponding board sizes.  

By &quot;equivalent attacks&quot; the following is meant.  Consider two situations: a connected single-ended orthogonal attack on an 8x8 board with 4-way gravity, and a 4th-row attack on an 8x8 board with downward gravity.  Both situations have a zugzwang-value of 7, and therefore are equivalent.  So on an 8x8 board, the last mover (who would benefit from a 4th-row attack in the regular 2-move variant) would benefit from a connected single-ended orthogonal attack in 4-way gravity 2-move-turn.

In similar fashion (using the principle of equivalence) one derives the following rules:

=====Even domain=====
Last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*2, 3, or [(2 or 3) + (multiple of 4)] of 9-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*An odd # of 14-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*A good attack plus a bad attack.

2nd-to-last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*1 or [(0 or 1) + (multiple of 4)] of 9-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*An even # of 14-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*A 16-ZV attack&lt;br /&gt;
*Two bad attacks.

=====Odd domain=====
Last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*3, 4, or [(3 or 4) + (multiple of 4) of 9-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*An even # of 14-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*A 16-ZV attack&lt;br /&gt;
*Two bad attacks.

2nd-to-last mover can win with:&lt;br /&gt;
*1, 2, or [(1 or 2) + (multiple of 4) of 9-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*An odd # of 14-ZV attacks&lt;br /&gt;
*A good attack plus a bad attack.

===Diagonal stacking===
Rules: a piece can be placed diagonally above another piece.  The bottom row is always playable.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is only one type of long-term diagonal attack that can be made: a connected one pointed downward (meaning the critical space is below it).  This has a ZV of 3 (resulting from the critical space and the 2 zugzwang-spaces below it).

Single orthogonals, whether connected or gapped, have a ZV of 3.  Doubles have a ZV of 6.

In short, all critical spaces have 2 zugzwang-spaces.  

Since the turns consist of only one move each, the strategy can be understood in more than one way.  One could think in terms of last-mover and 2nd-to-last mover (as with 2-move-turn variants), or simply in terms of Red and Black and the evenness/oddness of the # of empty spaces left (as with regular Connect Four).  The latter approach will be taken and the strategic rules are:

====Even domain====
*Red needs 1 more unshared critical space than Black, or an odd # of shared ones.&lt;br /&gt;
*Black needs an even # of critical spaces (shared, or 2 more unshared than Red).

====Odd domain====
*Red needs an even # of critical spaces (shared, or 2 more unshared than Black).&lt;br /&gt;
*Black needs 1 more unshared critical space than Red, or an odd # of shared ones.
----
===Chess-knight motion, no gravity===
Rules: Red's first move can be anywhere, then pieces can be placed a [[Wikipedia:Knight (chess)|knight-move]] away from another piece.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No matter how a critical space is made, it will have a ZV of 9.  All single-critical-space attacks will have ZV's of 9 and all double-critical-space attacks will have ZV's of 18.

Strategic rules:

====Even domain====
*Red needs 1 more unshared critical space than Black, or an odd # of shared ones.&lt;br /&gt;
*Black needs an even # of critical spaces (shared, or 2 more unshared than Red).

====Odd domain====
*Red needs an even # of critical spaces (shared, or 2 more unshared than Black).&lt;br /&gt;
*Black needs 1 more unshared critical space than Red, or an odd # of shared ones.

== What is Signal Processing? ==

The field of signal processing is a very important field of study and one that makes possible various other fields such as communications. MP3 music files contain processed, transformed, and compressed music signal data. Speech recognition systems such as dictation software need to analyze and process signal data to identify individual words in a spoken sentence. Neural interface devices, such as various medical prostheses must read the complicated signals of neurons, process those signals to determine the important features, and then convert those features to digital data. Signal processing enables high-speed data communication, even in the presence of interference or noise.

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book is intended for readers at the undergraduate and graduate college levels, specifically those studying electrical engineering or a related field. This book can be used to accompany several semesters of study, depending on how the material is divided and presented.

== What are the Prerequisites? ==

All readers should have significant prior knowledge of [[Signals and Systems]], probability, [[Linear Algebra]], and [[Calculus]]. Knowledge of linear algebra topics covered in [[Engineering Analysis]], especially the sections about probability are required. Readers who do not have the necessary mathematics background will be at a severe disadvantage.

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will take a look at the traditional problems and methods of signal processing. We will attempt to cover many analog processing techniques, but we also must cover many advanced digital techniques as well. The [[Digital Signal Processing]] book will lay many foundations about digital systems that will be used in this book. The reader is strongly encouraged to either read both these books simultaneously, or to read the beginning sections of [[Digital Signal Processing]] first before reading this book. That book will cover many topics that are specific to digital systems, while this book will attempt to cover techniques that are useful for either analog or digital, are hybrid in nature (that they have analog ''and'' digital components) or that are traditionally analog but that can be modified for fast digital computation.

This book will attempt to cover the concept of filtering specifically, including adaptive Weiner and Kalman filters. This book will also look at some offshoots of adaptive filter theory, including beamforming. The more advanced sections of this book will look at additional subject, such as nonlinear systems and wavelet analysis.

This book will not cover, and will not attempt to cover, prerequisite information that is already covered in the [[Signals and Systems]] book or any of the other prerequisites. This includes, but is not limited to:
*Integral or differential calculus
*Differential equations
*Digital systems and difference equations
*LTI systems theory
*Stochastic signals or processes
*Fourier transform and fourier series</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Basics=
A basic attribute is one where the attribute class is a simple type such as &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; or a primitive.  A basic attribute's value can map directly to the column value in the database.  The following table summarizes the basic types and the database types they map to.

&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background:#ffdead&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Java type&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Database type&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;String (char, char[])&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;VARCHAR (CHAR, VARCHAR2, CLOB, TEXT)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Number (BigDecimal, BigInteger, Integer, Double, Long, Float, Short, Byte)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;NUMERIC (NUMBER, INT, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;int, long, float, double, short, byte&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;NUMERIC (NUMBER, INT, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;byte[]&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;VARBINARY (BINARY, BLOB)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;boolean (Boolean)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;BOOLEAN (BIT, SMALLINT, INT, NUMBER)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;TIMESTAMP (DATE, DATETIME)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.sql.Date&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;DATE (TIMESTAMP, DATETIME)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.sql.Time&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;TIME (TIMESTAMP, DATETIME)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.sql.Timestamp&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;TIMESTAMP (DATETIME, DATE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.util.Calendar&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;TIMESTAMP (DATETIME, DATE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.lang.Enum&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;NUMERIC (VARCHAR, CHAR)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.util.Serializable&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;VARBINARY (BINARY, BLOB)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


In JPA a basic attribute is mapped through the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Basic.html &lt;code&gt;@Basic&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;basic&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  The types and conversions supported depend on the JPA implementation and database platform.  Some JPA implementations may support conversion between many different data-types or additional types, or have extended type conversion support, see the [[#Advanced|advanced]] section for more details.  Any basic attribute using a type that does not map directly to a database type can be serialized to a binary database type.

The easiest way to map a basic attribute in JPA is to do nothing.  Any attributes that have no other annotations and do not reference other entities will be automatically mapped as basic, and even serialized if not a basic type.  The column name for the attribute will be defaulted, named the same as the attribute name, as uppercase.  Sometimes auto-mapping can be unexpected if you have an attribute in your class that you did not intend to have persisted.  You must mark any such non-persistent fields using the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Transient.html &lt;code&gt;@Transient&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;transient&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.

Although auto-mapping makes rapid prototyping easy, you typically reach a point where you want control over your database schema.  To specify the column name for a basic attribute the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Column.html &lt;code&gt;@Column&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;column&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is used.  The column annotation also allows for other information to be specified such as the database type, size, and some constraints.

===Example of basic mapping annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  // Id mappings are also basic mappings.
  @Id
  @Column(name=&quot;ID&quot;)
  private long id;       
  @Basic
  @Column(name=&quot;F_NAME&quot;)
  private String firstName;
  // The @Basic is not required in general because it is the default.
  @Column(name=&quot;L_NAME&quot;)
  private String lastName;
  // Any un-mapped field will be automatically mapped as basic and column name defaulted.
  private BigDecimal salary;       
  // Non-persistent fields must be marked as transient.
  @Transient
  private EmployeeService service;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of basic mapping XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;firstName&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;F_NAME&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;lastName&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;L_NAME&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;transient name=&quot;service&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Common Problems==
===&lt;i&gt;Translating Values&lt;/i&gt;===
:See [[#Conversion|Conversion]]

===&lt;i&gt;Truncated Data&lt;/i&gt;===
:A common issue is that data, such as Strings, written from the object are truncated when read back from the database.  This is normally caused by the column length not being large enough to handle the object's data.  In Java there is no maximum size for a String, but in a database &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; field, there is a maximum size.  You must ensure that the length you set in your column when you create the table is large enough to handle any object value.  For very large Strings &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt;s can be used, but in general &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt;s should not be over used, as they are less efficient than a &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt;.

:If you use JPA to generate your database schema, you can set the column length through the &lt;code&gt;Column&lt;/code&gt; annotation or element, see [[#Column_Definition_and_Schema_Generation|Column Definition and Schema Generation]].

==Temporal, Dates, Times, Timestamps and Calendars==
Dates, times, and timestamps are common types both in the database and in Java, so in theory mappings these types should be simple, right?  Well sometimes this is the case and just a normal &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mapping can be used, however sometimes it becomes more complex.

Some databases do not have &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; types, only &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; fields, however some do have separate types, and some just have &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt;.  Originally in Java 1.0, Java only had a &lt;code&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/code&gt; type, which was both a date, time and milliseconds.  In Java 1.1 this was expanded to support the common database types with &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Date&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Time&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Timestamp&lt;/code&gt;, then to support internationalization Java created the &lt;code&gt;java.util.Calendar&lt;/code&gt; type and virtually deprecated (almost all of the methods) the old date types (which JDBC still uses).

If you map a Java &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Date&lt;/code&gt; type to a database &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt;, this is just a basic mapping and you should not have any issues (ignore Oracle's &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; type that is/was a timestamp for now).  You can also map &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Time&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Timestamp&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt;.  However if you have a &lt;code&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;java.util.Calendar&lt;/code&gt; in Java and wish to map it to a &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt;, you may need to indicate that the JPA provider perform some sort of conversion for this.  In JPA the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Temporal.html &lt;code&gt;@Temporal&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;temporal&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is used to map this.  You can indicate that just the &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; portion of the date/time value be stored to the database.  You could also use &lt;code&gt;Temporal&lt;/code&gt; to map a &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Date&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; field, or any other such conversion.

===Example of temporal annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
    ...
    @Basic
    @Temporal(DATE)
    private Calendar startDate;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of temporal XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        ...
        &lt;basic name=&quot;startDate&quot;&gt;
            &lt;temporal&gt;DATE&lt;/temporal&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Milliseconds===
The precision of milliseconds is different for different temporal classes and database types, and on different databases.  The &lt;code&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; classes support milliseconds.  The &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Time&lt;/code&gt; classes do not support milliseconds.  The &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Timestamp&lt;/code&gt; class supports nanoseconds.

On many databases the &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; type supports milliseconds.  On Oracle prior to Oracle 9, there was only a &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; type, which was a date and a time, but had no milliseconds.  Oracle 9 added a &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; type that has milliseconds (and nanoseconds), and now treats the old &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; type as only a date, so be careful using it as a timestamp.  MySQL has &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt; types.  DB2 has a &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; types, the &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; supports microseconds.  Sybase and SQL Server just have a &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt; type which has milliseconds, but at least on some versions has precision issues, it seems to store an estimate of the milliseconds, not the exact value.

If you use timestamp version locking you need to be very careful of your milliseconds precision.  Ensure your database supports milliseconds precisely otherwise you may have issues, especially if the value is assigned in Java, then differs what gets stored on the database, which will cause the next update to fail for the same object.

In general I would not recommend using a timestamp and as primary key or for version locking.  There are too many database compatibility issues, as well as the obvious issue of not supporting two operations in the same millisecond.

===Timezones===
Temporals become a lot more complex when you start to consider time zones, internationalization, eras, locals, day-light savings time, etc.  In Java only &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; supports time zones.  Normally a &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be in the local time zone, and is stored and retrieved from the database with that assumption.  If you then read that same &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; on another computer in another time zone, the question is if you will have the same &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; or will you have the &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; of what the original time would have been in the new time zone?  It depends on if the &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; is stored as the GMT time, or the local time, and if the time zone was stored in the database.

Some databases support time zones, but most database types do not store the time zone.  Oracle has two special types for timestamps with time zones, &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMPTZ&lt;/code&gt; (time zone is stored) and &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMPLTZ&lt;/code&gt; (local time zone is used).  Some JPA providers may have extended support for storing &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; objects and time zones.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support the Oracle &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMPTZ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMPLTZ&lt;/code&gt; types using the &lt;code&gt;@TypeConverter&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML.

===Joda-Time===
[http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/ Joda-Time] is a commonly used framework for date/time usage in Java.  It replaces Java Calendars which many people find difficult to use and have poor performance.
There is no standard Joda-Time support in JPA, but a &lt;code&gt;Converter&lt;/code&gt; can be used to convert from Joda-Time classes and database types.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : The base product offers no specific Joda-Time support, but there is a custom converter provided by a third party library, [http://code.google.com/p/joda-time-eclipselink-integration/ joda-time-eclipselink-integration].

==Enums==
Java [https://java.sun.com/java/5/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html &lt;code&gt;Enums&lt;/code&gt;] are typically used as constants in an object model.  For example an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; may have a &lt;code&gt;gender&lt;/code&gt; of enum type &lt;code&gt;Gender&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;MALE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FEMALE&lt;/code&gt;).

By default in JPA an attribute of type Enum will be stored as a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; to the database, using the integer Enum values as codes (i.e. &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;).  JPA also defines an [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Enumerated.html @Enumerated] annotation and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;enumerated&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element (on a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;basic&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to define an Enum attribute.  This can be used to store the Enum as the &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt; value of its name (i.e. &lt;code&gt;&quot;MALE&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;FEMALE&quot;&lt;/code&gt;).

For translating Enum types to values other than the integer or String name, such as character constants, see [[#Translating Values|Translating Values]].

===Example of enumerated annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;

public enum Gender {
    MALE,
    FEMALE
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    ...
    @Basic
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Gender gender;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of enumerated XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        ...
        &lt;basic name=&quot;gender&quot;&gt;
            &lt;enumerated&gt;STRING&lt;/enumerated&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==LOBs, BLOBs, CLOBs and Serialization==
A &lt;code&gt;LOB&lt;/code&gt; is a Large OBject, such as a &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; (Binary LOB), or a &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; (Character LOB).  It is a database type that can store a large binary or string value, as the normal &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;VARBINARY&lt;/code&gt; types typically have size limitations.  A LOB is often stored as a locator in the database table, with the actual data stored outside of the table.  In Java a &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; will normally map to a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, and a &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; will normally map to a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;, although a &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; may also represent some serialized object.

By default in JPA any &lt;code&gt;Serializable&lt;/code&gt; attribute that is not a relationship or a basic type (String, Number, temporal, primitive), will be serialized to a &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt; field.

JPA defines the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Lob.html @Lob] annotation and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;lob&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element (on a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;basic&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to define that an attribute maps to a &lt;code&gt;LOB&lt;/code&gt; type in the database.  The annotation is just a hint to the JPA implementation that this attribute will be stored in a LOB, as LOBs may need to be persisted specially.  Sometimes just mapping the LOB as a normal &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; will work fine as well.

Various databases and JDBC drivers have various limits for LOB sizes.  Some JDBC drivers have issues beyond 4k, 32k or 1meg.  The Oracle thin JDBC drivers had a 4k limitation in some versions for binding LOB data.  Oracle provided a workaround for this limitation, which some JPA providers support.  For reading LOBs, some JDBC drivers prefer using streams, some JPA providers also support this option.

Typically the entire LOB will be read and written for the attribute.  For very large LOBs reading the value always, or reading the entire value may not be desired.  The fetch type of the &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; could be set to &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; to avoid reading a LOB unless accessed.  Support for &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; fetching on &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; is optional in JPA, so some JPA providers may not support it.  A workaround, which is often a good idea in general given the large performance cost of LOBs, is to store the LOB in a separate table and class and define a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; to the LOB object instead of a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt;.  If the entire LOB is never desired to be read, then it should not be mapped.  It is best to use direct JDBC to access and stream the LOB in this case.  In may be possible to map the LOB to a &lt;code&gt;java.sql.Blob&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;java.sql.Clob&lt;/code&gt; in your object to avoid reading the entire LOB, but these require a live connection, so may have issues with detached objects.

===Example of lob annotation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
    ...
    @Basic(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
    @Lob
    private Image picture;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of lob XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        ...
        &lt;basic name=&quot;picture&quot; fetch=&quot;LAZY&quot;&gt;
            &lt;lob/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Lazy Fetching==
The &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; attribute can be set on a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mapping to use &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; fetching.  By default all &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mappings are &lt;code&gt;EAGER&lt;/code&gt;, which means the column is selected whenever the object is selected.  By setting the &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt;, the column will not be selected with the object.  If the attribute is accessed, then the attribute value will be selected in a separate database select.  Support for &lt;code&gt;LAZY&lt;/code&gt; is an optional feature of JPA, so some JPA providers may not support it.  Typically support for lazy on basics will require some form of byte code weaving, or dynamic byte code generation, which may have issues in certain environments or JVMs, or may require preprocessing your application's persistence unit jar.

Only attributes that are rarely accessed should be marked lazy, as accessing the attribute causes a separate database select, which can hurt performance.  This is especially true if a large number of objects is queried.  The original query will require one database select, but if each object's lazy attribute is accessed, this will require &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; database selects, which can be a major performance issue.

Using lazy fetching on basics is similar to the concept of fetch groups.  Lazy basics is basically support for a single default fetch group.  Some JPA providers support fetch groups in general, which allow more sophisticated control over what attributes are fetched per query.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support lazy basics and fetch groups.  Fetch groups can be configured through the EclipseLink API using the &lt;code&gt;FetchGroup&lt;/code&gt; class.

==Optional==
A &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; attribute can be &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; if its value is allowed to be null.  By default everything is assumed to be optional, except for an &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, which can not be optional.  Optional is basically only a hint that applies to database schema generation, if the persistence provider is configured to generate the schema.  It adds a &lt;code&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/code&gt; constraint to the column if &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.  Some JPA providers also perform validation of the object for optional attributes, and will throw a validation error before writing to the database, but this is not required by the JPA specification.  Optional is defined through the &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; annotation or element.

==Column Definition and Schema Generation==
There are various attributes on the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Column.html &lt;code&gt;Column&lt;/code&gt;] annotation and element for database schema generation.  If you do not use JPA to generate your schema you can ignore these.  Many JPA providers do provide the feature of auto generation of the database schema.  By default the Java types of the object's attributes are mapped to their corresponding database type for the database platform you are using.  You may require configuring your database platform with your provider (such as a persistence.xml property) to allow schema generation for your database, as many database use different type names.

The &lt;code&gt;columnDefinition&lt;/code&gt; attribute of &lt;code&gt;Column&lt;/code&gt; can be used to override the default database type used, or enhance the type definition with constraints or other such DDL.  The &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;precision&lt;/code&gt; can also be set to override defaults.  Since the defaults for the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; are just defaults, it is normally a good idea to set these to be correct for your data model's expected data, to avoid data truncation.  The &lt;code&gt;unique&lt;/code&gt; attribute can be used to define a unique constraint on the column, most JPA providers will automatically define primary key and foreign key constraints based on the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; and relationship mappings.

JPA does not define any options to define an index.  Some JPA providers may provide extensions for this.  You can also create your own indexes through native queries

===Example of column annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
  @Id
  @Column(name=&quot;ID&quot;)
  private long id;
  @Column(name=&quot;SSN&quot;, unique=true, optional=false, description=&quot;description&quot;)
  private long ssn;
  @Column(name=&quot;F_NAME&quot;, length=100)
  private String firstName;
  @Column(name=&quot;L_NAME&quot;, length=200)
  private String lastName;
  @Column(name=&quot;SALARY&quot;, scale=10, precision=2)
  private BigDecimal salary;       
  @Column(name=&quot;S_TIME&quot;, columnDefinition=&quot;TIMESTAMPTZ&quot;)
  private Calendar startTime;
  @Column(name=&quot;E_TIME&quot;, columnDefinition =&quot;TIMESTAMPTZ&quot;)
  private Calendar endTime;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of column XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;ssn&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;SSN&quot; unique=&quot;true&quot; optional=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;firstName&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;F_NAME&quot; length=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;lastName&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;L_NAME&quot; length=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;startTime&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;S_TIME&quot; columnDefinition=&quot;TIMESTAMPTZ&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;basic name=&quot;endTime&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;E_TIME&quot; columnDefinition=&quot;TIMESTAMPTZ&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If using BigDecimal with Postgresql, JPA maps salary to a table column of type NUMERIC(38,0). You can adjust scale and precision for BigDecimal within the @Column annotation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
   @Column(precision=8, scale=2)
   private BigDecimal salary;  
&lt;/source&gt;

==Insertable, Updatable / Read Only Fields / Returning ==
The &lt;code&gt;Column&lt;/code&gt; annotation and XML element defines &lt;code&gt;insertable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatable&lt;/code&gt; options.  These allow for this column, or foreign key field to be omitted from the SQL INSERT or UPDATE statement.  These can be used if constraints on the table prevent insert or update operations.  They can also be used if multiple attributes map to the same database column, such as with a foreign key field through a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mapping.  Setting both &lt;code&gt;insertable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatable&lt;/code&gt; to false, effectively mark the attribute as read-only.

&lt;code&gt;insertable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatable&lt;/code&gt; can also be used in the database table defaults, or auto assigns values to the column on insert or update.  Be careful in doing this though, as this means that the object's values will be out of synch with the database, unless it is refreshed.  For &lt;code&gt;IDENTITY&lt;/code&gt; or auto assigned id columns a &lt;code&gt;GeneratedValue&lt;/code&gt; should normally be used, instead of setting &lt;code&gt;insertable&lt;/code&gt; to false.  Some JPA providers also support returning auto assigned fields values from the database after insert or update operations.  The cost of refreshing or returning fields back into the object can effect performance, so it is normally better to initialize field values in the object model, not in the database.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support returning insert and update values back into the object using the &lt;code&gt;ReturnInsert&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ReturnUpdate&lt;/code&gt; annotations and XML elements.

==Converters (JPA 2.1)==
A common problem in storing values to the database is that the value desired in Java differs from the value used in the database.  Common examples include using a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; in Java and a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;'T'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'F'&lt;/code&gt; in the database.  Other examples are using a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; in Java and a &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; in the database, or mapping custom Java types such as Joda-Time types, or a Money type.

JPA 2.1 defines the &lt;code&gt;@Converter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@Convert&lt;/code&gt; annotations and &lt;code&gt;&lt;converter&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;convert&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML elements.  A &lt;code&gt;Converter&lt;/code&gt; is a user defined class that provides custom conversion routines in Java code.  It must implement the &lt;code&gt;AttributeConverter&lt;/code&gt; interface and be annotated with the &lt;code&gt;@Converter&lt;/code&gt; annotation (or specified in XML).  A &lt;code&gt;Converter&lt;/code&gt; can be used in one of two ways.  Normally it is specified on a mapping using the &lt;code&gt;@Convert&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;convert&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  Another option, if converting a custom type, is to have the &lt;code&gt;Converter&lt;/code&gt; applied to any mapped attribute that has that type.  To define such as global converter the &lt;code&gt;autoApply&lt;/code&gt; flag is added to the &lt;code&gt;@Converter&lt;/code&gt; annotation.  The &lt;code&gt;@Convert&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;disableConversion&lt;/code&gt; flag can be used to disable a global converter from being applied.  The &lt;code&gt;@Convert&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;attributeName&lt;/code&gt; option can be used to override inherited or embeddable conversions.

====Example Converter====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
    ...
    @Convert(converter=BooleanTFConverter.class)
    private Boolean isActive;
    ...
}

@Converter
public class BooleanTFConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;Boolean, String&gt;{
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Boolean value) {
        if (value) {
            return &quot;T&quot;;
        } else {
            return &quot;F&quot;;
        }
    }
    @Override
    public Boolean convertToEntityAttribute(String value) {
        return &quot;T&quot;.equals(value);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example global Converter====
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
    ...
    private Boolean isActive;
    ...
}

@Converter(autoApply=true)
public class BooleanTFConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;Boolean, String&gt;{
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Boolean value) {
        if (value) {
            return &quot;T&quot;;
        } else {
            return &quot;F&quot;;
        }
    }
    @Override
    public Boolean convertToEntityAttribute(String value) {
        return &quot;T&quot;.equals(value);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Conversion===
Previous to JPA 2.1 there was no standard way to convert between a data-type and an object-type.
One way to accomplish this was to translate the data through property get/set methods.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Employee {
    ...
    private boolean isActive;
    ...
    @Transient
    public boolean getIsActive() {
        return isActive;
    }
    public void setIsActive(boolean isActive) {
        this.isActive = isActive;
    }
    @Basic
    private String getIsActiveValue() {
        if (isActive) {
            return &quot;T&quot;;
        } else {
            return &quot;F&quot;;
        }
    }
    private void setIsActiveValue(String isActive) {
        this.isActive = &quot;T&quot;.equals(isActive);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Also for translating date/times see, [[#Temporal, Dates, Times, Timestamps and Calendars|Temporals]].

As well some JPA providers have special conversion support.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support translation using the &lt;code&gt;@Convert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@Converter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@ObjectTypeConverter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@TypeConverter&lt;/code&gt; annotations and XML.

==Custom Types==
JPA defines support for most common database types, however some databases and JDBC driver have additional types that may require additional support.

Some custom database types include:
* TIMESTAMPTZ, TIMESTAMPLTZ (Oracle)
* TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE (Postgres)
* XMLTYPE (Oracle)
* XML (DB2)
* NCHAR, NVARCHAR, NCLOB (Oracle)
* Struct (STRUCT Oracle)
* Array (VARRAY Oracle)
* BINARY_INTEGER, DEC, INT, NATURAL, NATURALN, BOOLEAN (Oracle)
* POSITIVE, POSITIVEN, SIGNTYPE, PLS_INTEGER (Oracle)
* RECORD, TABLE (Oracle)
* SDO_GEOMETRY (Oracle)
* LOBs (Oracle thin driver)

To handle persistence to custom database types you may be able to use a &lt;code&gt;Converter&lt;/code&gt; or special feature of your JPA provider.  Otherwise you may need to mix raw JDBC code with your JPA objects.  Some JPA provider provide custom support for many custom database types, some also provide custom hooks for adding your own JDBC code to support a custom database type.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support several custom database types including, TIMESTAMPTZ, TIMESTAMPLTZ, XMLTYPE, NCHAR, NVARCHAR, NCLOB, object-relational Struct and Array types, PLSQL types, SDO_GEOMETRY and LOBs.

== I'm impressed with [[Connect four]]! ==

If you could just get a few more pictures on the book, I would probably nominate it for a featured book. Nice work! [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 18:58, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

== [[Connect four]] solved for 8x8 boards? ==

I would like to learn more about this. When and where was this solved? And was it solved strongly or weakly? I would apreciate it if you could provide me with some information on this! [[User:Onots|Onots]] ([[User talk:Onots|talk]]) 14:21, 24 September 2008 (UTC)

== I return to finish the page. ==

Hi.  I am pleased to see that there is some interest in the connect four page.  I am returning to this page after a long period of distractions.  Please forgive all the mentionings of sections that would be done in &quot;two weeks&quot; lol.  Onots, it's good that you brought that up, I should be more specific in the page when making a claim like that.  And Hoogli, thanks for the compliment, I'll try to finally finish what I started.  The Tactics section will have quite a few pictures and will cover more tactics.  The variant sections are probably confusing, but once I add pictures to them they should make a lot more sense.  And some day I might add some tactics for a few of the variants, possibly with help from some people with experience in them.

== Levinson-Durbin Algorithm ==

The '''Levinson-Durbin Algorithm''' is a direct method to solve the augmented Wiener-Hopf equations for the lattice predictor-error coefficients and the predictor-error power. The Levinson-Durbin algorithm uses the filter coefficients of an order ''m'' filter to compute the coefficients of an order ''m + 1'' order filter.

There are two parts to the Levinson-Durbin Algorithm. The first part is a method to compute the tap-weight vector ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' using the tap-weight vector of a lower-order filter, ''a&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{a}_m = \begin{bmatrix}\bold{a}_{m-1} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + \kappa_m \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ \bold{a}^{B*}_{m-1}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In scalar form, this equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{m,k} = a_{m-1,k-1} + \kappa_m a_{m-1,m-k}&lt;/math&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:39, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

== About C++ and RTTI ==

I have moved the post to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Content#RTTI Talk:C++ Programming/Content] (corrected some spelling and signed it for you). I also have quickly replied to your post (will conclude it better as soon as I can).

== Copyright held by Kelvin Seifert ==

Is that why the page suddenly disappeared on me, or did I just push the wrong button?

Let me think about this. When I went through getting a release of the rights in 2003 when the book went out of print, the publisher provided me with a signed contract releasing the rights to me, so that I could do what I'm doing now. I now have that contract in my file. Using the boilerplate will mean going back to them a second time, which is both a pain and annoying to them. It may be easier simply to delete this chapter--though it will reduce the value of the book to others if this happens.

[[User:Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]] 21:16, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

:If this person owns the copyrights and chooses to upload content to wikibooks, we shouldnt make them jump through any hoops. The only time we need to worry about permissions really is when a complaint is raised. If [[User:klseifert]] has the signed contract that he claims to have, dealing with issues of copyright later will be a cinch. Maybe an uploaded scanned copy of the contract here will be an extra layer of protection? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:24, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

== On Further Thought... ==

On further thought, let's delete all of Chapter 13 (though I realize the history will stay). I do not like the large &quot;copyright violation&quot; notice that has been posted at the head of Chapter 13--it creates a negative impression of the entire book.

For now, ASAP, I will try to make the editing changes needed earlier in the book. I'll think about whether to write the Houghton Mifflin editors again.

As you might imagine, I am annoyed now myself. Maybe I will change my mind later after I think about it more, but for now, my feeling about Chapter 13 is &quot;forget it.&quot;

[[User:Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]] 21:28, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

::@WK: My concern was that he's not the original holder - the publishing company is. So we're taking his word that they transferred the copyrights to him in some year &quot;around 2003.&quot; If that's satisfactory for you, then it is for me too.

::@KLS: I wasn't aware you already had some sort of release. That should be fine. I don't think tagging the page would make it disappear though - you must have pressed the wrong button ;) I'll make sure it's still there and remove the tag.

:::Copyright issues can be tricky, and sometimes just trying to do a good thing (donating content to a non-profit) means jumping through hoops. He may not be the original holder, but if he is the current holder that's good enough. For safety, he could probably upload a scanned copy of the document that says he's the copyright holder, but then again there would be the problem of verifiying that the letter is genuine and that this is the person he claims to be. The problems can continue ad infinitem, especially if we dont trust somebody eventually. ''If'' a copyright problem arises in the future, we can worry about things then. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:35, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the encouragement. I will contact you if I need further assistance.[[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 13:44, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

== A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology ==

Hello. I am puzzled as to what has happend to this article. I was literaly in the middle of modifying it and Darklama made changes which have left me very confused as to what is going on. Can you help - revert it or whatever? [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 11:22, 7 September 2007 (UTC)
:Actually what DL did was a good idea. He moved content from the page [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology]] onto subpages, then transcluded them. If you look in the wikicode for the page, you'll notice &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/Further reading}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for instance. That takes the page [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology/Further reading]] and ''transcludes'' it onto the page. Transclusion means that where the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/Further reading}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is, the wiki software will substitute in the content of the page [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology/Further reading]]. When pages are very long, it gets difficult to edit easily, and some browsers can't even handle loading them. By moving some of the content to subpages and then transcluding them, no content moves (or at least it seems that way) and the wikicode gets broken into smaller chunks. You should be able to edit the page as normal. If you edit a section being transcluded, you'll be taken to the edit page for that subpage instead, where you can edit as normal. When you save, you'll be looking at the subpage; you'll have to return to the main page to see how it fits in with the rest of the content there. I'd suggest continuing that process to further decrease the size of each page. IMHO, an even better idea would be to break that page into subpages and link to them instead simply because the size of that main page is so big. As well, since your dictionary is secondary and auxiliary to the rest of the textbook, it shouldn't be the first thing you see - it should probably be linked to as a subpage. If you need anything else, feel free to ask. I'll probably be around for most of the day (except about 2 hours starting now.)

:I guess it can be a bit puzzling or confusing at first. Books unlike articles on Wikipedia do not consist of single pages, except maybe early in there creation process. Wikibooks makes extensive use of subpages for dividing a single book up into multiple pages, while remaining part of the same book. Try reading the [[WB:NP|naming policy]] to get an idea of how its done and you'll see I was following conventions used here. I transcluded to minimize any effects of the change for now. Mike is right that it would be better to link to each subpage instead. What this means really is that the first page of the book becomes the table of contents. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:44, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

==Greetings==
Hi Mike! Thank you for the hearty welcome you have given me. I have some questions... At [[Talk:Latin]] I asked where I could put some certain pages. I'm guessing you don't do much latin, but it's just the fact that I don't really know my way around yet and the pages seem ordered in a way that a prefix and suffix chapter would look out of place. Is is acceptable to put lists (like at [http://bbs.ebigear.com/archiver/tid-5693.html Here] in WikiBooks? --&lt;font face=&quot;Courier new&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[[user:Harris Morgan|Harris]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Harris Morgan|Morgan]]&lt;/font&gt; 19:05, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

:What you're proposing would be acceptable as an appendix; it must be secondary and auxiliary to the textbook. Since [[Latin]] is already a featured text, adding another appendix will be fine. There is an entire section devoted to appendices to the textbook [[Latin#Appendices|here]]; I've created an appendix for your prefixes and suffixes called [[Latin/Prefixes and Suffixes]]. It is a redlink for now; when you click on the link you'll be taken to the edit window so you can start adding content. Sounds like it'll be a useful appendix to the text. If you need help with wiki markup, layout, or anything else, come back and ask here, or at [[WB:SL|the staff lounge]].

== Question about a deleted Lucid Dreaming page... ==

I'm the user who flagged the duplicate articles for deletion, but I see that you merged the edit histories. I'm a little confised as to if this modified the current article, as I and other users already moved any important changes from the old page to the new one. When you merged the pages, what happened to the differences between the pages? Later I see a (restored current version) Does this mean that the merged changes were removed?

Basically, I already put everything important from the old article into the new one, so there was no need for a merge, just a deletion. This also goes for the other 5-6 pages that were flagged for deletion by me per request of the author. [[User:Erik212]] 03:01, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:I deleted the tagged pages in [[Lucid Dreaming]], then re-created them as redirects to the real pages in the book. For some pages, edit history merges were needed (since you manually copied and pasted content, which doesn't give proper attribution to the author of that content, which is required by the GNU Free Documentation License), which I did. Some pages didn't require history merges, so I didn't bother doing it for them.
:If you see an edit summary &quot;restoring current version&quot; then that means that the version you see was whatever was there before I began the process. If more edit history merges are required, or if you have further questions about what I did, please let me know.

::The discussion page for [[Lucid Dreaming]] explains what the author (r3m0t) wanted done, just to clarify why I made the change. It was not me that copied and pasted, but I understand. Thanks! [[User:Erik212]] 04:05, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:::Sorry, I assumed you had done the copy-paste moves. The history merges fixed the licensing issue, so it's really a matter of &quot;Do you see the right content on the page?&quot; I'm fairly certain the history merges were successful; if you think they weren't, we'll have to sort it out.

== VfD closer ==

I noticed your closing of [[:Image:Wikibooks German-English Film Glossary.pdf]] with the reason being &quot;as a glossary out of project scope&quot; with a link to [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_dictionary]]. I'm wondering if you read the exception bit about glossaries. Also as a general rule, you shouldn't close a vfd that you started as [[WB:DP#Guidelines_for_admins]] states and there doesn't seem to be enough consensus on what should happen, one person is in favor of keeping, one is in favor of deleting, and one is in favor of transwiki besides your own.

I'm just wondering what your thoughts were when you closed it. I also don't think enough time had passed between my comment on the 9th and your closing it on the 12th for anyone to comment on it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:20, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry. Re-open it if you like. I was trying to be careful not to close anything I had opened - my mistake. Nevertheless, here's my thinking, which seems to me to be in line with the comments made:
:The exception is for glossaries that are secondary and auxiliary to a text. I can't find any text that could use this as a glossary. Delete and keep cancel; transwiki is the favoured alternative. Indeed, I (I can't speak for whoever else wanted to transwiki) specifically chose transwiki so the content wouldn't be lost; if we need it back we can have it back.

::Seems to be pointless now to reopen it, since the pdf file was uploaded to commons, its now available to any project. I had offered the [[German]] book as a possible place where the text could be used as a glossary, since its a german glossary. However I was perfectly fine with it being transwikied if nobody working on that book wanted it. Which is why I just commented on it rather then picking keep or transwiki. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:50, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't mean to belittle the idea of having a glossary as an appendix to a book, but it should match the scope of the book.

== Re:Subject: Templates ==

Whenever I make templates like that, I usually include a little message telling where it came from, in case there is an error or somebody has a question. That template is located at [[User:Whiteknight/Simple Subject]]. The documentation for using it is on that page as well. All the templates for various purposes that i've created can be found [[User:Whiteknight/Book Foundry#Header Templates|HERE]]. You are more then welcome to use any of them. If you see something that needs to be changed, let me know, and I can fix it (or, i suppose, you are welcome to do it yourself). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:09, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

:Great; thanks! So I've created [[Subject:First Aid]] - but every page in the book shows up. Is the solution to use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subject|First Aid}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[First Aid]], and use regular categories on the rest of the pages to keep track of them?
:Totally unrelated: Do you know how to set the font that stuff shows up in? I imagine it has something to do with monobook.js?? ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:18, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

::The subject template uses DPL to include all the pages from a particular category. In the [[First Aid]] book, all the pages are in [[:Category:First Aid]], so all the pages show up. A solution would be to make a new category for all books on that topic, such as [[:Category:Emergency Medicine]], or something similar. Put the title pages of all books that relate into that category. A lot of what I have been doing with my bot recently has been removing book pages from subject categories, so that the list only shows book titles and not subpages. It's tedious, to say the least.
::As to the font, I don't think there is an explicit way to do it. I can try to add some style information to my template, and see if that works for you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:23, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

:::::If you want to change the font that you see, you could change it in your [[User:Mike.lifeguard/monobook.css|monobook.css]] page. You can make many changes with your skin, you should see how complicated mine is!
:::::The DPL is going to show all pages that are in a particular category. If you want certain pages to be in that category, you need to tag those pages. One thing that you could do is tag the main page with [[:Category:First Aid]], and tag all the sub pages with [[:Category:First Aid (Book)]]. An easy way to tag all subpages is by putting the category tag inside the book's templates. That way you dont need to tag and retag every single page individually, you only tag the templates. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:42, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

Some additional info: {{tlx|subject}} is just a quick way to add up to 10 categories to a page in the proper sort order, while being smart about it. Its &quot;smart&quot; in that it automatically adds the book category to the page for you and doesn't add any of the other categories if its a subpage for the book. I'm assuming you removed them from all the pages because of what Whiteknight said. All the pages need to be in the book category, you just need a separate category for maintaining a list of all books on a subject. Such as [[:Category:First aid]], notice the case difference. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:46, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

:Smart cookie, you are... So I do &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Subject|First aid|First Aid|Medicine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; then [[First Aid]] would get added to them all, but subpages would only be added to the first (which doesn't match the Subject: page?

::Just use {{tlx|Subject|First aid|Medicine}}, [[:Category:First Aid]] will get added to every page in the book you use it on, the other categories will be ignored except for the main page. Its just as if you added [[:Category:First Aid]] by hand to every page you add the subject template to and only included [[:Category:First aid]] and [[:Category:Medicine]] to the main page of the book. It doesn't check the subject namespace at all. This is separate from working with the subject namespace. It just makes sure subpages aren't added to anything but the book category, so that subject categories aren't full of subpages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:07, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

:::K, I think I've got it. The only thing left is to add more books to [[Subject:First Aid]] - it's looking sparse :P To add the first aid sections of [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] (for example), should I tag that page, or only the relevant subpages? Also, if I want [[Emergency Medicine]] to show up in the &quot;First Aid and Medicine Books&quot; section, it'd have to be in both categories?

::::I think you got it backwards. &quot;First Aid&quot; is the name of your book, so that should be the category all the pages in the book should be in while &quot;First aid&quot; is the category to put the main page of any books on first aid in, including the First Aid book.

*'''Delete'''. I don't believe this is worthy of being transwikied. I doubt it belongs on wiktionary or any other project, and so it should just be deleted. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:12, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

*'''Transwiki to Wiktionary''' - Although I rather suspect that anyone who needs a translation of these words has already done it, or can do it without this. If they need a translation for these words, then let them have it. Otherwise delete. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:04, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

*'''Transwiki''' - Although it appears as though some of the active individuals on Wiktionary have adopted it in terms of extracting words from this page, and it is their suggestion to move this page to Wiktionary as an Appendix (their terminology and namespace).  Indeed, this page seems to fit the style and format of many other appendix pages on Wiktionary, so it seems as though this has a home there.  The Wiktionary guys, however, are questioning why stuff like this needs to be deleted from Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:06, 17 July 2007 (UTC)
*:To be fair, it's not really up for the members of another project to question why we delete things here. If there's one thing we should learn from our past dealings with Wikipedia, it's that people from one project are typically not knowledgable about the policies and inclusion criteria of other projects. If it fits on Wikitionary, that's good. If not, we really shouldnt make our deletion decisions based on whether they take it, or whether they agree with our decision to delete. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:31, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

While going through the uncategorized books I found this page. The subject of language design is very important in the fields of communication, Linguistics, and Computer Science. However, this page has some NPOV issues, is written more like a journal entry then a book (in the first person, so other authors cannot easily contribute to it, etc). This page was created in two edits in February 2005, as the only two content edits by [[User:Lynchdavid]], and in the two years since there have only been 2 edits. Not only is it a stub, but because of the way it's written it is unlikely to ever progress beyond that. Barring a ground-up rewrite, there is no hope for this book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:22, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - I'm not voting, as human languages are probably my area of least expertise, but this looks like it could be Original Research. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:29, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Probably Delete'''  Actually there are far worse &quot;books&quot; out there but I think I'm with Webaware on this being Original Research of some sort --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:07, 18 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - This looks copied from somewhere as well (talking about images seen below, etc.) and seems to just be someone's personal essay on the topic. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:39, 19 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - not a textbook, and would be very difficult to change into textbook format. It's just an essay as it stands, which is no way to start a textbook.

Found this one while sailing through [[:Category:Not linked Wikibooks]]. It's an absolute mish-mash of all sorts of ideas, no unifying narrative, no direction, and no hope. The book is all over the place, talking about astronomy, politics, physics, and dating. It's not linked to anywhere (and frankly I dont know what shelf to put it on), it hasnt been edited really in a year, etc. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:32, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - this is apparently about language again, so I won't vote. However, it appears to actually convey some concepts, albeit rather obliquely. Perhaps someone who cares could merge this into something that actually is a textbook, unlike this page. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:59, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - the text is not only about language, it stretches many fields but is more an interpretation of the author about many subjects, a convoluted idealization that provides nothing and leads no were.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:47, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Someone forgot to take his or her lithium. Seriously, may be original research, definitely lacks (and needs) attribution, and there's not enough there to give anyone other than the original author a chance of finding good sources. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:38, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

This is another book that i've found in my travels. This is a VG strategy guide, if you can even call it that, but I dont think it's really a candidate for transwiki. First off, it's mostly just a listing of various &quot;costs&quot; and the differences between a variety of &quot;races&quot; from a game i've never heard of. There is absolutely zero prose in this whole book, not even a suitable introduction or explanation of what it is supposed to be. Beyond that, it hasnt been edited since april 2006. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:08, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:13, 12 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:10, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

== Hello again... C++ Programming ==
About the moving of the pointers and arrays from the operators section... What the logic behind moving them out of the section (since they are operators)? 

I think I understand what irked you. Humm probably moving the [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers]] and [[C++ Programming/Operators/Arrays]] to a new location /Code/Types/ in the future...

Introducing Arrays and pointers without explaining operators first can be problematic in helping to understand the overloading of of operators and how to work with those derived types. Check [[C++ Programming/Code/Variables]] at the end and at this location in the book it would be better to make a note that those types exist (they are on the table) and point to the section were they are introduced giving freedom to the reader to select skipping or waiting until they are presented. 

I also noted that you renamed the references given to the operators. I used the same that were referred on the table (I don't have any particular objection to your rename only about consistency, I will have to take a look on the standard to check how they are referred there, we should fallow as closely to the standard as possible...)

I made minor edits (some corrections were beyond wording), moved the page (and reference section from another page) to keep up with the navigation, corrected the headers levels as it broke the TOC and restored the removed array page.

(full [[C++ Programming/Chapter Fundamentals]] or specific section [[C++ Programming/Operators]] ) 

PS: You can reply here... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:52, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

Well, what happened was that after I improved the existing section, I realized that it was more of a description of how to use pointers. For instance, why is there a section on NULL pointers in the operators section? I'm not really familiar with the way wikibooks actually works (and the policy documents are horrible to navigate), so I did the best I could. I'm thankful that you came along and fixed it up. 

I don't take offense to any corrections you make, as you're much more familiar than I am with this. I think that the best way to do this is to start by moving the pointer and array descriptions into the variables page, and then having the operators cover the actual operations in-depth. The problem I have is with pointers being described in the operators section. In C++, IMHO, they're worthy of their own page. There are pointers to functions and pointers to members, and then the combination of the two. Maybe such an advanced page should follow classes, such that pointers-to-members can properly introduced. I'll continue to write about pointers to functions and member pointers at [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/to functions]] and [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/Member pointers]] respectively, since I can't do anything wrong there.

Yup that was what I thought about the move to a specific page...  The problem with writing anything about C++ is that at some points dependencies are very difficult to maintain in a logical way as to facilitate the learning of the language, introducing pointers or arrays without the understanding of the operators that serve to declare and access this &quot;derived&quot; types is my believe, cause more confusion. I have attempted to structure the book as a mirror of how I would have liked I had learned the language, breaking the pages in smaller section and on specific points/subject will enable cross link and readers to skip/jump to other section in this I think our efforts coincide the problem is were we think the subject should rest for your edits I think you would like to insert it directly on the variable section. What I prosed above (and with my edits) is mention this specific types and point to the operators section (or even better to a specific pages of each type), for instance how would you propose explaining the operator &amp; without first  covering operators in general?

The same concept was what I proposed with [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/to functions]] and [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/Member pointers]] (names can be tweaked later, to functions and member functions would probably be better) the best place to &quot;put&quot; the text would probably be on the section dedicated to functions and classes, and reference those concepts on the pointers text (and on the functions also) pointing forward into the book. Do you agree or have a better solution that would keep some kind of logical structure to the covered subjects?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:30, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

BTW if you can, please take a look into the reply I posted on [[Talk:C++ Programming/iostream]] maybe you can extend or correct some of the information I gave to that user...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:34, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

I think that the best way to keep the structure would be to write about pointers in three places - 1) The variables page, where they can be introduced in a simple manner. 2) The operators page, where everything can be well-defined and worked on and 3) A new advanced pointers page where we could cover the uses of pointers and how they all interact. Other tidbits on pointers (like using the &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator) could also be put in the appropriate page (the page on classes for &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, and the page on inheritance for &lt;tt&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/tt&gt;).

It's also worth noting that member pointers do not have to be member function pointers. The use of member non-function pointers is extremely rare, but imagine if you are writing an RPG, and every monster has 6 stats, and each one can range from 1-99. Now, let's say that these are private. You could have a bunch of functions for each one (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;getStr()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;performStrCheck()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;increaseStr()&lt;/tt&gt;). Instead, you could have a function returning a &lt;tt&gt;const int Monster::*&lt;/tt&gt; for each stat, and then pass those around. In case it comes back to a function that requires modification (&lt;tt&gt;increaseStat()&lt;/tt&gt;, for instance), you can make an asssertion that it is a valid stat (which gets removed during the release build), and then remove the const-ness via a &lt;tt&gt;const_cast&lt;/tt&gt; and modify. This shrinks the code, and makes more complex relationships possible between classes.

I unfortunately don't have that same dearth of knowledge as to the iostream answer. My best guess, though, would be that the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; operators for primitives are actually performing the extraction or insertion. Most user-defined &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; operators (particularly &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;) are just transalting the streaming of one class into the streaming of all it's member variables. You can't do the same thing for an integer.</text>

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The sum of &quot; &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; and &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; &quot; is &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;

The above line illustrates what is called ''chaining of insertion operators'' to print multiple expressions. How this works is as follows:
#The leftmost insertion operator takes as its operands, &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt; and the string &lt;tt&gt;&quot;The sum of &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, it prints the latter using the former, and returns a ''reference'' to the former.
# Now &lt;tt&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; a&lt;/tt&gt; is evaluated. This prints the value contained in the location &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e. 123 and again returns &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt;.
# This process continues. Thus, successively the expressions &lt;tt&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; and &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; b&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; is &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; sum &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; are evaluated and the whole series of chained values is printed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Current==

Imagine a wire with charge flowing through it.  The current is the rate at which charge flows through the wire.  Say that there are n movable electrons per unit volume, that the electrons have a charge e, and move at a velocity in the direction of the wire with velocity v.  Also assume that the wire has cross-sectional area A.  Then the charge per second passing through the surface is envA.  You can easily see this if you imagine a cylinder of the wire of length v dt.  It has a volume of Av dt, and by the definition of n, nAv dt electrons, and by definition of e, enAv dt charge.  All of that (and only all of that) will go through the wire in the time dt.  Therefore, the current, i = envA.

Notice that in our formula, even though electrons have negative charge, we regard the current as positive.  This is called conventional current.  It is equivalent to an equal and opposite flow of positive charge (mathematically, that means multiplying both sides of i = envA by -1).

==Circuits==

A '''circuit component''' is a device that sets up a relationship between voltage and current.  A circuit component may have any number of terminals, and have any relationship.  However, in practice, there are only a few basic circuit components.  In analyzing circuits, it is highly advantageous to use only circuit components that, given the voltage at a single instant, or infinitesimal neighborhood, you can determine the current, and vice versa.  Two very simple circuit elements are voltage sources and current sources.  A voltage source keeps the voltage fixed and lets the current be whatever it wants.  A current source keeps the current constant and lets the voltage be whatever it wants.  A third simple circuit element is the resistor, which keeps the voltage proportional to the current, with the constant of proportionality called the resistance.  We can write these relationships as:

V = V_0;
I = I_0;
V = IR

for a voltage source, current source, and resistor respectively.

A special case of the voltage source is when it keeps the voltage zero; this is called a short circuit or wire.  When a current source keeps the current zero, it is called an open circuit.  We may regard an open circuit as not being part of the circuit at all, and a short circuit as just combining the two circuit elements it joins.

A circuit or network is a collection of circuit components hooked together.  Naturally, there will be loops and nodes, which are when two or more circuit components join together.  At every node, we assume that charge does not build up, and that charge is conserved.  That is, the current going in is the current going out.  In any loop, we assume that an electron going around cannot speed up faster and faster ad infinitum, in other words, the voltage in a closed loop must be zero; that is, energy is conserved.  These two rules, along with the voltage-current (v-i) relationships, completely describes a circuit.  With these, we can find every voltage and every current.

&lt;!-- reference voltages, currents, capacitors, inductors, nodal and loopal analysis--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">If we have an electron orbiting the nucleus, the electron is accelerating towards the nucleus.  It is well known that an accelerating charge produces radiation, which contains energy.  Therefore, as the electron orbits, it loses energy and consequently will eventually fall into the nucleus.  The classical model of electrons orbiting a nucleus must therefore be wrong because not only do we not observe the radiation, but the electrons do NOT fall into the nucleus.

Bohr proposed that the angular momentum of the electrons could only take on discrete values, say, &lt;math&gt;n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;.  The energy of the electrons is also quantized as a result, so unless an electron gets enough energy to jump energy levels, it cannot emit a photon; that is, it will not radiate.

We will work through a very simple case of the Bohr model.

Assume we have a single electron of mass m orbiting a single proton in a circular orbit, and the angular momentum is &lt;math&gt;n \hbar&lt;/math&gt; where n is any integer greater than zero.  Also assume that the mass of an electron is negligible compared to that of a proton.

&lt;math&gt;L = mvr = n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{ke^2}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v^2 = \frac{ke^2}{mr}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{ke^2}{mvr} = \frac{ke^2}{n \hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{n \hbar}{mv} = n^2 \frac{\hbar^2}{mke^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{ke^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{m (ke^2)^2}{n^2 \hbar^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Bohr model, surprisingly, makes very good predictions about the energy of the photons emitted from an electron jumping levels.  We could continue our model and calculate such things as the magnetic moment of hydrogen and figure out what we expect the magnetic properties to be.

===Flaws of the Bohr Model===

Only works for hydrogenic(one-electron) atoms.

The assumption of discrete angular momentum values is unexplained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Special Relativity===
One of Einstein's most famous theories was the theory of special relativity.  Relativity explains the dynamics of systems in motion relative to one other.  

&lt;p&gt;One popular example is that of a person on a train watching a stationary person on the ground.  When you view the problem in one light, you may think that the person on the train is moving (this is from the stationary persons vantage point).  Now, think of the problem from the viewpoint of the person on the moving train--he thinks that the person on the ground is moving.  Ultimately, you may choose to view the problem in either way--there is no right or wrong answer.  Everything just depends on your viewpoint.
&lt;p&gt;
All of special relativity can be derived from two principles
&lt;p&gt;1) Physics is the same in any inertial reference frame.  If you're riding in your car on the highway (with the windows up) and you drop a ball it falls in the same way as if you were stopped at a stop sign and dropped the same ball.
&lt;p&gt; 2) Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (which should really be called the speed of a massless particle).  This speed is approximately &lt;math&gt;3x10^8 m/s&lt;/math&gt;

Strictly speaking, information cannot travel faster than the speed of light.  It can be shown that if a signal travels faster than light, in some reference frame, the information is received before it is sent, which is nonsense.  However, there is no restriction on other things.  For example, if I had a projector very far away from a screen, and I wave my hand in front of it very quickly, the shadow will travel faster than light.  Also, the phase velocity of light waves in some circumstances will be greater than the speed of light.  However, it is impossible to transmit any signal faster than light with these objects.

We could derive all of relativity from the two postulates, but that would not be very enlightening, because it is a rather technical proof.  Instead, consider that Alice is in a frame moving at velocity v with respect to Bob.  Let's call Alice's frame A', and Bob's frame A.  It follows that

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x' = \frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;y' = y&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;z' = z&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;t' = \frac{t - vx/c^2}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the Galilean transform,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x' = x - vt&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;y' = y&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;z' = z&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;t' = t&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The startling thing about the first set of equations, called the Lorentz transform, is that if  substituted into Maxwell's equations, they leave them unchanged!  If you try to substitute the second set of equations in, you get different equations.  Anywhere there is electricity and magnetism, the Galilean transform must be wrong.

It is possible to derive all the results in relativity from the Lorentz transforms, much like all of non-relativistic mechanics comes from the Gallilean transform and Newton's laws.

Let's look at some properties of the Lorentz transform.  First, the inverse of the transform (solving for the unprimed components in terms of the primed ones) gives exactly the same thing except with v replaced with -v, as we would expect.

If there is a burst of light, defined by &lt;math&gt; x = c t&lt;/math&gt; it remains unchanged.  

==Four Vectors==

Note that

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x' = \frac{x - (v/c) ct}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;y' = y&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;z' = z&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;ct' = \frac{ct - (v/c)x}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

With new notation,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma (x - \beta ct)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;y' = y&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;z' = z&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;ct' = \gamma (ct - \beta x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Define a four-vector to be a 4-tuple with components such that when transformed to a new frame with characteristic &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, then the components transform as above.  For example, (x,y,z,ct) is a four vector.  If &lt;math&gt; x = (a,b,c,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a four vector, then when changing frames (when &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is in the x direction), we have &lt;math&gt; x' = ( \gamma (a - \beta d), b, c, \gamma(d - \beta a))&lt;/math&gt;.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:19, 12 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Regarding [[Good Teaching]] ==
I have seen the new stub for a new book. Try and avoid signing the content you add to a book (the information is kept on the edit history of the page), if you must create an authors page ( see [[C++ Programming/Authors]] ) and create also one stating the scope of the book if you like.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:25, 12 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

I'm glad you've come to wikibooks, and i'm sorry if you feel you need to prepare an unblock template already! Here at wikibooks we tend to be a lot more laid-back and lenient then they are at wikipedia. We have fewer rules and ask only that people work to the best of their ability, to improve the project.

We have lots and lots of things to do. Let me ask you: what do you like to do? what are you good at doing? We need everything: authoring content, copyediting, organizing, general maintenance, answering questions, greeting new users, etc. All the usual tasks. What kinds of subjects are you interested in? We probably have a book or two that you can adopt. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:07, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

:Oh nevermind. I didnt realize that you were actually a vandal. You've already been blocked, probably wont be unblocked either. Sorry. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:09, 13 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Signal Processing/Page}}

== Fourier Analysis ==

The [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Fourier_Series Fourier Series] allows to represent a '''periodic signal''' in terms of its frequency components, instead of it's time waveform.
The periodic signal can be represented as the sum of sinusoïds of frequencies being all integer multiples of the signal's base frequency, which is the inverse of the signal's period.

The [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Aperiodic_Signals Fourier Transform] extends this approach for '''aperiodic signals'''.
The signal is considered to be the sum of infinitesimal sinusoids. The sinusoïds are no more integer multiples of a base frequency but are found everywhere on the frequency axis.

The Fourier Series and the Fourier Transform both have an inverse transform.
The transformation can be carried out from the time domain to the frequency domain as well as from the frequency domain back to the time domain without any loss of information.
In other words, the frequency and the temporal representations are equivalent: they are both accurate representations of the signal and convey it's complete information.

== Laplace Analysis ==

[[Image:LTI.png|thumb|Laplace analysis of a LTI system|right|320px]]

Whilst the Fourier Series and the Fourier Transform are well suited for analysing the frequency content of a signal,
the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/LaPlace_Transform Laplace transform] is the tool of choice for analysing and developing circuits such as filters.

Indeed, the Laplace transform is used for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform#Properties_and_theorems solving differential and integral equations].
With this transform, differentiation and integration respectively become multiplication and division by &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

=== LTI Systems ===

Circuits such as filters which implement a set of differential equations on an incoming signal in order to modify it are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_system_theory Linear Time Invariant] (LTI).

In the frequency domain, the input signal's frequency content, &lt;math&gt;X(s)&lt;/math&gt;, is multiplied by the transfer function of a LTI system, &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, to determine the output signal's frequency content, &lt;math&gt;Y(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Filters ===

Time-continuous (analog) filters are LTI systems used to damp unwanted frequency contents out of a signal or to amplify desired frequency bands of the signal.

They are used to:
* damp out noise which has been added to the signal,
* limit the frequency content of a signal in order to mix it with other signals having different frequency contents on a common transmission channel,
* retreive a single signal which has been mixed with others on a common transmission channel,
* limit the frequency content of a signal before sampling it at a given rate.

From this, the usual shape of a transfer function would be of &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_filter#Brick-wall_filters brick-wall]&quot; type: letting all the signal through in certain frequency bands and letting nothing trough in the others.
Alas, this is not possible.
It can be shown that brick-wall filters would need an infinite time to provide the very beginning of the output signal.
Because of this, filter designers have to fall back on transfer functions close to the brick-wall characteristic but which are physicall realizable: Butterworth, Chebychev, …

== Sampled systems analysis ==

Sampled systems, such as switched-capacitor or digital filters, are not analysed based on differential equation but on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation difference equations].
At a given time, the output of a sampled filter is a function of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; last values of the filter's input and internal signals.

Solving difference equations is done with the help of the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Z-Transform_Introduction Z-transform].
Similarily to the Laplace analysis, the Z-transform of the input signal, &lt;math&gt;X(z)&lt;/math&gt;, is multiplied by the sampled transfer function, &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt;, to determine the output signal's Z-transform, &lt;math&gt;Y(z)&lt;/math&gt;.
The time samples of the output signal, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated with the help of the inverse Z-transform of &lt;math&gt;Y(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Digital filters ===

Digital filters can perform the same tasks as their analog counterparts, but on sampled signals.
Additionally, they can be used to:
* insert additional samples between the original samples of a signal in order ot increase the sampling rate of a signal (interpolation)
* predict furure values of a signal (extrapolation)
* adapt their transfer function based on an evaluation of the signal's time-varying charactersitics.

=== Adaptative filters ===

The adaptative filtering problem stems from the fact that data is transmitted over noisy channels. At the receiver, the data from a signal needs to be separated from other data streams, inter-symbol interference, and external noise. Notice that both noise and other data streams can be considered to be stochastic (random) processes. These processes can be found to have certain characteristics, such as mean and variance.
On top of the problem of separation is the fact that the characteristics of the various components of the received signal, the data itself, the noise, and the other data streams all change over time. For instance, new transmitters could be adding data streams to the channel, or new noise could be added, or the sender of the target data stream could be altered. The mean and variance of the various components could change over time. 

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]
As an analogy, consider a room with one person speaking (the speaker), and one person listening (the listener). The room will have certain ambient noises, such as electrical hums from the sound system, or the feint sounds of other speakers in other rooms. In general, if the ratio of the speaker's volume to the volume of the other noises is high, the listener will have no trouble focusing on the speaker. However, if a second speaker sets up a podium and begins speaking, the listener will have trouble focusing, because the received signal has changed.
&lt;/div&gt;

The filtering problem, in essence, is trying to detect and extract useful data from a noisy signal. The characteristics of the data and the background noise might not be known ''a priori'', and they are likely to change over time.</text>

'''Soda pop''', commonly called '''soda''' or '''pop''' (esp. in Canada), is a soft drink involving the use of syrup, usually from concentrate, added to carbonated [[Cookbook:Water|water]].  Two famous examples of companies that produce soda pop are PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.  Well known flavors include cola, lemon-lime, orange, ginger ale, cream soda, and grape.

== State Observation ==

The state space model of a system is the model of a single plant, not a true feedback system. The feedback mechanism that relates ''x' '' to ''x'' is a representation of the mechanism internal to the plant, where the state of the plant is related to its derivative. As such, we do not have an ''A'' &quot;component&quot; in the sense that we can swap one ''A'' &quot;chip&quot; with another ''A'' &quot;chip&quot;. The entire state-space model, incorporating ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are all part of one device. Frequently, these matrices are immutable, that is that they cannot be altered by the engineer, because they are intrinsic parts of the plant. However, these matrices can change if the plant itself is altered, such as through thermal effects and RF interference.

If the system can be treated as basically immutable (except for effects out of the engineers control), then we need to find a way to modify the system ''externally''. From our studies in classical controls, we know that the best system for such modifications is a feedback loop. What we would like to do, ultimately, is to add an additional feedback element, ''K'' that can be used to move the poles of the system to any desired location. Using a technique called &quot;state feedback&quot; on a controllable system, we can do just that.

== State Feedback ==

In '''state feedback''', the value of the state vector is fed back to the input of the system. We define a new input, ''r'', and define the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = r(t) + Kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;

''K'' is a constant matrix that is external to the system, and therefore can be modified to adjust the locations of the poles of the system. This technique can only work if the system is controllable.

=== Closed-Loop System ===

If we have an external feedback element ''K'', the system is said to be a '''closed-loop system'''. Without this feedback element, the system is said to be an '''open-loop system'''. Using the relationship we've outlined above between ''r'' and ''u'', we can write the equations for the closed-loop system:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = Ax + B(r + Kx)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x' = (A + BK)x + Br&lt;/math&gt;

Now, our closed-loop state equation appears to have the same form as our open loop state equation, except that the sum ''(A + BK)'' replaces the matrix ''A''. We can define the closed-loop state matrix as:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{cl} = (A_{ol} + BK)&lt;/math&gt;

''A&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the closed-loop state matrix, and ''A&lt;sub&gt;ol&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the open-loop state matrix. By altering ''K'', we can change the eigenvalues of this matrix, and therefore change the locations of the poles of the system. If the system is controllable, we can find the characteristic equation of this system as:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(s) = |sI - A_{cl}| = |sI - (A_{ol} + BK)|&lt;/math&gt;

Computing the determinant is not a trivial task, the determinant of that matrix can be very complicated, especially for larger systems. However, if we transform the system into '''controllable canonical form''', the calculations become much easier.

=== Controllable Cannonical Form ===

== Linear Prediction ==

Linear prediction is an important tool in the field of Signal Processing, but also in related engineering fields. Linear prediction is the process where we attempt to predict the value of the next sample, given a set of previous samples. The number of previous samples required depends on the type of predictor that we employ. We will discuss this in more detail later.

A predictor is said to have an order of ''m'' if it has at most ''m'' taps in the forward or backward direction. The forward direction, the '''feed forward elements''' are the zeros of the filter. The backward direction, or the '''feedback elements''' are the poles of the filter. In other words, the filter has an order ''m'' if it has ''m'' zeros or ''m'' poles, whichever is greater.

== Forward Prediction ==

A forward linear predictor is a filter that attempts to predict the ''u(n)'' sample from the previous ''m'' samples. Forward predictors are causal, which means they only act on previous results.

== Backward Prediction ==

Backward prediction is similar to forward prediction, and we will see later that they are closely related mathematically. Backward prediction is the process of trying to determine the ''u(n + M - 1)'' element of a signal given the next ''M'' elements. In other words, the backward predictor is an attempt to &quot;remember&quot; what a past value was, given later values.

== Lattice Filters ==

Lattice filters are interesting tools to use because they can simultaneously calculate the forward and backward filter coefficients given a set of special '''reflection coefficients'''. These reflection coefficients can, in turn, be calculated from the forward or backward filter coefficients. Also, the relflection coefficients can be calculated from other metrics, such as the signal power, or the autocorrelation function. We will discuss the reflection coefficients more in the next chapter.</text>

&lt;big&gt;Random Variables&lt;/big&gt;
*Quantity that theoretically may assume a wide variety of actual values, even though at any given time we only observe a single value
*Probability distribution of the variable is both the specification of all values the variable can take on, as well as the frequency with which it occurs in the entire population 
*A set of values observed (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is called a sample from the population (the population being defined by the probability distribution)
*A random sample assumes that the characteristics of the sample reflects those of the entire population, of which the sample may be only a small part
*Two types of random variables:
**Discrete random variable: it is possible to identify all values that a variable may take. Example: gender
**Continuous random variable: variable may take on any value (typically within a range), and the value is only limited by the precision of the measurements. Example: height
*Probability distribution is often illustrated with a histogram:
**Probability curve: x-axis specifies values, y-axis specifies number of occurrences
**Cumulative probability curve: x-axis specifies values, y-axis specifies the probability that the variable value '''X''' is at most ''a'', that is Pr('''X'''&lt;=''a'')</text>

&lt;big&gt;Characteristics of Distribution&lt;/big&gt;
*Need to specify if variable is discrete or continuous
*Location:
**Mean ('''μ'''): average value
**Median: value that divides the probability distribution in half, meaning half of values are above it and half are below it
**Mean and median are the same for symmetrical distributions, and different for skewed distribution. Extreme values of '''X''' influence mean much more than median
*Spread:
**Variance ('''σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''': the mean value for all variables of the distance from x to mean, squared. Calculated as the mean of (X-μ)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
**Standard deviation ('''σ'''): square root of the variance. Effectively the mean difference of variable x from mean
*Mean and standard distribution provide approximate distribution of the variables</text>

&lt;big&gt;Fisher's Exact Test (2x2)&lt;/big&gt;
==Overview==
*Very common in smaller medical studies
*Appropriate for binary data 
*Evaluates association between two binary classifications
**&lt;u&gt;Characteristic&lt;/u&gt; 
***&quot;Group 1&quot; vs. &quot;Group 2&quot;
***For example: male/female, treatment given/no treatment given, treatment type 1/treatment type 2, high dose/low dose, etc.
**&lt;u&gt;Outcome&lt;/u&gt; 
***&quot;Success&quot; vs. &quot;Failure&quot;
***For example: alive/dead, response/no response, recurrence/no recurrence, etc.
**This defines a 2x2 matrix

*Used for small sample sizes (typically less than 50), due to limitation on computational power. Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Medical_Statistics/Chi_Squared|Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Test]] for more information on approximations 


==Details==
*Hypothesis tested (H0) is that there is no association between the two classifications
*Fisher's test determines the degree to which this hypothesis is consistent with the data
**Probability of correlation of Group 1 with Outcome 1 (e.g. male - survive) is ''p1''
**Probability of correlation of Group 2 with Outcome 2 (e.g. female - survive) is ''p2''
**The test hypothesis (H0) is that there is no correlation, and that ''p1 = p2''
*Therefore, the population &quot;success&quot; rate (Outcome 1) ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p1'' = ''p2'', and can be calculated as (Group 1 Outcome 1 + Group 2 Outcome 1) / (Total Population) 
*Observation: We observe a given total number of Outcome 1 in the study
*Question is, are the Outcomes 1 divided between Group 1 and Group 2 such that ''p1'' = ''p2'', or are they split up such that it is '''not likely that''' ''p1'' = ''p2''?
*To objectively evaluate this question, we set up the tables showing all the possible outcomes that we could have seen, given the fixed number of cases in Group 1 and Group 2, and the fixed number of Outcome 1 and Outcome 2.
*Test statistic ('''T''') is the number of Outcome 1 (&quot;success&quot;) in Group 1. 
*Given that the number of cases in Group 1 and Group 2 is known, and the number of Outcome 1 and Outcome 2 events is known, knowing '''T''' determines all the other points in the matrix

*We then evaluate the probability that each possible outcome (including the actual observed outcome) would occur by chance from a random sampling
**Binomial coefficient calculations are done to find the probability that a table '''T''' (range of '''t''') would be observed by chance in a random sampling: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p = {{{R1}\choose{t}}{{N-R1}\choose{C1-t}}}\left/{{{N}\choose{C1}}}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

**However, as these are computationally intensive, statistical tables or software is generally used to evaluate probability of '''T''' 
*The probability of the actual outcome &lt;u&gt;combined with&lt;/u&gt; the probability of the even less likely outcomes occurring due to chance random sampling alone defines the ''significance level (p)''
**If the probability of these outcomes is &lt;5% (p&lt;0.05), typically the test hypothesis that there is no difference between the populations is rejected
*Assumptions:
**Probability of Outcome for each member of a given Group is the same; it does not vary from member to member. Random sampling ensures this
**The Outcome of one member does not affect the outcome of a different member


==Example==
*Adapted from PMID 6092550 as shown in [http://www.amazon.com/Using-Understanding-Medical-Statistics-Matthews/dp/3805581890/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-9016758-3810830?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1189655997&amp;sr=8-1 Using and Understanding Medical Statistics]
*In our example above, there are 4 total relapses observed. The question is, is the rate of relapse related to treatment type (large field RT vs. small field RT)?
*If the H0 hypothesis is true, and the two failure rates are comparable, and are also comparable to the failure rate in the entire population, then ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4/259 = 0.015
*The expected number of failures observed in the ''Small Field RT'' group would therefore be 23 patients x 0.015 = 0.4 failures
*However, 2 failures were observed. Is this likely due to chance, or not?
*There are 5 possibilities of how the 4 failures could have been observed in a random sampling (with Possibility 2 being the actual observation):

|}
*Our original hypothesis is that the probability of failure in Small Field RT is the same as in Large Field RT, which is the same as in the entire underlying population treated with RT. Possibility 0 (68.7%) and Possibility 1 (27.1%) would have been reasonably consistent with this hypothesis
*The probability that the actual observation (Possibility 2) occurs as a result of the random sampling process is 0.039 (3.9%), which is not as reasonable. Possibilities 3-5 are even less likely to be reasonable than the actual observation (0.2%, 0.01%)
*The ''significance level'' is the sum of probability of the observed occurrence (3.9%) and the probabilities of the even less likely possibilities (0.2%, 0.01%) = 4.11%; expressed as ''p=0.04''
*In this example, the hypothesis that there is no difference between the two groups with respect to the two outcomes is rejected. Conclusion: Small Field RT results in significantly more failures

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Great Depression ==

During the Great Depression a large number of people lost their jobs and were left with large debts that they could not pay off. The depression started on the 24th of October 1929. At the beginning of 1929, small investors in the American markets started selling off their stock. This lead to a small drop in the share prices. This small decrease in the price continued until October 24 where 13 million shares were sold at greatly reduced prices. This lead to a downward spiral of economic death.
There is much speculation why the Great Depression happened in the first place. The most popular theory is that playing the share market had become another fad. People were buying without really knowing what they were buying. This pushed the shares much higher than their real value. When they started to collapse, people started to panic and tried to get out before the lost all their savings.
This then slowly spread across the world. Australia who was in lots of debt was perhaps hit hardest. People lost their jobs, their houses, and nearly everything they owned.
The Newly elected American President, President Hoover, came up with a plan to halt this economic spiral. His plan was called New Deals and incorporated the thinking that if he started employing lots of people to build government funded buildings, the economy might jump-start. To start with, he shutdown all banks until they could declare that they were financially stable. His plan worked, and it’s President Roosevelt who we need to thank for our modern day good and prosperous economy.

&lt;big&gt;''Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (Chi-Squared)&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Used for comparison of two classifications schemes, which may each have multiple categories 
*Purpose is to determine the probability that observed data are (or are not) consistent with the hypothesis H0: the probability of outcomes in the different groups is the same
*Used to approximate [[Radiation_Oncology/Medical_Statistics/Fishers_Test|Fisher's Exact Test (2x2)]] for large numbers:
**Accuracy of estimation depends on the total number of observations in each cell
**Expected observations number (calculated from actual observations; see below) should be at least 5 in each cell
*Used to extend [[Radiation_Oncology/Medical_Statistics/Fishers_Test|Fisher's Exact Test]] for comparison of classification schemes with &gt;2 categories

==''Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' for 2x2 Table==
*Used for tables, which are too large for [[Radiation_Oncology/Medical_Statistics/Fishers_Test|Fisher's Exact Test]] 
*The process is parallel; please see that page for details of initial set-up

*Start by assuming that H0 is true, and that ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p1'' = ''p2''
*Calculate the expected 2x2 table based on the observed total numbers 
**Expected population &quot;success rate&quot; is ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = C1 / N
**Using ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the observed Group 1/2, Outcome 1/2 numbers, calculate the expected 2x2 table
*Compare the expected table to the observed table, by calculating test statistic '''T''' 
*One way of calculating '''T''' is to evaluate the proportional difference in each cell between the observed and expected values, and then sum them all
**'''T''' = ((O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) + ((O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) + ((O&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;) + ((O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;)
*After some nifty mathematics, this can more simply be calculated from the original bserved table
**'''T''' = N * (|O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; * O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; - O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; * O&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;| - 1/2*N)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / R1 * R2 * C1 * C2
*Because '''T''' is derived from observed-expected difference, the larger the '''T''', the more different the tables are, and the less likely H0
*In order to calculate the significance level, we need to evaluate the probability that the observed table was due to random sampling, which is related to the size of '''T'''. We also need to evaluate the probability of all the other possible tables that could have been observed (again, same as in Fisher's test)
*When H0 is true, the probability distribution of '''T''' is ''approximately'' the same as the probability distribution for the Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function
*We can therefore approximately determine the probability of observed '''T''' by evaluating the Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function at the '''T''' level (by looking it up in a table)
*Because these are approximations, the table typically gives critical values:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book Intentions ==

What is the intention of this book? Is this book going to only focus on definitions and examples of each proof, or will there also be detailed explanations for each proof aimed at helping to teach and learn each proof or will a separate math book be needed to understand the proofs and to put them into context? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:30, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

: The book focuses on proofs so certainly there will be detailed proofs. Examples and definitions should be included to supplement the proof.

: The two objectives of the book in my view are:

:* Complement other wikibooks by providing them with a place where they can put the tedious proofs of their theorems while they themselves concentrate on the explanations part. (I am assuming that such a complementary book is allowed in wikibooks as a [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks#Wikibooks_is_not_a_dictionary|book with a glossary of math terms is allowed]].)

:* Focus on the beauty of mathematical proofs as such. For example a result may have a geometric proof, an algebraic proof, a rigorous proof from the foundation etc. All such proofs can be included. The pythagoras theorem has many proofs. Trigonometric identities have geometric proofs. The Axiom of Choice has many equivalent formulations. 

:Please help contribute to the book. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 05:22, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

::Sure books can have glossaries, but a glossary is secondary and not the main part of a book, nor is it a separate book. Thats actually why I asked what the intention is. So if its suppose to let other books concentrate on the explanation parts, then am I right in saying that this book would not be explaining the proofs at all? You first say that there will be detailed proofs in answer to my question which was asking about &quot;detailed explanations for each proof&quot;, but go on to explain the objectives which seems to suggest instead that it will be relying on other math books to provide explanations for the proofs.

::Even reference books I've read have detailed explanations, usually assuming some prior knowledge of the subject, but still explaining some things as to refresh/remind people with professionals/advanced knowledge of the subject, and put whats being referenced into context. If this book to be complimentary, sounds like it should still be having explanations, but directed at people with advanced knowledge, leaving the details needed to help beginners to other math books. Perhaps that is already whats intended?

::I can't unfortunately help contribute to this book, because I don't know any proofs or at least I don't think I do. What proofs are covered isn't an issue. I'm just checking up to be sure its not intended to be a dictionary of math proofs. I'm not trying to scare you, discourage you or anything, just want to help insure you've got the right project for your work in the form you want it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:47, 6 October 2007 (UTC)


What about creating the entire proof tree from the axioms, definitions and lemmas? That is a dream I have thought of for a long time. [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 13:43, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

:I too wanted to have some kind of proof tree in the book (see my [[User:Shahab/Sandbox|sandbox]]). That would be a good idea. Anyway in response to Darklama, the proofs will be certainly explained. The explanations in other books will be of the concepts. An example is this [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Proofs in Analysis/Metric Spaces|page]]. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 10:49, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

:: Great! Is there anyone that has an idea on how one organizes proofs/lemmas, definitions and axioms? Maybe creating a template for proofs, like &quot;This proof uses proof(s) A,B,C&quot;, and try to motivate every (non-trivial) step by linking to the proof/axiom used? [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 09:02, 9 October 2007 (UTC)


:How about this: 
&lt;div 
  class=&quot;noprint&quot; 
  style=&quot; clear: right; 
          border: dashed 1px;
          border-color: #ffffff #a0a7ff #a0a7ff #a0a7ff;
          margin: 0 0 1em 0; 
          font-size: 90%; 
          background: #f3f4ff; 
          width: 200px; 
          padding: 4px; 
          spacing: 0px; 
          text-align: left; 
          float: right;&quot; 
&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Question dropshade.png|50px|none|Full Proof]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 60px;&quot;&gt; This result uses the following proof:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;'''''[[The Book of Mathematical Proofs|Link to Proof]]'''''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Similar templates can be made for axioms and definitions. I got this from the Measure Theory book. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 10:50, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

: That looks great, I was thinking something like this [[User:Paxinum/Proof styles]]. [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 15:11, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

::Nice. I would suggest the phrase ''This result uses the following:'' instead  of ''Depends on''. Can you make the template? Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 11:12, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:::I put it under '''Resources''' on the front page. This is just an example. [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 20:29, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestion for editors==
All proofs available on the wikipedia site and on other wikibooks can be copied here. Formatting can be done later. Right now we need to add more content to the book. Also this [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/The_Book_of_Mathematical_Proofs link] can be used to watch changes related to the entire book.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 10:57, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

== Structure ==

This book needs a consistent and suitable structure for its purpose.

At the moment, each page (on the whole) relates to an entire ''branch'' of mathematics, with an assortment of theorems and a proof or two of each.  This is going to be no use as the number of theorems and proofs increases.  We need to break down the pages into subcategories and theorems.  We should also avoid vague headings like &quot;Theorem 1&quot; as is currently on [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Proofs in Number Theory|Proofs in Number Theory]].

Before this was started, I drafted some pages for a proofs book, intending to put it up when I've got a bit of content ready.  The structure I had in mind was basically to categorise the theorems hierarchically and have a page for each theorem, which has a subpage for each proof.

What do we think?  I think it would be good to work towards a 'one page, one theorem' principle.

If nobody minds, I'll make a start on improving the structure.

While I'm at it, how should [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Proofs in Geometry|Proofs in Geometry]] be subcategorised?  Sections that should be included include:
* Plane Euclidean geometry
* Solid Euclidean geometry
* Projective geometry
* Elliptic geometry
* Hyperbolic geometry
but I'm not sure what the best hierarchy would be.  Some theorems would cross the boundaries between these sections - how we should put these in is also something to think about. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:10, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

:Definitely a hierarchical structure is needed in the book. What I feel is that we should adopt 2 approaches side by side in developing the book. One approach is to frame the sequence of the proofs by building different pages for each topics like in [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Proofs in Algebra/Proofs in Linear Algebra/Matrix Theory|matrix theory proofs]] and while simultaneously also populating the book with proofs just dumped under the pages of the fields in mathematics. After sufficient proofs have been added then they can be categorised further. The one page- one proof principle is good but should be applied for lengthy and/or interesting proofs (such as Pythagoras, FTA etc). Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 16:01, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:: So if I understand correctly, you're proposing that the content and the structure should be developed independently of each other, with theorems/proofs dumped under the higher-level pages pending splitting into subpages.  All well; moreover, I think we should concentrate on categorising theorems rather than categorising proofs.  Once we've got the theorems categorised, we can look at whether it's worth subcategorising proofs of the same theorem, e.g. geometrical vs. algebraic proofs of Pythagoras' theorem.
:: One thing I don't get: What's with the use of &quot;but&quot; in your last sentence?  Did you by any chance miss out a word to the effect of &quot;only&quot;?
:: Also, I think we should get rid of the phrase &quot;Proofs in&quot; from chapter titles.  It's redundant, inconsistently applied and making some page titles excessively long. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 17:14, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:::I agree that categorising by theorems is correct and that the word proof from the chapter title should be removed. One thing that we have to keep in mind is that to maintain accessibility the theorem/proofs should not lie more then 2 levels deep in the hierarchy. What we can do is to create lists in the 1 level deep subject page eg the Algebra page for the various branches of Algebra (eg linear algebra, abstract algebra etc). Each list should contain its subdivisions and a sublist of links to various pages of proofs. For example:
 
'''Abstract Algebra'''
*Group Theory (&lt;small&gt;Basic proofs&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;Isomorphism Theorems&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;Sylow Theorems&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;Fundamental Theorem of finitely generated abelian groups&lt;/small&gt; etc)
*Ring Theory(...)
 
All this should be on the Algebra page only and so only 1 level deep. The 2nd level should contain the theorems/proofs. This way accessibility will be easy. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 09:36, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

: Let me think ... so
:* [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs]] - main page
:* [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Algebra]] - section page, with a full TOC of the section
:* [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Algebra/Group Isomorphism Theorems]] - page giving theorems and proofs thereof, not long/detailed enough to merit a separate page for each theorem
:* [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Algebra/Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]] - page devoted to a single theorem that is complicated, has a long proof or has several supplied proofs
: I suppose this would work.  Actually, there's still one thing for which I think we should use the third level: if so many proofs of the same theorem have been contributed that it becomes desirable to split them across pages.  I don't think this would compromise ease of navigation, partly because it would be done only occasionally, and partly because people are likely to want to find the theorem before choosing from the various (groups of) proofs of it to look at. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 12:13, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

::One point to keep in mind is that the link titled ''Basic Proofs'' should actually point to ''Basic Proofs (Group Theory)'' in the example above. A similar title should be used for names which are associated with many theorems eg ''Cauchy's Theorem (Group Theory)'', ''Cauchy's Theorem (Complex Analysis)'' etc. --[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 15:20, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

::: I'm not sure whether &quot;Basic Proofs (Group Theory)&quot; is a good title, or if it should be &quot;Basic Group Theory&quot; instead.  But it's a suitable notation for distinguishing theorems with the same name.  Moreover, what shall we do with the titles of the as-yet-uncreated &quot;Definitions in&quot; pages?  I personally think incorporating definitions into the same first-level subpages as the proofs would work or, if not, making them [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Algebra/Definitions]] and similar. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 23:28, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:::: What about instead of having duplicate pages with multiple theorems, there was one page for each theorem classification? Each page could include an explanation/definition of the classification and a list of links to associated theorems/proofs. So for example there could be a &quot;Group Theory&quot; page and a &quot;Complex Analysis&quot; page both with a link to a page called &quot;Cauchy's Theorem&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:52, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::Not sure if that would help. In fact it would then be confusing to link theorems with multiple people names. For example Peano-Cauchy theorem would then point to the page on Cauchy's theorem. Also it would really be better to keep a page related to one field only. Our ultimate aim is to build a whole hierarchy of proofs. In response to Smjg I think definitions can be incorporated inside the proofs. In fact many proofs provide us with the definitions. For example the Ramsey number is a number which exists due to Ramsey's theorem &amp; so it should be logically defined just after Ramsey's theorem is proved.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 17:35, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::: I'm now going to make a start at implementing these ideas.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 00:05, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

I have built a list or a TOC for the [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Number Theory|Number Theory page]]. Please take a look at the format and give me your opinion. Also while deciding on the subtopics to include in the list I found that 

1. Unless the theorem is sufficiently big to merit a page of its own it should be kept within a page containing lots of other theorems related to the same topic. For example the prime numbers page can contain the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. However this should not preclude the fundamental theorem to have a seperate mention on the list of subtopics so that it remains accessible to casual browsers.  

2.It will be a generally good idea to list the topics rather then the theorems because a majority of the theorems don't have names but are extremely useful.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 10:54, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

: The structure in itself seems OK, but I'm not sure about the choice of subsubtopics.  Maybe we should try developing the chapter and see how it goes.  And are we going to have headings in sentence case or title case?  You can't seem to make up your mind even within the course of a single editing operation. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:09, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

----
I've just had a go at writing a contents page for [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs/Geometry]].  Please tell me what you think. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 12:59, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

:Nice, although I'd prefer small case in the subtopics. I'll soon start work on the number theory page. Lets develop the chapters and see what we learn from that. One more thing: The standard on the wikipedia site is that in a section heading only the first letter of the first word, letters in acronyms, and the first letter of proper nouns are capitalized; all other letters are in lower case (Funding of UNESCO projects, not Funding of UNESCO Projects). Do you think that we should implement that policy here?--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 15:33, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

:: While sentence-case titles are a standard on Wikipedia, titles on Wikibooks are a mixture.  This applies to both page titles and section headings within a page.  I don't think there's an official Wikibooks policy, but the consensus seem to be 'each book for itself', while it should be kept consistent within any one book.  At the moment and for this case, I'm not sure which convention I prefer.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:35, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

== Which form of English? ==

Should we standardise (or standardize?) on British or American spelling/terminology?  It's going to affect quite a bit (centre/center, trapezium/trapezoid JTNAF) and possibly even some page titles.  We should certainly ''address'' such dialectal differences as trapezium/trapezoid - the question at the moment is which forms should be in general use throughout the book. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 13:16, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

== Book Intentions 2 ==
Originally I started the book with the aim of creating a collection of all possible mathematical definitions, theorems and proofs. Increasingly I started feeling that this amounts to just creating an encyclopaedia of mathematics, a function well served elsewhere. The book has too gigantic a scope if built with this intention and is doomed to fail. The only alternative I feel would be to change the original objectives of the book, and instead to create a repository of the beautiful/good proofs in mathematics, without any regard to the various fields they belong to. For example, the Pythagoras Theorem, Euler's Theorem, Fermats theorem etc can qualify as beautiful proofs. The community can decide by consensus on the talk page whether any proof is worthy of being included or not. Any comments?--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 17:49, 2 August 2008 (UTC)
:I propose changing the name of the book to [[Famous theorems of mathematics]] in accordance with the discussion [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2008/August#change_in_intentions_with_which_the_book_was_created|here]] and for the same reasons as stated above.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 06:01, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

== Transwiki ==

Hello, there is currently a discussion on Wikipedia ([[w:Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics/Proofs]]) about the correct way to include proofs in Wikipedia articles. There is an emerging consensus that not all proofs are appropriate on WP, and we are looking for someplace where we can put proofs that have already been written but are not appropriate for WP. It seems this book, at least in its previous title, could be the right place. Would it be all right with everyone here if we transferred various miscellaneous proofs from WP to this book? --[[User:Zvika|Zvika]] ([[User talk:Zvika|talk]]) 08:22, 17 December 2009 (UTC)

:Something similar to what you want was my initial intention with this book but the resultant turned out to be a big mess. In my experience such a repository of proofs is not a textbook per se, and does not qualify to be a wikibook unless systematically organized so that it is a comprehensive whole for a reader. I personally think the only really practical option would be to start a proof wiki. Regards-[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 12:45, 18 December 2009 (UTC)

::I think [[m:New project policy|the policy for creating new wikis]] is intended for something bigger than what we (currently) have. We are currently talking about maybe several hundred proofs, and I doubt there will be sufficient enthusiasm for anyone to give monthly reports to the board, etc. So I think I will try to transfer some existing proofs here, and see what happens. --[[User:Zvika|Zvika]] ([[User talk:Zvika|talk]]) 20:11, 19 December 2009 (UTC)

:::You can't have a book that has the proofs that are missing from other books.  There is not just ONE way to do a proof so if two different books have the same theorem, they may not have all the same background and you would need two different proofs.  If fifteen books have the same theorem and have slightly different background, you might need fifteen different proofs, some of which are vastly different and some of which are only slightly different.  This is why a proof goes in the book with the theorem, because the author(s) of the book know all the background they have already gone over and they make sure the proof they put in works with all the background that has already been done.

:::And, saying that Wikipedia can't have proofs is very silly.  Formulas and theorems are not all there is to math.  Proofs are math and if you have an encyclopedia of math it makes sense to have some proofs.  That doesn't mean the proof of every single result must be in an article, but proofs that are enlightening or beautiful would only help an article.

:::So, the only thing this book could possibly be is a book of beautiful theorems.  And, such books exist outside of Wiki so it's a good idea to other people as well to have such a book.  For example, &quot;Proofs from the book&quot; is a very popular book. --[[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 20:49, 15 February 2010 (UTC)
::::Well the issue is that in Wikipedia there is sort of a consensus that &quot;regular proofs&quot; are usually not included. Aside from the fact, that this is a somewhat common custom in traditional math encyclopedias anyway, there is variety of reasons why WP went that way.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kmhkmh|contribs]]) 22:26, 17 September 2011 (UTC)

==intentions and current state==
I was wondering who is still active here after the renaming. I was personally more in line of the original project goal of having this as a (potentially large) proof repository. It is true however that wikibooks might not provide the best structure for such an undertaking.
If there's a serious interest to turn the original into a separate wiki, I would support such an effort.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kmhkmh|contribs]]) 22:32, 17 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=OneToOne=
[[Image:ObjectRelational-OneToOne.jpg]]

A &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship in Java is where the source object has an attribute that references another target object and (if) that target object had the inverse relationship back to the source object it would also be a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  All relationships in Java and JPA are unidirectional, in that if a source object references a target object there is no guarantee that the target object also has a relationship to the source object.  This is different than a relational database, in which relationships are defined through foreign keys and querying such that the inverse query always exists.

JPA also defines a &lt;code&gt;[[Java Persistence/ManyToOne|ManyToOne]]&lt;/code&gt; relationship, which is similar to a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship except that the inverse relationship (if it were defined) is a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  The main difference between a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship in JPA is that a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; always contains a foreign key from the source object's table to the target object's table, where as a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship the foreign key may either be in the source object's table or the target object's table.  If the foreign key is in the target object's table JPA requires that the relationship be bi-directional (must be defined in both objects), and the source object must use the &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the mapping.

In JPA a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/OneToOne.html @OneToOne]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or the &lt;code&gt;&lt;one-to-one&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  A &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship typically requires a &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/JoinColumn.html @JoinColumn]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/JoinColumns.html @JoinColumns]&lt;/code&gt; if a composite primary key.

==Inverse Relationships, Target Foreign Keys and Mapped By==
A typical object centric perspective of a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship has the data model mirror the object model, in that the &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; object has a pointer to the &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; object, so the database &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; table has a foreign key to the &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; table.  This is not how things always work out in the database though, in fact many database developers would think having the foreign key in the &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; table to be logical, as this enforces the uniqueness of the &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  Personally I prefer the object perspective, however you will most likely encounter both.

To start with consider a bi-directional &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship, you do not require two foreign keys, one in each table, so a single foreign key in the &lt;i&gt;owning&lt;/i&gt; side of the relationship is sufficient.  In JPA the &lt;i&gt;inverse&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; use the &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; attribute ([[#Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys|with some exceptions]]), this makes the JPA provider use the foreign key and mapping information in the &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; mapping to define the &lt;i&gt;target&lt;/i&gt; mapping.

See also, [[#Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys|Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys]].

The following gives an example of what the inverse &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; relationship would look like.

===Example of an inverse OneToOne relationship annotations===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
public class Address {
  @Id
  private long id;
  ...
  @OneToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy=&quot;address&quot;)
  private Employee owner;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example of an inverse OneToOne relationship XML===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Address&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Address&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;one-to-one name=&quot;owner&quot; fetch=&quot;LAZY&quot; mapped-by=&quot;address&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Common Problems==

=====&lt;i&gt;Foreign key is also part of the primary key.&lt;/i&gt;=====
: See [[Java Persistence/Identity_and_Sequencing#Primary_Keys_through_OneToOne_and_ManyToOne_Relationships|Primary Keys through OneToOne Relationships]].

=====&lt;i&gt;Foreign key is also mapped as a basic.&lt;/i&gt;=====
:If you use the same field in two different mappings, you typically require to make one of them read-only using &lt;code&gt;insertable, updatable = false&lt;/code&gt;.
: See [[#Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys|Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys]].

=====&lt;i&gt;Constraint error on insert.&lt;/i&gt;=====
:This typically occurs because you have incorrectly mapped the foreign key in a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship.
:: See [[#Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys|Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys]].

:It can also occur if your JPA provider does not support referential integrity, or does not resolve bi-directional constraints.  In this case you may either need to remove the constraint, or use &lt;code&gt;EntityManager&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the order your objects are written in.

=====&lt;i&gt;Foreign key value is null&lt;/i&gt;=====
:Ensure you set the value of the object's &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt;, if the &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; is part of a bi-directional &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship, ensure you set &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; in both objects, JPA does not maintain bi-directional relationships for you.
:Also check that you defined the &lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; correctly, ensure you did not set &lt;code&gt;insertable, updatable = false&lt;/code&gt; or use a &lt;code&gt;PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt;.

=Advanced=

==Target Foreign Keys, Primary Key Join Columns, Cascade Primary Keys==
If a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship uses a &lt;i&gt;target foreign key&lt;/i&gt; (the foreign key is in the target table, not the source table), then JPA requires that you define a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping in both directions, and that the &lt;i&gt;target foreign key&lt;/i&gt; mapping use the &lt;code&gt;mappedBy&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  The reason for this, is the mapping in the source object only affects the row the JPA writes to the source table, if the foreign key is in the target table, JPA has no easy way to write this field.

There are other ways around this problem however.  In JPA the &lt;code&gt;JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; defines an &lt;code&gt;insertable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatable&lt;/code&gt; attribute, these can be used to instruct the JPA provider that the foreign key is actually in the target object's table.  With these enabled JPA will not write anything to the source table, most JPA providers will also infer that the foreign key constraint is in the target table to preserve referential integrity on insertion.  JPA also defines the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/PrimaryKeyJoinColumn.html @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn]&lt;/code&gt; that can be used to define the same thing.  You still must map the foreign key in the target object in some fashion though, but could just use a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; mapping to do this.

Some JPA providers may support an option for a unidirectional &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; mapping for target foreign keys.

Target foreign keys can be tricky to understand, so you might want to read this section twice.  They can get even more complex though.  If you have a data model that cascades primary keys then you can end up with a single &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; that has both a logical foreign key, but has some fields in it that are logically target foreign keys.

For example consider &lt;code&gt;Company&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Department&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Company&lt;/code&gt;'s id is &lt;code&gt;COM_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Department&lt;/code&gt;'s id is a composite primary key of &lt;code&gt;COM_ID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DEPT_ID&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt;'s id is a composite primary key of &lt;code&gt;COM_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEP_ID&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt;.  So for an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; its relationship to &lt;code&gt;company&lt;/code&gt; uses a normal &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; with a foreign key, but its relationship to &lt;code&gt;department&lt;/code&gt; uses a &lt;code&gt;ManyToOne&lt;/code&gt; with a foreign key, but the &lt;code&gt;COM_ID&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;insertable, updatable = false&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;, because it is actually mapped through the &lt;code&gt;company&lt;/code&gt; relationship.  The &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt;'s relationship to its &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; then uses a normal foreign key for &lt;code&gt;ADD_ID&lt;/code&gt; but a target foreign key for &lt;code&gt;COM_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEP_ID&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt;.

This may work in some JPA providers, others may require different configuration, or not support this type of data model.

==Mapping a OneToOne Using a Join Table==
In some data models, you may have a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship defined through a &lt;i&gt;join table&lt;/i&gt;.  For example consider you had existing &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt; tables with no foreign key, and wanted to define a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; relationship without changing the existing tables.  To do this you could define an intermediate table that contained the primary key of both objects.  This is similar to a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship, but if you add a unique constraint to each foreign key you can enforce that it is &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt; (or even &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt;).

JPA defines a join table using the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/JoinTable.html @JoinTable]&lt;/code&gt; annotation and &lt;code&gt;&lt;join-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  A &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; can be used on a &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; mappings, but the JPA 1.0 specification is vague whether it can be used on a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;JoinTable&lt;/code&gt; documentation does not state that it can be used in a &lt;code&gt;OneToOne&lt;/code&gt;, but the XML schema for &lt;code&gt;&lt;one-to-one&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does allow a nested &lt;code&gt;&lt;join-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  Some JPA providers may support this, and others may not.

If your JPA provider does not support this, you can workaround the issue by instead defining a &lt;code&gt;OneToMany&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ManyToMany&lt;/code&gt; relationship and just define a get/set method that returns/sets the first element on the collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Comparison to HTML ==
&gt; &quot;The process is similar to working with raw HTML with the added step that each time you want to see how your changes look, you have to re-compile the source. While this may seem like a major inconvenience, the benefit is that once the customized title format has been written, it serves as a template for all other documents that would use the title format you have just made. In other words, once you have a layout you like, you can use it for any other documents where you would like the same layout without any additional fiddling with layout.&quot;

Well, this looks like some comparison to raw HTML. You lose the convenience of not needing to compile, but you get the convenience to reuse your template.

Sadly there is something called CSS, which we all know. We gain nothing here. Just admit it. The problem, I guess, is we shouldn't compare LaTeX to HTML at all, since they are completely different things. --[[Special:Contributions/166.111.68.163|166.111.68.163]] ([[User talk:166.111.68.163|discuss]]) 16:00, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

== English needs improvement ==

The English on this page needs help to become intelligible. Currently it sounds fairly foreign and I suspect the original writer was not a native speaker. The ideas are good, though, and I don't mean to disparage the work done already--I wouldn't want others to see very much of my Spanish!

I may or may not have time to edit this page further, but it needs more clarity. Once the usage is standard, it still may need some work in normalizing terms--I see inconsistencies in my current corrections since sometimes I use 'layout' and sometimes 'format'. This comes partly from my feeble knowledge of typesetting. For now I just want the page to be legible for native speakers of English.
--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 15:47, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

I agree with both points - I will try to re-write parts of the page in more normalized English in the next days. Overall, excellent job, very helpful. --[[User:Spirosdenaxas|Spirosdenaxas]] ([[User talk:Spirosdenaxas|talk]]) 09:31, 3 December 2009 (UTC)

I am trying to learn TeX having installed ProTeXt (Windows XP distribution), and everything goes fine as long as I don't use the graphicx package. If anyone can help me troubleshoot, I would be most grateful.

:in my past experiences I found it much simpler and faster to create titles this way instead of using packages and studying hours just to make a minor change to the title.

:: I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Title_Creation&amp;oldid=1560611 added] the standard way, and I'm putting it first just because it is easier and less intimidating.

== Warning ==

When I was trying to produce my own custom title page, I got this warning:

&quot;pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier (name{page.1}) has 
been already used, duplicate ignored&quot;

This is because the title page has no number on it and the next page has number 1. I wonder if the same problems happens in the example given here. Anyway, there is a simple workaround for this. See here: http://tug.org/mail-archives/texhax/2005-June/004157.html

== Order of chapters ==

This chapter comes way before the chapter of including firures.
