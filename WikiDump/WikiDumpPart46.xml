'''Barley''' is a grain used as a staple food, as well as animal feed. It is often used in [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]] and [[Cookbook:Stews|stews]] as a ''whole grain'' (actually, with the hull removed but the bran remaining) or as ''pearl barley'' (with the bran removed also). It is [[Cookbook:Malt|malted]] and crushed for making [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] and other malt products. It is ground to [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] for making bread, both raw and malted.

Barley is not [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten free]]. Whilst it does not have the same form of gluten much  loved by bread bakers, it has a protein called [[w:Hordein|hordein]] which is equally harmful to people sensitive to gluten, including those with [[w:Coeliac disease|coeliac disease]].

  {{#if:{{{noincludecat|}}}||[[Category:Cereals|{{{1|{{PAGENAME}}}}}]]}}
}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

== Usage ==

&lt;code&gt;{{(}}{{(}}{{PAGENAME}}{{)}}{{)}}&lt;/code&gt;

This template also takes an optional sort key for the category:

&lt;code&gt;{{(}}{{(}}{{PAGENAME}}|''Sort key''{{)}}{{)}}&lt;/code&gt;

== Effect ==

* This template uses the {{tl|ingredient}} template to specify that the article is about an ingredient
* It adds &quot; | [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|Cereal Grain]]&quot; to the navigation field
* Unless the parameter ''noincludecat'' is specified, the article is added to [[:Category:Cereals]]
*: For example, &lt;code&gt;{{(}}{{(}}{{PAGENAME}}|noincludecat=no{{)}}{{)}}&lt;/code&gt; will not add the article to any categories

'''Oats''' are cereal grains. Oats are unsuitable to make bread by themselves, but are often added to baked goods as oat [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or rolled oats (crushed flat between hot rollers). 

Consumption of oat bran has been linked to a reduction in LDL cholesterol, and possibly a reduced risk of heart disease.

In theory, oats may be safe to eat in a [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] diet. However, in practice, oats are often cross-contaminated with wheat or barley either growing in the field alongside oats or in the transportation and processing systems that are used in common. Additionally, studies have shown that some people with coeliac disease are also sensitive to oats, even when any risk of cross-contamination has been eliminated.

A '''stew''' is a common dish made of [[cookbook:vegetable|vegetable]]s and [[cookbook:meat|meat]] cooked in some kind of [[cookbook:broth|broth]], [[cookbook:stock|stock]], or [[cookbook:sauce|sauce]].

The line between stew and [[Cookbook:soup|soup]] is often a thin one, but in general a stew's ingredients are cut in larger pieces, it is thicker, more likely to be eaten as the main course than as a starter dish and often contains cuts of meat that need longer cooking to become tender.
Stewing has a long tradition in cookery. Popular recipes for regional stews, such as [[cookbook:gumbo|gumbo]], [[cookbook:bouillabaise|bouillabaise]], [[cookbook:Brunswick Stew|Brunswick stew]], and [[cookbook:burgoo|burgoo]] became common during the 19th century and have increased in popularity during the 20th century.

For a complete list of our stew recipes, please see the [[:Category:Stew recipes|category for stew recipes]].

Hey there...

I'm a tall Australian living in Indonesia.  I've contributed some articles to the Indonesian language wikibook and look forward to doing a few more soon.  My main strength is Jakarta slang and general colloquial Indonesian, but I can write lessons in other topics if anyone has any specific requests.

My other main area of interest is music (esp. guitar and other fretted instruments) but I haven't contributed yet.

See you 'round,

John</text>

'''Beetles''' are the most diverse group of insects. Their order, '''Coleoptera''' (meaning &quot;sheathed wing&quot;), has more described species in it than in any other order in the animal kingdom. Forty percent of all described insect species are beetles (about 350,000 species), and new species are regularly discovered. Estimates put the total number of species, described and undescribed, at between 5 and 8 million. For this reason, the Scottish geneticist [[w:J. B. S. Haldane|J. B. S. Haldane]], when asked what his studies of nature revealed about God, replied, &quot;An inordinate fondness for beetles.&quot; 

Beetles can be found in almost all habitats, but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions. They impact the ecosystem in several ways. On the one hand, they feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. On the other hand, they are prey of various animals including birds and mammals. Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the red flour beetle ''[[../Tribolium castaneum/]]'', the Colorado potato beetle ''[[../Leptinotarsa decemlineata/]]'', or the mungbean beetle ''[[../Callosobruchus maculatus/]]'', while others are important controls of agricultural pests. For example, [[../Lady Beetles/]] (family Coccinellidae) consume [[../Aphids/]], [[../Scale Insects/]], [[../Thrips/]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.

==Description==

The general anatomy of beetles is quite uniform, though specific organs and appendages may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Beetle bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs arise. The abdomen, then, is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle &quot;section&quot; is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. Like all insects, beetles are [segmented organisms, and all three of the major sections of the body are themselves composed of several further segments, although these are not always readily discernible. This further segmentation can usually best be seen on the abdomen.

Beetles are generally characterised by a particularly hard exoskeleton, hard forewings (elytra), and chewing mouth parts. The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design creates the armoured defences of the beetle while maintaining flexibility. The elytra are not used for flight, but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of wings (alae). The elytra must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and, after landing, are folded, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra.

In some beetles the ability to fly has been lost, most notably in the [[../Ground Beetle/]]s (family Carabidae) and the &quot;true [[../Weevils]]&quot; (family [[../Curculionidae/]]), but also in some desert and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many of these species have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, with the best known example being the glowworms of the family Phengodidae, in which the females are larviform throughout their lives.

Beetles have mouthparts similar to those of grasshoppers. Of these parts, the most commonly known are probably the mandibles, which appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see [[#Defence|Defence]], below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. These are the maxillary and labial palpi.

The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, as in the case of whirligig beetles (family Gyrinidae), in which the eyes are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Other species also have divided eyes — some longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) and weevils — while many beetles have eyes that are notched to some degree. A few beetle genera also possess ocelli, which are small, simple eyes usually situated farther back on the head (on the vertex).

Beetle antennae are primarily organs of smell, but may also be used to feel out a beetle's environment physically. They may also be used in some families during mating, or among a few beetles for defence. Antennae vary greatly in form within the Coleoptera, but are often similar within any given family. In some cases, males and females of the same species will have different antennal forms. Antennae may be [[Wiktionary:clavate|clavate]] ([[Wiktionary:flabellate|flabellate]] and [[Wiktionary:lamellate|lamellate]] are sub-forms of clavate, or clubbed antennae), [[Wiktionary:filiform|filiform]], [[Wiktionary:geniculate|geniculate]], [[Wiktionary:moniliform|moniliform]], [[Wiktionary:pectinate|pectinate]], or [[Wiktionary:serrate|serrate]]. For images of these antennal forms, see [[antenna (biology)]].

The legs, which are multi-segmented, end in two to five small segments called tarsi, which are vaguely comparable to feet. Like many other insect orders beetles bear claws, usually one pair, on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs may be variously modified and adapted for other uses. Among aquatic families — predacious diving beetles (Dytiscidae), crawling water beetles (Haliplidae), many water scavenger beetles (Hydrophilidae), and others — the legs, most notably the hind pair, are modified for swimming and often bear rows of long hairs to aid this purpose. Other beetles have fossorial legs that are widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (family Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as [[../Flea Beetle/]]s (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), are enlarged and designed for jumping.

Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibres. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system.

Beetles have hemolymph instead of blood, and the open circulatory system of the beetle is powered by a tube-like heart attached to the top inside of the thorax.

==Life Cycle==
[[Image:Engerling1.jpg|thumb|250px|Scarabaeiform larva of the cockchafer, ''Melolontha melolontha'']]

Beetles undergo complete metamorphosis, meaning that the larval form does not resemble the adult.

A single female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime. Eggs are usually laid according to the substrate the larva will feed on upon hatching. Among others, they can be laid loose in the substrate (e.g. flour beetle), laid in clumps on leaves (e.g. Colorado potato beetle), or individually attached (e.g. mungbean beetle and other seed borers) or buried in the soil (e.g. carrot weevil).

The larva is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle lifecycle. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most metallic wood-boring beetles (family Buprestidae) and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, lady beetles, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species but can be as long as several years.

Beetle larvae can be differentiated from other insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened head, the presence of chewing mouthparts, and spiracles along the sides of the body. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles whose larvae are somewhat flattened and are highly mobile are the ground beetles, some rove beetles, and others; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the families of the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, but more commonly known as grubs.

All beetle larvae go through several instars, which are the developmental stages between each moult. In many species the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile in order to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; examples include the blister beetles (family Meloidae) and some rove beetles, particularly those of the genus ''Aleochara''.

As with all endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from this pupa emerges a fully formed, sexually mature adult beetle, or imago. Adults have an extremely variable lifespan, from weeks to years, depending on the species.

===Reproduction===
Beetles may display extremely intricate behaviour when mating. Smell is thought to be important in the location of a mate.

Conflict can play a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (genus ''Nicrophorus'') where conflicts between males and females rage until only one of each is left, thus ensuring reproduction by the strongest and fittest. Many beetles are territorial and will fiercely defend their small patch of territory from intruding males.

Pairing is generally short but in some cases will last for several hours. During pairing sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the eggs.

[[Image:striped.love.beetle.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Striped love beetle ''Eudicella gralli'' from the forests of Central Africa. The iridescent elytra are used in marriage ceremonies.]]

Parental care varies between species, ranging from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf to certain scarab beetles, which construct impressive underground structures complete with a supply of dung to house and feed their young. Other beetles are leaf rollers, biting sections of leaves to cause them to curl inwards, then laying their eggs, thus protected, inside.

===Defense===
Beetles and their larvae have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity, and active defence.

Camouflage involves the use of colouration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. Among those that exhibit this defensive strategy are some of the leaf beetles (family Chysomelidae), having green colouring very similar to their habitat on plant leaves. More complex camouflage also occurs, as with some weevils, where various coloured scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung.

Another defence that often uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to wasps, which fools predators into keeping their distance even though the beetles are in fact harmless. This defence can be found to a lesser extent in other beetle families, such as the scarab beetles. Beetles may combine their colour mimicry with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble.

Many beetle species, including [[../Lady Beetle/]]s and [[../Blister Beetle/]]s, can secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or even poisonous. These same species often exhibit aposematism, where bright or contrasting colour patterns warn away potential predators.

Large ground beetles and longhorn beetles may go on the attack, using their strong mandibles to forcibly persuade a predator to seek out easier prey. Others, such as bombardier beetles (within Carabidae) spray acidic gas from their abdomen to repel predators.

==Anatomy==
===Feeding===
Besides being abundant and varied, the Coleoptera are able to exploit the wide diversity of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are generalists, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialised in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and [[../Rove Beetles/]] (family Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and will catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.

Decaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is consumed by coprophagous species such as certain scarab beetles (family Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species such as the carrion beetles (family Silphidae). Some of the beetles found within dung and carrion are in fact predatory, such as the clown beetles, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects.

===Adaptations to the environment===
Aquatic beetles use several techniques for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Predaceous diving beetles hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Water scavenger beetles have hairs on their under surface that retain a layer of air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention (Roughley 2001) while whirligig beetles simply carry a bubble down with them whenever they dive.

==Impact on humans==
===Pests===
[[Image:Bonenkever Acanthoscelides obtectus.jpg|thumb|250px|Damage to beans by larvae of the common bean weevil, ''Acanthoscelides obtectus'']]

Many agricultural, forestry, and household insect pests are members of this order. Some of these are: 

* The Colorado potato beetle, ''[[../Leptinotarsa decemlineata/]]'', is a notorious pest of potato plants. Crops are destroyed and the beetle can only be treated by employing expensive pesticides, many of which it has begun to develop immunity to. As well as potatoes, suitable hosts can be a number of plants from the potato family (Solanaceae), such as nightshade, tomato, aubergine and capsicum.
* The [[bark beetle]]s ''Hylurgopinus rufipes'' and ''Scolytus multistriatus'', the elm leaf beetle, ''Pyrrhalta luteola'', and other beetles attack elm trees. The bark beetles are important elm pests because they carry Dutch elm disease as they move from infected breeding sites to feed on healthy elm trees. The spread of the fungus by the beetle has led to the devastation of elm trees in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, notably in Europe and North America.
* The death watch beetle, ''Xestobium rufovillosum'', (family Anobiidae) is of considerable importance as a pest of older wooden buildings in Britain. It attacks [[hardwood]]s such as oak and chestnut, always where some fungal decay has taken or is taking place. It is thought that the actual introduction of the pest into buildings takes place at the time of construction.

===Beneficial organisms===
* Both the larvae and adults of some [[../Coccinellidae|lady beetles]] (family Coccinellidae) are found in aphid colonies. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce they may feed on other things, such as small caterpillars, young plant bugs, aphid honeydew, and plant nectar.
* Ground beetles (family Carabidae) are common predators of many different insects and other arthropods, including fly eggs, caterpillars, wireworms, many and others.
* Plant-feeding beetles are often important beneficial insects, controlling problem weeds. Some flea beetles of the genus ''Aphthona'' feed on leafy spurge, a considerable weed of rangeland in western North America.

Some farmers develop [[w:beetle bank]]s to foster and provide cover for beneficial beetles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===How to translate a subtitle file and return it to the project====

It is likely that the video translation will have a project page where you can download the video and the original language subtitle file and cont 

The process is... 

1) Download and look at the  video file and the original language subtitle file to check you can translate it. 

2) Email the translations project co-ordinator to check that someone isn't already translating it

2) Open it, translate it and save it (see below for instructions)

3) Email the subtitle file to the translation project co-ordinator

====Opening Editing and Saving Subtitle  Files from a Text Editor====

Video creators and distributors are starting to create subtitle files for their videos. These are transcripts with timecodes included. They are very useful as they can be played on a computer linked with the appropriate video file, so that the subtitles are displayed. They can also be used to create subtitles for DVDs. These are very useful because the subtitles can be selected or not when opening the video file, and do not need to be 'burnt on' to the image as with traditional subtitling practice.

What video makers and distributors increasingly need are subtitle files (most frequently *.srt files) in as many languages as possible.

There are two main ways for translators to help the process of creating multiple versions of subtitle files in different languages.

a) Translator downloads the *.srt file and open it up in a text editor. Each subtitle will look like the section below.

 9
 00:00:48,105 --&gt; 00:00:51,573
 But on the other hand, if you say
 that there will be a screening

 10
 00:00:51,574 --&gt; 00:00:56,656
 it's a whole different thing and a lot
 more people come.

---///---

If there are mistakes and the files are saved in the wrong format, it's not a disaster. A subtitle project coordinator then take the word/text documents that are created by translators and convert them to *.srt files

There is a manual page for opening and saving a file called [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_a_subtitle_file_with_a_text_editor opening and editing subtitle files in a text editor]

b) Translators use the appropriate subtitle programs - subtitle workshop (pc), miyu (mac), gnome
subtitler (linux) - and open and save .srt files with these tools.

(The more translators get used to working with subtitle tools and files the better. As with subtitle tools, translators can also create subtitle files, and edit existing ones adjusting their line lengths if needed.)

There are manual pages for opening and saving subtitle files in the following programmes.

subtitle workshop(pc) - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Making_subtitles_in_subtitle_workshop - needs to be modified for just editing
miyu (mac) - to do
gnome subtitler (linux) - to do

'''Rye''' is a grain used as a staple food, as well as animal feed. Rye [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] is often used in [[Cookbook:Sourdough Bread|sourdough bread]], and in fact the gluten in rye requires the acids of a sourdough [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]] to develop the gumminess needed to help rye bread rise properly. A prominent sourdough rye bread is called [[Cookbook:Pumpernickel|pumpernickel]].

Rye is not [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten free]]. Whilst it does not have the same form of gluten much  loved by bread bakers, it has a protein called secalin which is also harmful to people sensitive to gluten, including those with coeliac disease.

A guide to the best practice for creating a new Haskell project or
program.

== Recommended tools ==

Almost all new Haskell projects use the following tools.  Each is
intrinsically useful, but using a set of common tools also benefits
everyone by increasing productivity, and you're more likely to get
patches.

=== Revision control ===

Use [http://darcs.net darcs], unless you have a specific reason not to,
in which case use [http://git-scm.com git]. If you don't like git, go back and look at darcs.
It's written in Haskell, and it's used by many Haskell developers.
See the wikibook [[Understanding darcs]] to get started.

=== Build system ===

Use [http://haskell.org/cabal Cabal].
You should read at least the start of section 2 of the [http://haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/index.html Cabal User's Guide].

=== Documentation ===

For libraries, use [http://haskell.org/haddock Haddock]. We recommend using recent versions of haddock (2.8 or above, as of December 2010).

=== Testing ===

Pure code can be tested using [http://www.md.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/ QuickCheck] or [http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell@haskell.org/msg19215.html SmallCheck], impure code with [http://hunit.sourceforge.net/ HUnit].  

To get started, try [[Haskell/Testing]].  For a slightly more advanced introduction, [http://blog.codersbase.com/2006/09/simple-unit-testing-in-haskell.html Simple Unit Testing in Haskell] is a blog article about creating a testing framework for QuickCheck using some Template Haskell.

== Structure of a simple project ==

The basic structure of a new Haskell project can be adopted from [http://semantic.org/hnop/ HNop], the minimal Haskell project. It consists of the following files, for the mythical project &quot;haq&quot;.

* Haq.hs    -- the main haskell source file
* haq.cabal -- the cabal build description
* Setup.hs  -- build script itself
* _darcs or .git -- revision control
* README    -- info
* LICENSE   -- license

You can of course elaborate on this, with subdirectories and multiple
modules.

Here is a transcript on how you'd create a minimal darcs-using and cabalised Haskell project, for the cool new Haskell program &quot;haq&quot;, build it, install it and release.

The new tool 'mkcabal' automates all this for you, but it's important that you understand all the parts first. 

We will now walk through the creation of the infrastructure for a simple Haskell executable. Advice for libraries follows after.

=== Create a directory ===

Create somewhere for the source:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkdir haq
$ cd haq
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Write some Haskell source ===

Write your program:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat &gt; Haq.hs
--
-- Copyright (c) 2006 Don Stewart - http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons
-- GPL version 2 or later (see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
--
import System.Environment

-- 'main' runs the main program
main :: IO ()
main = getArgs &gt;&gt;= print . haqify . head

haqify s = &quot;Haq! &quot; ++ s
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Stick it in darcs ===

Place the source under revision control:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ darcs init
$ darcs add Haq.hs 
$ darcs record
addfile ./Haq.hs
Shall I record this change? (1/?)  [ynWsfqadjkc], or ? for help: y
hunk ./Haq.hs 1
+--
+-- Copyright (c) 2006 Don Stewart - http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons
+-- GPL version 2 or later (see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
+--
+import System.Environment
+
+-- | 'main' runs the main program
+main :: IO ()
+main = getArgs &gt;&gt;= print . haqify . head
+
+haqify s = &quot;Haq! &quot; ++ s
Shall I record this change? (2/?)  [ynWsfqadjkc], or ? for help: y
What is the patch name? Import haq source
Do you want to add a long comment? [yn]n
Finished recording patch 'Import haq source'
&lt;/pre&gt;

And we can see that darcs is now running the show:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ls
Haq.hs _darcs
&lt;/pre&gt;

For git:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ git config --global user.name &quot;John Doe&quot;
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
$ git init
$ git add *
$ git commit -m 'Import haq source'
$ ls -A
.git Haq.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;


=== Add a build system ===

Create a .cabal file describing how to build your project:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat &gt; haq.cabal
Name:                haq
Version:             0.0
Synopsis:            Super cool mega lambdas
Description:         My super cool, indeed, even mega lambdas 
                     will demonstrate a basic project. You will marvel.
License:             GPL
License-file:        LICENSE
Author:              Don Stewart
Maintainer:          Don Stewart &lt;dons@cse.unsw.edu.au&gt;
Build-Depends:       base

Executable:          haq
Main-is:             Haq.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;

(If your package uses other packages, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;array&lt;/tt&gt;, you'll need to add them to the &lt;tt&gt;Build-Depends:&lt;/tt&gt; field.)
Add a &lt;tt&gt;Setup.lhs&lt;/tt&gt; that will actually do the building:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat &gt; Setup.lhs
#! /usr/bin/env runhaskell

&gt; import Distribution.Simple
&gt; main = defaultMain
&lt;/pre&gt;
Cabal allows either &lt;tt&gt;Setup.hs&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Setup.lhs&lt;/tt&gt;; as long as the format is appropriate, it doesn't matter which one you choose. But it's a good idea to always include the &lt;code&gt;#! /usr/bin/env runhaskell&lt;/code&gt; line; because it follows the [[w:Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] convention, you could execute the Setup.hs directly in a Unix shell instead of always manually calling &lt;tt&gt;runhaskell&lt;/tt&gt; (assuming the Setup file is marked executable, of course).

Record your changes:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ darcs add haq.cabal Setup.lhs
$ darcs record --all
What is the patch name? Add a build system
Do you want to add a long comment? [yn]n
Finished recording patch 'Add a build system'
&lt;/pre&gt;

Git:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ git add haq.cabal Setup.lhs
$ git commit -m 'Add a build system'
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Build your project ===

Now build it!

&lt;pre&gt;
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs install
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Run it ===

And now you can run your cool project:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ haq me
&quot;Haq! me&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also run it in-place, avoiding the install phase:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ dist/build/haq/haq you
&quot;Haq! you&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Build some haddock documentation ===

Generate some API documentation into dist/doc/*

&lt;pre&gt;
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock
&lt;/pre&gt;

which generates files in dist/doc/ including:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ w3m -dump dist/doc/html/haq/Main.html
 haq Contents Index
 Main

 Synopsis
 main :: IO ()

 Documentation

 main :: IO ()
 main runs the main program

 Produced by Haddock version 0.7
&lt;/pre&gt;

No output?  Make sure you have actually installed haddock.  It is a separate program, not something that comes with the Haskell compiler, like Cabal.

=== Add some automated testing: QuickCheck ===

We'll use QuickCheck to specify a simple property of our Haq.hs code. Create a tests module, Tests.hs, with some QuickCheck boilerplate:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat &gt; Tests.hs
import Char
import List
import Test.QuickCheck
import Text.Printf

main  = mapM_ (\(s,a) -&gt; printf &quot;%-25s: &quot; s &gt;&gt; a) tests

instance Arbitrary Char where
    arbitrary     = choose ('\0', '\128')
    coarbitrary c = variant (ord c `rem` 4)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's write a simple property:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat &gt;&gt; Tests.hs 
-- reversing twice a finite list, is the same as identity
prop_reversereverse s = (reverse . reverse) s == id s
    where _ = s :: [Int]

-- and add this to the tests list
tests  = [(&quot;reverse.reverse/id&quot;, test prop_reversereverse)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can now run this test, and have QuickCheck generate the test data:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ runhaskell Tests.hs
reverse.reverse/id       : OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's add a test for the 'haqify' function:

&lt;pre&gt;
-- Dropping the &quot;Haq! &quot; string is the same as identity
prop_haq s = drop (length &quot;Haq! &quot;) (haqify s) == id s
    where haqify s = &quot;Haq! &quot; ++ s

tests  = [(&quot;reverse.reverse/id&quot;, test prop_reversereverse)
        ,(&quot;drop.haq/id&quot;,        test prop_haq)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

and let's test that:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ runhaskell Tests.hs
reverse.reverse/id       : OK, passed 100 tests.
drop.haq/id              : OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Great!

=== Running the test suite from darcs ===

We can arrange for darcs to run the test suite on every commit:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ darcs setpref test &quot;runhaskell Tests.hs&quot;
Changing value of test from '' to 'runhaskell Tests.hs'
&lt;/pre&gt;

will run the full set of QuickChecks. (If your test requires it you may need to ensure other things are built too e.g.: &lt;tt&gt;darcs setpref test &quot;alex Tokens.x;happy Grammar.y;runhaskell Tests.hs&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;).

Let's commit a new patch:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ darcs add Tests.hs
$ darcs record --all
What is the patch name? Add testsuite
Do you want to add a long comment? [yn]n
Running test...
reverse.reverse/id       : OK, passed 100 tests.
drop.haq/id              : OK, passed 100 tests.
Test ran successfully.
Looks like a good patch.
Finished recording patch 'Add testsuite'
&lt;/pre&gt;

Excellent, now patches must pass the test suite before they can be
committed.

=== Tag the stable version, create a tarball, and sell it! ===

Tag the stable version:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ darcs tag
What is the version name? 0.0
Finished tagging patch 'TAG 0.0'
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Advanced Darcs functionality: lazy get ====

As your repositories accumulate patches, new users can become annoyed at how long it takes to accomplish the initial &lt;tt&gt;darcs get&lt;/tt&gt;. (Some projects, like [[w:Yi (editor)|yi]] or GHC, can have thousands of patches.) Darcs is quick enough, but downloading thousands of individual patches can still take a while. Isn't there some way to make things more efficient?

Darcs provides the &lt;tt&gt;--lazy&lt;/tt&gt; option to &lt;tt&gt;darcs get&lt;/tt&gt;. This enables to download only the latest version of the repository. Patches are later downloaded on demand if needed.


==== Distribution ====
When distributing your Haskell program, you have roughly three options:
# distributing via a Darcs repository
# distributing a tarball
## a Darcs tarball
## a Cabal tarball

With a Darcs repository, if it is public, than you are done. However: perhaps you don't have a server with Darcs, or perhaps your computer isn't set up for people to &lt;tt&gt;darcs pull&lt;/tt&gt; from it. In which case you'll need to distribute the source via tarball.

===== Tarballs via darcs =====

Darcs provides a command where it will make a compressed tarball, and it will place a copy of all the files it manages into it. (Note that nothing in _darcs will be included - it'll just be your source files, no revision history.)

&lt;pre&gt;
$ darcs dist -d haq-0.0
Created dist as haq-0.0.tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;

And you're all set up! 

===== Tarballs via Cabal =====

Since our code is cabalised, we can create a tarball with Cabal
directly:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs sdist
Building source dist for haq-0.0...
Source tarball created: dist/haq-0.0.tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;

This has advantages and disadvantages compared to a Darcs-produced tarball. The primary ''advantage'' is that Cabal will do more checking of our repository, and more importantly, it'll ensure that the tarball has the structure needed by HackageDB and cabal-install.

However, it does have a disadvantage: it packages up only the files needed to build the project. It will deliberately fail to include other files in the repository, even if they turn out to be necessary at some point&lt;ref&gt;This is actually a good thing, since it allows us to do things like create an elaborate test suite which doesn't get included in the tarball, so users aren't bothered by it. It also can reveal hidden assumptions and omissions in our code - perhaps your code was only building and running because of a file accidentally generated.&lt;/ref&gt;. To include other files (such as &lt;tt&gt;Test.hs&lt;/tt&gt; in the above example), we need to add lines to the cabal file like:

&lt;pre&gt;
extra-source-files: Tests.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we had them, we could make sure files like AUTHORS or the README get included as well:

&lt;pre&gt;
data-files: AUTHORS, README
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Summary ===

The following files were created:

    $ ls
    Haq.hs           Tests.hs         dist             haq.cabal
    Setup.lhs        _darcs           haq-0.0.tar.gz

== Libraries ==

The process for creating a Haskell library is almost identical. The differences
are as follows, for the hypothetical &quot;ltree&quot; library:

=== Hierarchical source ===

The source should live under a directory path that fits into the
existing [http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/lib-hierarchy.html module layout guide].
So we would create the following directory structure, for the module
Data.LTree:

    $ mkdir Data
    $ cat &gt; Data/LTree.hs 
    module Data.LTree where

So our Data.LTree module lives in Data/LTree.hs

=== The Cabal file ===

Cabal files for libraries list the publically visible modules, and have
no executable section:

    $ cat ltree.cabal 
    Name:                ltree
    Version:             0.1
    Description:         Lambda tree implementation
    License:             BSD3
    License-file:        LICENSE
    Author:              Don Stewart
    Maintainer:          dons@cse.unsw.edu.au
    Build-Depends:       base
    Exposed-modules:     Data.LTree

We can thus build our library:

    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build    
    Preprocessing library ltree-0.1...
    Building ltree-0.1...
    [1 of 1] Compiling Data.LTree       ( Data/LTree.hs, dist/build/Data/LTree.o )
    /usr/bin/ar: creating dist/build/libHSltree-0.1.a

and our library has been created as a object archive. On *nix systems, you should 
probably add the --user flag to the configure step (this means you want to update
your local package database during installation). Now install it:

    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install
    Installing: /home/dons/lib/ltree-0.1/ghc-6.6 &amp; /home/dons/bin ltree-0.1...
    Registering ltree-0.1...
    Reading package info from &quot;.installed-pkg-config&quot; ... done.
    Saving old package config file... done.
    Writing new package config file... done.

And we're done! You can use your new library from, for example, ghci:

    $ ghci -package ltree
    Prelude&gt; :m + Data.LTree
    Prelude Data.LTree&gt; 

The new library is in scope, and ready to go.

=== More complex build systems ===

For larger projects it is useful to have source trees stored in
subdirectories. This can be done simply by creating a directory, for
example, &quot;src&quot;, into which you will put your src tree.

To have Cabal find this code, you add the following line to your Cabal
file:

    hs-source-dirs: src

Cabal can set up to also run configure scripts, along with a range of
other features. For more information consult the
[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/Cabal/index.html Cabal documentation].

==== Internal modules ====

If your library uses internal modules that are not exposed, do not forget to list them in the ''other-modules'' field:

    other-modules: My.Own.Module

Failing to do so (as of GHC 6.8.3) may lead to your library deceptively building without errors but actually being unusable from applications, which would fail at build time with a linker error.

== Automation ==

=== cabal init ===
A package management tool for Haskell called cabal-install provides a command line tool to help developers create a simple cabal project. Just run and answer all the questions. Default values are provided for each.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cabal init
Package name [default &quot;test&quot;]? 
Package version [default &quot;0.1&quot;]? 
Please choose a license:
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== mkcabal ===
mkcabal is a tool that existed before cabal init, which also automatically populates a new cabal project :

    darcs get http://code.haskell.org/~dons/code/mkcabal

'''N.B. This tool does not work in Windows.''' The Windows version of GHC does not include the readline package that this tool needs.

Usage is:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkcabal
Project name: haq
What license [&quot;GPL&quot;,&quot;LGPL&quot;,&quot;BSD3&quot;,&quot;BSD4&quot;,&quot;PublicDomain&quot;,&quot;AllRightsReserved&quot;] [&quot;BSD3&quot;]: 
What kind of project [Executable,Library] [Executable]: 
Is this your name? - &quot;Don Stewart &quot; [Y/n]: 
Is this your email address? - &quot;&lt;dons@cse.unsw.edu.au&gt;&quot; [Y/n]: 
Created Setup.lhs and haq.cabal
$ ls
Haq.hs    LICENSE   Setup.lhs _darcs    dist      haq.cabal
&lt;/pre&gt;

which will fill out some stub Cabal files for the project 'haq'. 

To create an entirely new project tree:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkcabal --init-project
Project name: haq
What license [&quot;GPL&quot;,&quot;LGPL&quot;,&quot;BSD3&quot;,&quot;BSD4&quot;,&quot;PublicDomain&quot;,&quot;AllRightsReserved&quot;] [&quot;BSD3&quot;]: 
What kind of project [Executable,Library] [Executable]: 
Is this your name? - &quot;Don Stewart &quot; [Y/n]: 
Is this your email address? - &quot;&lt;dons@cse.unsw.edu.au&gt;&quot; [Y/n]: 
Created new project directory: haq
$ cd haq
$ ls
Haq.hs    LICENSE   README    Setup.lhs haq.cabal
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Licenses ==

Code for the common base library package must be BSD licensed or something more Free/Open&lt;!--I say Freer, because I doubt public domain code, eg, would be rejected. --&gt;. Otherwise, it is entirely up to you as the author. 

Choose a licence (inspired by [http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/rants/license.html this]). Check the licences of things you use, both other Haskell packages and C libraries, since these may impose conditions you must follow.

Use the same licence as related projects, where possible. The Haskell community is split into 2 camps, roughly, those who release everything under BSD or public domain, and the GPL/LGPLers (this split roughly mirrors the copyleft/noncopyleft divide in Free software communities). Some Haskellers recommend specifically avoiding the LGPL, due to cross module optimisation issues.  Like many licensing questions, this advice is controversial.  Several Haskell projects (wxHaskell, HaXml, etc.) use the LGPL with an extra permissive clause to avoid the cross-module optimisation problem.

== Releases ==

It's important to release your code as stable, tagged tarballs. Don't
just [http://web.archive.org/web/20070627103346/http://awayrepl.blogspot.com/2006/11/we-dont-do-releases.html rely on darcs for distribution].

* '''darcs dist''' generates tarballs directly from a darcs repository

For example:

 $ cd fps
 $ ls       
 Data      LICENSE   README    Setup.hs  TODO      _darcs    cbits dist      fps.cabal tests
 $ darcs dist -d fps-0.8
 Created dist as fps-0.8.tar.gz

You can now just post your fps-0.8.tar.gz

You can also have darcs do the equivalent of 'daily snapshots' for you by using a post-hook.

put the following in _darcs/prefs/defaults:
  apply posthook darcs dist
  apply run-posthook

Advice:
* Tag each release using '''darcs tag'''. For example:

 $ darcs tag 0.8
 Finished tagging patch 'TAG 0.8'

Then people can &lt;tt&gt;darcs get --lazy --tag 0.8&lt;/tt&gt;, to get just the tagged version (and not the entire history).

== Hosting ==

You can host public and private Darcs repositories on http://patch-tag.com/ for free.
Otherwise, a Darcs repository can be published simply by making it available from a web page.
Another option is to host on the Haskell Community Server at http://code.haskell.org/. You can request an account via http://community.haskell.org/admin/. You can also use https://github.com/ for Git hosting.

== Example ==

[http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/blog/2006/12/11#release-a-library-today A complete example] of writing, packaging and releasing a new Haskell library under this process has been documented.

==Reverted?==
The vote for deletion page was showing up again and I tried to revert it. Please revert to the last valid version if I didn't do it right. =)&lt;br&gt;
-- Anonymous Blender user.

==Someone did it on purpose...==
I reverted the book to an older date. Some stupid person came in and wiped out the page and replaced it with a fake error message. 

==EH?==

-Has this page been transwiki'd? nowhere does it say so, except a little not towards the bootom about wikiversity. and it's not in wikiversity at the moment. What's left of the front page mentions an 'error'but this all looks like gobbldigook, along with the last 20 or so edits. I'm rather confused and extremely annoyed, as this book is a really big resource for me. I could look an idiot and cause a mess reporting this when the book is just in transit between wiki's, but I seriously want to kow what's going on, so if there' no developments in say a day I will. -[[User:Zepheriah|Zepheriah]] 15:01, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

Phew, thanks everyone...
-[[User:Zepheriah|Zepheriah]] 23:13, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

== Misc rants ==

I was wondering if under animation, we could put something about downloading and using BVH files. I'll be happy to do that myself. Also, for talented animators with limited resources, a few links to Blender compatible remote render services. I didn't sign in, but you may contact me at [[User_talk:Dessydes]]

Thank god someone finally said something about other newbies posting stupid comments in the tutorial pages. It was getting friggin annoying and a wasting my time. I am new to Blender, glad to use it, and  thankful for what guidance there is. I do from time to time add or try to clarify from my own experience, but not to the extent that this recent flood of morons have been.....Mudpuddle

== WHY did you deleted this great page ==

Why did you deleted this book which was awarded as wikibook of mounth. It was the best book which i has allredy found on internet for biginers as I am. Who deleted this book is really silly man.

By joining up with the team, you'll be able to participate in our uphill swim as we work to turn [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] into a real winner.  Take a look at the current tasks below to get an idea of how you can help.  Add yourself to the team list above and get started helping out. It doesn't matter if you know nothing about virtual design, you can also be an artist. So join the team.

==Current Needs==
*For every page:
**editors to improve the page
**editors to review changes
*For every module:
**Make sure the module has navigation templates at the top and bottom. (Use [[Template:B3D:N2P/NAV|NAV template]].  See [[../Nav_Demo_Page_2|the demo page]] for an example.)
**Make sure the module order agrees with the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro#Table of Contents|Table of Contents]] and both printable versions (see below)
*For every tutorial module:
**Test with current stable release -- some tutorials are several years old.
**Tutorials need to be taught visually.  Overlay renders and screenshots with instructions. (See [[../Nav_Demo_Page_2|the demo page]] for an example).

      <comment>/* Introduction to categories */ making it clearer what a &quot;notion of composition&quot; actually entails.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Wider Theory}}

This article attempts to give an overview of category theory, in so far as it applies to Haskell. To this end, Haskell code will be given alongside the mathematical definitions. Absolute rigour is not followed; in its place, we seek to give the reader an intuitive feel for what the concepts of category theory are and how they relate to Haskell.

== Introduction to categories ==
[[Image:Simple-cat.png|left|frame|A simple category, with three objects ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', three identity morphisms &lt;math&gt;\mathit{id}_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{id}_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{id}_C&lt;/math&gt;, and two other morphisms &lt;math&gt;f : C \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g : A \to B&lt;/math&gt;. The third element (the specification of how to compose the morphisms) is not shown.]]

A category is, in essence, a simple collection. It has three components:

* A collection of '''objects'''.
* A collection of '''morphisms''', each of which ties two objects (a ''source object'' and a ''target object'') together. (These are sometimes called '''arrows''', but we avoid that term here as it has other connotations in Haskell.) If ''f'' is a morphism with source object ''A'' and target object ''B'', we write &lt;math&gt;f : A \to B&lt;/math&gt;.
* A notion of '''composition''' of these morphisms. If &lt;math&gt;g : A \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f : B \to C&lt;/math&gt; are two morphisms, they can be composed, resulting in a morphism &lt;math&gt;f \circ g : A \to C&lt;/math&gt;.

Lots of things form categories. For example, '''Set''' is the category of all sets with morphisms as standard functions and composition being standard function composition. (Category names are often typeset in bold face.) '''Grp''' is the category of all groups with morphisms as functions that preserve group operations (the group homomorphisms), i.e. for any two groups ''G'' with operation ''*'' and ''H'' with operation ''·'', a function &lt;math&gt;f : G \to H&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism in '''Grp''' iff:

: &lt;math&gt;f(u * v) = f(u) \cdot f(v)&lt;/math&gt;

It may seem that morphisms are always functions, but this needn't be the case. For example, any partial order (''P'', &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;) defines a category where the objects are the elements of ''P'', and there is a morphism between any two objects ''A'' and ''B'' iff &lt;math&gt;A \leq B&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, there are allowed to be multiple morphisms with the same source and target objects; using the '''Set''' example, &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; are both functions with source object &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and target object &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, but they’re most certainly not the same morphism!

=== Category laws ===

There are three laws that categories need to follow. Firstly, and most simply, the composition of morphisms needs to be '''''associative'''''. Symbolically,

: &lt;math&gt;f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, the category needs to be '''''closed''''' under the composition operation. So if &lt;math&gt;f : B \to C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g : A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, then there must be some morphism &lt;math&gt;h : A \to C&lt;/math&gt; in the category such that &lt;math&gt;h = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;. We can see how this works using the following category:

[[Image:Composition-ex.png|center]]

''f'' and ''g'' are both morphisms so we must be able to compose them and get another morphism in the category. So which is the morphism &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;? The only option is &lt;math&gt;\mathit{id}_A&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we see that &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = \mathit{id}_B&lt;/math&gt;.

Lastly, given a category ''C'' there needs to be for every object &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; an '''''identity''' morphism'', &lt;math&gt;\mathit{id}_A : A \to A&lt;/math&gt; that is an identity of composition with other morphisms. Put precisely, for every morphism &lt;math&gt;g : A \to B&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;g \circ \mathit{id}_A = \mathit{id}_B \circ g = g&lt;/math&gt;

=== '''Hask''', the Haskell category ===

The main category we'll be concerning ourselves with in this article is '''Hask''', which treats Haskell types as objects and Haskell functions as morphisms and uses &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; for composition: a function &lt;code&gt;f :: A -&gt; B&lt;/code&gt; for types &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is a morphism in '''Hask'''. We can check the first and second law easily: we know &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; is an associative function, and clearly, for any &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f . g&lt;/code&gt; is another function. In '''Hask''', the identity morphism is &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, and we have trivially:

: &lt;code&gt;id . f = f . id = f&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Actually, there is a subtlety here: because &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; is a lazy function, if &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, we have that &lt;code&gt;id . f = \_ -&gt; ⊥&lt;/code&gt;. Now, while this may seem equivalent to &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt; for all intents and purposes, you can actually tell them apart using the strictifying function &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that the last category law is broken. We can define a new strict composition function, &lt;code&gt;f .! g = ((.) $! f) $! g&lt;/code&gt;, that makes '''Hask''' a category. We proceed by using the normal &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;, though, and attribute any discrepancies to the fact that &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; breaks an awful lot of the nice language properties anyway.&lt;/ref&gt; This isn't an exact translation of the law above, though; we're missing subscripts. The function &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell is ''polymorphic'' — it can take many different types for its domain and range, or, in category-speak, can have many different source and target objects. But morphisms in category theory are by definition ''monomorphic'' — each morphism has one specific source object and one specific target object. A polymorphic Haskell function can be made monomorphic by specifying its type (''instantiating'' with a monomorphic type), so it would be more precise if we said that the identity morphism from '''Hask''' on a type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;(id :: A -&gt; A)&lt;/code&gt;. With this in mind, the above law would be rewritten as:

: &lt;code&gt;(id :: B -&gt; B) . f = f . (id :: A -&gt; A) = f&lt;/code&gt;

However, for simplicity, we will ignore this distinction when the meaning is clear.

{{Exercises|
* As was mentioned, any partial order (''P'', &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;) is a category with objects as the elements of ''P'' and a morphism between elements ''a'' and ''b'' iff a &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; b. Which of the above laws guarantees the transitivity of &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;?
* (Harder.) If we add another morphism to the above example, it fails to be a category. Why? Hint: think about associativity of the composition operation.
[[Image:Not-a-cat.png|center]]}}

== Functors ==
[[Image:Functor.png|frame|right|A functor between two categories, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt;. Of note is that the objects ''A'' and ''B'' both get mapped to the same object in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt;, and that therefore ''g'' becomes a morphism with the same source and target object (but isn't necessarily an identity), and &lt;math&gt;id_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;id_B&lt;/math&gt; become the same morphism. The arrows showing the mapping of objects are shown in a dotted, pale olive. The arrows showing the mapping of morphisms are shown in a dotted, pale blue.]]

So we have some categories which have objects and morphisms that relate our objects together. The next Big Topic in category theory is the '''functor''', which relates categories together. A functor is essentially a transformation between categories, so given categories ''C'' and ''D'', a functor &lt;math&gt;F : C \to D&lt;/math&gt;:

* Maps any object ''A'' in ''C'' to &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt;, in ''D''.
* Maps morphisms &lt;math&gt;f : A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in ''C'' to &lt;math&gt;F(f) : F(A) \to F(B)&lt;/math&gt; in ''D''.

One of the canonical examples of a functor is the forgetful functor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; which maps groups to their underlying sets and group morphisms to the functions which behave the same but are defined on sets instead of groups. Another example is the power set functor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; which maps sets to their power sets and maps functions &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; to functions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; which take inputs &lt;math&gt;U \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and return &lt;math&gt;f(U)&lt;/math&gt;, the image of ''U'' under ''f'', defined by &lt;math&gt;f(U) = \{ \, f(u) : u \in U \, \}&lt;/math&gt;. For any category ''C'', we can define a functor known as the identity functor on ''C'', or &lt;math&gt;1_C : C \to C&lt;/math&gt;, that just maps objects to themselves and morphisms to themselves. This will turn out to be useful in the [[#The monad laws and their importance|monad laws]] section later on.

Once again there are a few axioms that functors have to obey. Firstly, given an identity morphism &lt;math&gt;id_A&lt;/math&gt; on an object ''A'', &lt;math&gt;F(id_A)&lt;/math&gt; must be the identity morphism on &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.:

: &lt;math&gt;F(id_A) = id_{F(A)}&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly functors must distribute over morphism composition, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;F(f \circ g) = F(f) \circ F(g)&lt;/math&gt;

{{Exercises|For the diagram given on the right, check these functor laws.}}

=== Functors on '''Hask''' ===
The Functor typeclass you will probably have seen in Haskell does in fact tie in with the categorical notion of a functor. Remember that a functor has two parts: it maps objects in one category to objects in another and morphisms in the first category to morphisms in the second. Functors in Haskell are from '''Hask''' to ''func'', where ''func'' is the subcategory of '''Hask''' defined on just that functor's types. E.g. the list functor goes from '''Hask''' to '''Lst''', where '''Lst''' is the category containing only ''list types'', that is, &lt;code&gt;[T]&lt;/code&gt; for any type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. The morphisms in '''Lst''' are functions defined on list types, that is, functions &lt;code&gt;[T] -&gt; [U]&lt;/code&gt; for types &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;. How does this tie into the Haskell typeclass Functor? Recall its definition:

 class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
   fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b

Let's have a sample instance, too:

 instance Functor Maybe where
   fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
   fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing

Here's the key part: the ''type constructor'' Maybe takes any type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; to a new type, &lt;code&gt;Maybe T&lt;/code&gt;. Also, &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; restricted to Maybe types takes a function &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; to a function &lt;code&gt;Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b&lt;/code&gt;. But that's it! We've defined two parts, something that takes objects in '''Hask''' to objects in another category (that of Maybe types and functions defined on Maybe types), and something that takes morphisms in '''Hask''' to morphisms in this category. So Maybe is a functor.

A useful intuition regarding Haskell functors is that they represent types that can be mapped over. This could be a list or a Maybe, but also more complicated structures like trees. A function that does some mapping could be written using &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, then any functor structure could be passed into this function. E.g. you could write a generic function that covers all of Data.List.map, Data.Map.map, Data.Array.IArray.amap, and so on.

What about the functor axioms? The polymorphic function &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; takes the place of &lt;math&gt;id_A&lt;/math&gt; for any ''A'', so the first law states:

 fmap id = id

With our above intuition in mind, this states that mapping over a structure doing nothing to each element is equivalent to doing nothing overall. Secondly, morphism composition is just &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;, so

 fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g

This second law is very useful in practice. Picturing the functor as a list or similar container, the right-hand side is a two-pass algorithm: we map over the structure, performing &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, then map over it again, performing &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;. The functor axioms guarantee we can transform this into a single-pass algorithm that performs &lt;code&gt;f . g&lt;/code&gt;. This is a process known as ''fusion''.

{{Exercises|Check the laws for the Maybe and list functors.}}

=== Translating categorical concepts into Haskell ===

Functors provide a good example of how category theory gets translated into Haskell. The key points to remember are that:

* We work in the category '''Hask''' and its subcategories.
* Objects are types.
* Morphisms are functions.
* Things that take a type and return another type are type constructors.
* Things that take a function and return another function are higher-order functions.
* Typeclasses, along with the polymorphism they provide, make a nice way of capturing the fact that in category theory things are often defined over a number of objects at once.

== Monads ==

[[Image:Unit-join.png|frame|right|''unit'' and ''join'', the two morphisms that must exist for every object for a given monad.]]

Monads are obviously an extremely important concept in Haskell, and in fact they originally came from category theory. A ''monad'' is a special type of functor, from a category to that same category, that supports some additional structure. So, down to definitions. A monad is a functor &lt;math&gt;M : C \to C&lt;/math&gt;, along with two morphisms&lt;ref&gt;Experienced category theorists will notice that we're simplifying things a bit here; instead of presenting ''unit'' and ''join'' as natural transformations, we treat them explicitly as morphisms, and require naturality as extra axioms alongside the [[#The third and fourth laws|standard monad laws (laws 3 and 4)]]. The reasoning is simplicity; we are not trying to teach category theory as a whole, simply give a categorical background to some of the structures in Haskell. You may also notice that we are giving these morphisms names suggestive of their Haskell analogues, because the names &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; don’t provide much intuition.&lt;/ref&gt; for every object ''X'' in ''C'':

* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{unit}^M_X : X \to M(X)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join}^M_X : M(M(X)) \to M(X)&lt;/math&gt;

When the monad under discussion is obvious, we’ll leave out the ''M'' superscript for these functions and just talk about &lt;math&gt;\mathit{unit}_X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join}_X&lt;/math&gt; for some ''X''.

Let’s see how this translates to the Haskell typeclass Monad, then.

 class Functor m =&gt; Monad m where
   return :: a -&gt; m a
   (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

The class constraint of &lt;code&gt;Functor m&lt;/code&gt; ensures that we already have the functor structure: a mapping of objects and of morphisms. &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is the (polymorphic) analogue to &lt;math&gt;\mathit{unit}_X&lt;/math&gt; for any ''X''. But we have a problem. Although &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;’s type looks quite similar to that of ''unit''; the other function, &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, often called ''bind'', bears no resemblance to ''join''. There is however another monad function, &lt;code&gt;join :: Monad m =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a&lt;/code&gt;, that looks quite similar. Indeed, we can recover &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; from each other:

 join :: Monad m =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a
 join x = x &gt;&gt;= id
 
 (&gt;&gt;=) :: Monad m =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
 x &gt;&gt;= f = join (fmap f x)

So specifying a monad’s &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to specifying its &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;. It just turns out that the normal way of defining a monad in category theory is to give ''unit'' and ''join'', whereas Haskell programmers like to give &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This is perhaps due to the fact that Haskell programmers like to think of monads as a way of sequencing computations with a common feature, whereas in category theory the container aspect of the various structures is emphasised. &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; pertains naturally to containers (squashing two layers of a container down into one), but &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; is the natural sequencing operation (do something, feeding its results into something else).&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the categorical way makes more sense. Any time you have some kind of structure ''M'' and a natural way of taking any object ''X'' into &lt;math&gt;M(X)&lt;/math&gt;, as well as a way of taking &lt;math&gt;M(M(X))&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;M(X)&lt;/math&gt;, you probably have a monad. We can see this in the following example section.

=== Example: the powerset functor is also a monad ===
The power set functor &lt;math&gt;P : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; described above forms a monad. For any set ''S'' you have a &lt;math&gt;\mathit{unit}_S(x) = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, mapping elements to their singleton set. Note that each of these singleton sets are trivially a subset of ''S'', so &lt;math&gt;\mathit{unit}_S&lt;/math&gt; returns elements of the powerset of ''S'', as is required. Also, you can define a function &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join}_S&lt;/math&gt; as follows: we receive an input &lt;math&gt;L \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(S))&lt;/math&gt;. This is:

* A member of the powerset of the powerset of ''S''.
* So a member of the set of all subsets of the set of all subsets of ''S''.
* So a set of subsets of ''S''

We then return the union of these subsets, giving another subset of ''S''. Symbolically, 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join}_S(L) = \bigcup L&lt;/math&gt;. 

Hence ''P'' is a monad &lt;ref&gt;If you can prove that certain laws hold, which we'll explore in the next section.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In fact, ''P'' is almost equivalent to the list monad; with the exception that we're talking lists instead of sets, they're almost the same. Compare:

== The monad laws and their importance ==
Just as functors had to obey certain axioms in order to be called functors, monads have a few of their own. We'll first list them, then translate to Haskell, then see why they’re important.

Given a monad &lt;math&gt;M : C \to C&lt;/math&gt; and a morphism &lt;math&gt;f : A \to B&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;A, B \in C&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join} \circ M(\mathit{join}) = \mathit{join} \circ \mathit{join}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join} \circ M(\mathit{unit}) = \mathit{join} \circ \mathit{unit} = \mathit{id}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathit{unit} \circ f = M(f) \circ \mathit{unit}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathit{join} \circ M(M(f)) = M(f) \circ \mathit{join}&lt;/math&gt;

By now, the Haskell translations should be hopefully self-explanatory:

# &lt;code&gt;join . fmap join     = join . join&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;join . fmap return   = join . return = id&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;return . f           = fmap f . return&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;join . fmap (fmap f) =  fmap f . join&lt;/code&gt;

(Remember that &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; is the part of a functor that acts on morphisms.) These laws seem a bit impenetrable at first, though. What on earth do these laws mean, and why should they be true for monads? Let’s explore the laws.

=== The first law ===
&lt;code&gt;join . fmap join = join . join&lt;/code&gt;
[[Image:Monad-law-1-lists.png|frame|right|A demonstration of the first law for lists. Remember that &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; in the list monad.]]

In order to understand this law, we'll first use the example of lists. The first law mentions two functions, &lt;code&gt;join . fmap join&lt;/code&gt; (the left-hand side) and &lt;code&gt;join . join&lt;/code&gt; (the right-hand side). What will the types of these functions be? Remembering that &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;’s type is &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[a]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt; (we’re talking just about lists for now), the types are both &lt;code&gt;[[[a]]] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt; (the fact that they’re the same is handy; after all, we’re trying to show they’re completely the same function!). So we have a list of list of lists. The left-hand side, then, performs &lt;code&gt;fmap join&lt;/code&gt; on this 3-layered list, then uses &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; on the result. &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; is just the familiar &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; for lists, so we first map across each of the list of lists inside the top-level list, concatenating them down into a list each. So afterward, we have a list of lists, which we then run through &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;. In summary, we 'enter' the top level, collapse the second and third levels down, then collapse this new level with the top level.

What about the right-hand side? We first run &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; on our list of list of lists. Although this is three layers, and you normally apply a two-layered list to &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;, this will still work, because a &lt;code&gt;[[[a]]]&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[b]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;b = [a]&lt;/code&gt;, so in a sense, a three-layered list is just a two layered list, but rather than the last layer being 'flat', it is composed of another list. So if we apply our list of lists (of lists) to &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;, it will flatten those outer two layers into one. As the second layer wasn't flat but instead contained a third layer, we will still end up with a list of lists, which the other &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; flattens. Summing up, the left-hand side will flatten the inner two layers into a new layer, then flatten this with the outermost layer. The right-hand side will flatten the outer two layers, then flatten this with the innermost layer. These two operations should be equivalent. It’s sort of like a law of associativity for &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; is also a monad, with

 return :: a -&gt; Maybe a
 return x = Just x
 
 join :: Maybe (Maybe a) -&gt; Maybe a
 join Nothing         = Nothing
 join (Just Nothing)  = Nothing
 join (Just (Just x)) = Just x

So if we had a ''three''-layered Maybe (i.e., it could be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Just Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Just (Just Nothing)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Just (Just (Just x))&lt;/code&gt;), the first law says that collapsing the inner two layers first, then that with the outer layer is exactly the same as collapsing the outer layers first, then that with the innermost layer. 

{{Exercises|Verify that the list and Maybe monads do in fact obey this law with some examples to see precisely how the layer flattening works.}}

=== The second law ===
&lt;code&gt;join . fmap return = join . return = id&lt;/code&gt;

What about the second law, then? Again, we'll start with the example of lists. Both functions mentioned in the second law are functions &lt;code&gt;[a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;. The left-hand side expresses a function that maps over the list, turning each element &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; into its singleton list &lt;code&gt;[x]&lt;/code&gt;, so that at the end we’re left with a list of singleton lists. This two-layered list is flattened down into a single-layer list again using the &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;. The right hand side, however, takes the entire list &lt;code&gt;[x, y, z, ...]&lt;/code&gt;, turns it into the singleton list of lists &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[x, y, z, ...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then flattens the two layers down into one again. This law is less obvious to state quickly, but it essentially says that applying &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; to a monadic value, then &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;ing the result should have the same effect whether you perform the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; from inside the top layer or from outside it.

{{Exercises|Prove this second law for the Maybe monad.}}

=== The third and fourth laws ===
&lt;code&gt;return . f = fmap f . return&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;join . fmap (fmap f) = fmap f . join&lt;/code&gt;

The last two laws express more self evident fact about how we expect monads to behave. The easiest way to see how they are true is to expand them to use the expanded form:

# &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; return (f x)  =  \x -&gt; fmap f (return x)&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; join (fmap (fmap f) x)  =  \x -&gt; fmap f (join x)&lt;/code&gt;

{{Exercises|Convince yourself that these laws should hold true for any monad by exploring what they mean, in a similar style to how we explained the first and second laws.}}

=== Application to do-blocks ===
Well, we have intuitive statements about the laws that a monad must support, but why is that important? The answer becomes obvious when we consider do-blocks. Recall that a do-block is just syntactic sugar for a combination of statements involving &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; as witnessed by the usual translation:

 do { x }                 --&gt;  x
 do { let { y = v }; x }  --&gt;  let y = v in do { x }
 do { v &lt;- y; x }         --&gt;  y &gt;&gt;= \v -&gt; do { x }
 do { y; x }              --&gt;  y &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; do { x }

Also notice that we can prove what are normally quoted as the monad laws using &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; from our above laws (the proofs are a little heavy in some cases, feel free to skip them if you want to):

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;

&lt;code&gt;return x &gt;&gt;= f  =  f x&lt;/code&gt;. Proof:
&lt;pre&gt;   return x &gt;&gt;= f
 = join (fmap f (return x)) -- By the definition of (&gt;&gt;=)
 = join (return (f x))      -- By law 3
 = (join . return) (f x)
 = id (f x)                 -- By law 2
 = f x
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

&lt;code&gt;m &gt;&gt;= return  =  m&lt;/code&gt;. Proof:
   m &gt;&gt;= return
 = join (fmap return m)    -- By the definition of (&gt;&gt;=)
 = (join . fmap return) m
 = id m                    -- By law 2
 = m

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

&lt;code&gt;(m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g  =  m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)&lt;/code&gt;. Proof (recall that &lt;code&gt;fmap f . fmap g = fmap (f . g)&lt;/code&gt;):
   (m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g
 = (join (fmap f m)) &gt;&gt;= g                          -- By the definition of (&gt;&gt;=)
 = join (fmap g (join (fmap f m)))                  -- By the definition of (&gt;&gt;=)
 = (join . fmap g) (join (fmap f m))
 = (join . fmap g . join) (fmap f m)
 = (join . join . fmap (fmap g)) (fmap f m)         -- By law 4
 = (join . join . fmap (fmap g) . fmap f) m
 = (join . join . fmap (fmap g . f)) m              -- By the distributive law of functors
 = (join . join . fmap (\x -&gt; fmap g (f x))) m
 = (join . fmap join . fmap (\x -&gt; fmap g (f x))) m -- By law 1
 = (join . fmap (join . (\x -&gt; fmap g (f x)))) m    -- By the distributive law of functors
 = (join . fmap (\x -&gt; join (fmap g (f x)))) m
 = (join . fmap (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)) m                -- By the definition of (&gt;&gt;=)
 = join (fmap (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g) m)
 = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)                          -- By the definition of (&gt;&gt;=)

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

These new monad laws, using &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, can be translated into do-block notation.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;

! Points-free style
! Do-block style

|-

| &lt;code&gt;return x &gt;&gt;= f = f x&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;do { v &lt;- return x; f v } = do { f x }&lt;/code&gt;

|-

| &lt;code&gt;m &gt;&gt;= return = m&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;do { v &lt;- m; return v } = do { m }&lt;/code&gt;

|-

| &lt;code&gt;(m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)&lt;/code&gt;
| 
&lt;pre&gt;   do { y &lt;- do { x &lt;- m; f x };
        g y }
 =
   do { x &lt;- m;
        y &lt;- f x;
        g y }
&lt;/pre&gt;

|}

The monad laws are now common-sense statements about how do-blocks should function. If one of these laws were invalidated, users would become confused, as you couldn't be able to manipulate things within the do-blocks as would be expected. The monad laws are, in essence, usability guidelines.

{{Exercises|1=
In fact, the two versions of the laws we gave:
 -- Categorical:
 join . fmap join = join . join
 join . fmap return = join . return = id
 return . f = fmap f . return
 join . fmap (fmap f) = fmap f . join
 
 -- Functional:
 m &gt;&gt;= return = m
 return m &gt;&gt;= f = f m
 (m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)
are entirely equivalent. We showed that we can recover the functional laws from the categorical ones. Go the other way; show that starting from the functional laws, the categorical laws hold. It may be useful to remember the following definitions:
 join m = m &gt;&gt;= id
 fmap f m = m &gt;&gt;= return . f
Thanks to Yitzchak Gale for suggesting this exercise.

== Summary ==
We've come a long way in this chapter. We've looked at what categories are and how they apply to Haskell. We've introduced the basic concepts of category theory including functors, as well as some more advanced topics like monads, and seen how they're crucial to idiomatic Haskell. We haven't covered some of the basic category theory that wasn't needed for our aims, like natural transformations, but have instead provided an intuitive feel for the categorical grounding behind Haskell's structures.

A Wikibooks Editorial Board is a group of three qualified editors who can be asked by the authors of books to review their book and check it for accuracy, compliance with copyright and other attributes required in a textbook that will have high credibility. The editorial board can approve stable editions of books and these will be preserved in the Wikibooks database as PDF files. This procedure should normally apply only to mature, completed books.

The stable editions of books that have editorial approval will have the same credibility as any textbook published by a reputable publisher.

== The editorial board ==

The board will consist of three members with the following characteristics:

# '''Lead expert''': at least one expert in a field that is closely related to that covered by the book. Expertise can be assessed by either a declaration by the editor of their name and qualifications '''or''' (for those who prefer anonymity) a body of work in Wikibooks that demonstrates their competence in the field.
# '''Second expert''': in addition, a further expert from the appropriate area of academic endeavour. (A scientist for scientific books, an expert in the humanities for a humanities book etc.) Again expertise may be judged by declared qualifications or contributions.
# '''Administrative editor''': in addition a person with experience of editorial boards.

The editorial board may not contain a prominent author of the book under review (contribution &gt; 5%).

The editorial board must be acceptable to each other and to all the authors of the book who are active. 

All Wikibookians should be asked whether they would like to volunteer as editors and enter their names on [[Wikibooks:Volunteer editors]] along with their areas of expertise  ie: Johnsmith  Science esp: chemistry, biochemistry.

== The Editorial process ==

The editorial board can, at any time refuse to continue editing if they feel that the book needs too many amendments or there are insurmountable difficulties.  A refusal to continue editing will lead to a six month delay before the next opportunity to submit the book for editorial board approval.

=== First pass ===

The authors should obtain three editorial board volunteers and establish their respective roles.

The authors should create a PDF file of the book.

They should then create a subpage in their book called &quot;Editorial review edition 1.0&quot; based on the [[/Editorial review/]] template.  A link to this page should be placed at the bottom of their book.

Any challenges to the composition of the board must be made within 2 weeks of the creation of the template and before editors have devoted more than 1 hour of work to the review.

The PDF file should be submitted to the administrative editor who will assess whether it is suitable for editorial review.  The book may be passed back for preliminary modifications at this stage.

=== Second pass ===

Books that have passed the preliminary checks for format etc. will then be read by the whole editorial board.

Having read through the book the expert editors may pass the book back to the authors for further format, depth of content etc. revisions.  

Once satisfied with the general content and structure the expert editors will divide the book into equal portions and engage in an in-depth review.

The parts of the book may be passed back for revision.

=== Third pass ===

The authors will be advised that the book is acceptable and informed of final presentational details.

The final PDF will have a clear date, approval logo and edition number.  It will be filed under a unique name and made available as a stable approved edition.

==Frequency of approved editions ==

Approved editions should normally be no more frequent than 6 monthly.  Requests for frequent editions may take away valuable resources from other books.  There is no reason why development of the book should not proceed in the normal way between approved editions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of the editorial review is to ensure that a textbook is factual and as free from error as possible.  The editorial board should concentrate on accuracy.  Clarity of presentation is also important - confusion is a form of error.  Minor issues of style are less important - the board might advise on &quot;scrappy&quot; illustrations etc. but these are not mission critical and even a scrappy illustration may transmit more understanding than a thousand words.

Editors should provide as much guidance as possible in the answers to the questions below so that authors can correct faults.

==Composition of the Board==

Enter the userid's of the board members below:

Lead expert:

Second expert:

Administrative editor:

Date:

(Any challenges to the composition of the board must be made within 2 weeks of the above date and before any editor has devoted substantial time &gt; 1 hour to the review)

==PDF File==

Enter a link to the book's PDF below.  The PDF must not be revised whilst the review is in progress except at the request of the editorial board.

''(ie: media:biology.pdf bracketed with double square brackets.)''

== Preparation by Editorial Board ==

Each expert member of the board should state which outside textbooks they will use for comparison with the book.  Links should be included with e-books.

===Lead Expert===
''(ie: Grays Anatomy)''


===Second Expert===

== First Pass ==
The administrative editor should answer the questions below with yes/no or an appropriate response.
* Is there an acceptable front cover?
* Is there a link to Wikibooks on the front cover?
* Is there an edition number?
* Is the title appropriate for the contents?
* Is there a Table of Contents?
* Are there any copyright violations?
* Is there adequate content for this level of textbook?
* Is the book a &quot;Guide&quot;, &quot;Textbook&quot; or &quot;Complementary/Supplementary text&quot;?
* Are illustration/text/maths legible?

==Second Pass==

This phase of the review should be dedicated to assuring the '''accuracy''' of the content. Any biassed point of view should be noted. Once the review is complete the editor should note this at the bottom of their section.  The authors should then correct the faults and produce a new PDF and submit this again.

Each editor should note errors here:

===Review of initial book===

====Errors noted by lead expert====




====Errors noted by second expert====



===Review of Revision 1===
====Errors noted by lead expert====




====Errors noted by second expert====


==Third pass==

The editorial board should state here whether the book has passed review:

Has the book passed review? .....

If the book has not passed the authors should spend the next 6 months digesting why it failed and correcting the problems. Alternatively the authors may leave the book as an unapproved text.

If the book has passed then the authors should insert the edition date on the second page, the seal of approval on the front cover (if desired) and the following text on the second page:

'''This (textbook/study guide/Supplementary text) has been approved by a Wikibooks board of experts.  It is a stable edition that will not be changed.'''

In the case of Supplementary Texts the following warning should be added:

'''This is a '''Supplementary Text''' for a course of study.  It may be intended to stimulate debate.  Where the authors have treated the subject from a particular point of view this has been noted in the text. Students should be aware that particular points of view may not be acceptable for answers in examinations and should seek guidance from seminar leaders, teachers or further texts.'''

When ISBN numbers are available for Wikibooks, the ISBN number should be added to the second page.

The administrative editor should review these changes and note that they are sufficient below:

* Has the edition date been inserted? ...
* Has the approval text been added on the second page? ...
* '''Is the book ready for upload?''' ....

The authors should then upload the file as:

'''Appr_(book name)_ed(edition number).pdf'''

The editor should then ask Wikibooks administrators to amend any links to the PDF for the book on the Main Wikibooks page to the format required for approved texts. Authors should amend any other links to the PDF to link to the approved version.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck!--[[User:Sundance Raphael|Sundance Raphael]] 21:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Dupe pages? ==

Hi I see you have created two [[Animal Behavior/Cover]] pages (the other one has different capitalisation).  Do you require them both or should one be deleted, thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:12, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

Equally you have two pages [[Animal Behavior/Contributors/]] (one with a trailing slash the other without)? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== re: Dupe pages? ==

hi herby, what a reat. i was just looking to see whether i could scrounch up an admin to delete the two unused files - one cover and on for contributors. i am completely new and am trying to figure still everything out.  i am not even sure whether this is the right way to respond to your message. i think i have just managed to grasp file names and conventions, so i hope i wont create many more duplicates :-).

thanks again and please delete away, much obliged, ciao, [[User:129.1.84.29|129.1.84.29]]

i guesss this is what the tildes do when you are logged in :-) [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:No problem at all Robert - always ask - there are folk around who will help if they can.  You'll soon get the hang of it! I'll delete them anyway - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== Another thought! ==

Hi Robert - I've piped a couple of links using &quot;|&quot;, you can see what I have done here [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Animal_Behavior&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=715625].  I won't do anymore as you may not feel it improves things but if you do you'll learn by doing it yourself (much of what I know I have learnt from other people!).  If I can help let me know - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:Great, thanks, that does look mighty fine. Your changes are greatly appreciated and make my life for adding in the material that much easier. 

:I have also just run into a different problem and was wondering what the proper solution would be. Another wikibook has a section that would be very applicable to this book.

::*[[Introduction to Psychology/chpt3 | Biological basis of behavior]]

:i can link it into my table of context but then the navigation items are to the original table of contents and not to this book. Alternatively, if i copy the text, then there are two places that need to be updated in identical ways. it would really be best if the section could be used for both but the navigation would be book specific - how do i handle this all best? thanks, ciao,

::oops [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:::End of dayish in my time zone Robert so I'll take a look at this tomorrow and see if I can help (I'd like to say &quot;I'm sure I can&quot;) then.  Hope that is ok , regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

*reset
Hi Robert - ok - copying text is a no no - licensing issues means that you are cutting out the &quot;contributors&quot;.  Apart from anything else I would consider a message on [[User talk:ArrowStomper]] the contributor's talk page for that page.  I guess I would go for a &quot;see also&quot; approach in both articles rather than a navigation between them.  the &quot;See also&quot; idea is not used here as much as Wikipedia but I do think it is relevant in this case.

The book looks promising - the nature/nuture debate has always fascinated me (won't say more - don't want to fall out!!).  I'll certainly keep watching but let me know if I can help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:07, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:hi herby, thanks for your help. i contacted arrowstomper to see what s/he has to say. more soon, ciao, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

== Importing==

also, it is cool to import material via [[WB:RFI]] - right? could i do that with the materials from the psych page or does that simply apply to wikipedia entries?, ciao, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:not sure I understand this.  To me this is for importing from external Wikis (such as WP).  You may be better posting this one in the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] where more folks (&amp; more experienced folks) will see it.  I see you have linked the Psych page anyway --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

::i had played with this yesterday.i take if off for now and see what arrowstomp says, thanks, ciao, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

== Links to Wikipedia ==
sorry, one more question ... i am trying to link to a subsection of a wikipedia page using [[Wikipedia:en:Descartes#Dualism|Mind/body dualism]], but that does not seem to work as i would have hoped. thanks for any suggestions, ciao, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:Again not sure - to me what you have done works just fine.  The link takes you to the relevant spot in WP.  If you want the WP content that would be a [[WB:RFI]] issue (and can be done).  However bear in mind that way you get a snapshot of the WP page, edits after the tranwiki'ing will not be there?  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

::i get to the overal entry for descartes, but it fails to jump to the #dualism subsection. does this actually work for you, maybe it is my browser, thanks, ciao [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:::Interesting - goes to Dualism for me - using Firefox, works in Opera to (please apologise first if you are using IE &lt;g&gt;!) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:53, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

::::thanks. great to know. nah, definitely no IE here, i m using safari on the mac and i am proud to offer a microsoft free environment for the kids in my classes ;-) ciao and thanks again [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

== Animal behaviour patterns ==

Is it just me (or Euro based view)  Konrad Lorenz (sp?) springs to mind?  Bird behaviour I think --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:15, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

:[[W:Konrad_Lorenz]]?? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:18, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

:indeed, this chapter is next :-) bird behavior it is. this is the part where i have quite a bit of material as i was one of his last graduate students - i even have pictures which i will be happy to bring to the public domain, more soon, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]
::Excellent - as you will have guessed it does interest me.  And must have been interesting to have worked with someone like that - Thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== Deletions ==

No problem - will do.  In case I am not around take a look at [[WB:TM]] &amp; particularly [[Wikibooks:Template_messages/Deletion]] as this will allow you to &quot;tag&quot; such pages as you require deleted yourself and any admin will get them as they will be placed in that category which is checked regularly.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
:OK - done some - however there are pages on that list that have contributions (in some cases substantial) from IP addresses ([[Animal Behavior/History of Neuroscience]] for example).  As such I am not comfortable with deleting the page from a licensing and approval standpoint.  If you &quot;retain&quot; information that others have placed it would be far better to move or merge content.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
::hi herby, the tcpip address was also me, i had just forgotten to log in :-) [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] 14:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Ok there are just three left that have more that one IP address contributing to them (widely different ones)? Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
::::thanks, the other ips should be mine as well, 129.1.84.29 is me at work and the other looks like me at the coffee shop :-) thanks,[[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] 12:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

==templates for a animal behavior stub==

hi, i would like to create a book specific stub, i found where the existing ones are listed but not on how to create one. any advice greatly appreciated, thanks, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] 16:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

== Animal Behaviour book in catalan ==

Hello Robert,

First of all, congratulations for your book. I will read it entirely when I can. For now I've read the first pages and I like it very much.

I've just start &quot;my&quot; own wikibook about Animal Behaviour. It is in catalan [http://ca.wikibooks.org/wiki/Comportament_animal], but if you are interested in a particular page I can bring you a quick translation in my poor english (or very quick in spanish). It will be structured in my own point of view, heavily influenciated for my Animal Behaviour teacher, but your text will be very useful to me. 

I whish the help will be reciprocal. Ask me all that you want. Could I ask you questions if I have any? For now, what pages on your book do you think I can improve?

Thank you --[[w:ca:Usuari:Loquetudigas|Loquetudigas]] &lt;small&gt;(awnser [[ca:usuari discussió:Loquetudigas|here]] please!)&lt;/small&gt; 00:33, 19 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

Though I wish I could say &quot;No Problem!&quot;, I'm afraid I can't say that. The incompatibility of the two licenses might be fixed someday, but for now they're incompatible (as far as I know... I'm not a lawyer). I would be interested to see what they had to say... please email it to me. 

You also might want to bring this up on [http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/textbook-l textbook-l], our mailing list. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:48, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== New student-written text about educational psychology? ==

Dear Dwight,

I teach educational psychology at the University of Manitoba, and I am thinking about creating a student-written textbook about educational psychology. It would be reminiscent of your Wikibook about the social and cultural foundations of education.

I've read most of the behind-the-scenes advice that I could find about doing this (including your course syllabus for ECI 301, and the discussion pages for your Wikibook). My overall impression is that I should be able to do something along these lines, but it will have to be more modest, at least at the beginning. The reasons are that I have only about 70-75 students per year, only a handful of graduate students, and no grant to support this project at the moment. Nonetheless I would like to see what can be done.

I believe that you may have published an article or two about your experiences and/or assessment of the course, but I haven't been able to locate them. Can you point me in the right direction, and/or send me appropriate reprints (electronically is fine)? Any advice, ideas, or cautions would also be most welcome.

Thanks,
Kelvin Seifert

On of the Wikibooks users have nominated the [[Manx Youth Games]] book for deletion.  Please be aware that Wikibooks is for the creation of books and that articles of an encyclopedic nature should be created on Wikipedia which is more suitable.  I'm from the Isle of Man also so would be delighted to help in any way over on Wikipedia.

While Wikibooks offers somewhat clearer opportunities for &quot;authorship&quot; than Wikipedia, there remains the fact that anything put here is really a contribution. Content is thus developed by contributors rather than authors. If you are interested in developing a particular subject as part of this textbook, please add your material to an existing chapter or start a new page and fit it into the book's structure. The chapter arrangement can be fine-tuned at a later time.

*[[w:user:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] is a biologist at Bowling Green State University. This book started as an online, html-based, modular textbook in 1998. This material was transferred into the Wikibook to start things off. Since then content continues to develop for use in a college course in Animal Behavior.

*J. Jackson. Contributed to the Nature vs. Nurture section. 

*... (add your name and thoughts here if you are a contributor)

*Case Studies were contributed by ... (add your name if you have contributed a case study, research summary, or example)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. &quot;In his opinion NTFS is faster...&quot;, IN HIS OPINION??? FAT32 is faster, FACT. NTFS is a much more robust and advanced filesystem, but it's definately not faster than the much simpler FAT32. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:76.5.191.2|76.5.191.2]] ([[User talk:76.5.191.2|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/76.5.191.2|contribs]]) 06:45, 11 Jan 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

Agreed. The author of this article has no idea what he's talking about, or even what he should be talking about. He is describing NTFS from a user's standpoint.

{{wikipedia|Brans-Dicke theory}}

In theoretical physics, the Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation (sometimes called the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory) is a minority viewpoint in physics. The Brans-Dicke theory is a well-known competitor of Einstein's more popular theory of general relativity. The theory was developed by Robert H. Dicke and Carl H. Brans building upon, among others, the earlier work of Pascual Jordan. It is an example of a scalar-tensor theory, a gravitational theory in which the gravitational interaction is mediated by a scalar field as well as the tensor field of general relativity.

At present, both Brans-Dicke theory and general relativity are generally held to be in agreement with observation, although the experiments of the golden age of general relativity have considerably constrained the allowed parameters of Brans-Dicke theory.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Animal Behavior&lt;p&gt;
&lt;big&gt;A guide to the hows and whys of animals as they interact with each other &lt;br&gt;and with the world around them.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This textbook focuses on the mechanisms and evolution of animal behavior, including neural, hormonal, and genetic substrates of behavior; foraging; anti-predator defenses; mating systems and sexual selection; social behavior; communication; parental care; kin selection and recognition; and territoriality. Associated laboratory exercises provide hands-on experience for many of these concepts.

== Passing variables to os.system ==
This book should cover the os.system call
and state how to pass a varible to this call
for example I have &gt;&gt;&gt; os.system (&quot;ls -l ,dir &quot;)
and that does not work
[[Special:Contributions/70.70.255.225|70.70.255.225]] ([[User talk:70.70.255.225|talk]]) 00:00, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

== Syntax highlighting ==

I think the tutorial could get even more attractive with some syntax highlighting of the code. Wikibooks supports the [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight GeSHi]] extension, which actually looks really nice. In order to use it, code examples have to be put into &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;...&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags, which could actually replace the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags used almost everywhere in the book so far. This works only for code blocks and not for in-line code, but I think that's a minor problem. Any objections? [[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] 12:58, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

:I could implement this change quickly using my bot, if nobody disagrees with the change. I think it would be a big improvement over the existing code formatting. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:17, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== Refurbishing Code examples according to Python Style Guide (PEP 8) ==

During the next weeks, I am going to check the formatting of the code examples so that they get compliant with the Python Style Guide (PEP&amp;nbsp;8, http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Apart from that, there are some LaTeX style references in the text (\ref{...something...}) and some other minor bugs which I'll fix, too. --[[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] 12:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== ''Before You Begin Your Quest'' chapter ==

I merged the information from [[../Before You Begin Your Quest|Before You Begin Your Quest]] with [[../Intro|Intro]] and took away the link from the table of contents, to get rid of the redundency. --[[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] ([[User talk:Siebengang|talk]]) 11:21, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

== Redundant solution set info? ==

Is there a particular reason why the same text from module exercise descriptions is included in the solution set as well?  It seems redundant to me with the current (description of exercise) (solution bar) (description of exercise) setup the text has now. --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 20:20, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== break and continue ==

It's probably worth introducing the 'break' and 'continue' statements [[:Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python/Count to 10|here]].  I don't think they are described anywhere at all in the book at the moment [[User:Dooglus|Dooglus]] 19:37, 1 May 2006 (UTC) dooglus

== None ==

Might want to have something on assigning a value of &quot;None&quot; to variables in the [[Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python/Count_to_10|Count to 10 module]] or in the previous lesson, [[:Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python/Who_Goes_There?|Who Goes There?]]&quot;.  The [[:Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python/Count_to_10#Exercises|Exercise]] section in Count to 10 uses it without a prior introduction, I was a bit confused when trying to figure out the solution.

Maybe something like this?

{| border = 1 cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
|
So what about assigning a variable an empty value?  You can't exactly have a python program written up like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
variable_1 =
variable_2 =
print variable_1, variable_2
&lt;/source&gt;
If you try to run the above program in Python you will receive an invalid syntax error.  When we want to assign an empty value to a variable, Python has the special type that can be used for this case called &quot;None&quot;. You can test it out by using it in the example provided above:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
variable_1 = None
variable_2 = None
print variable_1, variable_2
&lt;/source&gt;
When you run the program now you will see an output of:
 None None
|}

I'm not sure about the exacts details here as I'm learning python myself, maybe someone more experienced could clean this up and add it in? --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 10:18, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== Talk page suggestions ==

=== Merge talk pages? ===

I added the &quot;Count to 10&quot; talk page contents here to the main page.  I think it might be easier if all the talk pages for the wikibook were in the same location.   As there only seems to be a small number of contributors currently working on the wiki, I think it would make things easier to have all the suggestions in the same place.  Maybe create a &quot;master&quot; talk page that had the contents of all the individual talk similar to the &quot;printable version&quot; style page? It might get messy if all the module talk pages were redirected here. --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 09:06, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Archiving ===

Would anyone mind if I moved the older, implemented suggestion discussions here to an &quot;archive&quot; page, so only the not discussed / unresolved issues are shown? --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 09:06, 16 November 2008 (UTC)
:Hmm, I found a to-do list in the  module &quot;[[:Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python/The End|The End]]&quot;, I'll use that for keeping track of suggested changes for now. --[[User:Tehdrago|Tehdrago]] ([[User talk:Tehdrago|talk]]) 18:18, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

== Python 3.0 ==

I am going to start creating [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3.0]] soon.  Since most of the examples in the existing tutorial will be invalid in python 3.0, and python 2.6 will be here for a while, I figure we can have two tutorials for awhile.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 04:49, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
:I started it. [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 15:29, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

:: Should we move this tutorial for Python 2.6 to &quot;Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6&quot;? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 00:11, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

:::Well, I think any python 2.2 to 2.6 will work with this version.  Almost all the examples will work in python 1.6 - 2.6.  That said I have no objection to moving it to something like &quot;Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2&quot;.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 04:20, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

I moved it...something is wrong...its all red links? I even moved the subpages. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 11:36, 20 June 2009 (UTC)
::nevermind I just purged the wiki cache and its proper now :) --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 11:40, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

==Exercises==
I noticed that many solutions to excersises were much messier than they needed to be. Should they at least note that their are other solutions?
:They can note that there are other solutions.  Some of the exercises already have multiple solutions.  They also can be rewritten, but be careful to only use features of python that have already been discussed (For example don't use boolean logic until after it has been discussed in the tutorial.) [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 12:17, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

== I just love WIKI ==

I just Love WIKI  .. GREAT WORK . ...Thanks to all of You ..

== username/password exercise ==

The first solution given, just keeps on asking you your name and doesn't go to the end of the program (for me at least). The second solution works fine.

==  How to contribute to future versions? ==

I would like to help make this document available for up-to-date versions of Python (2.7 and 3.x). However, it looks like this project is generated automatically out of a LaTeX source, meaning it would not be helpful to edit it here. Is that correct? How should others contribute to newer versions?</text>

      <comment>QuiteUnusual moved page [[Talk:Rebuilding Civilization from Scratch]] to [[Talk:When It Hits the Fan/Rebuilding]] without leaving a redirect: History merge</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook is kind of a how-to for restoring civilization from scratch. 

You might read [[wikipedia:Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Flies by William Golding]], [[wikipedia:Tunnel in the Sky|Tunnel in the Sky by Robert A. Heinlein]] and possibly [[wikipedia:Lucifer's Hammer|Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle]] for ideas and/or inspiration.

Basicly, I created this book to flesh out a thought experiment of mine (what happens if you drop a plane full of people on an island with no chance of return), and decided to open it up to the public in a general sense ((re)building civilization in any remote location). -[[User:DavesTA|DavesTA]] 12:56, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

== Really rebuilding civilization ==

I believe the object of the document should be to list all steps necessary to actually rebuild civilization from scratch. All technologies necessary and the foundation technologies necessary for rebuilding civilization to the current level need to be included or referenced.

When the document is completed, a group of people should be able to be dropped into the desert or a habitable wilderness and be able to create a functioning high-tech civilization using materials at hand. 

The founding technologies of survival (how to start a fire, how to kill animals for food, how to identify edible plants, how to build a shelter, how to purify water) should form the first sections. Next should come the sections describing the next level of technology and how to create the tools to build it, from iron all the way to microchips. The sum total of all human knowledge needs to be collected into one place which is what Wikipedia is all about. There should of course be a discussion of the various forms of human government and which are more effective during each technological phase, and the process by which the next phase can be implemented. 

The text should ultimately include video files demonstrating how to perform various useful acts. 

The most important aspect would be the &quot;how to safeguard the information in this document&quot; along with various methods. Perhaps a priesthood (like the &quot;technomages&quot; in Babylon 5) should be created to protect and copy the document, and ensure that it survives any nuclear or other catastrophe that befalls the human race. 

This is a topic I have thought about for years. How could civilization quickly recover from any massive catastrophe in a short period of time without being reset back to the stone age? Think of this article as a disaster recovery document.

Methods of preserving the document should also be considered: hard copy, CD/DVD, a video player embedded in a stone monolith ala 2001 (my favorite ;-) etc.

-jjb

== Golf Course? ==

Wouldn't that imply: &quot;Oh, we're stranded and we're playing golf, then we've 'planned' to be stranded for an extended amount of time?&quot; That might raise hopelessness for some people, projects that should be done while stranded should be projects that is useful to the survival of the group (or at least something that looks useful).

Week long trips should be avoided to avoid exhaustion and wounds when medical treatments is a scarce resource, unless there is something that needs immediate investigation or there is a hope that something that is helpful could be found on the exploration. In short, blind exploration is a no-no, the exploration should be done with a clear goal (like exploration to find the other side of the island, which might be inhabited by tribes, after seeing some evidence that there might be other human civilization nearby other than the group).

*Well, technically, this is about ''rebuilding'' civilization. I'm not nit-picking, because I don't care all that much, but a golf course doesn't seem all that productive either. As for long trips, I can see your point. Would short, day-long trips be acceptable, for the purpose of exploration or finding new sources of food/water/supplies? -[[User:DavesTA|DavesTA]] 14:14, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

== Additions ==

Wow, more text here than in the book... I took the liberty of adding some stuff I know from other survival works such as the SAS survival manual concerning water and food and some stuff I know about government because I am a freaking genius.

I agree with jjb although it should suffice with the all important technologies such as science, fire, basic tools, weapons, powder, metalurgi, paper, printing press, electricity, steam engines, windmills, ships, sails/wings, farming, animal/plant breeding, a simple and very basic computer if it gets really advanced maybe.
Just enough to kick things off, though just instilling the scientific principle would go a long way by itself though.

-Realpra

== Err details anybody? ==

Jeez, did anyone think to oh i dont know... put details on how to do stuff... i mean you say &quot;light a fire&quot; and how does one do that... what you have put so far (24/6/10) is great but your talking way below the level to skip on survival details (by this i mean, your talking about starting a fire and securing water/food supplies... both valid points, but if you have to tell the reader that thats important then odds are they wont know how to start a fire... civilization starts at the most basic with governance (not needed at survival stage) farming (not needed at survival stage) defence (possibly needed at survival stage, but instinct will provide the level of this for survival)) you havent got a secure food or water supply, but lets get the internet going? no... your book reads like a survival guide... civilization should start way beyond that...

so, basically, im gonna re-write the whole book, and when someone else comes along, they are more than welcome to restore the original if they think its better [[User:The seraphim|The seraphim]] ([[User talk:The seraphim|talk]]) 17:46, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) says that this section applies to any lease of duration not exceeding 50 years where the grantor of a lease could have, based on arm's length rates at the time the lease was granted, required the tenant to pay additional amounts by way of premium. Such amounts are referred to as the '''amount foregone'''.

Subsection (2) provides that where this section applies to a lease, and the lease is later assigned for a consideration greater than any premiums for the grant of the lease (if it has not previously been assigned), or for a consideration greater than any premium for the last assignment (otherwise), the lower of the amount of the excess and the amount foregone less excesses on previous assignments, is treated as additional rent by the assignor.

Subsection (2A) says that such amounts are deemed to be received when the consideration for the assignment becomes payable and is taken into account when determining rental income in the accounting period in which it is received.

Subsection (3) allows the grantor, assignor or assignee of a lease to make a statement to the Inspector of Taxes of what corporation tax, if any, is due under this section. If the Inspector is satisfied that the statement is accurate, he shall certify it as accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Required Tools ==
* The [http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html WLA-65816 Macro Assembler]
* A SNES [[../SNES Emulators| Emulator]]
* An initialization routine and a header.

==Overview==
Pointers are an important part of a game or ROM.  In the Super Nintendo, these pointers are usually made up of various addresses organized in a specific order.  Some examples of pointer tables may include, for example, the list of locations in a ROM of a game's levels, or pointers to where certain sections of code are.  A pointer could be related to a file name in windows, C:\WINDOWS\Explorer.exe, for example, points to the windows file explorer.exe.

==Example==
Say you have a game with three levels.  You've inserted them into your ROM, but you need your game to be able to read the levels.  This could be solved by using pointers to the three levels in a table, somewhat like this:

&lt;tt&gt;
 .dl Level_1
 .dL Level_2
 .dl Level_3&lt;/tt&gt;

This table would now contain the addresses in the ROM of level 1, level 2, and level 3.  The game could then read from this table and know where to look for those level files.

==db/dw/dl==

.dl, .dw, and .db are three assembler directives for WLA-65816.  This means that they tell the assembler to do something, in this case they tell it to create a byte, two bytes, or three bytes that together make up an address.  .db creates a one-byte number, .dw a two-byte number, and .dl a three-byte number.  Note that although they are used for pointers in this tutorial, these three commands can also be used to hold absolute values.

==Accessing the table==

In 65816 ASM, tables are relatively easy to access.  If you are already familiar with A and X in the 65c816, then this next section should not be a problem for you.

&lt;tt&gt;
             ; This code will read from a table of 3-byte entries.  Load X with the entry you wish to read, and
             ; the code will read that entry for you.
 LDA Table,X ; This is the important part.  Table here refers to a label, and &quot;,X&quot;  means &quot;Plus the value of X&quot;.  So,
             ; A is loaded with the value at (The position of Table) + the value of X.
 JMP ETable  ; Jump past the table, otherwise the CPU will attempt to execute it as code, and easily crash.
 Table:      ; This allows the LDA above to find this table.
 .dw Pointer_1
 .dw Pointer_2
 .dw Pointer_3
 ETable:     ; End of the table.  This label is jumped to by JMP, making sure the 65c816 doesn't try to execute
             ; the data as code.
&lt;/tt&gt;

This code will take X, and then read from (Table + X) to get a value, and then store that to the Accumulator (A).  Note that X would need to be doubled in order to read the correct entry.  Having X be one would read from the second byte of the first entry and the first byte of the second entry, which is not the intended operation of the code.

'''Mealybug''' is the common name of insects in '''Pseudococcidae''', a family of unarmored [[../Scale Insects/]] found in moist, warm climates. They feed on plant juices of greenhouse plants, house plants and some outdoor plants.

==Description==
Mealybugs are sexually dimorphic, meaning that the sexes have distinct morphological differences. Females are nymphal, exhibit reduced morphology, and are wingless. The females do not change completely and are likely to be neotonic (exhibiting nymphal characteristics). Males are winged and do change completely during their lives.  Since mealybugs (as well as all other Hemiptera) are hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word.  I.e. there are no clear larval, pupal and adult stages, and the wings do not develop internally.  However, male mealybugs do exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to &quot;wasp-like&quot; flying adults.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Large infestations may induce leaf drop.

==Ecology==
Mealybug females feed on plant sap, normally in roots or other crevices. They attach themselves to the plant and secrete a powdery wax layer (therefore the name '''mealy'''bug) used for protection while they suck the plant juices. The males on the other hand, are short-lived as they do not feed at all as adults and only live to fertilize the females. Male citrus mealy bugs fly to the females and resemble fluffy gnats.

Some species of mealybug lay their eggs in the same waxy layer used for protection in quantities of 50&amp;ndash;100; other species are born directly from the female.

The most serious pests are mealybugs that feed on citrus; other species damage sugarcane, grapes, pineapple (Jahn et al. 2003), coffee trees, cassava, ferns, and orchids.  Mealybugs only tend to be serious pests in the presences of ants because the ants protect them from predators and parasites.  Mealybugs also infest some species of carnivorous plant such as ''[[../Sarracenia/]]'' (pitcher plants), in such cases it is difficult to eradicate them without repeated applications of insecticide such as [[../Diazinon/]]. .

Hemiptera is a large, cosmopolitan order of insects, comprising some 67,500 known species in three suborders. Traditionally these taxa were treated as two separate orders, Homoptera (Auchenorrhyncha and Sternorrhyncha) and Heteroptera; the former name is now obsolete (the group was paraphyletic), and the latter name is falling into disuse, often replaced by Prosorrhyncha. Referring latest investigations the name Auchenorrhyncha should also be replaced by Archeorrhyncha and Clyeporrhyncha.
Members of the &quot;Heteroptera&quot; are typically called true bugs, and this name sometimes is used for members of &quot;Hemiptera&quot; as a whole. The name heteroptera comes from their forewings having both membranous and hard portions. It is also essentially this same feature which gives the order its name, hemiptera, coming from the Greek for half-wing.
Members of the Hemiptera are distinguished from all other insects by both adults and nymphs having a proboscis that includes a salivary channel as well as a food channel. The proboscis is usually specialized to suck the juices from various parts of plants, including seeds, although some species are predatory (on arthropods and sometimes small animals), and a few are adapted to suck blood from mammals. In addition, the space between the overlapping wings in the members of this order forms a triangular shape near the head which is commonly used to identify a true bug.

Suborder Prosorrhyncha includes 25,000 known species in over 60 families.

Suborder Archaeorrhyncha:Some authors prefer this name to refer to the Fulgoromorpha, or Planthoppers.

Suborder [Clypeorrhyncha is sometimes used to refer to the Cicadomorpha.

Suborder Sternorrhyncha contains 12,500 species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parallel Plate Flow: Realistic IC==

===The Steady State===

The initial velocity profile chosen in the last problem agreed with intuition but honestly came out of thin air. A more realistic development follows.

The problem stated that (to come up with an IC) the fluid was under a pressure difference for some time, so that the flow became steady aka flowing steadily. &quot;Steady&quot; is another way of saying &quot;not changing with time&quot;, and &quot;not changing with time&quot; is another way of saying that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into the PDE from the previous section:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho} = \frac{d^2 u}{d y^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the PDE became an ODE with variables separated and thus we can integrate.

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \frac{P_x}{\nu \rho} \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho}y^2 + C_1 y + C_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The no slip condition results in the following BCs: &lt;math&gt;u = 0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;. We can plug the BC values into the integrated ODE and resolve the Cs.

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} \cdot 0^2 + C_1 \cdot 0 + C_0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C_0 = 0 \qquad \mbox{(Bottom plate BC: u = 0, y = 0)}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} \cdot 1^2 + C_1 \cdot 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C_1 = -\frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho} \qquad \mbox{(Top plate BC: u = 0, y = 1)}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;!--math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math--&gt;

Inserting the Cs and and simplifying yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
u = \frac{P_x}{2 \nu \rho}(y^2 - y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

For the sake of example, take &lt;math&gt;P_x/(2 \nu \rho) = -4&lt;/math&gt; (recall that a negative pressure gradient causes left to right flow). Also note that this is a constant gradient or slope. This gives a parabola which starts at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, increases to a maximum of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;y = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and returns to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This parabola looks pretty much identical to the sinusoid previously used (you must zoom in to see a difference). However, even more so on the narrow domain of interest, the two are very different functions (look at their taylor expansions, for example). Using the parabola instead of the sine function results in a much more involved solution.

So this derives the steady state flow, which we will use as an improved, realistic IC. Recall that the problem is about a fluid that's initially in motion that is coming to a stop due to the absence of a driving force. The IBVP (Initial Boundary Value Problem) is now subtly different:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \qquad \mbox{(PDE)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = 4 y - 4 y^2 \qquad \mbox{(IC)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(BCs)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

===Separation===

Since the only difference from the problem in the last section is the IC, the variables may be separated and the BCs applied with no difference, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} B \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

But now we're stuck (after applying the BCs)! Applying the IC makes the &lt;math&gt;e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; term go away as t = 0, which is the IC. However, then the IC function can't be made to match:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = 4 y - 4 y^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B \sin(n \pi y) = 4 y - 4 y^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

What went wrong? It was the assumption that &lt;math&gt;u(y, t) = Y(y)T(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that the IC couldn't be fulfilled means that the assumption was wrong. It should be apparent now why the IC was chosen to be &lt;math&gt;\sin(\pi y)&lt;/math&gt; in the previous section.

We can proceed however, thanks to the linearity of the problem. Another detour is necessary, it gets long.

Linearity (the superposition principle specifically) says that if &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to the BVP (not the whole IBVP, only the BVP,  Boundary Value Problem, the BCs applied) and so is another &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt;, then a '''linear combination''', &lt;math&gt;C_1 u_1 + C_2 u_2&lt;/math&gt;, is also a solution.

Let's take a step back and suppose that the IC was 

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = \sin(\pi y) + 1/5 \sin(3 \pi y).
&lt;/math&gt; 

This is no longer a realistic flow problem but it contains the first two terms of what is called a '''Fourier sine expansion''', see these [http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Fall07/sines.pdf examples of Fourier sine expansions]. We are going to generalize this below.  Let's now use this expression and equate it to the half way solution (BCs applied) with &lt;math&gt;e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; being eliminated as t = 0:

&lt;!--math&gt;u(y, 0) = \sin(\pi y) + \frac{1}{5} \sin(3 \pi y)\,&lt;/math--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
B \sin(n \pi y) = \sin(\pi y) + \frac{1}{5} \sin(3 \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

And it still can't match. However, observe that the individual terms in the IC can. We simply set the constants to values making both sides match:

:&lt;math&gt;
B_1 \sin(n_1 \pi y) = \sin(\pi y) \Rightarrow n_1 = 1 \ \mbox{and} \ B_1 = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B_3 \sin(n_3 \pi y) = \frac{1}{5} \sin(3 \pi y)  \Rightarrow n_3 = 3 \ \mbox{and} \ B_3 = \frac{1}{5}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note the subscripts are used to identify each term: they reflect the integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; from the separation constant. Solutions may be obtained for each individual term of the IC, identified with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
u_1(y, t) = e^{-(1 \pi)^2 \nu t} 1 \sin(1 \pi y) = e^{-\pi^2 \nu t} \sin(\pi y) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n = 1 \ \mbox{and} \ B = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_3(y, t) = e^{-(3 \pi)^2 \nu t} \frac{1}{5} \sin(3 \pi y) = e^{-9 \pi^2 \nu t} \frac{1}{5} \sin(3 \pi y)\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n = 3 \ \mbox{and} \ B = \frac{1}{5}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Linearity states that the sum of these two solutions is also a solution to the BVP (no need for new constants):

:&lt;math&gt;
u_{1 + 3}(y, t) = e^{-\pi^2 \nu t} \sin(\pi y) + \frac{1}{5} e^{-9 \pi^2 \nu t} \sin(3 \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So we added the solutions and got a new solution... what is this good for? Try setting &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
u_{1 + 3}(y, 0) = e^{-\pi^2 \nu \cdot 0} \sin(\pi y) + \frac{1}{5} e^{-9 \pi^2 \nu \cdot 0} \sin(3 \pi y) =
\sin(\pi y) + \frac{1}{5} \sin(3 \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Each component solution satisfies the BVP, '''and the sum of these just happened to satisfy our surrogate IC'''. The IBVP with IC &lt;math&gt;u(y, 0) = \sin(\pi y) + 1/5 \sin(3 \pi y)&lt;/math&gt; is now solved. It would work the same way for '''any''' linear combination of sine functions whose half frequencies are &lt;math&gt;n \pi&lt;/math&gt;. &quot;Linear combination&quot; means a sum of terms, each multiplied by a constant. The sum is assumed to converge and be term by term differentiable. 

Let's do what we just did in a more generalized fashion. First, we make our IC a linear combination of sines (with &lt;math&gt;e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; eliminated as t = 0), in fact, infinitely many of them. But each successive term has to 'converge', it can't stray wildly all over the place.

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) =  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi y) \qquad \mbox{(IC: an arbitrary linear combination of sines)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Second, find the n and B for each term assuming t = 0 (the IC), then plug them back into each term making no assumptions about t, leaving t as is.

:&lt;math&gt;
u_n(y, t) = e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} B_n \sin(n \pi y) \qquad \mbox{(solution of} \ n^{th} \ \mbox{term)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Third, sum up all the terms with their individual n and Bs.

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} u_n(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} B_n \sin(n \pi y) \qquad \mbox{(sum of solutions)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Fourth, plug t = 0 into the sum of terms and recover the IC from the first step.

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu \cdot 0} B_n \sin(n \pi y) = 
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi y) \qquad \mbox{(IC recovered)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

So we went full circle on this example but found the n and Bs because we were able to equate/satisfy each term with the IC. Now we can solve the problem if the IC is a linear combination of sine functions. But the IC for this problem isn't such a sum, it's just a stupid parabola. Or is it?

===Series Construction===

In the 19th century, a man named Joseph Fourier took a break from helping Napoleon take over the world to ask an important question while studying this same BVP (concerning heat flow): can a function be expressed as a sum of sinusoids, similar to a taylor series? The short answer is yes, if a few reasonable conditions apply as we have already indicated. The long answer follows, and this section is a longer answer.

A function meeting certain criteria may indeed be expanded into a sum of sines, cosines, or both. In our case, all that is needed to accomplish this expansion is to find the coefficients &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;. A little trick involving an integral makes this possible.

The sine function has a very important property called orthogonality. There are many flavors of this, which will be served in the next chapter. Relevant to this problem is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \sin(n \pi y)\, dy = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; m = n \\
0, &amp; m \ne n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

A quick hint may help. Orthogonality literally means two lines at a right angle to each other. These lines could be vectors, each with its own tuple of coordinates.  If those two vectors are at a right angle to each other, multiplying and summing their coordinate tuples always yields zero (in Euclidean space). The method of multiplying and summing is also used to determine whether two functions are orthogonal. Using this definition, our multiplied and integrated functions above are orthogonal most of the time, but not always.

Let's call the IC &lt;math&gt;\phi(y)&lt;/math&gt; to generalize it. We equate the IC with its expansion, meaning the linear combination of sines, and then apply some craftiness. And remember that our goal is to reproduce a parabolic function from linearly combined sines:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi y) = \phi(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
2 \sin(m \pi y) \cdot \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi y) = 2 \sin(m \pi y) \cdot \phi(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \cdot 2 \sin(m \pi y) \sin(n \pi y) = 2 \sin(m \pi y) \phi(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\int_{0}^{1} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \cdot 2 \sin(m \pi y) \sin(n \pi y) dy = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \sin(n \pi y) dy = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
B_m = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy\,
&lt;/math&gt;

In the last step, all of the terms in the sum became &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; except for the &lt;math&gt;m^{th}&lt;/math&gt; term where &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt;, the only case where we get &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; for the otherwise orthogonal sine functions. This isolates and explicitly defines &lt;math&gt;B_m&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; as m = n. The expansion for &lt;math&gt;\phi(y)&lt;/math&gt; is then:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\phi(y) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} ( \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy ) \cdot \sin(m \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Or equivalently:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\phi(y) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} B_m \sin(m \pi y) \qquad ; \ B_m = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Many important details have been left out for later in a devoted chapter; one noteworthy detail is that this expansion is only approximating the parabola (very superficially) on the interval &lt;math&gt;0 \leq y \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, not say from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

This expansion may finally be combined with the sum of sines solution to the BVP developed previously. Note that the last equation looks very similar to &lt;math&gt;u(y, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Following from this:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) =  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) =  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy \cdot \sin(n \pi y) \qquad \,
&lt;/math&gt;

So the expansion will satisfy the IC given as &lt;math&gt;\phi(y)&lt;/math&gt; (surprised?). The full solution for the problem with arbitrary IC is then:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} B_n \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi y) \phi(y)\ dy \cdot \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

In this problem specifically, the IC is &lt;math&gt;\phi(y) = 4 y - 4 y^2&lt;/math&gt;, so:

:&lt;math&gt;
B_n = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi y) (4 y - 4 y^2) dy = \frac{8}{n^3 \pi^3} (2 - 2 \cos(n \pi) - n \pi \sin(n \pi))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Sines and cosines appear from the integration dependent only on &lt;math&gt;n \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, these can be made more aesthetic.

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin(n \pi) = 0 \qquad ; \ n \mbox{ is an integer.}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos(n \pi) = (-1)^n \qquad ; \ n \mbox{ is an integer.}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\qquad \Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B_n = \frac{16 - 16 (-1)^n}{n^3 \pi^3}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for even &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Putting everything together finally completes the solution to the IBVP:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} \frac{16 - 16 (-1)^n}{n^3 \pi^3} \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

There are many interesting things to observe. To begin with, &lt;math&gt;u(y, t)&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' a product of a function of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and a function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Such a solution was assumed in the beginning, proved to be wrong, but eventually happened to yield a solution anyway thanks to linearity and what is called a '''Fourier sine expansion'''.

A careful look at the procedure reveals something that may be disturbing: this lengthy solution is '''strictly valid for the given BCs'''. Thanks to the definition of &lt;math&gt;\phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is generic as far as the IC is concerned (the IC doesn't even need to match the BCs), however a slight change in either BC would mandate starting over almost from the beginning.

The parabolic IC, which looks very similar to the sine function used in the previous section, is wholly to blame (or thank once you understand the beauty of a Fourier series!) for the infinite sum. It is interesting to approximate the first several numeric values of the sequence &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
B_1 &amp;\approx 1.03205\\
B_3 &amp;\approx 0.03822\\
B_5 &amp;\approx 0.00826\\
B_7 &amp;\approx 0.00301\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that the even terms are all &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The first term by far dominates, this makes sense since the first term already looks very, very similar to the parabola. Recall that &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; appears in an exponential, making the higher terms even smaller for time not too close to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Details and Applications of Fourier Series==

In the study of PDEs (and much elsewhere), a Fourier series (or more generally, trigonometric expansion) often needs to be constructed.

===Preliminaries===

Suppose that a function ''f''(''x'') may be expressed in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) + B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown (not too difficult, but beyond this text) that the above expansion will converge to ''f''(''x''), except at discontinuities, if the following conditions hold:

:*''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'' + 2''L''), i.e. ''' ''f''(''x'') has period 2''L'' '''.
:*''f''(''x''), ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x''), and ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x'') are piecewise continuous on the interval -''L'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''L''.
:*The pieces that make up ''f''(''x''), ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x''), and ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''x'') are continuous over closed subintervals.

The first requirement is most significant; the last two requirements can, to an extent, be partly eased off in most cases without any trouble. An interesting thing happens at discontinuities. Suppose that ''f''(''x'') is discontinuous at ''x'' = ''a''; the expansion will converge to the following value:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left(\lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x) + \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x)\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

So the expansion converges to the average of the values to the left and the right of the discontinuity. This, and the fact that it converges in the first place, is very convenient. The Fourier series looks unfriendly but it's honestly working for you.

The information needed to express ''f''(''x'') as a Fourier series are the sequences ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. This is done using orthogonality, which for the sinusoids may be derived easily using a few identities. The following are some useful orthogonality relations, with m and n restricted to integers:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{L} \frac{2}{L} \sin\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) dx = \delta_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{L} \frac{2}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) dx = \delta_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) dx = \delta_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) dx = \delta_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \sin\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;

δ&lt;sub&gt;''m,n''&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Kronecker delta, defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{m,n} = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; m = n \\
0, &amp; m \ne n
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The Kronecker delta may be thought of as a discrete version of the Dirac delta &quot;function&quot;. Relevant to this topic is its '''sifting property''':

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} A_n \delta_{m,n} = A_m\,&lt;/math&gt;


===Derivation of the Fourier Series===

We're now ready to find ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) + B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cdot f(x) =
\frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cdot \left(\frac{A_0}{2} +
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

\frac{B_n}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right) dx
&lt;/math&gt;

|&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

\frac{B_n}{L} \int_{-L}^{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) dx \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx =
\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{A_0}{2 L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) dx +
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \delta_{m,n} +
\frac{B_n}{L} \cdot 0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is supposed to hold for an arbitrary integer ''m''. If ''m'' = 0, note that the sum doesn't allow ''n'' = 0 and so the sum would be zero since in no case does ''m'' = ''n''. This leads to:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{0 \cdot \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx =
\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{A_0}{2 L} \cos\left(\frac{0 \cdot \pi}{L} x\right) dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} f(x) dx = A_0 \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{dx}{2 L}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} f(x) dx = A_0&lt;/math&gt;

This secures ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Now suppose that ''m'' &gt; 0. Since ''m'' and ''n'' are now in the same domain, the Kronecker delta will do its sifting:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx =
\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{A_0}{2 L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) dx +
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \delta_{m,n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx =
\frac{A_0 \sin(m \pi)}{m \pi} + A_m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx = 0 + A_m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

In the second to the last step, sin(''m''π) = 0 for integer ''m''. In the last step, ''m'' was replaced with ''n''. This defines ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' &gt; 0. For the case ''n'' = 0,

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{0 \cdot \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

Which happens to match the previous development (now you know why it's ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/2 and not just ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). So the sequence ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is now completely defined for any value of ''n'' of interest:

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

To get ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, nearly the same routine is used.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) + B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cdot f(x) =
\frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{m \pi}{L} x\right) \cdot \left(\frac{A_0}{2} +
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_n = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier series expansion of ''f''(''x'') is now complete. To have it all in one place:

[[Image:PDEBook0009.jpg|frame|f(x): a square wave.]]

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) + B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_n = \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

It's finally time for an example. Let's derive the Fourier series representation of a square wave, pictured at the right:

This &quot;wave&quot; may be quantified as ''f''(''x''):

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; -1 &lt; x &lt; 0 \\
-1, &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\
f(x + 2)
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

''f''(''x'') has period 2. Since 2''L'' = ''P'', ''L'' = 1. Now, finding the Fourier coefficients:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A_n\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-1}^{1} \cos(n \pi x) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-1}^{0} \cos(n \pi x) (-1) dx + \int_{0}^{1} \cos(n \pi x) (1) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= -\frac{\sin(n \pi)}{n \pi} + \frac{\sin(n \pi)}{n \pi}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;B_n\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-1}^{1} \sin(n \pi x) f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-1}^{0} \sin(n \pi x) (-1) dx + \int_{0}^{1} \sin(n \pi x) (1) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left(\frac{1}{n \pi} - \frac{\cos(n \pi)}{n \pi}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n \pi} - \frac{\cos(n \pi)}{n \pi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{2}{n \pi}\left(1 - \cos(n \pi)\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{2}{n \pi}\left(1 - (-1)^n\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

[[Image:PDEBook0008.jpg|frame|Successive approximations (partial sums) of f(x).]]

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{n \pi}\left(1 - (-1)^n\right) \sin(n \pi x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{4 \sin((2n - 1) \pi x)}{(2n - 1) \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

In the last bit we used the fact that all of the even terms happened to be absent, and the odd numbers are given by 2''n'' - 1 for integer ''n''. The sum will indeed converge to the square wave, except at the discontinuities where it'll converge to zero (the average of 1 and -1).

Graphs of partial sums are shown at right. Note that this particular expansion doesn't converge too quickly, and that as an approximation of the square wave it's poorest near the discontinuities.

There's another interesting thing to note: all of the cosine terms are absent. It's no coincidence, and this may be a good time to introduce the Fourier sine and cosine expansions for, respectively, odd and even functions.


===Periodic Extension and Expansions for Even and Odd functions===

Two important expansions may be derived from the Fourier expansion: the Fourier sine series and the Fourier cosine series, the first one was used in the previous section. Before diving in, we must talk about even and odd functions.

Suppose that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;even&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is an even function and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;odd&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is an odd function. That is:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{even}(-x) = f_\text{even}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{odd}(-x) = -f_\text{odd}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Some interesting identities hold for such functions. Relevant ones include:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{even}(x) \cdot f_\text{even}(x) = \mbox{an even function}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{odd}(x) \cdot f_\text{odd}(x) = \mbox{an even function}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{even}(x) \cdot f_\text{odd}(x) = \mbox{an odd function}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-a}^{a} f_\text{even}(x) dx = 2 \int_{0}^{a} f_\text{even}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-a}^{a} f_\text{odd}(x) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is all very relevant to Fourier series. Suppose that an even function is expanded. Recall that sine is odd and cosine is even. Then:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A_n\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{even}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; (whole integrand is even)
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{0}^{L} \frac{2}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{even}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;B_n\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{even}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; (whole integrand is odd)
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So the '''Fourier cosine series''' (note that all sine terms disappear) is just the Fourier series for an even function, given as:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{even}(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(A_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \int_{0}^{L} \frac{2}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_{even}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

A Fourier expansion may be similarly built for an odd function:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A_n\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{odd}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; (whole integrand is odd)
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;B_n\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{-L}^{L} \frac{1}{L} \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{odd}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; (whole integrand is even)
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{0}^{L} \frac{2}{L} \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{odd}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
|}

And the '''Fourier sine series''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{odd}(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(B_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_n = \int_{0}^{L} \frac{2}{L} \cos\left(\frac{n \pi}{L} x\right) f_\text{odd}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, '''the periodic extension''' may be considered. In the previous chapter, the problem mandated a sine expansion of a parabola. A parabola is by no means a periodic function, and yet a Fourier sine expansion was done on it. What actually happened was that the function was expanded as expected within its domain of interest: the interval 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1. Inside this interval, the expansion truly is a parabola. Outside this interval, the expansion is periodic, and as a whole is odd (just like the sine functions it's built on).

The parabola could've been expanded just as well using cosines (resulting in an even expansion) or a full Fourier expansion on, say, -1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1.

Note that we weren't able to pick which expansion to use, however. While the parabola could be expanded any way we want on any interval we want, only the sine expansion on 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 would solve the problem. The ODE and BCs together picked the expansion and the interval. In fact, before the expansion was even constructed we had:

:&lt;math&gt;u(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} u_n(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} A_n \sin(n \pi y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Which is a Fourier sine series only at ''t'' = 0. That the IC was defined at ''t'' = 0 allowed the expansion. For ''t'' &gt; 0, the solution has ''nothing'' in common with a Fourier series.

What's trying to be emphasized is flexibility. Knowledge of Fourier series makes it much easier to solve problems. In the parallel plate problem, knowing what a Fourier sine series is ''motivates'' the construction of the sum of ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the end it's the problem that dictates what needs to be done. For the separable IBVPs, expansions will be a recurring &lt;s&gt;nightmare&lt;/s&gt; theme and it is most important to be familiar and comfortable with orthogonality and its application to making sense out of infinite sums. Many functions have orthogonality properties, including Bessel functions, Legendre polynomials, and others.

The keyword is orthogonality. If an orthogonality relation exists for a given situation, then a series solution is easily possible. As an example, the diffusion equation used in the previous chapter can, with sufficiently ugly BCs, require a trigonometric series solution that is not a Fourier series (non-integer, not evenly spaced frequencies of the sinusoids). Sturm-Liouville theory rescues us in such cases, providing the right orthogonality relation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Birth of Protostars'''

[[Image:Protostar HH-34.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Protostar Herbig-Haro 34]]
Protostars are formed in star nurseries called nebulas, while nebulas are areas of higher dust and gas densities relative to the surrounding interstellar space.
&lt;ref name = &quot;three&quot;&gt; Think Quest. Life cycle of stars., 2009, from http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/star/star.html. &lt;/ref&gt;
Nebulas are made up of mostly hydrogen and a little helium, although more massive elements and even molecules are also ubiquitous. These more massive elements and molecules are from previous stars that have died and scattered some of their remnants into the nebula. These clouds of gas and dust can span hundreds of [[w:Light-year|light years]] across and can be formed when enough gas and dust come together to become gravitationally bound or can be compressed by the explosion of stars known as [[supernova]] that also add their gases to the cosmos as [[w:Planetary nebula|planetary nebulas]].
&lt;ref name = &quot;one&quot;&gt; Bill Arnett. (1997). Types of nebulae., 2009, from http://astro.nineplanets.org/twn/types.html. &lt;/ref&gt;
If the nebula has a high density, [[w:Perturbation (astronomy)|distubances]] of gas and dust may cause gravitational contraction to become significant. If gravity becomes significant enough to pull in the dust and gas from the cloud then the material trapped by gravity will collapse into itself, this is how a protostar is formed.
&lt;ref name = &quot;two&quot;&gt;Linda Hermans-Killam. The infrared universe., 2009, from http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/sform.html &lt;/ref&gt;
When gravity takes over and causes the material of the nebula to collapse in on itself this forms a sort of ball that will start to rotate. This rotation will cause gas and dust outside of the ball to start to rotate towards the ball, similar to when the drain of a tub is opened and all the rubber ducks at the other side of the tub start to move towards the drain getting caught in the whirlpool and finally sucked down the drain. This is how a protostar increases its mass; a protostar will start out as the small ball that begins to rotate (this can be thought of as the drain) as this ball rotates it will create an accretion disk (the whirlpool around the drain) this disk will suck dust and gas from the surrounding nebula and transfer it to the protostar. How fast this process happens can help determine the outcome of the new star. This process will stop when the protostar starts nuclear fusion of hydrogen.
During the formation of the protostar and the accretion process the protostar becomes hotter and denser. The protostar becomes denser because the [[w:accretion disk|accretion disk]] is adding material to the star which is causing the gravity of the protostar to increase, thereby “pushing” the gas and dust from the accretion disk closer and closer towards the center of the protostar. This effect is correlated to the temperature of the protostar and as the density of the star increases so does the temperature. When the temperature at the center of the protostar reaches about 10^6 Celsius it will start to fuse hydrogen. &lt;ref name = &quot;three&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is the start of the proton proton fusion chain that is the main fusion that supports the star and signifies the birth of a new star. The burning of hydrogen produces a solar wave that will blow the accretion disk away from the star allowing no new material to be added beyond that time.&lt;ref name = &quot;two&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;      
                         
'''Simple Model of Protostar Formation'''

The above is a description of the formation of new stars. We will now look at the early physics used to describe protostar creation. The first person to study protostars was Sir James Jeans; he studied globules and molecular clouds where protostar formation has been observed. [[w:James Hopwood Jeans|Sir Jeans]] studied what conditions are needed in a molecular cloud or globule to induce collapse of material to form a protostar. During Jeans life time (1877-1946) the advanced computational powers of computers were not available so he had to simplify his calculations. The major simplifications Jeans made before he began his analysis was to assume that the effects of rotation, turbulence, and magnetic fields can be neglected. These assumptions are not true but Jeans calculations give a good starting point.

Jeans started with the [[w:Virial theorem|Virial Theorem]],
2K+U=0 equation 1
 
This theorem states that the total [[w:Potential energy|potential]] energy (U) of gravity is twice the absolute value of the total kinetic energy (K) of the system and when the two add to zero then the system is in equilibrium and the cloud will neither collapse nor dissipate. If the kinetic energy of the cloud is more than half of the potential energy then the cloud will expand and dissipate. If the kinetic energy is less than half its potential energy then the cloud will collapse into a protostar. We can write the potential energy as,
	
U= -(3/5)(GM2/R) equation 2

And kinetic energy can be written as,
	
K= (3MkT)/(μm&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) equation 3

where,

	μ= mean molecular weight

	T= temperature

	M= mass of cloud

	m&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;= is mass of hydrogen

	R= the radius of the cloud

	G and k= gravitational constant and Boltzmann’s constant

rewriting R as,

	R= [(3M)/(4πρ)]&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; equation 4

ρ= the initial mass density of the cloud is assumed to be constant throughout the cloud 

Sir Jeans then substituted the R equation into the Potential energy equation and then put both energy equations into the virial theorem and solving for the mass he found the minimum mass required for a cloud to collapse. This is called the Jeans mass and he found the minimum radius by placing the equation for R into the Jeans mass equation and solving this is called the Jeans length. If the cloud has a mass or radius larger than the values found by these equations then the cloud will collapse.

	M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;= [(5kT)/(Gμm&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;)]3/2[3/(4πρ)]1/2 equation 5

	R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;= [(15kT)/(4πGμm&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;ρ)]1/2 equation 6

This was the first theoretical attempt to model the formation of a protostar. These equations give us good approximations of which molecular clouds will be able to form protostars. But observations of forming protostars and of molecular clouds show that the equations that Sir Jeans developed are not always accurate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Four&quot;&gt; Ostlie, D. A., &amp; Carroll, B. W. (2007). In Black A. R. S. (Ed.), An introduction to modern stellar astrophysics (2nd ed.)San Francisco: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;


'''Constraining factors to Sir James Jeans Model'''

	The preceding section explained Sir Jeans’s model for the formation of protostars from the surrounding molecular clouds. Observations of molecular clouds and protostars have shown that this model is flawed. The model predicts that the entire cloud will collapse into the forming protostar; also the model predicts that if the mass or radius is higher than the Jeans mass or Jeans radius, than the cloud will collapse and form protostars. Astronomers have found molecular clouds and globules that do not follow this model very well. Observations have been made on globules and molecular clouds that have many stars forming in them and on others that are above the Jeans mass or Jeans radius and do not have a lot of protostar activity in them. Many astronomers have tried to determine what is wrong with the model and have found reasons to explain the observations made that contradict the model. One reason found was that the simplifications made by Sir Jeans could not be left out and that by including some of these previously excluded variables astronomers found that the model fit more closely to what they observed. Some of the variables that were excluded in Jeans model were cloud rotation, the presence of a magnetic field, temperature changes, mass density changes, external gas pressure, and fragmentation.&lt;ref name = &quot;Four&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Example'''

       
Let us look at a diffused hydrogen cloud. Assume that the temperature is 50K and that the cloud is completely hydrogen with a density of 8.4x10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and take µ to be 1. What then is the minimum mass necessary to cause the cloud to collapse? Using equation 5 from above with the given values we find that the mass necessary for collapse is roughly 1500 solar masses. The normal diffused hydrogen cloud ranges in mass from 1-100 solar masses therefore such clouds are stable since the Jeans Mass calculated above is greater than the mass of such clouds.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;
      
Now let’s look at what happens in the center of a dense giant molecular cloud (GMC). The typical temperatures for this cloud is 10K and we will take the density to be 3x10^-17kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and take µ to be 2. Again using equation 5 we find that the Jeans Mass is now only 8 solar masses. GMCs are approximately 10 solar masses. We can now reason that GMC cores are unstable. Consequently they will form stars because the Jeans Mass is lower than the mass of the cloud. This has been proven by astronomers through observations of GMCs in our night sky.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Change of Variables==

As with ODEs, a PDE (or more accurately, the IBVP as a whole) may be made more amenable with the help of some kind of modification of variables. So far, we've dealt only with boundary conditions that specify the value of ''u'', which represented fluid velocity, as zero at the boundaries. Though fluid mechanics can get more complicated than that (understatement of the millennium), let's look at heat transfer now for the sake of variety.

As hinted previously, the one dimensional diffusion equation can also describe heat flow in one dimension. Think of how heat could flow ''in one dimension'': one possibility is a rod that's completely laterally insulated, so that the heat will flow only along the rod and not across it (be aware, though, it is possible to consider heat loss/gain along the rod without going two dimensional).

If this rod has finite length, heat could flow in and out of the uninsulated ends. A 1D rod can have at most two ends (it can also have one or zero: the rod could be modeled as &quot;very long&quot;), and the boundary conditions could specify what happens at these ends. For example, the temperature could be specified at a boundary, or maybe the flow of heat, or maybe some combination of the two.

The equation for heat flow is usually given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the same as the equation for parallel plate flow, only with ν replaced with α and ''y'' replaced with ''x''.

===Fixed Temperatures at Boundaries===

Let's consider a rod of length 1, with temperatures specified (fixed) at the boundaries. The IBVP is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 0) = \varphi(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = u_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = u_1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

φ(''x'') is the temperature at ''t'' = 0. Look at what the BCs say: ''For all time'', the temperature at ''x'' = 0 is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and at ''x'' = 1 is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that this could be just as well a parallel plate problem: ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would represent wall velocities.

The PDE is easily separable, in basically the same way as in previous chapters:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(u(x, t)) = \alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(u(x, t))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(X(x)T(t)) = \alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(X(x)T(t))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
X(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(T(t)) = \alpha T(t) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(X(x))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
X(x) T'(t) = \alpha T(t) X''(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\alpha T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\alpha T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\alpha T(t)} = -k^2 \Rightarrow T'(t) = -k^2 \alpha T(t) \Rightarrow T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 \alpha t}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 \Rightarrow X''(x) = -k^2 X(x) \Rightarrow X(x) = C_2 \cos(k x) + C_3 \sin(k x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 \alpha t} (C_2 \cos(k x) + C_3 \sin(k x))
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t) = e^{-k^2 \alpha t} (A \cos(k x) + B \sin(k x))
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, substitute the BCs:

:&lt;math&gt;
u_0 = u(0, t)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_0 = e^{-k^2 \alpha t} (A \cos(k \cdot  0) + B \sin(k \cdot  0))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_0 = A e^{-k^2 \alpha t}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_1 = u(1, t)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_1 = e^{-k^2 \alpha t} (A \cos(k \cdot 1) + B \sin(k \cdot 1))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_1 = e^{-k^2 \alpha t} (A \cos(k) + B \sin(k))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

We can't proceed. Among other things, the presence of ''t'' in the exponential factor (previously divided out) prevents anything from coming out of this.

This is another example of the fact that the assumption that ''u''(''x'', ''t'') = ''X''(''x'')''T''(''t'') was wrong. The only thing that prevents us from getting a solution would be the non-zero BCs. This is where changing variables will help: a new variable ''v''(''x'', ''t'') will be defined in terms of ''u'' which will be separable.

Think of how ''v''(''x'', ''t'') could be defined to make its BCs zero (&quot;homogeneous&quot;). One way would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t) = v(x, t) + h(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This form is inspired from the appearance of the BCs, and it can be readily seen:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = u_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = u_1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(0, t) + h(0) = u_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(1, t) + h(1) = u_1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

If ''h''(0) = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''(1) = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''(''x'', ''t'') would indeed have zero BCs. Pretty much any choice of h(x) satisfying these conditions would do it, but only one is the best choice. Making the substitution into the PDE:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(u(x, t)) = \alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(u(x, t))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(v(x, t) + h(x)) = \alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(v(x, t) + h(x))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So now the PDE has been messed up by the new term involving ''h''. This will thwart separation...

...unless that last term happens to be zero. Rather then hoping it's zero, we can demand it (the best choice hinted above), and put the other requirements on ''h''(''x'') next to that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2 h}{d x^2} = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h(0) = u_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h(1) = u_1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the partial derivative became an ordinary derivative since ''h'' is a function of ''x'' only. The above constitutes a pretty simple boundary value problem, with unique solution:

:&lt;math&gt;
h(x) = (u_1 - u_0) x + u_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

It's just a straight line. Note that this is what would arise if the steady state (time independent) problem were solved for ''u''(''x''). In other words, ''h'' could've been pulled out of one's ass readily just looking at the physics of the situation.

The problem now reduces to finding ''v''(''x'', ''t''). The IBVP for this would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(x, 0) = \varphi(x) - h(x) = \varphi(x) - ((u_1 - u_0) x + u_0)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(1, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the IC changed under the transformation. The solution to this IBVP was found in a past chapter through separation of variables and superposition to be:

:&lt;math&gt;
v(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \alpha t} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi x) (\varphi(x) - ((u_1 - u_0) x + u_0)) \ dx \cdot \sin(n \pi x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

''u''(''x'', ''t'') may now be found simply by adding h(x), according to how the variable change was defined:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t) = v(x, t) + h(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \alpha t} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi x) (\varphi(x) - h(x)) \ dx \cdot \sin(n \pi x) + (u_1 - u_0) x + u_0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This solution looks like the sum of a steady state portion (that's ''h''(''x'')) and a transient portion (that's ''v''(''x'')):

[[Image:PDEBook0010.jpg|1000px|center|frame|Visualization of the change of variables.]]

===Time Varying Temperatures at Boundaries===

Note that this wouldn't work so nicely with non-constant BCs. For example, if the IBVP were:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 0) = \varphi(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = u_0(t)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = u_1(t)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, transforming it would require ''h'' = ''h''(''x'', ''t''). Reusing ''u''(''x'', ''t'') = ''v''(''x'', ''t'') + ''h''(''x'', ''t'') introduced previously would eventually lead to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(x, 0) = \varphi(x) - h(x, 0)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(1, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Where, to simplify the PDE above:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h(x, 0) = \mbox{anything}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h(0, t) = u_0(t)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h(1, t) = u_1(t)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Which doesn't really make anything simpler, despite freedom in the choice of IC.

But this isn't completely useless. Note that the PDE for h was '''chosen''' to simplify the PDE for ''v''(''x'', ''t'') (would lead to the terms involving ''h'' to cancel out), which may lead to the question: Was this necessary?

The answer is no. If that were the case, the PDE we '''picked''' for ''h'' would not be satisfied, and that would result in extra terms in the PDE for ''v''(''x'', ''t''). The no-longer-separable IBVP for ''v''(''x'', ''t'') could, however, be solved via an '''eigenfunction expansion''', whose full story will be told later. It's worth noting though, that an eigenfunction expansion would require homogenous BCs, so the transformation was necessary.

So this problem has to be put aside without any conclusion for now. I told you that BCs can mess everything up.

===Pressure Driven Transient Parallel Plate Flow===

Now back to fluid mechanics. Previously, we dealt with flow that was initially moving but slowing down because of resistance and the absence of a driving force. Maybe, it'd be more interesting if we had a fluid initially at rest (ie, zero IC) but set into motion by some constant pressure difference. The IBVP for such a case would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This PDE with the pressure term was described previously. That pressure term is what drives the flow; it is assumed constant.

The intent of the change of variables would be to remove the pressure term from the PDE (which prevents separation) while keeping the BCs homogeneous.

One path to take would be to add something to ''u''(''x'', ''t''), either a function of ''t'' or a function of ''y'', so that differentiation would leave behind a constant that could cancel the pressure term out. Adding a function of ''t'' would be very unfavorable since it'd result in time dependent BCs, so let's try a function of ''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = v(y, t) + f(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the PDE:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(v(y, t) + f(y)) =
\nu \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}(v(y, t) + f(y)) - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This procedure will simplify the PDE and preserve the BCs only if the following conditions hold:

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \nu \frac{d^2 f}{d y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f(0) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f(1) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The first condition, an ODE, is required to simplify the PDE for ''v''(''y'', ''t''), it will result in cancellation of the last two terms. The other two conditions are chosen to preserve the homogeneous BCs of the problem (note that if the BCs of ''u''(''y'', ''t'') weren't homogeneous, the BCs on ''f''(''y'') would need to be picked to amend that).

The solution to the BVP above is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(y) = \frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} (y^2 - y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So ''f''(''y'') was successfully determined. Note that this function is symmetric about ''y'' = 1/2. The IBVP for ''v''(''y'', ''t'') becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(y, 0) = -f(y) = \frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} (y - y^2)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v(1, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same IBVP we've been beating to death for some time now. The solution for ''v''(''y'', ''t'') is:

:&lt;math&gt;
v(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \alpha t} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi y) \left(\frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} (y - y^2)\right) \ dy \cdot \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

And the solution for ''u''(''y'', ''t'') follows from how the variable change was defined:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = v(y, t) + f(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi y) \left(\frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} (y - y^2)\right) \ dy \cdot \sin(n \pi y) + \frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} (y^2 - y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = \frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} (y^2 - y) - \frac{P_x}{2 \rho \nu} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} \cdot \frac{4 (-1)^n - 4}{n^3 \pi^3} \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This solution fits what we expect: it starts flat and approaches the parabolic profile quickly. This is the same parabola derived as the steady state flow in the [[Partial Differential Equations/Parallel Plate Flow: Realistic IC|realistic IC]] chapter; the integral was evaluated for integer ''n'', simplifying it.

A careful look at the solution reveals something interesting: this is just decaying parallel plate flow &quot;in reverse&quot;. Instead of the flow starting parabolic and gradually approaching ''u'' = 0, it starts with ''u'' = 0 and gradually approaches a parabola.

===Time Dependent Diffusivity===

In this example we'll change time, an independent variable, instead of changing the dependent variable. Consider the following IBVP:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{1 + t^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 0) = \varphi(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is a separable; a transformation isn't really necessary, however it'll be easier since we can reuse past solutions if it can be transformed into something familiar.

Let's not get involved with the physics of this and just call it a diffusion problem. It could be diffusion of momentum (as in fluid mechanics), diffusion of heat (heat transfer), diffusion of a chemical (chemistry), or simply a mathematician's toy. In other words, a confession: it was purposely made up to serve as an example.

The (time dependent) factor in front of the second derivative is called the ''diffusivity''. Previously, it was a constant α (called &quot;thermal diffusivity&quot;) or constant ν (&quot;kinematic viscosity&quot;). Now, it decays with time.

To simplify the PDE via a transformation, we look for ways in which the factor could cancel out. One way would be to define a new time variable, call it τ and leave it's relation to ''t'' arbitrary. The chain rule yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} \cdot \frac{d \tau}{d t}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the PDE:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} \cdot \frac{d \tau}{d t} = \frac{1}{1 + t^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note now that the variable ''t'' will completely disappear (divide out in this case) from the equation if:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \tau}{d t} = \frac{1}{1 + t^2} \Rightarrow \tau = \arctan(t) + C\,
&lt;/math&gt;

''C'' is completely arbitrary. However, the best choice of ''C'' is the one that makes τ = 0 when ''t'' = 0, since this wouldn't change the IC which is defined at ''t'' = 0; so, take ''C'' = 0. Note that the BCs wouldn't change either way, unless they were time dependent, in which they would change no matter what ''C'' is chosen. The IBVP is turned into:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 0) = \varphi(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, \tau) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, \tau) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Digging up the solution and restoring the original variable:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, \tau) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \tau} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi x) \varphi(x) \ dx \cdot \sin(n \pi x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-(n \pi)^2 \arctan(t)} \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(n \pi x) \varphi(x) \ dx \cdot \sin(n \pi x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, unlike any of the previous examples, the physics of the problem (if there were any) couldn't have helped us. It's also worth mentioning that the solution doesn't limit to ''u'' = 0 for long time.

===Concluding Remarks===

Changing variables works a little differently for PDEs in the sense that you have a lot of freedom thanks to partial differentiation. In this chapter, we picked what seemed to be a good general form for the transformation (inspired by whatever prevented easy solution), wrote down a bunch of requirements, and defined the transformation to uniquely satisfy the requirements. Doing the same for ODEs can often degrade to a monkey with typewriter situation.

Many simple little changes go without saying. For example, we've so far worked with rods of length &quot;1&quot; or plates separated by a distance of &quot;1&quot;. What if the rod was 5 m long? Then space would have to be nondimensionalized using the following transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;
x = 5 \ \mbox{m} \cdot \hat{x}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Simple nondimensionalization is, well, simple; however for PDEs with more terms it can lead to scale analysis which can lead to perturbation theory which will all have to be explained in a later chapter.

It's worth noting that the physics of the IBVP very often suggest what kind of transformation needs to be done. Even some nonlinear problems can be solved this way.

This topic isn't nearly over, changes of variables will be dealt with again in future chapters.

[[Image:Tapioca pudding.jpg|right|thumb|Pudding made from tapioca pearls]]

'''Tapioca Pearls''', also '''pearl tapioca''', are small spheres of [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca starch]] (made from [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava]]), and are the basis of many [[Cookbook:Pudding|puddings]] in [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asia]] and, through colonialism, parts of [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]]. They are also used to make a drink called [[Cookbook:Bubble Tea|bubble tea]].

Tapioca pearls normally require soaking for some hours before cooking, although some commercial brands are prepared for instant use (i.e. without soaking); read the packet before use.

Tapioca pearls are often used as a substitute for sago. The practice is so common that some brands of tapioca pearls called themselves sago, but closer inspection of the packet reveals that they are actually made from tapioca.

'''Tapioca Starch''', sometimes called '''tapioca flour''', is a refined white [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] made from the [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava root]]. It is broadly used as a thickener for [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]], [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]] and [[Cookbook:Stew|stews]]. It can also be used in [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]].

Tapioca starch is very fine and starchy, and is often used as a substitute for [[Cookbook:Arrowroot|arrowroot starch]] and [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]. 

Tapioca starch is [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]], and is often added to gluten-free baking as a thickener and binder to make up for the lack of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] in those recipes.

'''Manioc Flour''' - also '''cassava flour''', '''tapioca flour''', '''harina de manioca''', '''harina de yuca''', is a coarse [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] made from the [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava root]]. It is used largely in [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South American cuisines]], particularly as a thickener for [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]] and [[Cookbook:Stews|stews]], but also in some [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] and [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]].

A reasonable substitute for manioc flour is [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca starch]], although that is more refined and will behave a little differently.

For this discussion we will refer to 10 to twelve year-old Pathfinders as &quot;juniors&quot; and 13-16 year-old Pathfinders as &quot;teens.&quot;  More information on this topic can be found in the Pathfinder Staff Manual (see chapter 2).
===a. Physical===
Juniors are generally a very healthy group of kids, and they are very active.  They need to move, so a good Pathfinder program will have &quot;moving&quot; times built in to it (Marching and Drilling, games, etc.) to harness that energy productively.

Teens are very concerned about their appearance.  They will often engage in innocuous physical contact with a certain girl or boy of whom they harbor romantic thoughts.  This may include &quot;slugging&quot; them on the shoulder or lightly pushing them.

The teenage years are a time of rapid growth.  The mind may still say that their shoe size is 7 when 11 is more like it.  This can cause clumsiness and lead to embarrassment.

===b. Emotional===
Juniors remember almost everything you say.  If you say &quot;next week we are going to go on a nature hike,&quot; you had better go on a nature hike next week.  If you do not, they will remind you of what you said.  Be very careful of the things you promise to them, and never make a threat you are not willing to execute.  If you get in a situation where consequences are called for, it is better to say &quot;there will be consequences for that&quot; and decide what those consequences are later rather than making a spur-of-the-moment threat that you will regret later.

Furthermore, juniors will remember what the consequences for a given infraction were for Johnny, the consequences for the same infraction had better be about the same for Billy.  They recognize and remember unfairness.

Teens will continue to love and follow the adults in their lives that they loved and followed as juniors.  If you become their &quot;hero&quot; when they are 12, they will still respect you when they are 16.

The teen years are an emotional roller coaster.  Their bodies are coursing with hormones that make them very moody.  One can easily be on the top of the moon at the beginning of an activity and an emotional mess before it's over.  Girls tend to cry and get it all out (especially with trusted girlfriends), while boys tend to internalize negative emotions that can erupt at the slightest provocation.

Teens will sometimes challenge your authority.  This will sometimes come in the form of the Pathfinder uniform.  If a teen shows up for Induction with pink shoes instead of the regulation black, call them on it.  If you do not, they may very well show up in baggy pants at the next Class A uniform event.  You do not need to make a big scene - just let them know that you ''did'' notice and that their choice is not in line with your expectations.

===c. Mental===
Junior Pathfinders love to collect things - it could be anything from the traditional stamps and coins to the more bizarre.  Many AY honors involve making collections (Insects, Shells, Rocks and Minerals, etc.) so use this to your advantage.  

Juniors are eager to learn and can memorize things quickly.  They like to read.

Juniors are into &quot;secret codes&quot; and handshakes.  They like adventure, and they love stories.  Be careful when telling them the exploits of your own youth.  If you ever tell them about the wrong things you did as a child, make sure you tell them what the consequences were as well.  Also remember that they may try to reproduce your youthful adventures.

It is important that when you teach hands-on activities to this age group that it is ''their'' hands that are on, and not yours.  If you jump in and do their activities for them, they will quickly lose interest.  Instruct them how to do something, but then put your hands behind your back.  ''Let them do it!''  

Logic plays a large role in a teen's thinking, as it is at this age that they become critical thinkers.  They will compare what you say to what you do and note any inconsistencies.  

If teens were cars, they would have excellent acceleration and lousy brakes.  They may think of an idea and dive in before thinking of the consequences.  If they do consider the consequences before it is too late, they may still have difficulty putting on the brakes.  If they know that a well-loved adult leader (hopefully this is you) will be disappointed in their actions, that is sometimes enough to kick in the brakes.  If they respect you, they ''do'' want your approval.

===d. Spiritual===
Juniors are very interested in what goes on in church.  They are eager to help take up the offering in church.  Most baptisms in the Adventist church take place among this age group.

Do not discuss negatives in front of this age group.  If there are problems in your club that require discussion with other staff, save them for staff meetings.  Juniors will pick up on bad vibes, and if you complain about another staff member in front of them, you will undermine that staff's authority with them.

Juniors will take your word as authoritative on spiritual matters.  Teens will challenge you, citing objections or inconsistencies.

Teens will wrestle with their consciences, but remember - their braking system is not yet fully developed.  They do succumb to peer pressure, but they also repent.  Be ready to forgive them, and remember that if they already realize they have made a mistake, a lecture may be unnecessary.  Sometimes they just need a friend.

'''Pandan Essence''' is an essence extracted from the leaves of the screwpine ([[w:Pandanus amaryllifolius|Pandanus amaryllifolius]]). It comes in two varieties:

* Pandan essence &amp;ndash; a clear liquid
* Pandan paste &amp;ndash; deep-green and quite thick

Pandan essence or paste is used in place of fresh pandan leaves, to flavour and colour [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]], [[Cookbook:Beverages|drinks]], and [[Cookbook:Tapai|tapai]].

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Fermentation|Fermentation]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Cuisine of Indonesia]]

'''Tapai''', also '''tape''' (pronounced &quot;tah-pay&quot;), is a traditional [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] food of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]], although present in some form throughout [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-East Asia]]. It can be made from various starchy staple foods including [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|grains]] and [[Cookbook:Rhizome|tubers]], each giving it a distinctive taste and texture, and often a specific local name. Tapai tastes sweet, tangy, a bit yeasty, and is slightly alcoholic (or not so slightly, if left to ferment longer).

The following recipe is for a common variant called ''tape ketan'' (ketan means ''glutinous rice''; when made with black glutinous rice, it is ''tape ketan-hitam'').

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Rice|glutinous rice]] (sticky rice)
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 cake of ''ragi tapai'' (see notes)
* Optional: a couple of drops of [[Cookbook:Pandan Essence|pandan paste]] (to colour it green)

==Procedure==

# Rinse the rice and cook it in the water, unsalted. If adding pandan paste, add it now. The absorption method is usually easiest: bring the water to boiling point with the rice in it, then put the lid on the pot and turn the element or flame down to lowest possible setting and simmer for 15 minutes.
# Allow rice to cool down to about 30°C / 86°F. To help it cool down faster, sit the pot in a basin of cold water.
# Crumble the cake of ''ragi tapai'' over the rice and mix in well.
# Loosely pack the mixture into a large jar, cover with a cloth, and set aside in a warm place to ferment (about 30-35°C / 86-95°F).

==Fermentation==

The tapai will ferment over the next two to four days. After about two days, it should start to show a little liquid at the bottom of the jar, and will start producing a distinctive smell of tapai. At this point, the tapai can be considered complete, although it will taste better after a couple of days kept in the refrigerator.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Tapai can be made from plain white rice (''tape nasi''), or [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava]] (''tape ketala'', ''tape telor'', ''peuyeum''), or even [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]].
* ''Ragi tapai'' (or ''ragi tape'') can be a little difficult to track down outside of South-East Asia, but a little persistence should help find it.The same (or very similar) product is used to ferment Chinese rice wines, and runs under the names &quot;wine yeast&quot;, &quot;yeast cake&quot; and &quot;rice cake&quot; in Asian grocery stores. They look like crumbly little white balls, about 2-3cm (1 inch) in diameter. Just ask the shopkeeper whether it can be used to make wine. They can also be purchased on-line from some stores; try this [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ragi+tape%22+%22shopping+cart%22 Google search].
* The liquid that collects at the bottom is actually a rice wine, called ''brem''. It will be very low in alcohol after only a few days, but if kept and allowed to ferment, it will become more alcoholic.

'''Kaffir lime leaves''' are the leaves of a [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] tree native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]]. Kaffir lime leaves are used in several [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-East Asian cuisines]], adding a sour, citrus-like flavour to foods cooked with them.

Kaffir lime leaves are available fresh in some supermarkets, and as whole dried leaves from Asian grocers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I find it funny that a person needs to create a separate account for &quot;wikibooks&quot; even when he has account at wikipedia. No matter. More information about this person can be found [[wikipedia:User:F-3000|here]] (in wikipedia).

Currently I'm interested in expanding the &quot;[[AppleScript_Programming]]&quot;-book, as I am studying the Applescript language, and I think there isn't anywhere on the net an useful source that'll tell the ins and outs of scripting with it, and what would be better place than wikipedia?

Please, feel free to comment any of my works, and especially note me about lingual errors I make (typos, wrong sentence orders, etc.), since I'd prefer fixing my own mistakes so that I'll learn about them best.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">With command &quot;display dialog&quot; you can make the script invoke a sign, that can be used in so many purposes that it would be senseless to list them all. But for least few example, it can be used to note the user, ask for option (yes/no), prompt for user input, and so on.

In its simplest form, it is like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;display dialog &quot;Hello!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Which will give result like this:&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Applescript window say hello.png]]&lt;br /&gt;


When considering from the view of complexity, it is very opposite of this code...
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;set my_pass to text returned of (display dialog &quot;Enter password for &quot; &amp; ¬
	quoted form of my_name ¬
	with title &quot;LiveJournal Post Event&quot; ¬
	with icon stop ¬
	default answer &quot;&quot; ¬
	buttons {&quot;Continue…&quot;} ¬
	default button 1 ¬
	with hidden answer ¬
        giving up after 5)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
... and this window:&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Applescript window in full colour.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
''NOTE: For the script above to work, you need to set variable &quot;my_name&quot;.''


* I will introduce every piece of the code shown in the second example, so that you will have more insight about what you can do.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;set myVariable to text returned of (&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
When you start ''display dialog''-command with this, you will invoke dialog-window with input prompt. Just remember to add the &quot;)&quot; at the end, which I left out from above example, so that you '''won't''' be trying to make it like &lt;code&gt;... return of () display dialog ...&lt;/code&gt;.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;quoted form of myVariable&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
With this ''part of command'' you can put &quot;single-dot&quot;-quote around the variable, instead of &quot;two-dot&quot;-quote, which is not possible with &lt;code&gt;\'&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;\&quot;&lt;/code&gt; can be used to add quotes into the dialog-text.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;with title &quot;Hello punk!&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This will set a title for the dialog-window.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;with icon stop&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This will simply add the stop-sign into dialog-window.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;default answer &quot;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
When you use the input-prompt, this will insert sort of &quot;default&quot; into the input-field. If it's &quot;&quot; as like in the example, there will be nothing in the input-field. But if it's &quot;1&quot;, then there will be number 1 &quot;pre-written&quot; (and selected) in the input-field.

NOTE: Adding this to &lt;code&gt;display dialog&lt;/code&gt; will also create input-prompt.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;buttons {&quot;Uh, no.&quot;,&quot;Continue…&quot;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
With this you can determine the amount of buttons and what they have as text. Without this, there will be default buttons &quot;Cancel&quot; and &quot;OK&quot;.

NOTE: Without determining the button names, you cannot do &quot;&lt;code&gt;if button returned of result is &quot;OK&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;default button 1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
With this you can determine which button is &quot;selected&quot; in the dialog-window. If this code is not included while you set your own buttons (with &lt;code&gt;buttons {}&lt;/code&gt;), no button will be &quot;selected&quot;, and pressing enter won't close the dialog - forcing user to ''click'' one of the buttons. Button order is determined from &quot;left to right&quot;, so button number 1 is first button from left.



&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;with hidden answer&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text written into the input-field appear as balls, resembling &quot;••••&quot;. There is no need for any sort of &quot;&lt;code&gt;with visible answer&lt;/code&gt;&quot;-code.



&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;giving up after 5&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
With this you can limit the time the dialog-window is displayed. If this code is not included, the window can only be dismissed with the buttons (or the &quot;return&quot; key for the default button). When included, a separate &quot;gave up:true&quot; or &quot;gave up:false&quot; is returned as a sub-field of the result.



You can break out the separate return sub-field values using something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
   set theReturnedItems to (display dialog &quot;How are you?&quot; default answer &quot;Example&quot; buttons {&quot;Quit&quot;, &quot;OK&quot;} default button 2 giving up after 4)
   set theAnswer to the text returned of theReturnedItems
   set theButtonName to the button returned of theReturnedItems
   set theGaveUpState to gave up of theReturnedItems as string
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since the &quot;result&quot; can change at any time, it is important to preserve its parts in a local variable right away. You can not use the &quot;set my_pass to text returned of&quot; before the (display dialog ...) because that alters the result. You must preserve the '''entire''' result because you may need to extract separate sub-fields.


* That's it, you know as much about the &quot;&lt;code&gt;display dialog&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as the [[:en:User:F-3000|original writer]] at the moment he wrote this.


END NOTE: All text that I have written (with exception of code) are mine, spontaneously formed and written. Equalities to ''any'' copy-written source is ''pure coincidence''.

'''Heteroptera''' is a group of about 40,000 species of insects (also called '''true bugs''') in the order Hemiptera. The word &quot;Heteroptera&quot; is Greek for ''different wings'': most species have forewings with both membranous and hardened portions (called hemelytra); members of the primitive infraorder Enicocephalomorpha have wings that are completely membranous. The name Heteroptera is used in two very different ways in modern classifications; it commonly appears as a suborder within Hemiptera, but also as a rankless (non-Linnaean) but monophyletic grouping of infraorders within the suborder Prosorrhyncha of the order Hemiptera. The use of the name may eventually be rejected due to some taxonomical problems.

Heteroptera includes both pest insects and beneficial (predatory) insects, some of which are sold in the trade as biocontrols. The order also includes a number of aquatic insects (&quot;water bugs&quot;), including the water striders.

==Description==
True bugs have a &quot;plate&quot; called a ''scutellum'' behind the head, which is triangular. Most species have forewings with both membranous and hardened portions (called hemelytra), most are good fliers as adults. Like all [[../Hemiptera/]]ns, they have piercing-sucking mouthparts they use to extract plant juices. 

===Selected families of Heteroptera===
* [[w:stink bug|stink bug]]s or shield bugs (Pentatomidae and related families)
* [[w:leaf footed bug|leaf footed bug]]s and [[w:squash bug|squash bug]]s (Coreidae)
* [[w:seed bug|seed bug]]s (Lygaeidae)
* [[w:Reduviidae|assassin bug]]s (Reduviidae)
* [[w:bedbug|bedbug]]s and flower bugs (Cimicidae)
* [[w:leaf bug|leaf bug]]s or mirid bugs (Miridae; ''c.''6,000 species)

===Selected families of water bugs===
* [[w:back swimmer|back swimmer]]s (Notonectidae)
* [[w:giant water bug|giant water bug]]s (Belostomatidae)
* [[w:water scorpion|water scorpion]]s (Nepidae)
* [[w:water boatman| water boatmen]] (Corixidae)
* [[w:Gerridae|pond skater]]s (Gerridae)
* [[w:Veliidae|Smaller water strider]] (Veliidae)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening Editing and Saving Subtitle  Files from a Text Editor==

Video creators and distributors are starting to create subtitle files for their videos. These are transcripts with timecodes included. They are very useful as they can be played on a computer linked with the appropriate video file, so that the subtitles are displayed. They can also be used to create subtitles for DVDs. These subtitle files can be selected as needed when viewing a video, and do not need to be 'burnt on' to the video image as subtitles have been traditionally. 

Translators can also use a simple text editor like NotePad, Word Pad, Text Edit etc to open, edit (ie translate) and save the timecoded transcription file to a different language version.

===Windows===

In Windows the simplest way to do this is with the NotePad  program. You can open it in the Applications section of the Programs Menu.

Open notepad

[[Image:Opennotepad.jpg]]

When you have opened it you can select and substitute each line of text with the translation. Be careful not to alter any of the numbers listed in the first 2 lines of each caption.

 9
 00:00:48,105 --&gt; 00:00:51,573
 But on the other hand, if you say
 that there will be a screening
 
 10
 00:00:51,574 --&gt; 00:00:56,656
 it's a whole different thing and a lot 
 more people come.

becomes

 9
 00:00:48,105 --&gt; 00:00:51,573
 Maar als je vertelt dat er
 een video vertoond wordt 
 
 10
 00:00:51,574 --&gt; 00:00:56,656
 dan is het iets heel anders en veel 
 meer mensen komen er op af.

When the translation is finished you can save the file once more with a different name. Be sure to select from File Type, &quot;Text Documents *.txt&quot; - and give the file a *.srt extension as shown below. Then, for example, if the original is called transmission_xvid_700kps_mp3_128_en.srt and you have translated it to dutch you could call it transmission_xvid_700kps_mp3_128_nl.srt. It's good to include as much information as you can in the title of files to make it easier for internet distribution.


[[Image:Subtitlefrom_text_pad.jpg]]

===Other platforms===

The same theory applies if you are using Word, or Word Pad, or a Mac Text Edit or similar programmes. Just make sure you save as a text file, with the language indicated in the name, and with the .srt extension.

The file can then be emailed to whoever needs it, or it may be possible to upload it to the page that the original was downloaded from.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:03, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Applescript: Display Dialog]] ==

Hi - I guess you are a mind reader!!  I was just going to put a message on your page about this and you moved it!!

:If you want the redirect killed I'll do it, let me know (or tag it - will explain if you want) but it isn't doing any harm and as you say will allow a search to find it - your call as far as I see.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With command &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; you can create repetative behavior, that often will shorten the code a lot, if done correctly.


Its basic format is this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;repeat 10 times
	say &quot;Hello.&quot;
end repeat&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


And it can be used to do a specific task for every item you drop into a script that has been turned into a program.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;on open (ListItem)
	repeat with thisItem in ListItem
		-- bunch of kick*** code
	end repeat
end open&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


One example of actual script that utilizes repeat-function can be found [[AppleScript_Programming/Letter_Replacer|here]].


While, here is one example of code that will wait until a page in Safari is fully loaded:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
tell application &quot;Safari&quot; to activate -- Brings Safari frontmost application.
repeat
	tell application &quot;Safari&quot;
		if source of document in window frontmost contains &quot;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; then
			tell application &quot;Script Editor&quot; to activate
			exit repeat -- This will quit the loop.
		else
			delay 1 -- Will wait for 1 second.
		end if
	end tell
end repeat&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bakhtin was a Russian Scholar whose work was centered on the idea of Carnivalesque. Carnivalesque, relating to the carnival is a theme in literature with aspects of chaos and disaray, of social hierarchies being reversed, of celebration and of the worshipping of bodily functions. However, the main aspect of the carnivalesque was the idea of the 'cycle of life'. Bahktin created an image of an old hag, near death but about to give birth. Even though she is near to the end of her life, she is bringing new life into the world. 
In Wise Children, this idea of the old hag is played upon by Carter, exploring the idea that Dora and Nora are the old hags, who are given new life in the form of two new twin babies by Perry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A problem:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&lt;cite&gt;I need a script to change the unicode character to old Slovenian ASCII character because of some fonts we use. Right now we use find and replace in TextEdit, but it is a pain to do it on 50 documents and with 10 different replacing character in each text.&lt;/cite&gt;&quot;


Result:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Automatic Letter Replacer'''

Just copy the code, paste it in ScriptEditor, edit all necessary info (read the comments), and save as a program. Then just happily drag and drop - a punch at a time, so you don't have to do it one by one.

Note: I would suggest testing the program with a single document first (with &quot;autosave&quot; off), as all the letters that you put into variables might not appear correct in TextEdit. The script has difficulties to respect - for example - Scandinavian letters &quot;ä&quot; and &quot;ö&quot;.

More sophisticated version would save the changed document with different name, maybe even in different location. It could be a lot better, but current shall satisfy for now.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(*
This script works as &quot;drag and drop&quot;, and utilizes TextEdit. It's purpose is to replace letters (or even lines) in
documents.

To make it work properly in the first place, you need to edit variables &quot;find&quot; and &quot;replace&quot; to resemble the actual 
wording as they appear in your TextEdit with your OS language set.

Do NOT interrupt the script in run by switching program, as result might be something nasty.

There is disabled abilities at the end of the script. You can enable them if you wish.

If you get NSReceiverEvaluationScriptError: 4 (&quot;target object doesn't exist&quot; or something like that) in middle of
the script in action, you can ignore it and re-run the script.

If you get the above error at every time you run the script, you got either button name or window name wrong
- if you changed them in the first place.

== Monad laws are incorrect ==

Hi all. I was looking over the monad laws section and noticed some errors in the first and second laws. The first law is incorrect because join cannot be composed with join since it is a function from M^2 to M. The confusion here is on subscripts: the join_x can be lifted to join_{Mx} which will then be ok. It is better to write this as (join M) using the standard monad notion. I.e the first law should read jM.j = j.jM. See the wikipedia article on monads (category theory) for the correct commutative diagrams.

There is a similar abuse of notation problem with the second law. This may be confusing to the inexperienced. I did not change them because of the following example would have to be altered as well. Perhaps a note about the abuse of notation would be sufficient since it will be awkward to explain the haskell code equivalent. -- Marc

:The trouble comes from the fact that in Haskell, &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; is of polymorphic type &lt;code&gt;forall m, a . Monad m =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a&lt;/code&gt;. The parametrization on the monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is not important here, but the parametric type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is. This makes it a function and a natural transformation at the same time with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; being the type argument. The point is that the Haskell compiler will accept the composition &lt;code&gt;join . join&lt;/code&gt; because it can figure out that the first &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; takes the base type &lt;code&gt;m X&lt;/code&gt; if the other takes a base type &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, it will infer the subscripts automatically. I'm unsure what to do here, but I suspect that this has to be explained at some point anyway. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:30, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree that it is just an abuse of notation and that it doesn't affect the code since the compiler is smart enough to figure out what is going on. This is why I didn't go trampling through the page making changes. I do think that it is worth mentioning that this happens for clarity.

::Perhaps something like: Notice that the subscript on the second join is actually Mx so that this composition is proper from a category-theoretic standpoint, but since join is of polymorphic type in Haskell the compiler understands which join is meant from context, so in (coding) practice the distinction is not important. -- Marc

::: Actually, I think I should have called it &quot;type inference&quot; instead of &quot;compiler&quot;. From the Haskell point of view, &quot;subscript&quot; may be confusing :), it's &quot;type specialization&quot;. Maybe something like: &quot;note that the second &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; is specialized to the type &lt;code&gt;m (m (m a)) -&gt; m (m a)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
::: But the issue is more subtle than that: because of polymorphism, the category '''Hask''' allows to internalize not only morphisms but natural transformations as well. I'm not well-versed in category theory but I guess there is some construction corresponding to that? In particular, I suspect that the naturality laws 3 and 4 are [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/parametricity.html#free free theorems] (although I don't know whether higher kinded free theormes have been worked out yet). I think that this what makes innocent looking Haskell notation break with the standard category theory notation.
::: Maybe it's best to simply introduce natural transformations explicitely in the article and solve notational and conceptional problems with that. Hiding them is probably more confusing than giving a translation between Cat-speak and Haskell-speak. Actually, I like the &lt;math&gt;T\mu&lt;/math&gt; notation more than subscripts or type inference because it results in more symmetric monad laws. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 21:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

:::: I am well versed in category theory, but fairly new to haskell. I'm using my category theory skills to understand haskell, which is how I ended up here. I think that laws 3 and 4 are ok -- they are just expressing the requirement that unit and join must be natural transformations.

:::: I'm not sure if it is worth giving a significant introduction to natural transformations into the article, though a mention and a link to a wikipedia page might be appropriate. My main concern is just that the monad laws be replaced with their correct formulations so that others approaching this in the manner that I have won't have to wrestle with the laws for a while before figuring out that they are not what a category theorist would expect. (Normally I would not be such a stickler, but this is the category theory article after all.) I am, however, willing to help make the article more in-depth from a category-theoretic point of view. Perhaps in conjunction with more concepts we will find that we need to discuss natural transformations. [[User:Marc Harper|Marc Harper]] 02:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

::::: I agree, it's a category theory article, after all :) So, subscripts are important. I'm unsure on how to state the categorially correct monad laws without natural transformations? Concerning the introduction of concepts, the rule of thumb would be that a concept may be introduced as long as there is corresponding Haskell code for it. Of course, it's best introduced if it's also useful. Your additions would be most welcome! -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:28, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

I think that we should use the &lt;math&gt;T\mu&lt;/math&gt; notation and explain that the type system can infer the correct domain  for (M join). For the reader that understands functors, this will not be suprising since monads are functors and we are basically just applying fmap to join to lift it to the correct domain. Natural transformations can be viewed as types of the form &lt;math&gt; \forall a, m a \to n a &lt;/math&gt; for functors m and n, which should be sufficient for most readers.

Once some more content is added that uses natural transformations and gives interesting examples of them it may be appropriate for a more detailed discussion of natural transformations. There is a lot of categorical content to be added -- even relatively simple constructions such as identifying tuple types at the categorical product. Does anyone know of a good reference for a categorical discussion of the properties of Hask? [[User:Marc Harper|Marc Harper]] 21:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

:Agreed.

:Note that the tuple is (unfortunately) not the categorial product :) This basically comes from the fact that &lt;math&gt;\perp \neq (\perp,\perp)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the tuple type has an extra element &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; that breaks the universal property. The sum type (coproduct) &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;/code&gt; has the same problem. For more on &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;bottom&quot;) and the semantics of general recursion, see [[Haskell/Denotational semantics]].

:AFAIK, there is no concretely worked out category theory behind '''Hask'''. In general, Lambda calculi are connected to cartesian closed categories. A quick google suggests [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2006/ccc.html Cartesian closed categories and the λ-calculus] as trampoline. I don't know where to find a categorial construction of universal quantification &lt;math&gt;\forall a&lt;/math&gt;, but the inventors of the polymorphic lambda calculus [[w:System F|System F]] are [[w:Jean-Yves Girard|Girard]] and [[w:John C. Reynolds|Reynolds]] and they have semantics for it. Then, there are initial algebra semantics for folds and generic programming in general. The &quot;banana and barbed wires&quot;-paper mentioned on the haskell wiki page [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category_theory] is one of the most famous in that direction. There is also the work of Moggi in [http://www.disi.unige.it/research/Categorical_semantics Categorial semantics], he mostly deals with monads. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 11:01, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:: It is disappointing that it is not as elegant as it seems from the surface. Thanks for the references. -- Marc
::: What about restricting our attention to only strict functions in the category Hask? Then we seem to get better categorical properties. Also, if we consider types to be 'pointed' with basepoint &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; then we can get properties such as &lt;math&gt;\perp = (\perp,\perp)&lt;/math&gt; by taking the product in the pointed category (much in analogy with pointed topological spaces). -- Marc [[User:74.139.215.32|74.139.215.32]] 01:08, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

:::: I don't think that a restriction to strict functions makes things better. While (co)products may work out fine, function types won't: &lt;code&gt;() -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; are not isomorphic, the former can be used to simulate call-by-name in a strict language. In other words, &amp;perp; will still bite when considering function types. Usually, one restricts everything to total functions, thereby kicking out &amp;perp; completely, and that does give a satisfying category. Partiality &amp;perp; can then be modeled by a monad (I don't have a good reference for that but maybe [http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/WG2.8/22/slides/tarmo.pdf] is a start).
:::: For an introductory article like this one, I think the most reasonable thing to do is to mention the problem and otherwise declare all functions to be total :-) (The current article &quot;allows&quot; partial functions while ignoring them at the same time, I think that's a bit clumsy.)

== Strong monads ==
There is another subtlety, namely the fact that every &quot;monad&quot; in Haskell is also a &quot;strong monad&quot;, but not the other way round. See [http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/ftp/ic91.ps.gz Moggi's paper]. This means that there is a natural transformation
&lt;pre&gt;
 t :: Monad m =&gt; (a, m b) -&gt; m (a,b)
 t x m = m &gt;&gt;= \b -&gt; return (a,b) = join . fmap (\b -&gt; return (a,b)) $ m
&lt;/pre&gt;
Apparently, the category '''Hask''' offers quite a lot of objects for free.

== Powerset eq List Monad? ==

This may be irrelevant from a pedagogical standpoint, but most of the times I've heard category theorists talk about the list monad (in the operads world), they seem to view it as something in a symmetric monoidal category, i.e. tensor products of Thingies; and not using powersets -- the powerset analogy is slightly flawed in that it would disallow things like [2,3,2,2,1,2]. On the other hand, proposing a change that actually works out simple enough for an example to be good is over my own head right now. [[User:Michiexile|Michiexile]] 09:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

: They are not the same. This is because sets are not ordered/indexed by default, i.e. a set would not contain the element 2 twice, but a list could. As far as illustrating the idea though, they are otherwise very similar. 

: To be precise about the distinction, if you consider sets with the monoidal structure introduced by the cartesian product, then you can view lists as element of a product of sets. (This allows the list elements to be of different types though, so it is more properly viewed as a tuple.) So... lists of length n (in Haskell) are really elements of A^n, the product of A with itself n-times. The proper category theoretic way to view this is to generate a category with the product and a set A. Then n-lists can be viewed as a monad. If you wanted to treat all lists similtaneously, you could toss in the element B=A^{\infty}. It still has a product (B x B = B) and you could consider lists of length n to be infinite lists where all terms after the n-th are zero. -- Marc

:Since you mentioned operads, the connection here is that you can view operads as monoids in the monoidal category of symmetric families of a category... I think that a discussion of operads in the article would be unecessarily complicated at this time, and even though the powerset example is not quite the same I think that it is pedagogically sufficient. -- Marc

== Right chapter? ==

This is in the &quot;Time and space&quot; chapter, but the only connection to time and space (which I understand to mean performance in this context) appears to be the mention of fusion - which is tangential, and doesn't, I think, justify this article's inclusion in this chapter. --[[User:Greenrd|Greenrd]] 21:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

As an intuitive explanation, the &quot;mapped over&quot; has been to me as useful at saying &quot;functors are functors&quot;.

Can't it be added something like &quot;functors are the generalization to categories of linear operators&quot;?

== Comment ==

The first exercise asks
'As was mentioned, any partial order (P, \leq) is a category with objects as the elements of P and a morphism between elements a and b iff a \leq b. Which of the above laws guarantees the transitivity of \leq?'
This seems backwards to me.  The statement is that a partial order gives rise to a category, not the other way around.  Given a paritial order we don't need to gaurantee the transitivity of \leq. That is an axiom.  The question should be something along the lines of 'which of the axioms of a poset guarantees the second category theory law?' -- astrolabe

Morphism composition. If the existence of a (unique) f_{a,b} from a to b is equivalent to a \leq b, then: a\leq b and b\leq c means there are f_{a,b} and f_{b,c}, therefore there must be f_{a,c} = f_{b,c} . f_{a,b} --- which amounts to saying a must be \leq c. -- askyle

== Another Comment ==

When explaining functors as they apply to '''Hask''', the list functor is explained as a functor from '''Hask''' to '''Lst'''.  But for a Monad, the underlying functor is from a category to itself: &lt;math&gt;M : C \to C&lt;/math&gt;.  So considered as a Monad, is it not the case the list functor should be a functor from '''Hask''' to '''Hask''' (where its image in '''Hask''' is only those objects in the subcategory '''Lst''')?  I know this was (perhaps still is!) a point of confusion for me, perhaps a note of clarification would be worthwhile.--[[User:Jyossarian|Jyossarian]] ([[User talk:Jyossarian|talk]]) 03:39, 12 January 2010 (UTC)

:'''Lst''' is a (full) subcategory of '''Hask''', i.e. every object in '''Lst''' is a Haskell data type. The list functor can be viewed as an endofunctor &lt;math&gt;M : \mathbf{Hask} \to \mathbf{Hask}&lt;/math&gt; but it can also be interpreted as a functor from '''Hask''' to a subcategory '''Lst'''. The text simply chose the latter interpretation when introducing the functor.

== adjoint functors ==

I read somewhere that monad transformers were really adjoint functors, whatever those are. Could some explanation be added?  I like this article a lot and it helped me with the traditional stumbling block of understanding monads (I sort of get them now), but I'm still baffled by monad transformers.  Thanks

:Oh? That would be interesting, I only know that every pair of adjoint functors (like &lt;math&gt;S\to\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S\times\cdot&lt;/math&gt;) gives rise to a monad (&lt;math&gt;S\to(S\times\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;). Concerning monad transformers, the wikibook has a chapter on them, but it's not optimal yet. Meanwhile, have a look at [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Blog_articles/Monads#Monad_transformers].

== Convention used for function composition ==

In the section on ''Category Laws'', we have the following:

: … if &lt;math&gt;f : A \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g : B \to C&lt;/math&gt;, then there must be some morphism &lt;math&gt;h : A \to C&lt;/math&gt; in the category such that &lt;math&gt;h = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;.

This suggests that &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; is being used here for the morphism that results from composition of the morphism ''f'' '''preceding''' the morphism ''g''. However, this conflicts with the Haskell composition notation, in which &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; (well, &lt;tt&gt;f.g&lt;/tt&gt;) refers to the composition of the morphism ''f'' '''following''' the morphism ''g''.

The section is also internally inconsistent in that it states that for the category shown in the figure, for which &lt;math&gt;f: B \to A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g: A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = id_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \circ g = id_A&lt;/math&gt;. (This corresponds to the convention used in Haskell.). But for the same category, the text states that &lt;math&gt;f \circ id_A = id_B \circ f = f&lt;/math&gt; (which uses the opposite – and un-Haskell-like – convention).

Which convention should be adopted here? (I’m no authority on Haskell or on category theory, so I wouldn’t wish to make the choice myself.)

See also the compositions for unit and join, which appear to use the Haskell-like convention.

: Oh! The &quot;Haskell&quot; convention is correct. In fact, it's the convention used all over mathematics. Fixed. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 08:16, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

:: Not used ‘all’ over mathematics – but certainly by far the most common convention, I agree.

Thanks for fixing this. --[[User:Axnicho|Axnicho]] ([[User talk:Axnicho|talk]]) 09:17, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

--
It would be more instructive, I think, when in the diagram that explains the existence of f o g and g o f, there is for at least one of them another option than just id. Currently, the example is such that both f o g and g o f are the identity, and this might be misleading for the beginner.

== Typographical conventions for unit, join ==

In this article, we have, for example:

: &lt;math&gt;join \circ M(join) = join \circ join&lt;/math&gt;

Is this really the desired typography? I’d have been inclined to use

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{join} \circ M(\mbox{join}) = \mbox{join} \circ \mbox{join}&lt;/math&gt;

But perhaps there is some Haskell convention that I’m unaware of? (The same applies to unit.)

:Function names in italic (more precisely \mathit{} in LaTeX) have a widespread tradition in papers about functional programming and Haskell, especially when there is some &quot;mathematical&quot; touch to them. A prototypical example is probably the book [http://web2.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/publications/books/fop/ The Fun of Programming]. Some chapters are available online, like [http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/0333992857.Pdf Fun with Binary Heap Trees]. Naturally, typewriter face is widespread, too. A variable width but upright font is the exception, a prominent example being Chris Okasaki's [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf thesis] and corresponding [http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504 book].

::OK – I can accept that italic is used in Haskell and functional-programming papers (though why the standard mathematical convention that I mentioned should be used specifically in papers with ‘some &quot;mathematical&quot; touch to them’ eludes me!). Still, at the very least, we should improve the typography so that it looks more like this (I have made this change):

:::&lt;math&gt;\mathit{join} \circ M(\mathit{join}) = \mathit{join} \circ \mathit{join}&lt;/math&gt;

::By using math-mode italics (bare $…$) rather than \mathit{…} or \textit{…}, the spacing of the ''word'' ‘join’ is pretty awful – and a poor advertisement for TeX. As Lamport notes in the LaTeX&amp;nbsp;2ε user guide (p. 51):

:::‘LaTeX normally uses an italic type style for letters in math mode. However, it interprets each letter as a separate mathematical symbol [which is not what we want here], and it produces very different spacing than an ordinary italic typestyle. You should use \mathit for multiletter symbols in formulas.’
::--[[User:Axnicho|Axnicho]] ([[User talk:Axnicho|talk]]) 09:35, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Yes, thanks for making the change to \mathit{} :-)
:::Concerning the italic convention, I imagine it as follows: usually, the objects of mathematical discourse have only one-letter names like &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;. This is not practical for programming, so multi-letter names like &lt;math&gt;\mathit{map}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathit{foldr}&lt;/math&gt; are used. But since they're almost on &quot;equal footing&quot; with those nice looking italic letters, they gotta be italic, too. I mean, in the papers with &quot;mathematical touch&quot;, they're not so much actual code to be typed into the terminal (-&gt; typewriter face), but mathematical entities that obey laws like &lt;math&gt;\mathit{map}\,(f\circ g) = \mathit{map}\,f \circ \mathit{map}\,g&lt;/math&gt;. (Hm, same for &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; of course. Must be the higher order functions, i.e. the fact that ''map'' can also be argument of a function. Oh well, whatever, it looks good :-)

::::That is pretty funny, since in mathmetics the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_conventions_in_mathematical_formulae well established convention] is to write variables (whether the variable contains a number, a function, or some other object, does not matter) as single letters in italics, and the multi-letter symbols for named functions (whose meaning in known, so they are not variables, for example: sin, max, log, etc.) in upright. And clearly map and foldr etc. are in this category, too; not variables but names for known functions, and no mathematician would write them in italic. So apparently haskell/functional programming papers with &quot;some mathematical touch to them&quot; use a typographical convention that is based on misunderstanding the normal mathematical typography. Whether this wikibook should follow the normal mathematical, or the alternative functional programming convention, is a difficult question. Maybe it depends to which audience this wikibook is targeted: to readers familiar with math but new to functional programming (who'd be less confused with normal math typography), or readers more familiar with functional programming papers and less familiar with normal math (who'd be more confused with the normal math typography).

== Applicative Functors ==

Should there be a section about applicative functors? It seems to me that a functor F can be made into an applicative functor if it respects exponential objects, where &lt;math&gt; B^A &lt;/math&gt; should be the object consisting of functions from A to B. By that I mean that there needs to be a map

&lt;math&gt;F(B^A)\to F(B)^{F(A)}&lt;/math&gt;

Another way to say this is that there is a map 

&lt;math&gt; F(B^A)\times F(A)\to F(B)&lt;/math&gt;

But I haven't quite figured out where the pure requirement fits it (I'm not sure why a map &lt;math&gt;A\to F(A)&lt;/math&gt; is important to have for this). Possibly, we want the map &lt;math&gt; F(B^A)\times F(A)\to F(B)&lt;/math&gt; to be the unique map that makes a diagram commute, where we use &lt;math&gt;\text{pure}:B^A\times A\to F(B^A\times A)&lt;/math&gt;, and map that to &lt;math&gt; F(B) &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F(f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f:B^A\times A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is the evaluation map, and we also map &lt;math&gt;B^A\times A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; F(B^A)\times F(A)&lt;/math&gt; by the product of the two pure maps (sorry if it isn't clear, in the end we have a square we want to commute). I'm not sure if this makes sense/is actually true though.

== ID remark is incorrect ==

The article [[Haskell/Category_theory#Hask.2C_the_Haskell_category|says]] that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The function &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell is ''polymorphic'' - it can take many different types for its domain and range, or, in category-speak, can have many different source and target objects. But morphisms in category theory are by definition ''monomorphic'' - each morphism has one specific source object and one specific target object.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a gross error. A monomorphism is a left-cancellative morphism. The author is confusing the property of a function of sets being single-valued with a '''mono'''morphism. (Monomorphisms generalize the notion of an ''injective'' function, because they go ''mono-e-mono''...now you'll never forget that!)

Strictly speaking, from the mathematical point of view, the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; function can be viewed as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_notation abuse of notation]. Thus '''Hask''' is a category.

Moreover, with regards to subtyping, one can use a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subobject_classifier Subobject classifier] in a beautiful way...since the objects of '''Hask''' are types.

Just thought it might be nice to clarify that from the mathematician's point of view...

:Nicely spotted! The funny thing is that two rather different concepts have &quot;monomorph&quot; in their name.
:* ''monomorphic'' type vs ''polymorphic'' type. That's what the author meant.
:* ''morphism'', ''monomorphism'', ''epimorphism'' and friends. That's what you mean and what the author seemed to write.
:In category-speak, the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; function is a natural transformation. The &lt;code&gt;Hask&lt;/code&gt; category has the curious property that a lot of natural transformations can be reified as elements of some objects (which correspond to polymorphic types). This is like a cartesian closed category, where there are power objects &lt;math&gt;B^A&lt;/math&gt; whose elements correspond to morphisms.

== What the heck is a morphism? ==

I applaud the initiative to give an overview of category theory, and its relationship to Haskell.  And it's encouraging that the discussion starts with the basic: &quot;a category is a collection with three components&quot;.

But the article immediately heads off into the weeds by explaining everything in terms of &quot;morphisms&quot;, a word which appears over fifty times. Yet never is any clue provided as to what the morphism word actually delineates (although we are told that they are sometimes called arrows, no wait, ignore that, and they may not be functions, yet correspond to functions in the Haskell sense). 

Just from the context of this article, morphisms appear to be functions, or something very like functions.  But the fact that this article studiously avoids calling them functions suggests that anyone assuming they are functions would be on the wrong track.  So basically, if the reader doesn't already understand what morphism refers to in this neighborhood of mathematics they are going to be out of luck.

If someone takes on the task of adding a description introducing the word &quot;morphism&quot;, before it is used, telling what &quot;morphism&quot; encompasses, could they please also comment on how it relates (or doesn't) to the polymorphism, monomorphism and any other morphisms we're likely to encounter.

Thanks! [[User:Gwideman|Gwideman]] ([[User talk:Gwideman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gwideman|contribs]]) 09:16, 30 December 2012 (UTC)

:Pretty good question! The underlying issue is that there is nothing else we can say about what a morphism is in general; the concept, just like that of object, is entirely abstract. There are ''things'' called objects, and things called morphisms which have one object as source and one object as target, and so forth. Category Theory abstracts from what those things actually consist of.

:What we can do to clarify things is providing examples of categories. Then it is not surprising that morphisms appear to be &quot;something very like functions&quot;, given that in the very familiar example of the '''Set''' category functions are the morphisms, and in the no less familiar example of '''Hask''' Haskell functions are the morphisms. But it needn't be so. For an arbitrary example, you can make a category out of the integer numbers by taking a single object (and it doesn't even matter what it is), the integers as morphisms, addition as composition and zero as identity. For a different sort of example, when Gabriel Gonzalez talks in [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.1.0/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html#g:5 the &lt;tt&gt;pipes&lt;/tt&gt; documentation] about &quot;the category of Unix pipes&quot; he refers to the fact that a &lt;code&gt;Pipe a b m r&lt;/code&gt; is a morphism in a category with &lt;code&gt;(&gt;-&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; as composition and &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; (the forward-as-is pipe) as identity (a neat presentation of the underlying ideas is provided by [http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html &quot;The category design pattern&quot;] in Gabriel's blog).

:As for the relation to monomorphism and polymorphism with respect to types, they are different things. [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Haskell/Category_theory#ID_remark_is_incorrect This question, and Apfelmus' answer to it, may shed some light on the distinction].

== Defintion of composition unclear ==

&quot;A notion of composition of these morphisms. If h is the composition of morphisms f and g, we write &lt;math&gt;h=f\circ g&lt;/math&gt;.&quot;

It is very unclear what the exact requirements are. Is this &quot;notion of composition&quot; the same for all pairs of objects / morphisms? Does it have to exist between all morphisms? 

E.g. the '''Set''' category does not work if composition between all &lt;math&gt;f : A \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g : C \to D&lt;/math&gt; is required even if &lt;math&gt;B \neq C&lt;/math&gt;, but from the &quot;definition&quot; given above, it is not clear why only specific morphisms have to be composable.
How about this (copied from http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category_Theory/Categories#Data )
: 

&quot;For each ordered triple of objects ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;, there is a ''law of composition'': If &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to C&lt;/math&gt;, then the ''composite'' of ''f'' and ''g'' is a morphism &lt;math&gt;g\circ f:A\to C&lt;/math&gt;&quot;

I personally don't know any category theory, so I don't know if that is correct: It would mean that the composition is allowed to follow different laws for different ordered triples of objects.

:Well spotted - &lt;math&gt;f\circ g&lt;/math&gt; is only defined if the target of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the source of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and the text didn't make that clear enough. I rewrote the passage to show sources and targets explicitly.[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 20:24, 12 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

In this tutorial we will create a jewel in Blender. It is fairly simple. I recommend you do this tutorial if you are a noob, because it explains some basic features, but I suggest you read the tutorial syntax and the pages at the very beginning of this Wikibook first. 

== Modeling the jewel ==
Start up Blender if you haven't already. There is a cube in top view (it looks like a square because it is in top view.) Delete it by pressing the X key. Then, to begin modeling, add a circle by pressing '''SPACE'''→''Add''→''Mesh''→''Circle''. Set the vertices to 10 and make sure it is not filled in. Then press OK.

[[File:StepOne.png]]

Next, we will extrude the vertices down. First enter side view by pressing Numpad 3 on your keyboard. As you can see, the circle is flat and not filled in. We will give it some depth. Switch to Edit Mode (TAB) and extrude the circle by pressing the E key and selecting &quot;Only Edges&quot;. Move the mouse down and click to confirm the position (you may want to limit to Z axis by pressing the Z key).

[[File:StepTwo.png]]

OK, what we just did is turn the circle into a hollow cylinder by extruding. But we don't want a cylinder. We want the bottom to be a nice tip. To do this, press Alt-M. This creates a Merging menu. Select &quot;At Center&quot;. Now the bottom is a nice tip, like we want it!

[[File:StepThree.png]]

Now we will edit the top of the jewel. Press A to deselect everything and press the B key. This enters Box-Select Mode. Drag a box over the top vertices to select them.

[[File:StepFour.png]]

Now extrude the vertices upwards a bit (again: E key and &quot;Only Edges&quot;). Next, we will scale down these vertices to look a bit more like a jewel. Make sure the ring of vertices are selected and press the S key. This enters Scale Mode. Scale down the top vertices a bit and click to confirm.

[[File:StepFive.png]]

To look around your jewel model use the Middle Mouse Button or Alt-Left Click. Your jewel is looking fantastic! But there's a big gaping hole at the top. We'll fix that. First, enter side view (Numpad 3). Now extrude the topmost ring of vertices but don't move them anywhere with the mouse. If you are feeling doubtful, just press 0 and then Enter (or just click right mouse button). This makes a duplicate of rings placed over the original. Next merge this new ring with Alt-M -&gt; At Center. This merges the duplicate ring, thus filling up your hole.

At last! Your jewel is finished! Feel free to rotate around it and make further adjustments if you are more advanced with using Blender.

[[File:JewelFinished.png]]

== Shading ==

Switch back to Object Mode (TAB) and show the Shading Panel (F5). Enable the Material Buttons (click on the button with a red ball). Add new material by clicking on &quot;Add New&quot; button in the &quot;Links and Pipeline&quot; tab.  
Copy the settings in the screenshot below. If you are having trouble setting the precise value to a slider, just click on the number. This allows a manual type-in. First, make it green by setting R to 0, G to 1, and B to 0. Next set the alpha slider to 0.458 (it looks like an A). Now press &quot;Ray Mirror&quot; (raytracing reflection) to turn it on and set it to 0.13. Now press &quot;Ray Transparency&quot; and set the IOR value to set 1.44. When you're done it should look like this:

[[File:Jewel_Materials.png]]

== The finishing touch ==
To improve the effect, add a plane underneath the jewel. In the Object Mode (TAB) press SPACE&gt;&gt;ADD&gt;&gt;MESH&gt;&gt;PLANE. Scale it 5 times using the S key. Then move it down a bit using the G key (press the Z key to restrict movement to the Z axis).

You may try to render your jewel now. Press the F12 key. You may find that camera doesn't see whole jewel. 
Move and rotate the camera (using the G and R keys) to set it in the right position. You may want to switch to &quot;Camera View&quot; (Numpad 0) and try out &quot;Camera Fly Mode&quot; (SHIFT F). Try also moving the lamp and see what happens.

I've found that the jewel looks best with Ambient Occlusion on. So go to the Shading window, then the World buttons, click the Amb Occ tab and click the Ambient Occlusion button. 

Here is an example of what you can do:

==Mission Statement==

[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] aims to provide the best freely available Blender 3D instruction on the internet.  Hmm... &quot;best&quot; is so ambiguous... we better clarify a bit:

* Funnest
* Most efficient
* Most inspiring

There, much better.

==Vision==

In order to satisfy the stringent requirements brought by the aforementioned Mission Statement, [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] shall:

* have fun tutorials
** with fun page names
** that build on the principles taught in previous tutorials
** that prefer pictures to words for instruction
** that are littered with beautiful screenshots and renders
** that are organized smartly in the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro#Contents|Table of Contents]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dawn's Fish and Eggplant Curry
Curry Sauce:
2 tablespoons of butter
2 tablespoons of flour
1 tablespoon of lemon juice
4oz. of vegetable broth
3oz. of half and half
2 teaspoons of curry

Melt butter in small sauce pan. Once melted, add flour while stirring it in. Add other ingredients and mix.

Fish and Eggplant:
olive oil
disired fish fillets
disired amount of peeled and diced eggplant
salt to taste
lemon pepper to taste
fresh parsley to taste
minced garlic to taste

In a fry pan sautee the eggplant,lemon pepper, parsley, minced garlic,and salt in olive oil until brown. Remove from pan. In the same pan, add fish fillets. Add eggplant and then curry sauce. Cover until ready to eat.
Fish and Eggplant Curry goes wonderful with rice.

== Para removed from bread ==

&gt; , but unless they have a filling such as peanut butter or tofu slices, they provide inadequate protein on their own.

For some reason this criticism is often levelled at vegetarian foods, yet not levelled at meat eater diet foods, despite the fact that for both diets it is true but of no importance. Any healthy balanced diet does not mean eating only one food, and variation of protein intake from one meal to another is a non-issue.


&gt; Eating in public places, like having lunch at work, can be a challenge.

I cant work out if this is a persdonal issue or a claim that beaing vegetarian is problematic. If the first, a textbook is probably not the ideal place for such things, and if the 2nd I've been to several countries and not found vegetarian eating out a challenge. This is especially so in the wealthier countries where such great variety is available.


&gt; A bread rich in protein is always a good choice

Not so. Soy bread is usually a poor choice for a few reasons, which is why so few people eat it.

[[Image:Thaifishsauce0609.jpg|right|thumb|Fish sauce in a Thai supermarket]]

'''Fish Sauce''', also '''nước mắm''' ([[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnam]]), '''nam pla''' (น้ำปลา - [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thailand]]), '''jeotgal''' ([[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korea]]), is a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] made by [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermenting]] various types of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] (usually [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]]) and [[Cookbook:Pressing|pressing]] to extract the liquid.

Fish sauce is very salty and has a strong flavour, not just of fish (due to the fermentation process). It is an essential ingredient in many South-East Asian recipes. Is is also used as a basis for many other sauces.

When using fish sauce in a recipe, additional salt is generally unnecessary. Quantities of salt vary from country to country and from brand to brand, with Vietnamese fish sauces generally being saltier than those from Thailand. Additionally, some brands of fish sauce are more pungent and primarily for cooking, while others are more delicate and used mostly for salads as a dressing and to finish a dish.

{{Closed|1=I am &lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt;closing&lt;/span&gt; this as '''delete'''. in light of votes below and the wish of the main author to delete -[[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)}}

This book and (presumably) all subpages were nominated by the author for speedy, but at least some have had minor tweaking since then. Seemed worth a look here before deleting, in case any of it's useful. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I almost said that there was nothing there but structure; in fact, the author has wiped content from the top level pages to leave only the speedy delete tag. See [[:Category:Programming/LearnByExample]] for the pages that have actual content. I'll reserve my vote for the moment, until I can check this out further. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 22:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Looks like quite a bit of work when viewing the category. If someone took maybe an hour to revamp the structure a bit, I think this could be used. However, we could also just chop this book up and put its work in the other languages here. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:50, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
* &lt;del&gt;'''Delete'''&lt;/del&gt;. Move the salvageable contents to their respective languages if needed. The (seemingly) only substatial contributor cited &quot;''I did this a while ago, and it's not very useful''&quot; as the reason for {{tl|delete}}. I've emailed the author about this VfD. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
*: Author replied and I may have misunderstood his {{tl|delete}} reason. In his email the author stated that the reason for delete was that he wasn't going to complete it himself. The content may still be useful (I'm not wasting my time going through the history). I'm suspending my vote till I hear from the author again. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
*:: '''Delete'''. Author wants this deleted. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''. I agree with [[User:Swift]] --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:45, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>Protected &quot;[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Rebuttal]]&quot;: This part seems to be done [edit=sysop:move=sysop]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==From SB_Johnny==

I'm not going to make a lengthy rebuttal here: I think Panic's tone and the things he's said in response to the various &quot;charges&quot; speak for themselves only too well. Panic has a long history of disruptive behavior on Wikibooks, beginning with the troubles with Paddu and the moderators who got involved there, later with darklama, James Dennet, and finally with me. 

The issue with Panic is not edit warring... in fact he seems to see &quot;reverting&quot; to be an aggressive act. What he does instead is act uncivilly on talk pages, in such a way as to exert control of the conversation and in turn the editing process. 

His inability to work with others was inherent in the decision to make his &quot;fork&quot; early on. When his fork was disallowed, he returned to the main book, and apparently just kept arguing with Paddu until his &quot;opponent&quot; finally left the project and he could go ahead and do what he wanted. 

Paddu objected to the fork at least in part because these forks were in part copy-pastes of Paddu's work, and so weren't properly attributing in the history page. My guess is that this is where the idea of &quot;using the GFDL as a weapon&quot; came in, and Panic has since been using the GFDL as a justification for editorial control of the book.

In his response to Darklama, Panic seems to have taken the tactic of just saying &quot;well, too bad. Same thing happened to me a while ago, but now I'm the guy in charge, so now you'll have to deal with me.&quot; It's clear that he probably thinks this is actually the &quot;proper way&quot;, since he provides [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paddu&amp;oldid=711957#Moved_from_Panic.27s_talkpage... this link] in his &quot;defendant's reply&quot;. 

In summary, what we have in Panic is someone who doesn't  (or won't) work well with others, but or some reason insists on working on wikibooks, which is by it's very nature a collaborative project. He's very careful not to &quot;violate policies&quot; (though he has a hard time with [[WB:CIVIL]]), but continually violates the spirit of the project. His potential as a good contributor is undermined by his unwillingness to collaborate in a collegial manner. 

The three blocks were for the following reasons:
*'''Block 1:''' Bossing around a new user on talk pages (violating [[WB:CIVIL]]). This was a very short block, intended as a warning (previous written warnings were not being heeded).
*'''Block 2:''' Shortly after the first one, when Panic claimed that it was his &quot;right&quot; to do that, and would continue doing so (using a rather uncivil tone, on darklama's talk page). This block was longer, in part to give Panic some time to reconsider his behavior here, and in part to allow the other two users interested in contributing to discuss the book and how to improve it. 
*'''Block 3:''' Another 2 week block, this time for rearranging talk pages again. The talk pages were reorganized during his &quot;absence&quot; because Panic had apparently been moving them around and reorganizing them (see Paddu's comments on the &quot;Charges&quot; page). He may also have done this because I was no longer interested in arguing with him ad infinitum. Regardless of whether his intent was to push my buttons or to reassert his authority over the C++ book, it was time to stop him (and hopefully get him to try again to take a civil approach to all involved). 

In conclusion, I think my actions were perfectly reasonable. I had tried cajoling, discussion, and explanation... all fruitless, as Panic is interested only in making others see things from his point of view, rather than trying to understand theirs. Both James and Paddu made it clear from the beginning that they would not be willing to contribute to the book if it meant being harassed by Panic. Panic has all along been impossible to work with (either intentionally or unintentionally), has not been willing to budge an inch, and has ignored warnings. There was no option left but to block him for a cooling off.

I still hope Panic can become a good contributor, but he's going to need a moderator working with him for this to happen. As I have mentioned before, I am no longer willing to do it, in part because Panic's hostility is now directed at me as much as at anyone else, and in part because I'm just tired of doing it.

== From darklama ==

I agree with what SB_Johnny said above and including most importantly this isn't about any edit warring. My inviting Paddu was due my belief it is as important part as recent events are in regard to Panic having trouble working together cooperatively. The only part I disagree with is SB_Johnny's suggestion that Panic needs moderation, because that has already been tried for about 5 months without any progress or change. I believe its unreasonable for anyone to need to moderate someone endlessly on working together and being civil.</text>

A '''maggot''' is the larval stage of the fly life cycle, though sometimes &quot;maggot&quot; is used to refer to the larval stage of any insect. Many maggots feed on carrion and other wastes, but some are crop pests and others are predators and parasites.

==Description==
Maggots are generally 4 to 12 mm in length depending on their stage of growth.  Most maggots range from an off-white color to a light brown, though some can be a yellow or reddish color.  Maggots have one pair of tiny hook-like parts to aid in feeding and have no legs.

The adults are easily recognized since this is the only order of insects that has only one pair of wings (&quot;Diptera&quot; meaning 2 wings). 

==Symptoms and Signs==
Pest maggots can be leaf or root feeders, borers, or leaf miners.

==Ecology==
The fly life cycle is composed of four stages: egg, larva (commonly known as a maggot), pupa, and adult. Most feeding is done in the maggot stage.

'''Mites''', together with [[../Ticks/]], belong to the subclass Acarina (also known as Acari) and the class Arachnida. Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all the invertebrate groups. They have exploited an incredible array of habitats, and because of their small size (some are microscopic) most go totally unnoticed. Many live freely in the soil or water, but there are also a large number of species that live as parasites on plants or animals and even some that feed on mold.

Insects may also have parasitic mites. Examples are ''[[../Varroa destructor/]]'' which attaches to the body of the honeybee, and ''[[../Acarapis woodi/]]'', which lives in the tracheae of honeybees. There are hundreds of species of mites associated with other bee species, and most are poorly described and understood. Some are thought to be parasites, while others beneficial symbionts.

There are over 45,000 described species of mites[http://www.sa.waterwatch.org.au/pdfs/critters_4_mites.pdf]. Scientists believe that we have only found 5% of the total diversity of mites. Mites have existed for around 400 million years.

Most mites in the garden are pests, but some mites are predatory on other mites.

==Description==
Mites are very small arthropods, with eight legs and two body segments. They have piercing-sucking mouthparts.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Mite damage includes stippling, discoloration, distorted foliage, and in the case of spider mites webbing.

This topic is completely out of place in an Algebra I curriculum, especially because it is empty. The topic should be deleted because it would require the editor to teach the basics and some of the more advanced aspects of matrices in order to simply solve a linear equation. If I am not mistaken, it is the only reference to matrices in the entire wikibook. It would be much  better suited in an Algebra II curriculum or other higher level math.

* '''Speedy Delete''' - As it has no content and is not suited to the book I see no problems.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 21:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - This is something for the book authors to discuss on their own pages. VfD should not decide what Algebra I consists of and for all we know there could be many pages in that book that might not fit. The book is relatively new (with many structure-only pages) and I suggest we don't interfere with this for now. Once the book authors discuss this, they can give an admin a list of pages to immediately delete if necessary. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:But there's nothing whatsoever on the page.  So there's nothing factual that can be deleted except for the subject headings.  This page has existed since July with no content at all and someone has requested that the page be removed because a) it has no content and b) if it did have content it would not be relevent for the 'Algebra I' book (mainly because it's from a higher level).

*'''Keep''' - On the same conditions that was mentioned by Wthinfocus.  I've been quite upset when a user pushed a content dispute into a VfD in order to flame the issue, and this appears on the surface to be a similar kind of problem.  There are other means to deal with this problem, and rasing a VfD is not the best approach.  This should be decided upon by those who are participating with the development of the Algebra I book, or seem moderation of some sort to attempt to resolve the issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - Agree with Withinfocus. Unlike Wikipedia, wikibooks is more personal about projects. Books have authors and author lists here and as long as policy allows the book, whatever goes in it should be (in 99% of the cases) fine. That other 1% is reserved for vandalism and maybe for useless dangerous stuff (like that chemstry thing that made bombs and supposedly not useful in any class). Depends on how useless and how dangerous. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:06, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. As a matter of precident, I think this page should be deleted, but I dont believe that it should be deleted via VfD discussion. The authors of this book (of which I've played a small part) should discuss the matter internally to the book and make a decision in that way. With that said, I am going to '''be bold''' and remove the VfD notice from that page, replace it with a {{tl|delete}}, and possibly start a discussion about it on the main talk page of the book in an effort to get in touch with the other authors of that book. Because I am essentially moving the discussion away from VfD, I am going to declare this matter '''closed'''. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:At class waves.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:At class waves.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator.

Focaccia Genovese Dough

==Ingredients==

* 5¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] unbleached [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or 4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Kosher|kosher]] salt
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Yeast|instant yeast]]
* 2⅛ cups cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ⅛ cup [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] plus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] for the pan, divided

==Procedure==

# In a 4-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] bowl (or the bowl of an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]]), combine flour, salt, yeast and water.
# With a large metal spoon, stir together until all the flour is absorbed. If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon in cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand.
# When the dough sets up, wash and dry your hands and let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Then add ¼ cup olive oil and dip your hand or spoon again in water and continue to work the dough for another 5 minutes until it is smooth and stretchy. The dough should be very sticky, but it should also have some texture and structure. Even if mixed with the wet hands method, it should still pass the windowpane test. (Snip off a small piece of dough and gently stretch it until it forms a paper-thin, translucent membrane.)
# If the dough seems like a batter and does not have enough structure, work in some more flour.
# Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turn it to coat the dough with the oil, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, the dough should have nearly doubled in size. If not, allow it to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours or until it doubles in size.
# Line a 12-by-17-inch sheet pan (technically called a &quot;half sheet pan&quot; as a 24-by-17-inch or full sheet pan will only fit in a commercial oven) with either baking parchment or a silicon baking pad (Silpat).
#Drizzle about 2 tablespoons of olive oil on the parchment or pad and spread it over the surface. Using a plastic bowl scraper dipped in water, gently transfer the dough from the bowl to the pan, taking care to de-gas the dough as little as possible.
# Drizzle the remaining ¼ cup olive oil on the surface of the dough.
# Using only your fingertips, press down on the dough, creating dimples and pockets all over the surface for the oil to fill. Do not press the dough outward toward the edges of the pan; instead simply press downward at only a slight angle toward the edges. When the dough fills the pan a little more than half full and springs back toward the center, stop pressing and let the dough relax at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
# Repeat the dimpling process, beginning at the center and gradually working out toward the edges of the pan. This time the dough will nearly fill the pan. Again let the dough relax at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
# Repeat the dimpling. This time the dough should fill the pan. Let the dough rise for approximately 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or until it fills the pan.
# Your dough is now ready for topping and baking.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Makes enough dough for 1 (12-by-17-inch) half sheet pan.
* This bread spends more time in the pizza oven than most crusts, 30 to 40 minutes, so it requires special toppings that can take the heat:
** [[Cookbook:Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade|Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade]]
** paper thin slices of [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], seasoned with [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]
** [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce|Marinara Sauce]]
** [[Cookbook:Pesto|Pesto Sauce]]
** [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppers]] and [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]
** Genoa style: just sprinkle with salt

Thanks for experimenting with Wikibooks. Your test worked, and has now been removed. Please use [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] for any other tests you want to do, since testing material in modules will normally be removed quickly.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

Also please make sure that when signing up for a project you need to sign up on the 'talk' page and not the main 'module' page as the instructions say. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 00:55, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

For an explanation of Special:RecentChanges, see [[WB:RC|here]].}}

== A few minor changes ==

I have to suggestions.
# Add a link in the form &lt;code&gt;(&amp;#91;[meta:List of Wikibooks|complete list]])&lt;/code&gt; or something other pithy phrase immediately after the list of wikibookses by ISO language code.
# Change the &quot;edit&quot; link. First off, it should use the domain &quot;en.wikibooks.org&quot; not &quot;www.wikibooks.org.&quot; Secondly, it should use &quot;/w/index.php?title=&quot; not &quot;/w/wiki.phtml?title=.&quot; Also, I would suggest moving it to the bottom-right of the table.
Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 01:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
:Done. : ) --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]]&lt;sup&gt; ([[User talk:Az1568|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 09:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Other languages ==
Isn't the &quot;other languages&quot; link useless because on interwikis ? [[User:J.M. Tavernier|J.M. Tavernier]] 00:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
: Arguably.  Sometimes redundancy is warranted.  --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC[[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]])

* Please, add the interwikis that are missing. If you want, you can use [http://pt.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Caixa_de_areia&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=95124 the list] that I made at pt.wikibooks, only removing the comment tags around &lt;nowiki&gt;[[pt:Special:Recentchanges]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and putting them around your language interwiki. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 14:09, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

== Minor change ==

&quot;'''M''' = minor edit, '''N''' = new&quot; should be changed to &quot;'''m''' = minor edit, '''N''' = new&quot; but it is locked so I can't edit it. Could someone with higher clearance please fix this? [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 11:31, 16 May 2007 (UTC)
:Correct &amp; done - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:35, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

== Browse categories ==

The link to browse by category goes to [[:Category:Main page]] when it should go to [[:Category:Books by subject]] or even [[:Category:Categories]] for the very top level.. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:59, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

== Interwikies ==

{{tl|editprotected}}
Please update the interwiki links with the list below. This is to remove a few closed projects ([[:ast:|Asturian]], [[:co:|Corsican]], [[:lv:|Latvian]], [[:na:|Nauru]], [[:nds:|Low German]], [[:sw:|Swahili]], [[:tk:|Turkmen]], [[:zu:|Zulu]]) and to add the missing [[:tg:|Tajik]] Wikibooks.

'''Socca''' (French), '''Torta di ceci''' or '''Farinata''' (Italian).

''See also: [[Cookbook:Calentita|Calentita]]''

==Ingredients==

* 300g (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]]
* 500ml (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 2 Tbs [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste; 2-3 decent grinds of a grinder should do

==Equipment==

Apart from having the usual kitchen equipment and a good oven, you will need something to cook the ''socca'' on. Traditionally, a 50cm (20 inch) copper plaque is used as it spreads the heat evenly to all parts of the ''socca'', but a good [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|cast iron pan]] will suffice if preheated in the oven first. 

==Procedure==


# Heat oven &amp;ndash; super hot, around 300°C / 570°F is traditional, but whatever your oven can manage that gets close to this. If using a cast-iron pan, get it into the oven at the start so that it is hot when the batter goes into it.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] the ingredients together well, ensuring there are no lumps. This should make a very thin batter, easy to pour.
# Once the oven is up to temperature, pour some of the batter into the pan or onto the plaque, and put into the oven for 8-9 minutes at 300°C / 570°F, or 13-15 minutes at 250°C / 480°F. With a 50cm plaque or pan, cook half the batter at a time &amp;ndash; the batter should cover the plaque or pan very thinly.
# Remove from the oven and cut into triangular wedges. Serve hot.
# Repeat for the rest of the batter.

      <comment>Set stable version settings for &quot;Wikijunior:New Title Policy/Unstable&quot; [Default: Stable, Precedence: Pristine]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Wikijunior community has adopted some restrictions on what titles can be created within Wikijunior.

==Suggesting a title==
To suggest a title, visit the [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions|New Title Suggestions]] page and add the title to a list of proposed Wikijunior books. Regular Wikijunior contributors will be able to view this title and make suggestions. 

Please try to follow the format when suggesting a new title. Include a list of possible articles that would be within the book. Talk about the audience and scope of the title. Provide a list of questions that will be addressed by the articles.

==Voting on new titles==
One way that new books are added to Wikijunior is that they have passed through the [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter|New Book of the Quarter]] voting process.  This process is designed to make sure that a new book is launched once a quarter and that the book has a high level of community support. 

== Other ways of adding books ==
Voting is not the only way to add a book to Wikijunior. In unusual circumstances when trying to meet a contractual obligation such as what has happened with the Beck Foundation when Wikijunior was started, specific book projects can be created by the community independently of the voting process.

If an individual author would like to start a new book on Wikijunior and is willing to contribute substantial content, the author can create the book, suggest it in [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions|New Title Suggestions]], and add it to the [[Wikijunior:All Books|list of all books]]. 

Sometimes a suitable book with substantial appropriate content can be adopted by community consensus into the group of recognized Wikijunior titles without going through the New Book of the Quarter voting process.

==Additional notes==
This is a Wikijunior specific policy, and not something that pertains to Wikibooks in general. 
If in the future, there is increased activity on Wikijunior, this whole policy may be substantially revised or done away with, but for now this will give us a chance to gradually expand without being overwhelmed with a bunch of book stubs that don't go anywhere.

Adding a new Wikijunior book is not a huge thing. Even a brand-new contributors are encouraged to suggest a new title. If you want to write a book and are willing to put the hard work into developing substantial content yourself, we encourage you to do so. Have fun and enjoy working with Wikijunior. We are glad that you are here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think that this document badly needs to be updated and revised. So I'm being bold and doing so. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

==Motion to adopt== 

If there are no objections I will make this policy active on the grounds that: 
# It is a heckuva lot better than what is already there. 
# No-one has spoken against it. 
# Misunderstandings that this document address are damaging to Wikijunior and stifling its development. 
# This document has been up for review for three weeks, and has been well publicized in the staff lounge and on various users talk pages. 

-- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:Keep in mind that I wrote the original &quot;policy&quot; in an attempt to change the eariler &quot;policy&quot; for Wikijunior:  That no other books other than the &quot;original three&quot; Wikijunior books could be written.  I felt that a better solution could happen to allow some new Wikijunior books, but continue the original philosophy of generally slow growth and encouraging a &quot;polishing&quot; of Wikijunior books rather than a huge expansion of titles.  I'll leave the results of this effort to others to try and determine for themselves.
:BTW, I am supportive of the current changes and would suggest that this be moved to become &quot;official policy&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC) 

:: I appreciate that the existing new title policy was an effective problem solving step that helped Wikijunior grow. I'm glad that you find the revised policy to be acceptable. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 16:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Xiangqi, or Chinese Chess, is an extremely popular game in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is currently played by millions (or tens of millions) in China, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong and other Asian countries. Xiangqi has remained in its present form for centuries. It is believed that both Xiangqi and Western Chess derive from the original Indian game of Chanturanga.

Xiang Character (xiáng) Qi Character (qí ) translates to Elephant Game. In Mandarin it is written as either Xiangqi, Xiang Qi or Hsiang-Ch`i and pronounced &quot;Shiang-Chi&quot;. In Cantonese it is written as Jeuhng Keih and pronounced &quot;Junk Kay&quot;.

The name Xiangqi has an interesting origin. Of China's four traditional arts -- qin (music), hua (brush painting), shu (calligraphy) and qí (strategy games) -- the latter term, qi, provides the final syllable of Xiangqi. There is much literature on Xiangqi, most of it in Chinese. There are, however, a few books available in English and other languages.

Xiangqi sets can be procured from a number of sources. The most obvious of these are shops in the Chinese districts of large cities. Often, such sets are quite cheap, consisting of a paper board and flat wooden counters inscribed with red and black pictograms. These traditional Chinese symbols may appear strange to the western eye, but can easily be recognized with a minimum of practice. (For more sophisticated sets, see below.)

==Rules==

==The board==
The Xiangqi board is made up of ten horizontal lines and nine vertical lines. The verticals are interrupted by a central-horizontal void called a river. Two palaces are positioned at opposite sides of the board. Each is distinguished by a cross connecting its four corner points.

http://www.chessvariants.org/xiangqi.dir/xiangqi1.gif

The above board shows various L-shaped markings in order to distinguish the setup points of Pawns and Cannons. These markings are not present on all commercial boards.

'''Chorizo''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] made in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]]. A similar sausage, '''chouriço''', comes from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Portugal|Portugal]].

It typically has a red colour from the use of [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] in its preparation and is usually sold ready to eat, although it can also be used as an ingredient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikijunior Bugs ==

Sam86,

I would like to propose an alternate layout for the wikijunior bugs page. As you are one of the named authors, i have come to you directly to see what you think of the idea. I have made a mock-up of the proposed layout on my [[User:Urbane_User/Sandbox|personal sandbox]] which can be accessed by clicking this link or through my user page. All of the existing articles and other pages will remain unaltered by this as the only page that will change will be the main bugs page, if it is accepted that is.

I have proposed this new design to increase efficiency and reduce the amount of time that is spent moving articles from the stub list into the developing articles list and so on...

Please take a look and tell me what you think.

Regards,
Urbane User

== Invitation of a Wikibook study ==
Hello Sam86,

I read the Wikijunior Bug. I'm very impressed and interested to know more about your experience related to this particular book project (Wikijunior Bug) I'm current a doctoral student at Indiana University (US). My advisor and I, we are starting a Wikibook study regarding to online authors' beliefs and perceptions (motivation to write a Wikibook, beliefs about the knowledge of the topic, previous experience and success in writing a Wikibook, and ability to help coordinate the Wikibook project and interact with other authors). 

We would love to invite you to participate in this study. If you agree to participate, please leave me a message or send me an email. (My email is cl17@indiana.edu.) We'll send 14 open-ended questions by email (email interview). Your input to this study will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much again. Inkeys</text>

==Chapter 1. History, Aims and Approaches of Animal Behavior==
This chapter introduces the main topics that are covered by this field of research. A historical account discusses how we have tried to explore the behavior of humans and animals, to understand the biological constraints that impact our cognitive potential, and to make sense of the nature of human and animal personalities. As a scientific discipline Animal Behavior conforms to the rigors of the Scientific Method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) states that if an estate or an interest in land is sold subject to the right of reconveyance to the vendor, or someone connected with the vendor, then the following rule applies.

The vendor is deemed to have received as rental income the amount by which the price at which the estate or interest is sold exceeds the price at which it is to be reconveyed. If, however, the earliest date for the reconveyence is two or more years after the sale, this amount is reduced by one-fiftieth for each complete year, other than the first, in the period between the sale and the date of earliest reconveyance.

Subsection (2) deals with the situation where the date of reconveyance is not fixed. If the price of reconveyance changes depending on the date, it is taken to be the lowest price possible under the terms of the sale. If this rule leads to more corporation tax arising to the vendor than would have been the case had the actual date of reconveyance been fixed, the vendor has six years in which to make a claim for repayment of the additional tax.

Subsection (3) introduces a rule where the terms of the sale provide for the grant of a lease directly or indirectly out of the estate or interest of land to the vendor or a person connected with the vendor.

The rule is that the grant of the lease is treated as a reconvenyance of the estate or interest at a price equal to the premium for the lease and the value at the date of the sale of the right to receive a conveyance of the reversion immediately after the lease begins to run.

Subsection (4) disapplies subsection (3) where the lease is granted and begins to run within one month after the sale.

Subsection (4A) provides that an amount deemed to be the vendor's rental income under this section is treated as received on the date of the sale, and is taken into account when computing taxable rental income in the accounting period on which that date falls.

Subsection (4B) provides that, for these purposes, the sale happens when any of the following happen:

*an unconditional contract for the sale is entered into;
*a conditional contract for the sale becomes unconditional;
*an option or right of pre-emption is exercised requiring the vendor to enter into an unconditional contract for the sale.

Subsection (5) provides that &quot;connected with&quot; in this section is construed in accordance with [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 839 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|section 839 ICTA]].

'''Fava beans''', also '''faba beans''', '''ful''', '''horse beans''', are strong flavoured beans with tough hulls. Large fava beans are often called '''[[Cookbook:Broad Bean|broad beans]]''' in English-speaking countries. 

Fava beans are much used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]], [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern]], and [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian]] cuisines, and also feature in other cuisines.

Fava beans can be bought in the following forms:
* Green, in the pod
* Green, shelled and frozen
* Dried, shelled
* Dried, shelled and hulled, often also split

== Notes and TODOs ==
&lt;i&gt;
* TODO: Pour lazy evaluation explanation from [[../Laziness/]] into this mold.
* TODO: better section names.
* TODO: ponder the graphical representation of graphs.
** No grapical representation, do it with &lt;code&gt;let .. in&lt;/code&gt;. Pro: Reduction are easiest to perform in that way anyway. Cons: no graphic.
** ASCII art / line art similar to the one in Bird&amp;Wadler? Pro: displays only the relevant parts truly as graph, easy to perform on paper. Cons: Ugly, no large graphs with that.
** Full blown graphs with @-nodes? Pro: look graphy. Cons: nobody needs to know @-nodes in order to understand graph reduction. Can be explained in the implementation section.
** Graphs without @-nodes. Pro: easy to understand. Cons: what about currying?
* ! Keep this chapter short. The sooner the reader knows how to evaluate Haskell programs by hand, the better.
* First sections closely follow Bird&amp;Wadler
&lt;/i&gt;

== Introduction ==
Programming is not only about writing correct programs, answered by denotational semantics, but also about writing fast ones that require little memory. For that, we need to know how they're executed on a machine, commonly given by operational semantics. This chapter explains how Haskell programs are commonly executed on a real computer and thus serves as foundation for analyzing time and space usage. Note that the Haskell standard deliberately does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; give operational semantics, implementations are free to choose their own. But so far, every implementation of Haskell more or less closely follows the execution model of &lt;em&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/em&gt;.

In the following, we will detail lazy evaluation and subsequently use this execution model to explain and exemplify the reasoning about time and memory complexity of Haskell programs.

== Evaluating Expressions by Lazy Evaluation ==
=== Reductions ===
Executing a functional program, i.e. evaluating an expression, means to repeatedly apply function definitions until all function applications have been expanded. Take for example the expression &lt;code&gt;pythagoras 3 4&lt;/code&gt; together with the definitions

       square x = x * x
 pythagoras x y = square x + square y

One possible sequence of such &lt;b&gt;reduction&lt;/b&gt;s is

 pythagoras 3 4
  &amp;rArr; square 3 + square 4   (pythagoras)
  &amp;rArr;    (3*3) + square 4   (square)
  &amp;rArr;        9 + square 4   (*)
  &amp;rArr;        9 + (4*4)      (square)
  &amp;rArr;        9 + 16         (*)
  &amp;rArr;          25

Every reduction replaces a subexpression, called &lt;b&gt;reducible expression&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;redex&lt;/b&gt; for short, with an equivalent one, either by appealing to a function definition like for &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; or by using a built-in function like &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt;. An expression without redexes is said to be in &lt;b&gt;normal form&lt;/b&gt;. Of course, execution stops once reaching a normal form which thus is the result of the computation.

Clearly, the fewer reductions that have to be performed, the faster the program runs. We cannot expect each reduction step to take the same amount of time because its implementation on real hardware looks very different, but in terms of asymptotic complexity, this number of reductions is an accurate measure.

=== Reduction Strategies ===
There are many possible reduction sequences and the number of reductions may depend on the order in which reductions are performed. Take for example the expression &lt;code&gt;fst (square 3, square 4)&lt;/code&gt;. One systematic possibility is to evaluate all function arguments before applying the function definition

 fst (square 3, square 4)
  &amp;rArr; fst (3*3, square 4)   (square)
  &amp;rArr; fst ( 9 , square 4)   (*)
  &amp;rArr; fst ( 9 , 4*4)        (square)
  &amp;rArr; fst ( 9 , 16 )        (*)
  &amp;rArr; 9                     (fst)

This is called an &lt;b&gt;innermost reduction&lt;/b&gt; strategy and an &lt;b&gt;innermost redex&lt;/b&gt; is a redex that has no other redex as subexpression inside.

Another systematic possibility is to apply all function definitions first and only then evaluate arguments:

 fst (square 3, square 4)
  &amp;rArr;  square 3             (fst)
  &amp;rArr;  3*3                  (square)
  &amp;rArr;  9                    (*)

which is named &lt;b&gt;outermost reduction&lt;/b&gt; and always reduces &lt;b&gt;outermost redex&lt;/b&gt;es that are not inside another redex. Here, the outermost reduction uses fewer reduction steps than the innermost reduction. Why? Because the function &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; doesn't need the second component of the pair and the reduction of &lt;code&gt;square 4&lt;/code&gt; was superfluous.

=== Termination ===
For some expressions like

 loop = 1 + loop

no reduction sequence may terminate and program execution enters a neverending loop, those expressions do not have a normal form. But there are also expressions where some reduction sequences terminate and some do not, an example being

 fst (42, loop)
  &amp;rArr;  42                   (fst)
 
 fst (42, loop)
  &amp;rArr;  fst (42,1+loop)      (loop)
  &amp;rArr;  fst (42,1+(1+loop))  (loop)
  &amp;rArr;  ...

The first reduction sequence is outermost reduction and the second is innermost reduction which tries in vain to evaluate the &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; even though it is ignored by &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; anyway. The ability to evaluate function arguments only when needed is what makes outermost optimal when it comes to termination:

;Theorem (Church Rosser II): If there is one terminating reduction, then outermost reduction will terminate, too.

=== Graph Reduction (Reduction + Sharing) ===
Despite the ability to discard arguments, outermost reduction doesn't always take fewer reduction steps than innermost reduction:

 square (1+2)
  &amp;rArr;  (1+2)*(1+2)          (square)
  &amp;rArr;  (1+2)*3              (+)
  &amp;rArr;      3*3              (+)
  &amp;rArr;       9               (*)

Here, the argument &lt;code&gt;(1+2)&lt;/code&gt; is duplicated and subsequently reduced twice. But because it is one and the same argument, the solution is to share the reduction &lt;code&gt;(1+2) &amp;rArr; 3&lt;/code&gt; with all other incarnations of this argument. This can be achieved by representing expressions as &lt;em&gt;graphs&lt;/em&gt;. For example, 

  __________
 |   |     &amp;darr;
 &amp;loz; * &amp;loz;     (1+2)

represents the expression &lt;code&gt;(1+2)*(1+2)&lt;/code&gt;. Now, the &lt;b&gt;outermost graph reduction&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;code&gt;square (1+2)&lt;/code&gt; proceeds as follows

 square (1+2)
  &amp;rArr;  __________           (square)
     |   |     &amp;darr;
     &amp;loz; * &amp;loz;     (1+2)
  &amp;rArr;  __________           (+)
     |   |     &amp;darr;
     &amp;loz; * &amp;loz;      3
 
  &amp;rArr; 9                     (*)

and the work has been shared. In other words, outermost graph reduction now reduces every argument at most once. For this reason, it always takes fewer reduction steps than the innermost reduction, a fact we will prove when [[#Reasoning about Time|reasoning about time]].

Sharing of expressions is also introduced with &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; constructs. For instance, consider [[w:Heron's formula|Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle with sides &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;:

 area a b c = let s = (a+b+c)/2 in
      sqrt (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))

Instantiating this to an equilateral triangle will reduce as

 area 1 1 1
  &amp;rArr;        _____________________             (area)
           |  |    |     |      &amp;darr;
     sqrt (&amp;loz;*(&amp;loz;-a)*(&amp;loz;-b)*(&amp;loz;-c))  ((1+1+1)/2)
  &amp;rArr;        _____________________             (+),(+),(/)
           |  |    |     |      &amp;darr;
     sqrt (&amp;loz;*(&amp;loz;-a)*(&amp;loz;-b)*(&amp;loz;-c))  1.5
  &amp;rArr;
     ...
  &amp;rArr;
     0.433012702

which is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt3/4&lt;/math&gt;. Put differently, &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;-bindings simply give names to nodes in the graph. In fact, one can dispense entirely with a graphical notation and solely rely on &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; to mark sharing and express a graph structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = John Maraist, Martin Odersky, and Philip Wadler

Any implementation of Haskell is in some form based on outermost graph reduction which thus provides a good model for reasoning about the asympotic complexity of time and memory allocation. The number of reduction steps to reach normal form corresponds to the execution time and the size of the terms in the graph corresponds to the memory used.

{{Exercises|1=
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Reduce &lt;code&gt;square (square 3)&lt;/code&gt; to normal form with innermost, outermost and outermost graph reduction.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Consider the fast exponentiation algorithm
 power x 0 = 1
 power x n = x' * x' * (if n `mod` 2 == 0 then 1 else x)
   where x' = power x (n `div` 2)
that takes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the power of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. Reduce &lt;code&gt;power 2 5&lt;/code&gt; with innermost and outermost graph reduction. How many reductions are performed? What is the asymptotic time complexity for the general &lt;code&gt;power 2 n&lt;/code&gt;? What happens to the algorithm if we use &quot;graphless&quot; outermost reduction?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; }}

=== Pattern Matching ===
So far, our description of outermost graph reduction is still underspecified when it comes to pattern matching and data constructors. Explaining these points will enable the reader to trace most cases of the reduction strategy that is commonly the base for implementing non-strict functional languages like Haskell. It is called &lt;b&gt;call-by-need&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/b&gt; in allusion to the fact that it &quot;lazily&quot; postpones the reduction of function arguments to the last possible moment. Of course, the remaining details are covered in subsequent chapters.

To see how pattern matching needs specification, consider for example the boolean disjunction

 or True  y = True
 or False y = y

and the expression

 or (1==1) loop

with a non-terminating &lt;code&gt;loop = not loop&lt;/code&gt;. The following reduction sequence 
 
 or (1==1) loop
  &amp;rArr; or (1==1) (not loop)        (loop)
  &amp;rArr; or (1==1) (not (not loop))  (loop)
  &amp;rArr; ...

only reduces outermost redexes and therefore is an outermost reduction. But

 or (1==1) loop
  &amp;rArr; or True   loop              (or)
  &amp;rArr; True

makes much more sense. Of course, we just want to apply the definition of &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; and are only reducing arguments to decide which equation to choose. This intention is captured by the following rules for pattern matching in Haskell:
* Left hand sides are matched from top to bottom
* When matching a left hand side, arguments are matched from left to right
* Evaluate arguments only as much as needed to decide whether they match or not.
Thus, for our example &lt;code&gt;or (1==1) loop&lt;/code&gt;, we have to reduce the first argument to either &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, then evaluate the second to match a variable &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; pattern and then expand the matching function definition. As the match against a variable always succeeds, the second argument will not be reduced at all. It is the second reduction section above that reproduces this behavior.

With these preparations, the reader should now be able to evaluate most Haskell expressions. Here are some random encounters to test this ability:
{{Exercises|1=Reduce the following expressions with lazy evaluation to normal form. Assume the standard function definitions from the Prelude.

}}

=== Higher Order Functions ===
The remaining point to clarify is the reduction of higher order functions and currying. For instance, consider the definitions

 id x = x
 a = id (+1) 41

 twice f = f . f
 b = twice (+1) (13*3)

where both &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;twice&lt;/code&gt; are only defined with one argument. The solution is to see multiple arguments as subsequent applications to one argument, this is called &lt;b&gt;currying&lt;/b&gt;

 a = (id    (+1)) 41
 b = (twice (+1)) (13*3)

To reduce an arbitrary application &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expression&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, call-by-need first reduce &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; until this becomes a function whose definition can be unfolded with the argument &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expression&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Hence, the reduction sequences are

 a
  &amp;rArr; (id (+1)) 41          (a)
  &amp;rArr; (+1) 41               (id)
  &amp;rArr; 42                    (+)
 
 b
  &amp;rArr; (twice (+1)) (13*3)   (b)
  &amp;rArr; ((+1).(+1) ) (13*3)   (twice)
  &amp;rArr; (+1) ((+1) (13*3))    (.)
  &amp;rArr; (+1) ((+1)  39)       (*)
  &amp;rArr; (+1) 40               (+)
  &amp;rArr; 41                    (+)

Admittedly, the description is a bit vague and the next section will detail a way to state it  clearly.

While it may seem that pattern matching is the workhorse of time intensive computations and higher order functions are only for capturing the essence of an algorithm, functions are indeed useful as data structures. One example are difference lists (&lt;code&gt;[a] -&gt; [a]&lt;/code&gt;) that permit concatenation in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time, another is the representation of a stream by a fold. In fact, all data structures are represented as functions in the pure lambda calculus, the root of all functional programming languages.

&lt;i&gt;Exercises! Or not? Diff-Lists Best done with &lt;code&gt;foldl (++)&lt;/code&gt; but this requires knowledge of the fold example. Oh, where do we introduce the foldl VS. foldr example at all? Hm, Bird&amp;Wadler sneak in an extra section &quot;Meet again with fold&quot; for the (++) example at the end of &quot;Controlling reduction order and space requirements&quot; :-/ The complexity of (++) is explained when arguing about &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

=== Weak Head Normal Form ===
To formulate precisely how lazy evaluation chooses its reduction sequence, it is best to abandon equational function definitions and replace them with an expression-oriented approach. In other words, our goal is to translate function definitions like &lt;code&gt;f (x:xs) = ...&lt;/code&gt; into the form &lt;code&gt;f = &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This can be done with two primitives, namely case-expressions and lambda abstractions.

In their primitive form, case-expressions only allow the discrimination of the outermost constructor. For instance, the primitive case-expression for lists has the form

 case &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt; of
   []   -&gt; ...
   x:xs -&gt; ...

Lambda abstractions are functions of one parameter, so that the following two definitions are equivalent

 f x = &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt;
 f   = \x -&gt; &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt;

Here is a translation of the definition of &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt;

 zip :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [(a,a)]
 zip []      ys      = []
 zip xs      []      = []
 zip (x:xs') (y:ys') = (x,y):zip xs' ys'

to case-expressions and lambda-abstractions:

 zip = \xs -&gt; \ys -&gt;
    case xs of
       []    -&gt; []
       x:xs' -&gt;
          case ys of
             []    -&gt; []
             y:ys' -&gt; (x,y):zip xs' ys'

Assuming that all definitions have been translated to those primitives, every redex now has the form of either
* a function application &lt;code&gt; (\&lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;-&gt;&lt;i&gt;expression&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
* or a case-expression &lt;code&gt;case &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt; of { ... } &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;em&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/em&gt;.

;Weak Head Normal Form:An expression is in weak head normal form, iff it is either
*a constructor (possibly applied to arguments) like &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Just (square 42)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(:) 1&lt;/code&gt;
*a built-in function applied to too few arguments (perhaps none) like &lt;code&gt;(+) 2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt;.
*or a lambda abstraction &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;functions types cannot be pattern matched anyway, but the devious seq can evaluate them to WHNF nonetheless. &quot;weak&quot; = no reduction under lambdas. &quot;head&quot; = first the function application, then the arguments.
&lt;/i&gt;

=== Strict and Non-strict Functions ===
&lt;i&gt;A non-strict function doesn't need its argument. A strict function needs its argument in WHNF, as long as we do not distinguish between different forms of non-termination (&lt;code&gt;f x = loop&lt;/code&gt; doesn't need its argument, for example).&lt;/i&gt;

== Controlling Space ==

&quot;Space&quot; here may be better visualized as traversal of a graph. Either a data structure, or an induced dependencies graph. For instance : Fibonacci(N) depends on : Nothing if N = 0 or N = 1 ; Fibonacci(N-1) and Fibonacci(N-2) else. As Fibonacci(N-1) depends on Fibonacci(N-2), the induced graph is not a tree. Therefore, there is a correspondence between implementation technique and data structure traversal :
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Corresponding Implementation technique !! Data Structure Traversal
|-
| Memoization || Depth First Search (keep every intermediary result in memory)
|-
| Parallel evaluation || Breadth First Search (keep every intermediary result in memory, too)
|-
| Sharing || Directed acyclic graph traversal (Maintain only a &quot;frontier&quot; in memory.)
|-
| Usual recursion || Tree traversal (Fill a stack)
|-
| Tail recursion || List traversal / Greedy Search (Constant space)
|}

The classical :

  fibo 0 = 1
  fibo 1 = 1
  fibo n = fibo (n-1) + fibo (n-2)

Is a tree traversal applied to a directed acyclic graph for the worse. The optimized version :

 fibo n = 
  let f a b m =
     if m = 0 then a
     if m = 1 then b
     f b (a+b) (m-1)
  in f 1 1 n

Uses a DAG traversal. Luckily, the frontier size is constant, so it's a tail recursive algorithm.

&lt;i&gt;NOTE: The chapter [[../Strictness]] is intended to elaborate on the stuff here.

NOTE: The notion of strict function is to be introduced before this section.

Now's the time for the space-eating fold example:

 foldl (+) 0 [1..10]

Introduce &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$!&lt;/code&gt; that can force an expression to WHNF. =&gt; &lt;code&gt;foldl'&lt;/code&gt;.


Tricky space leak example:

 (\xs -&gt; head xs + last xs) [1..n]
 (\xs -&gt; last xs + head xs) [1..n]

The first version runs on O(1) space. The second in O(n).
&lt;/i&gt;

=== Sharing and CSE ===
&lt;i&gt;NOTE: overlaps with section about time. Hm, make an extra memoization section?

How to share

 foo x y = -- s is not shared
 foo x = \y -&gt; s + y
   where s = expensive x -- s is shared

&quot;Lambda-lifting&quot;, &quot;Full laziness&quot;. The compiler should not do full laziness.

A classic and important example for the trade between space and time:

 sublists []      = [[]]
 sublists (x:xs)  = sublists xs ++ map (x:) (sublists xs)
 sublists' (x:xs) = let ys = sublists' xs in ys ++ map (x:) ys

That's why the compiler should not do common subexpression elimination as optimization. (Does GHC?).
&lt;/i&gt;

=== Tail recursion ===
&lt;i&gt;NOTE: Does this belong to the space section? I think so, it's about stack space.

Tail recursion in Haskell looks different.
&lt;/i&gt;

== Reasoning about Time ==
&lt;i&gt;Note: introducing strictness before the upper time bound saves some hassle with explanation?&lt;/i&gt;

=== Lazy eval &lt; Eager eval ===
&lt;i&gt;When reasoning about execution time, naively performing graph reduction by hand to get a clue on what's going on is most often infeasible. In fact, the order of evaluation taken by lazy evaluation is difficult to predict by humans, it is much easier to trace the path of eager evaluation where arguments are reduced to normal form before being supplied to a function. But knowing that lazy evaluation always performs less reduction steps than eager evaluation (present the proof!), we can easily get an upper bound for the number of reductions by pretending that our function is evaluated eagerly.

Example:
 or = foldr (||) False
 isPrime n = not $ or $ map (\k -&gt; n `mod` k == 0) [2..n-1]

=&gt; eager evaluation always takes n steps, lazy won't take more than that. But it will actually take fewer.
&lt;/i&gt;

=== Throwing away arguments ===
&lt;i&gt;Time bound exact for functions that examine their argument to normal form anyway. The property that a function needs its argument can concisely be captured by denotational semantics:

 f &amp;perp; = &amp;perp;

Argument in WHNF only, though. Operationally: non-termination -&gt; non-termination. (this is an approximation only, though because f anything = &amp;perp; doesn't &quot;need&quot; its argument). Non-strict functions don't need their argument and eager time bound is not sharp. But the information whether a function is strict or not can already be used to great benefit in the analysis.

 isPrime n = not $ or $ (n `mod` 2 == 0) : (n `mod` 3 == 0) : ...

It's enough to know &lt;code&gt;or True &amp;perp; = True&lt;/code&gt;.

Other examples:
*&lt;code&gt;foldr (:) []&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;foldl (flip (:)) []&lt;/code&gt; with &amp;perp;.
* Can &lt;code&gt;head . mergesort&lt;/code&gt; be analyzed only with &amp;perp;? In any case, this example is too involed and belongs to [[../Laziness]].
&lt;/i&gt;

=== Persistence &amp; Amortisation ===
&lt;i&gt;
NOTE: this section is better left to a data structures chapter because the subsections above cover most of the cases a programmer not focussing on data structures / amortization will encounter.

Persistence = no updates in place, older versions are still there.
Amortisation = distribute unequal running times across a sequence of operations.
Both don't go well together in a strict setting. Lazy evaluation can reconcile them. Debit invariants. Example: incrementing numbers in binary representation.
&lt;/i&gt;

== Implementation of Graph reduction ==
&lt;i&gt;Small talk about G-machines and such. Main definition:

closure = thunk = code/data pair on the heap. What do they do? Consider &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.\lambda y.x+y) 2&lt;/math&gt;. This is a function that returns a function, namely &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.2+y&lt;/math&gt; in this case. But when you want to compile code, it's prohibitive to actually perform the substitution in memory and replace all occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by 2. So, you return a closure that consists of the function code &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.x+y&lt;/math&gt; and an environment &lt;math&gt;\{x=2\}&lt;/math&gt; that assigns values to the free variables appearing in there.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;
GHC (?, most Haskell implementations?) avoid free variables completely and use supercombinators. In other words, they're supplied as extra-parameters and the observation that lambda-expressions with too few parameters don't need to be reduced since their WHNF is not very different.

Note that these terms are technical terms for implementation stuff, lazy evaluation happily lives without them. Don't use them in any of the sections above.
&lt;/i&gt;

'''''Dianthus''''' is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, native mainly to Europe and Asia, with a few species extending south to north Africa, and one species (''D. repens'') in arctic North America. Common names include '''carnation''' (''D. caryophyllus''), '''pink''' (''D. plumarius'' and related species) and '''sweet william''' (''D. barbatus''). The name ''Dianthus'' is from the Greek words ''dios'' (&quot;god&quot;) and ''anthos'' (&quot;flower&quot;), and was cited by the Greek botanist Theophrastus.

The color pink may actually be named after the flower. The origin of the flower name 'pink' is unknown.

==Description==
The species are mostly perennial herbs, a few are annual or biennial, and some are low subshrubs with woody basal stems. Stems are swollen at the nodes, and contain a clear sap.

The leaves are opposite and simple with entire margins and petioles that wrap around the stem, mostly linear and often strongly glaucous grey-green to blue-green. 

The flowers are solitary or in panicles, with leafy bracts beneath and five petals, typically with a frilled or notched margin. In almost all species they are pale to dark pink, but at least one species (''D. knappii'') has yellow flowers with a purple centre. 

==Growing conditions==
Moist, well-drained, not overly rich soils, full sun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Mac OS X 10.4 (and most likely all versions of OS X) OpenGL and GLUT are installed with the Xcode/developer tools that came on your Mac OS X installation disc(s).

----

To use GLUT and OpenGL from within Xcode:

* open Xcode located in &quot;/Developer/Applications/&quot;
* choose &quot;New Project&quot; from the file menu
* choose &quot;Command Line Tool&quot; under the Application template for Mac OS X
* choose type &quot;C++&quot;
* enter your desired project name and directory
* from the &quot;Action&quot; menu (which has a picture of a small gear on it) select &quot;Add -&gt; Existing Frameworks&quot;
* frameworks are stored in &quot;/System/Library/Frameworks/&quot;, from there select and add GLUT &amp; OpenGL

When &amp;#35;including OpenGL &amp; GLUT header files (but not the regular ones like iostream) within Xcode, make sure to do so like this:

 &amp;#35;include &lt;OpenGL/gl.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;#35;include &lt;OpenGl/glu.h&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &amp;#35;include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;

in other words:

 &amp;#35;include &lt;''name_of_framework''/''name_of_header_file''.h&gt;

:''As feared, the death toll is still on the rise after the severe earthquake in the Indian Ocean and the  tsunami that was caused by it on the coast of Aceh. The destruction and the loss of human life is exceptionally large, especially the casualties amongst children. The demand for aid of all sorts is enormous but the interruption of practically all communication is a great obstacle to an adequate relief effort.''

==The -ing problem==
In English the ''-ing'' form is used extensively for a number of rather different functions. Although Dutch also has an ending -ing it does ''not'' correspond to the English one in most situations:

#''he is sing'''ing'''''
#:''hij is aan het zing'''en'''''
#''he walked out of the room sing'''ing'''''
#:''hij liep zingen'''d''' de kamer uit''
#''singing is her profession''
#:''z'''a'''ng is haar beroep''

In the above examples ''singing'' is used as:

# part of the present continuous tense
# as a participle 
# as a verbal noun (gerund). 

In Dutch ''different'' nouns are used in these three cases none of which ends in ''-ing''

Properly rendering -ing forms in Dutch may therefore present a bit of a problem for an English speaker.

==Continuous tenses==
In the strict sense Dutch does not have continuous times and in many cases where English uses them Dutch will use a simple present or past.

:''he '''was walking''' to school when he saw the UFO''
::''hij '''liep''' naar school toen hij de vliegende schotel zag''
::''hij '''was [[wikt:nl:onderweg|onderweg]]''' naar school toen hij de vliegende schotel zag''

To emphasize continuity Dutch can use the ''infinitive as a neutral noun'' preceded by the preposition ''aan'':

:''hij was '''aan het [[wikt:nl:wandelen|wandelen]]'''''
::''he was going for a walk''
:''zij waren '''aan het verhuizen'''''
::''they were busy moving''

Another common construction is to use an auxiliary verb like ''zitten'',''staan'',''liggen'', ''lopen''

:''de voetballer '''liep''' op de scheidsrechter '''te schelden'''.''
:: the soccer player walked around fuming at the umpire.
:''ik '''zat te denken'''''
::I was just thinking (on my chair)

The &quot;on my chair&quot; or &quot;on my feet&quot; distinction is often of negligible importance and the verbs zitten, liggen etc. are used more or less interchangeably as auxiliaries of the continuous aspect.

==Present participles==
The present participle in Dutch is formed by adding ''-d(e)'' ('''not:''' ''-ing'') to the infinitive:

:lopen – lopend(e)
:staan – staand

As in English it can be used as adjective:

:'''''flying''' saucer''
::'''''vliegende''' [[wikt:nl:schotel|schotel]]''

But it is rarely used as a (static) predicate:

:''kinine is '''[[wikt:nl:koortswerend|koortswerend]]'''''
::''quinine has the property of '''abating fever'''''

Using it in a continuous tense construction as in English sounds odd and rather ironic.

:''ach, was jij schrijvende?''
::roughly: ''Wow, did I catch you in writing mode?''

Present participles are seldom used to initiate a clause as is common in English:

: ''The second car '''moving''' at greater speed could not stop''
: ''De tweede auto '''die sneller reed''' kon niet stoppen''
: ''De tweede, '''sneller rijdende''' auto kon niet stoppen''

Either the participle ''rijdend'' is used as a preceding adjective or it is avoided by paraphrase.

==Gerunds==
The term ''gerund'' is seldom used in Dutch grammar. One could argue that Dutch does not have one in the English sense of the word, despite the presence of a rich variety of verbal nouns. 

First of all, in many cases Dutch uses the infinitive as a neutral noun where English uses a gerund in ''-ing'' and one could argue that this is the Dutch gerund:

:''addition and subtraction are the basis of arithmetic''
::[[wikt:nl:optellen|''optell'''en''']] en [[wikt:nl:aftrekken|aftrekk'''en''']] vormen de grondslag van het [[wikt:nl:rekenen|reken'''en''''']]

There are subtle differences associated with the use or omission of the neutral article ''het'', but the same holds in English:

:singing is healthy – zingen is gezond
:the singing finally ended – het zingen hield eindelijk op

There is typically no plural. In times past the word did get inflected -as Latin gerunds do-, e.g.:

:''Tot zien'''s'''!'' - See you!
:''Willen'''s''' en weten'''s''''' - Deliberately.

The -s ending is an old genitive.

===Suffix ''-ing''===
Many Dutch verbs do form a (feminine) verbal noun in -ing, but it usually corresponds more to  an English noun with (latinate) ending ''-ion'' than to a gerund with ''-ing'':

:''deze aftrekk'''ing''' is niet juist''
::''this subtract'''ion''' is incorrect''

Note that ''de aftrekking'' denotes a particular case of subtraction, where ''het aftrekken'' denotes the general process of subtracting

The formation of a verbal noun is ''-ing'' is quite common, particularly for verbs with prefixes like ''ver-'', ''be-'', ''af-'' etc. It is also a ''productive'' suffix, which means that newly formed verbs tend to form their verbal noun this way. It has a plural in -en:

:zegening – zegeningen
:blessing – blessings

However, the '''''-ing''''' form is certainly not as ubiquitous as in English where only a few verbs like ''can'' or ''must'' do not possess one. Not all Dutch verbs have an ''-ing'' form as there is a number of older ways to form verbal nouns, although most of them are no longer productive.

The ''-ing'' verbal noun is feminine and occurs frequently with &quot;ter&quot; (te + the old feminine dative de''r''), which translates roughly into &quot;in order to&quot;. 
:Hij besprak maatregelen '''ter verbetering''' daarvan - He discussed methods that could be used to improve that.

This process is still productive:
:ter wikifiëring -- to be wikified

Interestingly, this means that even north of the Great Rivers feminine gender is not quite dead yet...

===Verbal stems===
Many strong verbs have a verbal noun based on the stem of the verb with ''ablaut'' (vowel change) and lack an -ing form:

:h'''e'''lpen – de h'''u'''lp
:''na drie dagen kwam er eindelijk hulp''
::''after three days help finally arrived''

:wr'''e'''ken – de wr'''aa'''k:
:''wraak is zoet''
::''revenge is sweet''

:z'''i'''ngen – de z'''a'''ng
:''hij studeert zang''
::''he is studying voice''

Notice that in these cases forms in -ing like *helping, *zinging do '''not''' exist in Dutch.

Sometimes the vowel does not change:

:lopen – de loop
:''in de loop van het proces''
::''in the course of the process''

These nouns are typically common gender and often lack a plural, but this does not always hold. For example a weak verb like ''werken'' has '''''het''' werk'' and a plural ''de werk'''en'''''

===Other endings===
Some verbs add '''''-t''''' or '''''-st''''' to the stem, a process not entirely unfamiliar in English:

:vliegen – de vluch'''t''' – plural: de vluchten
:to fly – the fligh'''t'''

:telen – teelt (no plural)
:cultivate – cultivation

At times, there is more than one verbal noun:

:graven – graf – gracht (&lt;graft 1600's) 
:to dig – grave – canal

Plurals:
:graf – graven
:gracht – grachten

After nasals '''''-st''''' is more common:

:dienen – de dienst – plural: de diensten
::to serve – service

:komen – de komst – no plural
::come – advent, arrival

:vangen – de vangst
::catch – catch
:''de vangst van kabeljauw bij de Canadese kust is gestaakt''
::''cod fishing has been suspended off the coast of Canada''

A few verbs have '''''-te''''':

:behoeven – de behoefte
:: need – need
: baren – geboorte
:: give birth – birth

Plurals have '''''-s''''': behoeftes, geboortes, sometimes  also '''''-n''''': 

:denken – gedachten, gedachtes
:think – thought(s)

Other verbs have '''''-nis''''', '''''-enis''''' or '''''-tenis'''''

:kennen – kennis
::to know – knowledge / acquaintance
:gebeuren – gebeurtenis
::to happen – event
:bekennen – bekentenis
::to confess – confession
:hinderen – hindernis
::to obstruct / bother – hindrance

Plurals get '''''-sen''''':
:kennissen (''acquaintances''), bekentenissen

In English this ending is more common after adjectives like bald(ness), good(ness). In Dutch this is rare:

:sad – sadness
:droef – droefenis

Usually Dutch has '''''-heid''''' in such cases: droefheid

Dutch also has latinate endings—as English does—that sometimes compete with the Germanic ones:

The Latin '''-tio(n)''' ending is '''''-tie''''' in Dutch and usually pronounced as [tsi] or [si] ('see') 

:communiceren – communicatie
::communicate – communication
 
'''but''':

:archiveren – archivering
:to archive – archiving

==Prefix ''ge-''==
Another way to form a verbal noun is to add ''ge-'' to a stem. It forms a neuter noun from verbs without prefixes.

:vallen – het geval – de gevallen
:: to fall – the case
:missen – het gemis -  (no plural)
::to miss – the lack, missing
:spreken – het gesprek – de gesprekken
::to speak – the conversation
:voelen – het gevoel – de gevoelens
:: to feel – the feeling

This type is still productive, at least for verbs that do not carry prefixes. Newly formed nouns carry the connotation of annoying repetition and they usually have no plural:

:''dat onophoudelijk geblaf moet afgelopen zijn!''
::''enough of that incessant barking!''
:''hij viel op het toneel: gelach en boegeroep in het publiek...''
::''he fell on stage: laughter and boos in the audience...''

:''wat een gedoe!''
::''what a hassle!''

Notice the difference with the past participle:

:gelach – gelach'''en'''
:laughing,laughter – laugh'''ed'''

Verbal nouns with ''ge-'' tend to have a dysphemic connotation and some are better avoided by a non-native speaker:

:gezeur, geëtter, gezeik, gezwam (all ~ bull s#$t)

:zeuren – to nag
:etter – puss
:zeik –  urine (four letters..)
:zwam – fungus

===Subjects and objects===
As in English the ''-er'' suffix denotes the subject of the verb:

:geven – gever
:to give – giver

As in English the plural is in ''-s'': ''gevers''.

There usually is a feminine version in ''-ster'' as well, although under feminist influence it is under considerable pressure especially for functions in society:

:voorzitten – voorzitter – voorzitster
:to chair a meeting – chairman – chairwoman

''Voorzitter'' is increasingly used, regardless the gender of the chairperson.

There are other feminine endings, e.g. ''-eres'': (plural ''-eressen'')

:zingen – zanger – zangeres
:to sing – singer (m) – singer (f)

There is also an infrequent ''-sel'' suffix indicating an object, e.g.:

:scheppen – schepping - schepper - schep'''sel'''
:to create – creation - creator – creature

Note that in this case English has completely shifted to Latin roots and endings where Dutch has remained faithful to its Germanic roots altogether, at least in religious context. Otherwise ''creation'' is often ''creatie''.

The number and type of available verbal nouns differs from verb to verb.

==Verbal adjectives==
Apart from the two participles the verb can form various adjectives as it can in English. One suffix that corresponds to the English latinate ending ''-able'' is ''-baar'':

:verstaan – verstaanbaar
::understand – understandable

Another suffix ''-heid'' (cf. English ''-hood'') can be added to turn the adjective into a (feminine) noun:

:danken – dankbaar – dankbaarheid
::to thank – grateful – gratitude

The ''-heid'' suffix (plural ''-heden'') can also be used behind participles.

:bergen - geborgen – geborgenheid
::to secure – secured, safe – feeling at ease
:opletten – oplettend – oplettendheid
::to wacht out – attentive – attention

There is also a suffix ''-elijk'' , cognate with ''-ly''. (The 'ij' is usually pronounced as a schwa.)

:bewerken – bewerkelijk
::to process -requiring much work
:sterven – sterfelijk - sterfelijkheid
::to die – mortal - mortality

== Overview ==

The '''''Quietus''''' charm is cast by a wizard, usually upon himself, to restore his voice to its normal volume after the use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sonorus|Sonorus]] charm.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Quietus charm is first seen used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] when he is called upon to commentate the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]; when the game is finished, Ludo ends his earlier Sonorus charm by invoking Quietus.

Ludo uses this spell again after commentating the events in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].

'''Chickpea flour''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] made by milling [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]]. There are two main types of chickpeas, thus producing two main types of chickpea flour &amp;ndash; and some controversy over whether they are interchangeable or not. 

Cuisines of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|the Mediterranean]] and the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] use flour made from the large, white chickpeas (''European chickpeas''). Here are some recipes using this flour:

* [[Cookbook:Calentita|Calentita]]
* [[Cookbook:Panissa|Panissa]]
* [[Cookbook:Socca|Socca]]

Cuisines of [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]] use flour made from the small, brown chickpeas (''Chana'', or ''Bengal gram''). This flour is called '''besan''', or '''gram flour'''. Here are some recipes using this flour:

* [[Cookbook:Bonda|Bonda]]
* [[Cookbook:Mirchi bhajji|Mirchi bhajji]]
* [[Cookbook:Pakoda|Pakoda]]

==    I have been bloked for vandel? Mistake ==

I am new to wiki in this way, i have never had to left a message. I have receved some thing saying: &quot;Your username or IP address (64.59.144.24) has been blocked from editing Wikibooks by Az1568 with the following reason: 
Vandalism.&quot;                     

I dont vandellize, and i use wiki for the blender 3d tutorials, wich are very helpfull. If i could get some help, my email is old_man_enger@hotmail.com
It would be helpfull, I plan on posting some very helpfull tutorils.

PS: my inernet propertys says that my IP is: 70.69.139.54  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:64.59.144.24|64.59.144.24]] ([[User talk:64.59.144.24|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/64.59.144.24|contribs]]) 11:13, 15 Jan 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:The IP you just edited from is indeed blocked as there has been some vandalism from someone using this IP to accesss Wikibooks.  The IP address you quote above is not blocks but is not the one you used.  There is no history of editing blender 3d tutorials from this IP.  The best thing you can do is sign up with a username - you won't get blocked then (unless you vandalise - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:57, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

Please stop.  If you continue to vandalize pages, you will be blocked from editing Wikibooks. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Hi - I noticed your comment on this recipe.  If it is actually your copyright material then we would not be able to keep the page on Wikibooks unless you were to license it to be freely available.  Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] which should explain this.  Feel free to ask if you need help or clarification.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:05, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

: You can't copyright a recipe. What you can copyright is all the extra descriptive text and flourishes around the recipe. In this case, none of these have been replicated from the linked page (if that is indeed the original source), so no copyright issue applies.

== Literals ==
A number such as &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; in Haskell code is interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;fromInteger 5&lt;/tt&gt;, where the &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; is an &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;. This allows the literal to be interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Float&lt;/tt&gt; etc. Same goes with floating point numbers such as &lt;tt&gt;3.3&lt;/tt&gt;, which are interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;fromRational 3.3&lt;/tt&gt;, where &lt;tt&gt;3.3&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;Rational&lt;/tt&gt;. GHC has &lt;tt&gt;OverloadedStrings&lt;/tt&gt; extension, which enables the same behaviour for string types such as &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ByteString&lt;/tt&gt; varieties from the &lt;tt&gt;Data.ByteString&lt;/tt&gt; modules.

== Type level ==
The type &lt;tt&gt;[Int]&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;[] Int&lt;/tt&gt;. This makes it obvious it is an application of &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt; type constructor (kind &lt;tt&gt;* -&gt; *&lt;/tt&gt;) to &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; (kind &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;).

Analogously, &lt;tt&gt;(Bool, String)&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;(,) Bool String&lt;/tt&gt;, and the same goes with larger tuples.

It serves to show vocabulary translations in the language project '''[[Freistil]]'''. This template takes two or three parameters, making it flexible in dealing with word-by-word translations as well as more general translations that also provide the basic form of the translated term.

In the case of two parameters, the syntax is as follows:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{C|Wörter|words}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
yielding the following output:
:{{C|Wörter|words}}
&quot;Wörter&quot; is the text the reader will see. The tooltip provides the text &quot;Wörter = words&quot;.

In the case of three parameters, the syntax is as follows:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{C|Wörter|das Wort|word}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
yielding the output:
:{{C|Wörter|das Wort|word}}
Here, the tooltip provides the text &quot;das Wort = words&quot;, that is it does not repeat the original text but shows a different one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some people find this section useful, and some find it confusing. If you find it confusing you can skip it (or just look at the examples.)  Now we will do a walk through for the following program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def mult(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a, b - 1)
    value = a + rest
    return value
print &quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2)
&lt;/source&gt;
{{Solution|title=Output|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
3 * 2 =  6
&lt;/source&gt;
}}
Basically this program creates a positive integer multiplication function
(that is far slower than the built in multiplication function) and then
demonstrates this function with a use of the function. This program demonstrates the use of recursion, that is a form of iteration (repetition) in which there is a function that repeatedly calls itself until an exit condition is satisfied. It uses repeated additions to give the same result as mutiplication: e.g. 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 (addition) gives the same result as 3&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;2 (multiplication).
----
'''RUN 1'''
; ''Question:'' What is the first thing the program does?
: ''Answer:'' The first thing done is the function mult is defined with all the lines except the last one.

{{Solution|title=function mult defined|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def mult(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a, b - 1)
    value = a + rest
    return value
&lt;/source&gt;
}}
: This creates a function that takes two parameters and returns a value when it is done.  Later this function can be run.
----
; What happens next?  
: The next line after the function, &lt;code&gt;print &quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt; is run.
----
; And what does this do?
: It prints &lt;code&gt;3 * 2 = &lt;/code&gt; and the return value of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;
----
; And what does &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt; return?
: We need to do a walkthrough of the &lt;code&gt;mult&lt;/code&gt; function to find out.
----
'''RUN 2'''
; What happens next?
: The variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; gets the value 3 assigned to it and the variable &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; gets the value 2 assigned to it.
----
; And then?
: The line &lt;code&gt;if b == 0:&lt;/code&gt; is run.  Since &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 2 this is false so the line &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; is skipped.
----
; And what then?
: The line &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt; is run.  This line sets the local variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; to the value of &lt;code&gt;mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.  The value of &lt;code&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; is 3 and the value of &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; is 2 so the function call is &lt;code&gt;mult(3,1)&lt;/code&gt;
----
; So what is the value of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt; ?
: We will need to run the function &lt;code&gt; mult&lt;/code&gt; with the parameters 3 and 1.
{{Solution|title=RUN 2|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def mult(3, 2):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(3, 2 - 1)
    rest = mult(3, 1)
    value = 3 + rest
    return value
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

----
'''RUN 3'''
; So what happens next?
: The local variables in the '' new'' run of the function are set so that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has the value 3 and &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 1. Since these are local values these do not affect the previous values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.
----
; And then?
: Since &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 1 the if statement is false, so the next line becomes &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
----
; What does this line do?
: This line will assign the value of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; to rest.
----
; So what is that value?
: We will have to run the function one more time to find that out. This time &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has the value 3 and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 0.
----
; So what happens next?
: The first line in the function to run is &lt;code&gt;if b == 0:&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 0 so the next line to run is &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; 
----
; And what does the line &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; do?
: This line returns the value 0 out of the function. 
----
; So?
: So now we know that &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; has the value 0.  Now we know what the line &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt; did since we have run the function &lt;code&gt;mult&lt;/code&gt; with the parameters 3 and 0.  We have finished running &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; and are now back to running &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt;. The variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; gets assigned the value 0.
----
; What line is run next?
: The line &lt;code&gt;value = a + rest&lt;/code&gt; is run next. In this run of the function, &lt;code&gt;a = 3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rest = 0&lt;/code&gt; so now &lt;code&gt;value = 3&lt;/code&gt;.  
----
; What happens next?
: The line &lt;code&gt;return value&lt;/code&gt; is run.  This returns 3 from the function. This also exits from the run of the function &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt;.  After &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is called, we go back to running &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;.
----
; Where were we in &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;?
: We had the variables &lt;code&gt;a = 3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b = 2&lt;/code&gt; and were examining the line &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
----
; So what happens now?
: The variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; get 3 assigned to it.  The next line &lt;code&gt;value = a + rest&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;3 + 3&lt;/code&gt; or 6.  
----
; So now what happens?
: The next line runs, this returns 6 from the function.  We are now back to running the line &lt;code&gt;print &quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt; which can now print out the 6.
----
; What is happening overall?  
: Basically we used two facts to calculate the multiple of the two numbers.  The first is that any number times 0 is 0 (&lt;code&gt;x * 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;).  The second is that a number times another number is equal to the first number plus the first number times one less than the second number (&lt;code&gt;x * y = x + x * (y - 1)&lt;/code&gt;).  So what happens is &lt;code&gt;3 * 2&lt;/code&gt; is first converted into &lt;code&gt; 3 + 3 * 1&lt;/code&gt;.  Then &lt;code&gt;3 * 1&lt;/code&gt; is converted into &lt;code&gt;3 + 3 * 0&lt;/code&gt;.  Then we know that any number times 0 is 0 so &lt;code&gt;3 * 0&lt;/code&gt; is 0.  Then we can calculate that &lt;code&gt;3 + 3 * 0&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3 + 0&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;.  Now we know what &lt;code&gt;3 * 1&lt;/code&gt; is so we can calculate that &lt;code&gt;3 + 3 * 1&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3 + 3&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.
----
This is how the whole thing works:

 3 * 2
 3 + 3 * 1
 3 + 3 + 3 * 0
 3 + 3 + 0
 3 + 3
 6

Should you still have problems with this example, look at the process backwards. What is the last
step that happens? We can easily make out that the result of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; is
&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, the function &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; 
will return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and stop. 

So what does the previous step do? &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt; does not return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;
because &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. So the next lines are executed:
&lt;code&gt;rest = mult (a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;rest = mult (3, 0)&lt;/code&gt;, 
which is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; as we just worked out. So now the variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

The next line adds the value of &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and since &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt;
is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, the result is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;.

Now we know that the function &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. But we want to
know the result of &lt;code&gt;mult(3,2)&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, we need to jump back to the
start of the program and execute it one more round: 
&lt;code&gt;mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; to the result of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt;. We know
from the last round that this result is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. Then &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; calculates as &lt;code&gt;a + rest&lt;/code&gt;,
i. e. &lt;code&gt;3 + 3&lt;/code&gt;. Then the result of 3 * 2 is printed as 6. 

The point of this example is that the function &lt;code&gt;mult(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; starts itself inside
itself. It does this until &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; reaches &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and then calculates the result as explained above.

==== Recursion ====
Programming constructs of this kind are called ''recursive'' and probably the most intuitive definition of ''recursion'' is:

; Recursion
: If you still don't get it, see ''recursion''.

These last two sections were recently written.  If you have any
comments, found any errors or think I need more/clearer explanations
please email.  I have been known in the past to make simple things
incomprehensible.  If the rest of the tutorial has made sense, but this
section didn't, it is probably my fault and I would like to know.
Thanks.

=== Examples ===
'''factorial.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#defines a function that calculates the factorial

def factorial(n):
    if n &lt;= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print &quot;2! =&quot;, factorial(2)
print &quot;3! =&quot;, factorial(3)
print &quot;4! =&quot;, factorial(4)
print &quot;5! =&quot;, factorial(5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 
 2! = 2
 3! = 6
 4! = 24
 5! = 120

'''countdown.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def count_down(n):
    print n
    if n &gt; 0:
        return count_down(n-1)

count_down(5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

def mult(a, b): # (2.) This function will keep repeating itself, because....
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a, b - 1) # (3.) ....Once it reaches THIS, the sequence starts over again and goes back to the top!
    value = a + rest
    return value # (4.) therefore, &quot;return value&quot; will not happen until the program gets past step 3 above

print &quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2) # (1.) The &quot;mult&quot; function will first initiate here
                             

# The &quot;return value&quot; event at the end can therefore only happen
# once b equals zero (b decreases by 1 everytime step 3 happens).
# And only then can the print command at the bottom be displayed.

# See it as kind of a &quot;jump-around&quot; effect. Basically, all you
# should really understand is that the function is reinitiated
# WITHIN ITSELF at step 3. Therefore, the sequence &quot;jumps&quot; back
# to the top.
&lt;/source&gt;

Commented factorial.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Another &quot;jump-around&quot; function example:

def factorial(n): # (2.) So once again, this function will REPEAT itself....
    if n &lt;= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1) # (3.) Because it RE-initiates HERE, and goes back to the top.

print &quot;2! =&quot;, factorial(2) # (1.) The &quot;factorial&quot; function is initiated with this line
print &quot;3! =&quot;, factorial(3)
print &quot;4! =&quot;, factorial(4)
print &quot;5! =&quot;, factorial(5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Commented countdown.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Another &quot;jump-around&quot;, nice and easy:


def count_down(n): # (2.) Once again, this sequence will repeat itself....
    print n
    if n &gt; 0:
        return count_down(n-1) # (3.) Because it restarts here, and goes back to the top

count_down(5) # (1.) The &quot;count_down&quot; function initiates here
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!--Now try replacing the &quot;if&quot; with &quot;while&quot; (you are still typing these out, right?).  Now you've managed to turn your computer into a calculator which can't correctly count down from four.  In essence, &quot;while&quot; acts as combined &quot;if&quot; and &quot;repeat.&quot;  Throwing in two recursions makes for some interesting counting.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Freistil. Actual annotated German texts.''''' is a loose collection of German texts for foreign language learners. The texts, dealing with actual topics, are annotated with translations and spiced up with explanations and activities, so that you do not only learn new words but also how to use common phrases and typical grammatical structures.

You will find the following features:
* '''In-text annotations''' pop up when the mouse cursor hovers over a {{C|blue-coloured German word|here, the translation would show up}}. Here, you find an in-context translation of the given vocabulary, saving you the time to consider an external dictionary.
* '''What's worth learning?''' boxes next to the text give you an idea of which vocabulary shows up frequently in daily language and thus is worth learning.
* '''In detail''' boxes give you background information and cultural knowledge that help you understand what's going on.
* '''Text levels''' at the beginning of the articles hint at the difficulty of the texts.

Before long, all texts will be separately available as PDF documents optimized for printing. In time, there will also be a compilation containing all articles as a complete book. Hopefully, there will be audio recordings of the texts as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You are more than welcome to participate in this project! And you do not have to ask for permission to do so. Things you might want to do include:

* '''Markup articles.''' You feel that the annotations given are not sufficient to understand a text? Well, add some more. Annotations are inserted using [[Template:C]]. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{C|ging|(to) go}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; works out to {{C|ging|(to) go}}, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{C|ging|gehen|(to) go}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to {{C|ging|gehen|(to) go}}.
* '''Evaluate articles.''' Articles are marked with either of the three templates &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Freistil/Beginner}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{:Freistil/Beginner}}, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Freistil/Mediocre}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{:Freistil/Mediocre}} or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Freistil/Advanced}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{:Freistil/Advanced}}. You're free to change a text's markup if you feel it is more difficult or easier than the given hint.
* '''Review articles.''' Force out typos, improve grammar and make translations more precisely.
* '''Answer questions.''' Readers may ask questions on the talk pages of the articles. If you feel at home with the matter, try and answer them.
* '''Make it printable.''' You're proud owner of a PDF converting tool? Use it! Grab an article per page, activities —if provided— on a second page. Upload the document to Wiki Commons and link it. A pretty table for linking will be available soon.
* '''Vocalize articles.''' You're a native speaker of German? Record yourself reading one of the articles aloud, upload the recording as OGG Vorbis to Wiki Commons and link it. It doesn't matter if your voice sounds badly or you're a lover of dialect; people here need authentic day-by-day language, not vocal art. Pretty templates for the links will come up soon.
* '''Write an article.''' Look out for an up-to-date topic ([http://de.wikinews.org Wikinews] is a good source) and copy-paste or compile a new text. Copy the formatting stuff from one of the existing articles. Use [[Template:Freistil/Header]] for the headline and text intro, [[Template:Freistil/Footer]] for the text outtro. Helpful tools to simplify creating a new article from scratch may be developed in the near future.

If you want to cooperate on a regular basis, no matter if you're a native speaker of English or German, just add your name to this list:
* [[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]], German, founder
* [[User:Nowotoj|Nowotoj,]] German, create, comment and record texts

'''Horticultural Oil''' is a pesticide used primarily for controlling insects and mites. The oils are manufactured either from petroleum or vegetable oils, and are very lightweight. Until the late 20th Century, heavier &quot;dormant oils&quot; were used for the dame purpose, but they could only be used in winter as they were too heavy to be used in warmer conditions.

==Uses==
&lt;!--target animals, etc--&gt;

==Action==
Horticultural oils work by smothering the target pests, either clogging their stomatae or in the case of eggs simply preventing oxygen from moving through the oily film. Oils need to be applied directly to the pest, they have no residual effect and do not harm arthropods if ingested.

==Application==
Horticultural oils are mixed with water, and sprayed directly onto the pest organisms.

==Precautions==
&lt;!--toxicity, safety, environmental hazards--&gt;

==Resistance==
&lt;!--if known--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Forking and joining should suggest standards ==
Hi Dysprosia! I welcome this initiative to present a more coherent Wikibooks for editors and readers. Clearly, community effort should be bundeled to well-defined projects, and in this sense a good forking policy is necessary. 

Let's name things: I guess you are mostly concerned about the [[Programming:C plus plus]] &lt;-&gt; [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] fork. Suppose both parties agree to join the efforts again - whose style should be adopted? Who should be the winner, who the loser? I guess, the debate would continue, if it were not for ''standards''.

Another hot point for forks is the effort of Wikiversity vs. Wikibooks. I don't know how active the former group still is, but content might be duplicated there and here, reducing the quality effort that could in principle be put into one joint effort Wikibook.

Also, with a lot of &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; recently, there is a high chance that content is created twice.

What I wanted to suggest for a long time is, to set up such a '''standard committee''' for Wikibooks. We have all the ingredients, we could watch Wikibooks grow for a long time, certainly, browsing around, we see which concepts work and which don't - which books are easy to navigate around and which are not. Since we now have subpages enabled, I would suggest to form a standard committee for Wikibooks, that first works for a couple of weeks to agree on a set of simple and easily adoptable standards, that would work best on Wikibooks. (As with every standard, it is a suggestion that people might adopt to but don't have to).
Standards might include:

1. Using a uniform naming convention for new books or when joining books: A new standard might be (but of course it can be discussed)
 Bookname                    -&gt; use this for the main page, including contents
 Bookname/Cover              -&gt; use this for cover
 Bookname/Authors            -&gt; use this for authors
 Bookname/Introduction       -&gt; introduction
 Bookname/Chapterdescription -&gt; use this for chapters
:e.g. Organic chemistry/Foundational concepts
:# The standard would recommend the newly introduced subpages.
:# The standard would suggest a capitalization of names (e.g. all small except first letter or abbreviations)
:# The standard would suggest to name the main page of the book as the bookname. (not like e.g. [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide]] as main page and [[Assistant in France:Application]] as chapter pages. Also the main page should be renamed to [[Assistant in France]])
:# The standard should discourage the use of numbers for chapter names (e.g. &quot;Book/Chapter 1&quot;, &quot;Book/Chapter 2&quot; ...), as it is done in [[Geometry]]. This is because it would be very hard to insert a new chapter between existing chapters. When explicit names are used this poses no problem.
:# These standards make the future update of [[Wikibooks:Top active/SQL query|SQL queries]] on books easier.
:# Also, it might be a new standard, NOT to include the bookshelf name in the title. E.g. &quot;Programming:C plus plus&quot; should in future just be &quot;C plus plus&quot;. This is to make Wikibooks more coherent (there is also no &quot;Languages:German&quot; or &quot;Science:Mathematics&quot; but the book's name is plainly &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Mathematics&quot;.) Books can be sorted on bookshelves, but the book title itself should not reflect this. (to be discussed).

2. Splitting a book into reasonable chapters, and not having everything on one side.
:# Smaller pages are better for online-viewing of books.
:# On the other hand, there is no point in dividing a page into chapters that each only fill a few lines.
:# Having only 1 layer of chapters seems ideal for most books. Very large books (like Organic chemistry) will need 2 layers, but the suggestion should be to introduce the second layer only when necessary - not before. (like [[Business English]] that has 2 levels of chapters where most will be empty for a long time.. my personal guess. 1 level of chapters would be more than enough to let people work on the book in a coordinated way.)

3. Provide a print version. Using templates, a book could provide a print version where all chapters of a book are displayed on one page for printing. A book that does this is e.g. [[Computer Science:Data Structures]]. By providing a set of generally available templates, this could be made much easier. -&gt; Hence a good standard committee.
: Having this print version will take away one of the reasons for the unlucky C -/- -/- fork.

4. Books that follow the standard should have the right to carry a special logo &quot;Wikibook standard 05&quot; (like Fortran 95 and the like..). Someone should create a nice logo, like the CSS or XHTML logos from W3C.

5. Of course, there is no point in transforming very large books like Cookbook or Organic chemistry immediately, but there should be the possibility of an easy transition (e.g. that the standard is introduced chapter by chapter). (&quot;Wikibook standard 05 Transitional&quot;?!?)

The standard committee might even set up a Wikibook, called the &quot;Standard Wikibook&quot; (after having resolved the discussion points above), to present one Wikibook that explains all the rules of the standard, at the same time setting an excellent example for a good Wikibook. The standard committee might then continue to transform excellent books to adopt to the Wikibook Standard 05.

Having agreed on a standard first, joining of forks would be a very natural procedure.

What do you think about this? Dysprosia, would you be interested in being part of the committee? Who else might be a good candidate for the committee? Who is interested in joining? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:43, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
: I've had the idea to start the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] akin to Wikipedia's, but can be more prescriptive. Some of the points raised will be catered by the MoS. The print version however is generated automatically in Monobook using stylesheets, so if you print a Wikibooks page, it will come out pretty already. However, a project to ensure MoS conformity is a great idea. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:29, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Hi Dysprosia. The &quot;Print version&quot; I had in mind goes beyond the Monobook print style: The idea is, to have all modules of a book on 1 page, so if you print it, you will get the whole book. Yet, for online viewing the book is organized in several modules. This works in principle by having one page called &quot;...(print version)&quot; that includes as templates &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; all other pages of the book. 
:: I like your &quot;manual of style&quot;. It is a very good start. If I have time, and you don't oppose, I'll contribute by converting it into an example Wikibook (with cover, Authors, printversion, subpages, navigation...). I think, an example Wikibook would be more effective and easier to understand, than just writing about how it should look like. Cheers, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:59, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::: I did think of making it a Wikibook, but thought against it. I don't think the amount of material will be sufficient to make it into a Wikibook proper. Several things though I think will need to be voted on - the hierachy method being one of them. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:01, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::: We now have a [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 20:56, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== Support of this policy ==

I support this policy as it is in its entirety.  Please let it be so... [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 02:43, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)




== [[Programming:C plus plus]] and its fork [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] ==

(moved from [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]])

Things have taken an ugly turn in [[Programming:C plus plus]] with [[User:Panic2k4]] deciding to fork off another page at [[Programming: C -/- -/-]]. See my failed attempt at getting the opinions of other wikibookians (apart from Panic and me) above at [[#Attracting contributors to a textbook: Differences from the 'pedia]], and past discussions at [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/single page]] and those discussions rearranged in Panic's new format at [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]].

I've replaced [[Programming:C plus plus]] with text asking people to contribute to [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] instead. Already the only reason I was in the debate was I feared there'd be two separate books on C++, viz. one at [[Programming:C plus plus]] and one in the many modules named [[Programming:C plus plus &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;chapter/section name&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (See [[Programming:C plus plus Hello world]] for example). Now with the fork there is a possibility of getting 3 separate books. Doing these things would make it difficult to consolidate all the info. about C++, which places readers of such material at a disadvantage.

If this were wikipedia, we could've added a vote on single- vs. multiple- pages for books, but here the traffic is so low, almost no one would vote. In fact no one might read this thread, just like no one read my previous thread above. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 09:15, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Hi,
:I don't any know C++, so I can't help on the topic, but my opinion is:
* [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] is not a good name for an article title. It's ugly to type and probably bad to get it working in search engiges. I think, the simpler the title, the better. Maybe try [[C pp]] or something like this instead, if [[C++]] is not possible. Actually I don't read '''C -/- -/-''' as C++, but as '''C minus-slash-minus minus-slash-minus'''. Even [[C -l- -l-]] or [[C -i- -i-]] or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[C -|- -|-]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be better.
* The best length for a page is about 30 KB. So if an article is getting really bigger than that (say 40 KB), better to split in 2.
Just my 2 cts. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 16:45, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:My specific questions for now are:
:#whether to allow forks, and
:#whether to allow an old version of a talk page to be replicated elsewhere, misleading people into believing that's the original talk page, and making them miss the comments added to the original talk page after the talk-page &quot;fork&quot;.

:If the answer to the first is &quot;no&quot;, not only must [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] be brought back to [[Programming:C plus plus]], but the portion of [[Programming:C plus plus]] which is also in [[Programming:C plus plus Hello world]], [[Programming:C plus plus Reference Tables]], etc. must be removed from one of the places they appear in and replaced by a link to the other.

:If the answer to the second is &quot;no&quot;, the talk pages must also be merged in case the answer to the first is also &quot;no&quot;. If the answer to the first is &quot;yes&quot;, both the talk pages must be updated to reflect the latest state of comments.

::I would say NO to both, but I am quite new in Wikibooks, although I edit Wikipedia for 2 years. And the option ''everything in one VERY BIG page'' is not reasonable. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 20:23, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::A1. I'm not sure on the meaning of fork, if you mean a duplicate of an existing page, then no. If you mean to have chapter pages, then yes. A naming convention can be &quot;Programming:C plus plus:Program:Hello World&quot;, &quot;&quot;Programming:C plus plus:Program:Simple Calculator&quot;, etc
::A2. Talk pages should not be replicated elsewhere. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 13:35, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:With lower priority, I'd like to know:
:#if a thread in a talk page can be called &quot;dead&quot; and archived, if something was added to it just a month back, and
:#whether first level headers are to be used in titling sections (they are too large, and befit only the title of the page).

:Note that I'm not that bothered about getting an answer to the multiple- vs. single-module immediately (I should've mentioned this above). But while that is being decided, the above problems must be resolved (esp. since these concern the talk pages on which that discussion can be held). -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 17:55, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Forgot to add this one in the lower priority section:
::&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;if threads with the last comment made a month ago can be regarded as &quot;dead proposals&quot; and archived, given the traffic that comes to Wikibooks.&lt;/ol&gt;
:: -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 18:56, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::A1. If a thread has been resolved, then make a summary sentence to acknowledge it and delete the thread. Otherwise, archive it if the talk page gets too long.
:::A2. I think second level headers should be used for titling sections.
:::A3. I don't see any problem with archiving older messages. Try to resolve as many of the threads as possible. I'm not sure about other people, but I wouldn't want to read so many messages. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 13:35, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::OK, since someone other than Panic2k4 says that a month old message can be archived, I've removed my (pet peeve) [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus#Common programming errors]] &amp; moved that to [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus Hello world]] (Hello world is where I started thinking about highlighting common programming errors in boxes). Just archiving and forgetting might be OK, but having another section in the talk that says that his proposal is &quot;dead&quot; doesn't seem OK, since someone can start implementing this proposal any time. Note that there was no opposition to the proposal. Just that I didn't find the time to implement it within a month (&amp; a few more days now). -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 17:31, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

=== My &quot;textbook-l&quot; Post ===
This is a mail I sent to the &quot;textbook-l&quot; mailing list.

Introduction:

A few days back Panic2k4 and I started discussing about whether to organise the C++ book as many modules or a single big module. This discussion can be found at:

*[[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]]
*[[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/archive1]]
*[[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/single page]]
*[[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]]
*[[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/- (Archive)]]
*http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;oldid=69650
*[[User talk:Dysprosia#Organising_Programming:C_plus_plus]]
*[[User talk:Yann#Programming:C_plus_plus]]
*[[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Attracting contributors to a textbook: Differences from the 'pedia]]
*[[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Programming:C plus plus and its fork Programming: C -.2F- -.2F-]]

The problem:

OK, for now I don't care whether we have single or multiple modules. In fact I never really wanted anyone to suddenly stop the single module approach and split into multiple modules. Neither do I bother about whether the stuff is organised. The book is in its early beginnings, organisation would follow in due course.

My real problem all the while was that Panic was adding to [[Programming:C plus plus]] what was already there in the &quot;submodules&quot; as I've called them, i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Programming:C plus plus *]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. e.g. http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Programming%3AC_plus_plus&amp;diff=63263&amp;oldid=61335. From id=61335 to id=63263 Panic added stuff from [[Programming:C plus plus Variables and Expressions]] to [[Programming:C plus plus]] but didn't remove the para. from &quot;Guide to Writers&quot; that specifically asked editors not to add content from those submodules into the [[Programming:C plus plus]]. This way it becomes difficult to keep track of changes made in [[Programming:C plus plus]] not made in [[Programming:C plus plus Variables and Expressions]] &amp; vice versa. OK, whatever he wanted to do, I thought of sorting it out through talk pages. But one fine day he decided to &quot;fork off&quot; an earlier version of the talk page to [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]] (forking the article has been handled, by providing a link to his location [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] from the original location), in the process letting my replies at [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] to lie orphaned (compare the two talk: pages to see my replies not getting copied to the &quot;fork&quot;), while he added [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] to the [[Programming languages bookshelf]] (http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Programming_languages_bookshelf&amp;diff=69112&amp;oldid=68382) so as to ensure his version gains audience (&amp; contributors) while the pages at the original location lose them. Also, I protested his fork of the talk page but he removed my comment (http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Programming:_C_-/-_-/-&amp;diff=69397&amp;oldid=69393).

Whatever happens to the single- vs. multiple-module debate, *FOR NOW* I'd like to request wikibookians (esp. sysops) to kindly protect [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]], merge them into one discussion page, preferably at [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]], and preferably move [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] to [[Programming:C plus plus]] without losing edit history (I believe sysops have a way to do that).

: Hi Paddu, I think it's best to have the module named as &quot;Programming:C (plus plus)&quot;. I just noticed this module and I think it's a bad practice to lump all the contents on one page. The main page should have links to separate pages for different sections of the book. I'm not sure what's been going on, seems like a dispute between you and Panic. Also the problem of the Talk pages? I'll try to help sort out this problem (I'm not admin). Give me some time if you'll allow.

::Thanks for your response Mkn, and thank you for accepting my proposal that moving the page is not the right thing to do now. If you look at [[Programming:C plus plus Hello world]] and pages linked to from there, you can see that I've been writing separate modules for a long time now. [[User:Panic2k4]] however feels everything must be in one page, at least until a section grows &quot;big enough&quot; when it could be split off as a separate module. Whatever it is that gets decided, I have seen that no one favours forks of the article. But a more important problem is a &quot;fork&quot; of talk pages which makes it difficult to discuss about the problem at hand.
::It's really nice to see more people getting interested in this issue so a resolution seems closer.
::BTW if you didn't know [[Programming:C plus plus Hello world]] existed it probably means Panic2k4 has succeeded in giving his monolithic page wider visibility than the &quot;submodules&quot;, which I think is unfair BTW. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 12:41, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:::I didn't know about the other modules of C++. But then I wouldn't notice since the main page is so cluttered and I don't see links to such modules.

::::I'd provided links to other modules in the &quot;Guide to Writers&quot; section of [[Programming:C plus plus]] but Panic moved the links to the bibliography section at the end.

:I don't completely understand what's going on here, but don't create more than one fork of the same book.  That's just silly.  If someone wants to create their own fork, try to figure out why and bring them back, but if they are really adamant, hey, they can do what they want.  It will probably just stagnate with no other users but them contributing.  But c'mon.  Collaborate/compromise/consensus.  Focus on writing the book, not on dumb political struggles. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 13:30, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: I'm not sure what's going on either. I agree that &quot;Programming: C -/- -/-&quot; is an ugly name. Since [[C++]] won't work, [[Programming:C pp]] or [[Programming:C plus plus]] would be adequate. I wouldn't mind a single 30 K reference page on C, but I doubt that's going to happen. Having 3 different books on the same subject certainly does seem like a waste of time. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 19:32, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

:Would you mind an anonymous user's suggestion? It may or may not have been proposed before, but if it has, then I apologize.

:I think to resolve the fork, you simply provide an introduction cover, and ask the user to choose whether he/she wants a single page comprehensive approach to C++ and its structure, or prefers a tutorial-based approached broken down in sections. Make C Plus Plus the tutorial-based approach and C -/- -/- the single page approach, and make them subsections of the module. That way, development, although focused in two directions, can be referenced with one search term. --[[User:69.156.104.171|69.156.104.171]] 20:21, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

'''Update''': I've determined that the fork [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] is against policy and I've started the clock for it to be deleted in two weeks. For an open, collaborative book project such forks are simply unacceptable. For instance, imagine you are a possible contributor, and you notice there are two different books. It would be impossible to determine which book your contributions should go to. Note that there is always the option of forking, but such forks must ''always'' be on a different site. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:45, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:This seems like a pretty silly argument/debate to me.  A web page is a single click or search away whether it is on the same physical server controlled by the same organization or administrator or not.  I personally happen to own probably over twenty books on different aspects of programming in C++ and I have only ever played project manager ... not actually written C++ code.  We are contemplating a fork early and often and mutate effectively policy at Wikiversity.  I would like to extend a &lt;b&gt;boldly engraved&lt;/b&gt; invitation to any or all of the forking parties to come to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity and establish or participate in a course  (or many courses if you are feeling ambitious) or a learning process involving the use of C++ regarding whatever aspect of, it however they choose to organize it, and work with us attracting and mentoring interested learners and other mentors.  While less time will be spent in &quot;productive&quot; writing, the input and assistance in reviewing and editing is often found quite helpful by many authors in academic settings in improving the overall percieved quality of one of their typical products: a text or reference for a specific targeted audience of learners or practitioners.  Also note that the early paradigm of organizing schools is merely one of many possible paradigms or overlays to lead adventurous internet surfers into the clutches of our mentors and mentees.  By all means put your new fork in its own space and link to it from all appropriate namespaces: the hacker hideout, software engineering, Institute for Self Adaptive Programs for use in Autonomous Killing Machines (terminator, rise of the machines), Star Command's League of Justice Game Developer's, Informatics, etc.  You get the idea.  At Wikiversity, we just want to have some fun and provide a little empowerment (over themselves not us) for others; not displace every other book ever written by one unique final master tome of everything ever known or to be known about one favorite subject or title.  We do not even care if you work under multiple pseudonyms with multiple styles to see which one works best with which age groups or skillsets of targeted audiences ... call it concurrent development if duplicated, redundant, mutating, innovative, diverse effort scares, dilutes, or confuses your potential readers, commentators, and fans or makes you personally nervous.

==I am opposed to this policy==

There are many subjects that benefit from the introduction of slightly different viewpoints. I have about 8 textbooks on Special Relativity, most of which cover similar ground but they are all useful.  There is also the problem of national curricula - the British A-Level science curriculum might be different from US SATS requirements. It might be useful as a guideline but should certainly not be enforced. It might also be reasonable if a fork contains more than, say, 30% of the content of the book from which it has been forked. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:45, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

: The policy is designed to prevent each new wikibookian from writing their own personal version of already existing books. We don't need multiple cookbooks, C++ books, etc. (exceptions as listed apply) Books designed for a specific national curriculum are acceptable since they are geared towards different audiences. The policy was initially created because there was an already existing C++ book which was forked over formatting issues; that should have been resolved internally instead of resulting in forking. Advanced topics such as special relativity are probably more difficult to merge and centralize, but all efforts should be made to do so. We are, after all, writing textbooks not theoretical essays.

:: The dispute about the C++ book was not only on format, content was the major problem...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 13:54, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

Many subjects can be studied in varying degrees of depth, so would it not make sense to have 'Elementary' and 'Advanced' books for some subjects. Of course the elementary book would be a prerequisite for the advanced one, so that information does not need to be unnecessarily repeated. --[[User:Waqjan|Waqjan]] ([[User talk:Waqjan|talk]]) 22:15, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

:The proposal is in need of update, see for instance the [[C++]] page, even the forced merge of the previous Programming:C++ was see as erroneous, but is now a ''faith accompli'' readdressing it would be of no service, in the mean time several parallel works do now exist in several subjects, this has both positive and negative points, the major one being the fragmentation of the contributors poll but this also increases the freedom of choice and a more freedom to implement divergent approaches, same of those you have just enumerated.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:20, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

== Move that Forking policy to be rejected and/or be turned it into a guideline ==

A forking policy without a previous understanding of a derived work and approval of a [[Wikibooks:General_voting_rules]] or a definition to a book community should not exist. Forking brings content, the problem with forking a work on wikibooks is not space as if equal parts are on different works those can be merged, it will only provide a different context to the content on both works.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. This particular text needs some work, but I think we need some kind of policy against unnecessary forking of material. Furthermore, it has been de facto wikibooks policy for some time that multiple books on a single subject are merged. In general, it's better to make policy conform to the community then it is to try and change the community by instantiating new policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:54, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
*: I think you are not opposing because we need a fork prevention policy, but because content shouldn't be duplicated, I agree with that and a merge should be enforced to the oldest copy of the offending page, but by providing multiple instances of the same content to be accessible in different ways even with different structures we are providing a service to readers and facilitating the work of contributors...
*: More, every edit of a book on wikibooks creates a fork (derived work) of the original text/book, even more problematic is that by altering a secondary page you can't keep up with all versions (they still exist on wikibooks) of a work as there is no way a easy reversal or to display of a previous version by date, and a fork policy without a proper definition to the merge process is unworkable. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
*:Since you have not extended your view on the opposition, I will try to explain my points a bit more, we (Wikibooks community) should have a Merge policy and a Fork guideline (the Merge policy would enable correcting abuses and validate the guideline) the first would &quot;force&quot; a merge of any abandoned work or give some force to impose limitations to forks, the guideline would define a fork and explain how and why to avoid one and how to proceed with one within certain parameters or pointing to the Merge policy, the bottom line is that by avoiding forks we are not giving the proper treatment to Wikibooks objectives, we need authors, forks enable authors to create by forking a work, this would effectively reduce any chance for conflicts and solve many other problems and enable and even foster competition on the forked versions, let imagine for example we place a time limit on the fork and original version and would force a merge with the book with more content/votes or near to &quot;completion&quot; or some similar resolution in a fixed time frame or even passing a similar process like VfD on both copies (I think the whole community should have a say in selecting the version to keep on Wikibooks).
*:On the other side with a no fork rule the only result will be less authors (or if you prefer less content) because increased protectionism for the existing versions, reducing authors freedom and empowering users that probably would not have the same level of commitment to block or entangle productive users from contributing and will in fact be increasing the chance for conflicts. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:59, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:I'm still not convinced of a need for forking material at all. The project has gotten along fine by shunning forks in the past. I can't think of a situation where material needs to be shared between books, and transclusion can't do the same job. Wikibooks has too few users writing on any one topic for us to be forking content all over the place. We just dont have the infrastructure to support it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:53, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::This feature would allow contributors greater freedom to create books, by allowing them to build upon the contributions of others in alternative directions. The best way to get more people to contribute (and continue to do so) is to make whatever tools they might need available to them. While we have had reasons to shun certain kinds of forks before, the kind of forking being discussed here isn't about resolving conflicts between editors, but rather conflicts between topics. Even the garden book might require forking at some point, if separate textbooks were needed for tropical or monsoon-climate gardening, or large-scale agriculture in any number of climates (those books would address a lot of the same things, but from different technical perspectives). Similarly, if someone were to write a textbook on hydrology, much of that information could be used as a basis for a book on petroleum exploration... but would you insist that those two books share the same chapters, rather than forking them off? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

:::In the first case, with the gardening book, it would seem to me more appropriate to simply expand the current book to fit additional technical perspectives. For instance, every page could have a section for &quot;temperate climates&quot; and a section for &quot;monsoon climates&quot;, etc. In this way, people wouldn't need to figure out which climate they were in before they started reading a book, the book would contain all the information for everybody who needs it. 
:::In the second case, it would be much easier for the petroleum exploration book to say &quot;This book relies heavily on principals already discussed in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[hydrology]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and the reader is expected to have read that book first&quot;. This way, we dont need to duplicate content at all, and we are advertising our books internally. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:15, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::::This really seems like an argument for putting square pegs into round holes. For example, having a separate section on each page for various climates would make the pages much larger than they would need to be, and would be similar to including versions in 4 different languages in order to avoid having to make duplicate books, or perhaps similar to insisting that a book on agriculture be required to be part of a biology book. As another example, a book on the History of the American Revolution would perhaps need to mention what was going on in Britain and Europe at the time, but forcing authors to transclude chapters from European or British history books (if we're allowing those to be separate books, of course) would limit the teaching value... a book on British history isn't going to relate the events there to events in the colonies with the same clarity and vigor that would be desirable for the American Revolution book. What this feature would allow authors to do is just take chapters from that other book and condense/expand/transform the material to fit the subject. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:03, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::If two pages contain the same information, they should be the same page. If two pages do not contain the same information, they should be separate pages. I can understand the idea of wanting to base the text of a new book off that of an existing book, but I can't see why we would want wholesale copying of pages and page histories to a new location. Sections of text that are being used verbatim between two or more modules should likely be templates or other transcluded pages. I've written several books that make use of the same tables or charts, and I transclude those tables individually where they are needed. Text that is not being used verbatim isn't likely to be generated by a copy operation anyway. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

(''reset tabs''&amp;larr;) That kind of transcluding might work for some books, but I assure you it won't for many other fields, both technical and non-technical. These kinds of forks might want to take a whole page from one book and transform it to fit the style and focus of another book. For an example, compare [[w:Aster (flower)]] and [[A Wikimanual of Gardening/Aster]]... the latter was built upon the former (using import), but takes an approach so different that even if transclusion of a Wikipedia article were possible, it would not be appropriate (and neither would transcluding that chapter be valid for Wikipedia). 

We're not talking about images and tables. Most books don't use tables in the same way that engineering books do.

I really just don't understand why you want to force contributors to do workaround solutions... it's not necessary, it can seriously hamper the progress of writing a book, and quite frankly it imposes an artificial restriction that can be poisonous to the feeling of creative freedom a textbook-writer deserves to have. Again (using the example I understand the best), forcing a biology book, a botany book, a horticulture book, an agriculture book, a dichotomous key, and a local field guide to trees to all share the same chapters if the content addresses the same thing is rediculous, and I can assure you that the authors of those books won't do it. This feature is simply to allow a valid way to copy a chapter from one book in order to modify it for use in another book. It's a time and effort saving tool that contributors can use to make use of materials that are already available, rather than having to reinvent the wheel every time. 

These are our alternatives:
#Forbid the authors of any given book from using materials from any other book (maybe block them if they do?)
#Ban the existence of 2 pages on wikibooks that address the same or very similar subjects (we can of course have a policy and jury board to decide when things are ''too'' similar to be permitted...).
#Permit authors of one book to take materials from another book, and adapt it to fit the book they're working on (if this were required to be done using the import tools, there would at least be a &quot;community filter&quot; provided by the administrator who's making the copy).

:I'm not really going to argue the point any further, If you say it's necessary I will follow your judgement on the matter. There are a couple of things that I dont want to see resulting from this:
:*People duplicating existing books, and abandoning them (especially new or short-term users).
:*People forking books because of disputes over content.
:*Duplicate books not being sufficiently different, and requiring later effort to merge them back together.
:Even if we have a forking policy, that doesnt mean that we no longer merge related books together. I think it might be prudent, before we allow forks to be created in this manner, that authors should have to specify exactly what their plans are with the duplicate material, so we can try to avoid the problems i've listed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::I share those concerns... I think te first and third are pretty much the same issue on this concern (the only way two books would end up being insufficiently distinct would be if one or the other was abandoned). 
::Since it's clear there will be vocal opposition to getting the tools set up without creating a policy first, I'm going to move this page to become an unstable branch of the current forking policy so that debate can continue there. The tools I had in mind just make it easier (or at least more graceful) than the alternatives, but the alternative methods aren't so arduous that we couldn't make do until the policy has some trial runs and we can see how well the actual forking part works for us. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

== Switched it around a bit (page name changed now) ==
: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;The following section has been merged in from [[Wikibooks talk:Forking and Merging]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:08, 16 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;
It seemed sensible to try to do this here, since we've been discussing it here. The template (which needs writing) for the talk page should do the same thing the tool would have done, and should include a category so that we can fix any forks in the future (I don't think there will be many, so catch-up should be a small chore). 

I'll work more on it in the morning, but it should have some language to address the concern of making forks without discussing it first, in the hopes of preventing abuse and/or abortive forks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Renewed proposal ==

I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Forking_policy&amp;diff=1395656&amp;oldid=1394976 merged and trimmed] what I see as the essence of [[Wikibooks:Forking and Merging]], [[Wikibooks:Subject policy]] and this page. I don't think there is any lack of consensus with the general idea of this proposal and if we keep it short and simple without going into hypothetical details, we should be able to make this official without difficulty.

Should the need for more nuance present itself, we can deal with it then and reflect what we've learnt in this policy.

For now, I suggest that we delete the other two, merge in their edit histories and make this official. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:47, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:This is premature, and requires formalization of announcement and proceedings (skipping any of those will remove any  validity to the discussion).
:The merges should be agreed and worked upon before a real discussion on the subject takes place (as a way of adopting the text as a guideline or policy), since only then similar view points on the issue can consistently be argued and converged upon without people requesting the adoption of special versions of the text.
:There is also the problem of understating definitions (I've just added one for the fork, to this text), some of the other versions get into that more verbosely, I prefer reducing them to the minimum or even using links to Wikipedia or Wiktionary would probably do a better job, but that lead into another problem...
:How we can define a Fork on a book, fork is used most commonly on the software world to characterize a split on the evolution of a software project (arguably derived from a fork of a process in an operating system), that is, when a person or group of people decide to take the last version of the project and build a derivative with a distinct scope or objective, there are also forks that started because splits in policy and lack of coordination between the participants, in any case it is hard to define and argue that any fork is negative or has a negative impact on the work itself or on the end user, it does undeniably have an impact on the community working on the project but if things reach the fork stage then it doesn't really count since agreement on the evolution of the project has already failed. This rational can easily be proven if taken in consideration situations were forks aren't possible due to licensing or other legal o structural consideration, so forking is mostly a positive thing in itself, it removes barriers and foster creativity and the undertaking of different approaches, but can we call fork to a book split, hardly.
:If we agree in preventing this kind of book slits in project, we should define that &quot;our&quot; forks are only valid to projects namespaces, since we work on the bases of the GFDL all our work are forks or splits of a previous edit, even some of the project we have on Wikibooks are &quot;forks&quot; of works, derivatives, or revisions, each time there is a page edit there is a split from the previous revision. But this causes another issue on copy of content across books on Wikibooks, how quantitatively we define a split or a fork (or whatever name we get to call it), only on 100% identical replication of a work? What about transclusions they should be considered in this shouldn't they (even only to exclude them from what we consider replication).
:Ultimately I don't see &quot;forks&quot; as a problem, I agree that they should be the last solution, but if we adopt a good merge policy forks will not be an issue nor shall we have a good enough reason to object to them, we should however clearly define what we call a fork on Wikibooks and state that only failing to reach a consensus regarding the evolution of project should be a reason for one with some other hard considerations (ie recent number of edits/contributions to the work etc), we shouldn't encourage forks only so people can make a point or prevent a work from evolving. As the first person to fork a book and the basis for the creation of the policy and the executor of the &quot;forced&quot; merge, I do have a good understanding on the needs and problems regarding both issues and the rationals that defend or contest such decisions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:37, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:: &quot;''This is premature, and requires formalization of announcement and proceedings''&quot; No, we have no such policies.
:: &quot;''The merges should be agreed and worked upon before a real discussion on the subject takes place''&quot; As I explained above. These mergers are the common denominator of the three merged. What remains are details that we can be without for now. They can be added later.
:: &quot;''There is also the problem of understating definitions''&quot; This is not a problem. The proposal is clear in what the criteria for creating a seperate book is.
:: Many of your edits to the policy were helpful, Panic, but I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Forking_policy&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1396161 re-added] &quot;''is not an acceptable alternative to improving existing content or resolving disputes.''&quot; which you had [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Forking_policy&amp;diff=1396161&amp;oldid=1396150 removed] with the summary: &quot;''removed reason since all should be invalid added must since this part should be enforced''&quot;. Provisions like this do not limit the scope, but help hone its aim. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:12, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:::On the premature nature of the renewal of the proposal, the thing is that a discussion should take place to bring all proponents to the table (since there are several texts on the subject. None approved. 
:::The previous text on this proposal was enforced in the past, badly since it was not a result of a community decission process), in any case, the remark about the need for announcement and proceedings is still pertinent.
:::If you really intend on lunching the process to make the text into a approved policy or guideline you have to announce it (normal place is on general announcements forum), and establish the proceeding requirements and set a time frame to the outcome, previous decisions took, what I see as productive and conclusive format, this has somehow not been fallowed on the bots proposal, resulting in its status to become inconclusive and even if the participants now came to a consensus its validity would be object of debate. Even a non approval status to the previous discussion would be more clean.
:::On the merges proposals I still think that they should be resolved and acted upon before initiating an approval proceedings of this text, since it will remove and address other Wikibookians disagreements with it (they can be even considered a forks of this proposal :), since it predates any other text on the issue and the objective/function are similar) bringing everything to the table before is better than latter if you aim to bring consensus to the issue.
:::Regarding the definitions, I personally have no objection on that regard but from past discussions I know some other Wikibookians will (just examine the last few talk pages on similar decission processes, even the bot proposal IIRC was objected to on those grounds), I too dislike verbosity on policy and guideline text but recognize that establishing and nailing down some core definitions or interpretations is needed or the text will just be open to very distinct interpretations. (I above gave the problem of quantifying a &quot;fork&quot; or how forks aren't easily translated to a Wiki environment, even more under the GFDL, I do think you and me are talking on the same issue, but also took this chance to   show that even a proposal text have and will probably be forked).      
:::On the text changes I have no major objection just would like you to describe how forks are harmful to the Wikibooks project, and if is you intention to block future forks in general I also don't see a need to define one or two reasons that can promote one (the end of the same paragraph).
:::I see &quot;forks&quot; as unproductive at worst, but also see several benefits as described above. I again state that a strong merge guideline would address those problem in a non prohibitive and confrontational way. I'm not strongly against a fork policy (see previous thread on this page) but don't see it as incentive to productive participation to generate content. Can you state any problem with a fork that a later merge couldn't address?
:::A merge guideline, well constructed, would be inclusive rather than exclusive, and open to corrections, with the added benefit that volunteers would already contributed content to the project.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:51, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: Wow, Panic. I can't remember if this is a record for you, but a 175 word paragraph without a full-stop is certainly impressive!
:::: I had no intention of marking this official without bringing it to the attention of the community. Please don't make assumptions about people's motives or intentions.
:::: &quot;''Can you state any problem with a fork that a later merge couldn't address?''&quot; This is mentioned in the policy:
::::: &quot;''Books with similar content, scope and audience should be developed as a single wikibook in order to reduce the duplication of efforts.''&quot;
:::: Real-life examples abound. I can point to the [[Japanese]] book that I'm involved in (browse around the introduction pages, [[Talk:Japanese]] and its archives) which we've been stitching together from layers of contributions. We've already deleted over a hundred pages of duplicate content that we've merged. Another example is [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]] which is now in it's fourth edition, each of which has duplicate pages. From a reader's perspective, that's hardly a quality book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:47, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::There I fixed it for you (I did use commas) :) ...
:::::I was going to ignore it but since you seem somewhat offended I must make it clear. I didn't make any assumptions about your actions here, I only called your attention to the facts as I see them, as can clearly be read above, and based on your own reply:
:::::'''&quot;''This is premature, and requires formalization of announcement and proceedings''&quot; No, we have no such policies.'''
:::::I could have misread you on your words, but clearly haven't. I recognize you are aware of [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policy, this reply only made me lengthily restate the obvious. I was not claiming any wrong doing nor demanding you acted on it, only stating that this is the needed procedure, as for motives and intentions I strive to not state my assumptions as facts to others, something that I agree is rarely seen on this project, but be assured that if I ever make that mistake it will own up to it. I do prefer to be direct and if possible factual when I start pointing other peoples mistakes and expect others to do the same. Just take the above example, you assumed my assumption and acted as someone that interpreted my words as an act with bad intention, not so, as the can clearly be read on the posts above.
:::::Claiming duplication of efforts is not a rational argument. People forking a work will not be working together nor in the same direction (if so the fork would not occur) so no real duplication of content/work will occur after the fork. I could however agree that contributors would probably have to duplicate corrections to content predating the fork, but this in no big problem since most of those corrections are done by people reading the work, and after the fork some heavy restructuring is expected in both works. I doubt a non contributor would initiate a fork in any circumstance. If a fork occurs I can assure you that only the more active and fit work would survive in the end, you must always keep in mind that all contributors are volunteers and a fork is not taken lightly and only by people wanting to actively contribute.
:::::From the time I'm on the project I only have observed, IIRC, two other people thinking as a fork as a solution and I don't think anyone did come to fork, one was the OOP book, the other I forgot. If I'm not in error the [[Japanese]] work is a result at least of merging together two &quot;distinct&quot; works (something that involved also moving/renaming of the namespaces, you can better than me clarify the history), in any case you are discarding the issues concerning factual errors that existed (and had to be corrected), the book history, the size of the works and level of contributors/activity this all are factors that have an impact on completing a merge, it seems that you are only pointing negative aspects and not recognizing any added value, were the works stalled ?
:::::In the case of the C++ book, were I had the experience of forking and merging, there was no real content difficulties since the original book stalled after the fork, besides minor structural changes, but I see merging a fork as an easier task that merging together two distinct books on the same subject (and I have done that also).
:::::As for the [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]] I had examined it some time ago and can't really understand the project. I avoid doing even maintenance tasks on its pages even welcoming editors to it (I know they should be a target for promoting participation) but I have looked into the edit habits of a few and can't make any specific conclusion other that most are editors on a task for that particular project. Are you also considering those &quot;editions&quot; as forks ? Do you expect retroactive implementation of the policy? (I think a different approach must be found for those distinct issues).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:32, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::: I've been racking my brains how or if to respond to this. As before, you cling on to your view of others' motives and misconstrue or dismiss any counter-arguments to it. I'm going to leave this and move on. If you think I'm trying to Shanghai this proposal past the community without review, please report it in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|general reading room]] or request reprimands in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|administrative assistance reading room]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:28, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

As far as I can tell, there is no objection to the merger itself in the discussion above. I'd like to move this on, so unless there are any substantive objections ''to that step'', let's merge the page histories and archive the respective discussions in the coming days. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:45, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Yes_check.svg|15px| ]] '''Done''' I'll archive the discussions later. I haven't quite decided when to push for a formal discussion to make this an official guideline or proposal, essay, or rejected. There are currently several other discussions in the community (notably the [[Wikibooks talk:FlaggedRevs Extension|FlaggedRevs discussion]] on revising the +editor automatic granting criteria) which (should) take priority over this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:45, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

== * Courses ==

The [[Physics Course]], [[Arithmetic Course]], [[Trigonometry Course]], and [[Geometry Course]] books that appear to be low-quality poorly translated versions of content at another language Wikibooks dumped by an anonymous editor that refuses to engage with the community, with the mathematics books coming after the RFD of another mathematics book by likely the same person under another IP, almost make me want to try to push this to policy.  At least I can take solace in the fact that all books have now been classified with {{tl|status}} so that readers will gravitate toward higher-quality, more complete books. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:02, 13 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade


==Ingredients==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* 4 large yellow or white [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], sliced into thin strips
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ⅛ teaspoon coarse ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==

# Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onions, and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]], stirring, for about 15 minutes, or until they begin to brown. (Do not cook over high heat, as the outside of the onions will char too quickly before the insides have softened and sweetened.) When onions have softened and turned a light golden brown, add sugar.
# Continue stirring until sugar melts and begins to bubble.
# As the onions turn a richer brown, clear a space in the center of the pan. Pour balsamic vinegar directly onto the hot pan, then stir it into onions.
# When vinegar has reduced, leaving a syrupy coating on the onions, turn off the heat. Stir in salt and pepper, and allow onions to cool.

Focaccia with Onion Marmalade, Blue Cheese and Walnuts

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Focaccia Genovese Dough|Focaccia Dough]]
* 1½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade|Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|blue cheese]], crumbled or cut into ½-inch pieces
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Chop|coarsely chopped]] [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|500°F]].
# When the focaccia is fully risen and ready to bake, gently spread onion marmalade evenly over surface. Evenly distribute blue cheese over onion marmalade and scatter walnuts over the top.
# Place the sheet pan on the middle shelf of the oven, lower temperature to 450 degrees and [[Cookbook:Bake|bake]] for 20 minutes. Rotate pan 180 degrees and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the dough is golden on the bottom and top.
# When the baking is complete, set up a cooling rack inside a sheet pan and immediately remove the focaccia from the pan by using a metal [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] or pastry blade to break all contact with the walls of the pan. Place the spatula or blade between the focaccia and the parchment or pad and lift the edge up. Then jiggle the focaccia out of the pan onto the cooling rack. Pour any excess oil from the pan over the top of the focaccia. Let the focaccia cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving.

I would like to suggest some other visual identifier (probably color) in addition to (or possibly instead of) italics that would encourage people to mouseover the words while they read. This would aid in learning how to use the book without having to read the &quot;how to use this book&quot; page (which I suspect would often be skipped). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

I don't stick to italics, only the markup must not distract the reader. I could imagine either a dark colour similar to that of links, i. e. dark blue or dark purple, or some sort of underlining, both of which could encourage people to hover their cursor. Maybe some changing visual key like the regular link markup would do as well. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 20:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

I have tried underline and dark blue color, and I think color markup works better. Let me know about your thoughts. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 20:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

But the blue color, just like in links, is exceptionally bad. Here are my suggestions:
: look at &lt;span style=&quot;color: SteelBlue&quot;&gt;translated text&lt;/span&gt; here
: look at &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: LightSteelBlue&quot;&gt;translated text&lt;/span&gt; here
: look at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; color: #717171&quot;&gt;translated text&lt;/span&gt; here

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

Forms frequently need to display fields that are not editable by the user.  The following program demonstrates this feature.

This is done in XForms using a binding and a style sheet.

A single field (or group of fields) can be marked as read-only with a single bind statement.  For example, suppose you had a set of fields related to shipping supplies to remote staff in your IT department.  The billing address could not be changed, only who an item was shipped to.

The following single line in the model would make all of the sub-elements of BillToAddress read-only:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;/PurchaseOrders/BillToAddress&quot; readonly=&quot;true()&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that because of CSS, all the fields under this  binding will be marked read-only.  This is one good reason you may want to logically group read-only data elements in an application.

Sancocho, popular in the Dominican Republic, called by many its national dish.

==Ingredients==

===Marinade and chicken:===

* 1 large [[Cookbook:Orange|orange, juiced]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] fresh [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* ¼ bunch [[Cookbook:Parsley|curly parsley]], large stems removed
* ¼ bunch [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]], large stems removed
* 2 tablespoons fresh [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano leaves]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|cloves garlic]], minced
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Chicken|boneless, skinless chicken breasts]], cut into bite-size pieces

===Soup:===

* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:oil|clear oil]], such as [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]]
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|white onion]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]], peeled and cut into ½-inch chunks
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|boiling potato]], unpeeled and cut into bite-size chunks
* 1 [[Cookbook:Plantain|green plantain]], peeled and sliced into ½-inch thick slices (see Note)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Corn|ear corn]], quartered
* 1 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]] or [[Cookbook:Habanero|habanero]] [[Cookbook:Chile|chile]], seeded and minced
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Hot cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], optional
* Hot sauce, optional
* Chopped cilantro, optional

==Procedure==

===Marinade:=== 

# In bowl of a [[Cookbook:Food processor|food processor]] or [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], combine orange juice, lemon juice, parsley, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper, and process until combined.
# Pour mixture into a non-reactive bowl, add chicken and stir to combine.
# Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.

==Soup:==

# Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. When hot, use a slotted spoon to lift the chicken out of the marinade and place in the pot, reserving marinade. Cook chicken until opaque, stirring occasionally. 
# Add reserved marinade, vegetable stock and water to the pot, and bring to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
# Add onion, sweet potato, potato, plantain, corn, jalapeño, salt and pepper.
# Bring back to a boil, reduce to low and cook partially covered for 1 to 1½ hours.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* To serve, ladle soup into bowls and top with a small scoop of rice, if desired. Pass hot sauce and cilantro at the table.
* Because this soup has a long simmering time, choose an unripe green plantain rather than a ripe yellow or black-colored plantain, which has a softer texture.
* Each cook makes his own recipe for sancocho, combining root vegetables with different kinds of meat, some with up to seven meats.
* To make the soup even more authentic, add a small peeled cubed [[Cookbook:Cassava|yuca root]] to the broth, along with the other vegetables.

|title=Euro coins and banknotes
|content=The Euro, symbol €, was first introduced as a currency on January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 and today is the official currency of 27 European countries. There are banknotes valued 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 €. Each one has a couple of security features such as an holographic imprint, water sign and ink with changing colour, making it very difficult to reproduce them illegally. The crumbling banknotes add to other interesting physical aspects of the currency, such as that the inlay of coins can be broken out by manual force or that the coins with inlays have an unequal distribution of weight and thus are not apt to be tossed in stochastic experiments.

[[Image:Adult_deer_tick%28cropped%29.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Adult deer tick. Deer ticks are the primary transmitters of Lyme disease in the United States.]]
==What does it look like?==
It is part of the spider or arachnid class. It has one body part. When it is in the larva stage it has 6 legs. When it is in the nymph stage it has 8 legs. Some ticks are as big as a pin head and some are about an inch long. Hard ticks have hard shields and look flat. Soft ticks have a soft shield and look like a raisin.They can be seen without a microscope.When a female is engorged with blood it's abdomen grows to many times it's normal size. There are two kinds of ticks, a hard tick and a soft tick. A hard tick has a hard shield on its body and is shaped like a flat seed.A soft ticks skeleton is leathery and it resembles a raisin.

==Where does it live?==
Ticks spend most of their time in or around the ground just waiting around for a host to attach to.  Blacklegged ticks can live in shrubs to hide on pets like dogs and cats. They like the woods. Soft ticks can live in caves, cabins and on birds. Both of the ticks live in the United States.Even though they like dark damp places, they can live just about anywhere. Once a tick was under water for hours and survived. They sometimes cling to the top of fences or sides of buildings where they can sense the presence of a host. Most ticks like to climb to the top of a blade of grass too.

==What does it eat?==
Ticks feed on the blood of mammals, and some like to feed on birds and reptiles.
A tick attaches itself to the skin of an animal and sucks blood.                                                                                                                                                                          When ticks bite to obtain blood there is always a possibility of transmitting certain diseases like lyme disease,rocky mountain spotted fever and many others. Females need to feed to lay eggs. After engorging on blood from a host they drop to the ground. Some ticks only feed once but lay around 10,000 eggs. Other ticks feed several times and lay about 25 eggs after each meal.When ticks feed on diseased birds or land animals, they carry that disease to the next host they visit.

==How does it defend itself?==

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
There are four stages of life. Eggs are laid in the thousands after a female is engorged and drops from the host. The larva live in the grass and leaves not far from the ground. They have 6 legs. This can be the feeding stage too.The larva molt into nymph with 8 legs.It is about 1.5 mm long. When this stage is feeding it can cause itching on the host.When the larva is engorged it molts into the adult stage.It is about 3 mm long. Then they mate, find a host, feed, and females then lay eggs. Then it starts all over again.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Ticks like to be around dark damp places. They only eat blood. When they are full they are engorged with blood. They will drop off the host when full.Most ticks spend their time on the ground, at the top of a blade of grass or leaf, on a fence, or sitting on the siding of a building just waiting for a host, person/dog/cat/bird, to come along. They can sense the heat of a host, or even the vibrations in the air if a host comes near. They can even spot shadows of a host as it passes by. They do not jump, fly, or even crawl very quick, but they are good climbers.
We have to understand how they behave so we can find better ways of keeping them away from us and our pets.

==How does this bug affect people?==
This bug can make people sick if they don't look over themselves after being in high grass.

Ticks carry diseases  that cause illness like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and Lyme disease.  Lyme disease is the most common yet it doesn't occur often. You can get a rash, have a seizure, or your heart can skip a beat.Most cases of lyme disease occur in the Northeastern part of the US.Only deer ticks carry the disease. Most people get the tick from their own backyards.  People need to protect themselves when going into woody and grassy places. Spray with a repellent with a chemical called deet. Where light colored clothes so if one goes on you you can see it. Wear long sleeves and tuck your pants into your socks.

[[Image:Armadillidium_vulgare_001.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A woodlouse. Woodlice have many names including armadillo bug, cheeselog, monkeypea, pill bug, roly-poly, potato bug, roll up bug and sow bug.]]
Woodlice are known by many names including pill bug, armadillo bug, potato bug, and roly-poly. They are crustaceans like crabs, or shrimp, but they live on land. There are more than 3000 known species.

==What does it look like?==
Woodlice are very small. They have a hard exoskeleton that is made of several sections like an armadillo's shell. They have fourteen legs and are often gray or brown. They have two antenna extending from the head and two small tubes called uropods extending from the back.

==Where does it live?==
They live in moist environments like forests and gardens all over earth. They are so common that on many parts of the world you cannot turn over a stone lying on the ground without finding them. 

==What does it eat?==
Woodlice eat rotting plants and fungi. A woodlouse gets rid of waste by secreting ammonia through its shell as a gas.

[[Image:Slater_rolled_up_for_wiki.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A woodlouse rolled in a protected position.]]

==How does it defend itself?==
Many species can roll up into a small ball the size of a pill (that's why they're sometimes called &quot;pill bugs&quot;) to protect themselves. Some species produce bad smelling chemicals through their uropods as a defense mechanism. Their hard shell also helps to protect them.  

==What stages of growth does it go through?==
After mating, the female carries its eggs in a pouch under its body. These eggs hatch and the young woodlice remain in the pouch until they are big enough to survive on their own. As a woodlouse grows it sheds one half of its shell, then the other. It goes through gradual metamorphosis as the younglings get larger.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Woodlice need moisture because they breathe through gills. This is why they are often found in damp, dark places, like under rocks and logs. They are usually nocturnal. 

==How does this bug affect people?==
Woodlice are a beneficial garden bug, helping to break down plant-matter and create soil. They are not a serious household pest as they do not spread disease and do not damage wood or structures. They can sometimes damage plants like strawberries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Motion of a Projectile
Candidates should be able to:
(a) model the motion of a projectile as a particle moving with constant acceleration and understand
any limitations of this model;
(b) use horizontal and vertical equations of motion to solve problems on the motion of projectiles,
including finding the magnitude and direction of the velocity at a given time or position, the
range on a horizontal plane and the greatest height reached;
(c) derive and use the cartesian equation of the trajectory of a projectile, including problems in
which the initial speed and/or angle of projection may be unknown.--&gt;

A '''projectile''' is a body which moves under the action of gravity, and may also move horizontally. For M2 we only consider projectiles moving in one plane.

A projectile at launch can be thought as a vector, as either a velocity and angle or initial velocities in x and y planes, [http://i.imgur.com/lmQd6.jpg shown here].

As the object travels in only one plane, if we assume no air resistance (as is standard in M2), then the projectiles horizontal motion will remain constant while the vertical will only have the objects mass (gravity) acting upon it. This leads to the two equations below.

 &lt;math&gt;\ x_v = u cos( \theta )\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ y_v = u sin( \theta ) - g t \!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Below are the equations for the projectiles displacement. One can derive these from our equations of motion from M1 or integrate with respect to t the velocity equations as &lt;math&gt;\ x_v = \frac{d (x_s)}{dt)} \equiv \int x_v dt = x_s + c \!&lt;/math&gt; since we define our start point as the origin, c = 0 

 &lt;math&gt;\ x_s = u cos( \theta ) t \!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ y_s = u sin( \theta ) t - \tfrac{1}{2} g t^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

With these four equations, and applying some facets of symmetry we can solve many novel problem.

* When &lt;math&gt;\ y_s = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;, the projectile has just been launched or is in line with the point of launch (or on flat ground, landed). To calulate range, and the time of flight, we use this fact and rearrange

&lt;math&gt;\ y_s = u sin( \theta ) t - \tfrac{1}{2} g t^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ 0 =  t ( u sin( \theta )  - \tfrac{1}{2} g t ) \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ t = 0\ and\ t = \frac{ 2 u sin( \theta )}{g} \!&lt;/math&gt;

The x_s at this point in time is the range, 

&lt;math&gt;\ x_s = u cos( \theta )\ *\ \frac{ 2 u sin( \theta )}{g} \!&lt;/math&gt;

C3 identity &lt;ref&gt;[[A-level_Mathematics/OCR/C3/More_Trigonometric_Functions_and_Identities#Double-Angle_Formulae|OCR C3 Trignometric Identities]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sin(2x) = 2 \sin (x) \cos(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ x_\triangle = \frac{u^2 sin ( 2 \theta ) }{g} \!&lt;/math&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;\ y_v = 0 , y_s = maximum \!&lt;/math&gt;, since our vertical velocity is being accelerated downwards by the objects weight, using M1 knowledge (h being maximum height) 

&lt;math&gt;\ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ 0^2 = (u sin( \theta ))^2 + 2 ( - g ) h \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ 0 = u^2 sin^2 ( \theta ) - 2 g h \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ 2 g h = u^2 sin^2 ( \theta ) \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ h_\triangle = \frac{u^2 sin^2 ( \theta )}{2 g} \!&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Pediculus humanus capitis CDC0377.png|thumb|right|300px|A head louse. These insects live on the heads of human beings.]]

==What does it look like?==

Most lice belong to the diverse family Philopteridae. Some species have wings and others do not. They are pale in color. They are 1/32 to 1/8-inch long. Eyes or eye tubercles (rounded areas) are present. There are 6 strong short legs with special claws at the ends for gripping. The specialized mouthparts are adapted for sucking blood.

Human lice belong to the Order Phthiraptera and family Pediculidae. The 2 subspecies of human lice—head lice and body lice-are almost identical in appearance. They are gray in color and flattened in shape. The female is about 1/16 to 1/8-inch long; the male is a little smaller. Each of the six legs has a hook-like claw to help anchor the louse to the hair shaft. Head lice do not jump or fly. Head lice tend to take on the hair color of the host.

Chewing Lice have small, flattened bodies without wings  Their mouthparts have mandibles (jaws) for chewing. They have short, segmented antennae. The head is wider than the thorax. There are 1 or 2 claws on the legs. Mammal Chewing Lice are 1/32 to 1/8-inch long. They are pale brown in color. The large, square head has short antennae and mandibles for chewing. Each of the 6 short legs has a single tarsal claw.

Barklice belong to the Order Psocoptera. They have a large head, bulging eyes, and long filiform (threadlike) antennae. There are usually 2 pairs of membranous wings. They are 1/32 to 1/4-inch long. They are dull brown, black, or gray in color. Their wings are held in “rooflike” fashion and may have spots and irregular patches of color.

Booklice also belong to the Order Psocoptera. They have flat, yellowish-brown bodies and most have no wings. They are 1/64 to 1/32-inch long. They have small eyes and usually have short antennae. 

Parasitic Lice have flattened, wingless bodies. Short legs are often modified for clinging to fur or feathers.

Birdlice are 1/32 to 1/4-inch long with an oval abdomen and 6 short, stout legs with 2 claws each. The large, roughly triangular head has biting mandibles. 

Sucking Lice are small and have a flattened body with no wings. They are about 1/8-inch in length. Sucking mouthparts are stored inside the head when not in use. Compound eyes are small or absent.

==Where does it live?==

Lice occur worldwide and live in a wide range of habitats. Some live in the soil; others in treetops. They invade buildings and houses where food is available.

Barklice are found on leaves, foliage, bark, and bare wood of standing dead trees. They are found in bird nests and on rocks where lichen grows.

Pediculus humanus live on human hosts and sometimes on monkeys. Pediculus schaeffi is found exclusively on apes. The Body Louse lives and reproduces in clothing fibers. The Head Louse lives entirely in hair. Its eggs are called nits and they are glued to the host’s hair. 

Pubic Lice live almost anywhere on a very hairy body, but they are usually found in armpits, beards, and groin.   

Mammal Chewing Lice live on livestock, such as horses and cattle, and on household pets. They are found on non-domesticated species as well. 

Marine animals, such as seals, sea lions, and walruses, are hosts for Spiny Sucking Lice.

==What does it eat?==

Lice usually feed on a specific host. For instance, Mammal Chewing Lice feed on mammals such as horses, cows, dogs, and cats. Some species, such as Barklice feed on a variety of organic matter such as lichens, fungi, and tree bark. Booklice graze in “herds” on lichen. They also eat grain, household food, and books. Sucking Lice feed on the host’s blood.

Bird Lice are a large group of pests with 2 important species. One species feeds on feathers of water birds and birds of prey. Another species attacks hummingbirds and sparrows.

==How does it defend itself?==

The very small size of lice makes them inconspicuous and hides them from sight. Head lice camouflage themselves by taking on the color of the hair. Adult female barklice protect their eggs by covering them with silk made in their salivary glands. They also make silk tents to protect other barklice.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Lice undergo incomplete metamorphosis--egg, nymph, and adult. Eggs are attached or glued onto areas of hosts where lice live. There are usually 5 nymphal stages. A few species bear live young, but most lay eggs. Females lay 50-300 eggs at one time. There is an 8-day gestation period. Eggs can hatch any time during the year. After hatching, nymphs start feeding within minutes in order to survive. They become full adults in 9-12 days, living only about 2 weeks.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Most species are solitary, but some are sociable. Many species of lice are ectoparasites, living permanently on the bodies of birds and mammals without killing them. Some lice live in strange places, such as inside pelican pouches or in feather quills. Lice have even been found on prehistoric mummies.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Lice infestations generally occur in people who live in crowded conditions and rarely bathe or change clothes. Infestation with lice is called Pediculosis. In people it causes itching and sleeplessness.  

Body Lice are dangerous because they can transmit the organisms that cause infections, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever. A louse becomes a carrier after biting a patient. The infection is passed on when another individual scratches the louse or its feces into the skin. In World War I many soldiers died of these diseases.
 
Head Lice outbreaks are common among young children. Head Lice are transmitted from one person to another on combs, hair brushes, or hats. There are usually only 10 at a time on a head. They do not burrow into the scalp and rarely cause serious infections.
  
Several lice species are important pests of domestic animals, especially poultry. Dog Lice infestation may cause an animal to become very thin because constant grooming interferes with eating. 

Some Bird Lice species, such as the Shaft Louse, can be serious poultry pests. Infestations of Chicken Body Lice can lead to feather-loss and infection.

QUOTE: &quot;You don't need to animate the 2 bones in the legs, just place the body and the foot, the leg will follow automagically.&quot;
HA HA; even though its not in the dictionary, automagical seems to be the right word for the job.

Brachial Plexus

The brachial plexus is formed by the cervical nerve roots emerging from c-5 to t-1 with some individuals having contributions from c-4 (prefixed) and some from t-2 (post fixed).  These nerve roots then form a bundle as they emerge from the spine and then pass behind the clavicle and into the upper arm becoming the nerves of the upper limb.  Anatomically the plexus assumes typical patterns of which there are minor variation but which conceptually help when confronted with the damaged anatomy either from an open or closed injury.  In particular a knowledge of the usual location of specific motor branches can help specify the anatomic location of injury helping to reveal prognosis and plan suitable therapeutic intervention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This documentation was written by Andrew Lindesay (http://www.lindesay.co.nz) in 2006 as part of supported code in the LEWOStuff framework, but this material has been transcribed here.  It was written around the time of WebObjects 5.2 and 5.3 on the 1.4 JVM.  WebServicesCore is the framework used in MacOS-X for communications with SOAP services vended on the internet.  This page describes some problems that exist at the time of writing with getting WebServicesCore to communicate properly with WebObjects' WebServices framework.

=== Multirefs ===

WebServicesCore does not appear to be able to process the 'multiref' values which are returned from the AXIS engine.  To get around this, turn off multiref support in the WebObjects application.  To achieve this, locate the &lt;TT&gt;server.wsdd&lt;/TT&gt; file and the element &quot;&lt;TT&gt;parameter&lt;/TT&gt;&quot; with the name &quot;&lt;TT&gt;sendMultiRefs&lt;/TT&gt;&quot;.  Modify this element to have the value &quot;&lt;TT&gt;false&lt;/TT&gt;&quot;.

=== Nil Serialisation ===

This is a very simple deserialiser that can be used to deserialise to &lt;TT&gt;nil&lt;/TT&gt;.  Although this may seem less than useful, it proves very useful in the situation where you are using WebServicesCore which is a part of MacOS-X.

The WebServicesCore framework tends to serialise a &lt;TT&gt;nil&lt;/TT&gt; argument as &lt;TT&gt;&amp;lt;xyz xsi:type=&quot;nil&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/TT&gt;.  This is unfortunately missing type and so the SOAP engine is not able to instantiate the correct deserialiser for the type.  The correct output would be &lt;TT&gt;&amp;lt;xyz xsi:type=&quot;xsd:timeInstant&quot; xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/TT&gt;, but it appears that it may be difficult to get WebServicesCore to do this.

Regardless of the inbound type however, this serialiser will be able to convert the poorly encoded &lt;TT&gt;nil&lt;/TT&gt; to &lt;TT&gt;null&lt;/TT&gt; in the java environment.

You can use the &lt;TT&gt;registerWebServicesCoreNilDeserialiserFactoryForKnownTypes&lt;/TT&gt; method on the class &lt;TT&gt;LEWOWebServicesCoreNilDeserializerFactory&lt;/TT&gt; to setup easily for common known classes.

'''Rice flour''' is a [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] milled from [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. There are several grades, with different culinary uses including [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] and as a [[Cookbook:Thickener|thickener]].

Rice flour is [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] because it is milled from a gluten-free grain. It is often used as a substitute for [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]] in baking, but due to the lack of gluten, it requires other ingredients for binding such as [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca starch]], [[Cookbook:Guar gum|guar gum]] or [[Cookbook:Xanthan gum|xanthan gum]]. However, some rice flour may not be gluten-free, due to cross-contamination at the flour mill &amp;ndash; check with your supplier if this is important.

Some types of rice flour:
* '''White rice flour''' &amp;ndash; highly refined, generally best as a thickener or in combination with other flours
* '''Brown rice flour''' &amp;ndash; milled from the whole grain, so more flavour and nutrition than white rice flour; often not milled fine enough for baking, so select carefully
* '''Glutinous rice flour''' (also ''sweet rice flour'') &amp;ndash; made from white glutinous rice, better for baking than white rice flour
* '''Roasted red rice flour''' &amp;ndash; used for making [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]], [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosai]] or [[Cookbook:Hopper|hoppers]], especially in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan cuisine]]

This template creates a vocabulary box for the project '''[[Freistil]]''' like the one shown below. The syntax is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Freistil/VocBox|right|250px|FFEEAA|FFCC55|der Geldschein, die Banknote|banknote|kursieren|(to) circulate|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The first parameter is one of the values &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot; and declares on which side of the text the box shall float; if left out, &quot;right&quot; is assumed. The second parameter sets the width of the box. The third paramater sets the background color of the box, the fourth one the darker color of the border. Note that the # must be left out for technical reasons. Each one of them can be left out, which leads to the standard box with background #FFEEAA and border color #FFCC55.

After these parameters there follow up to 25 words and their translations. If needed, this amount can be increased; in that case, contact the project via [[Discussion:Freistil]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generic description about ERP5 Specific Zope tools needs to be here.

== portal_activities ==

The idea of portal activities (aka CMF Activity Tool) is described in section:

[[ERP5_Handbook/Getting_Started#Background_process_invocation_-_CMFActivity_system|Background process invocation - CMFActivity system]]

The way to use it is well described on the wiki:

http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToUseTheCmfActivityTool

The is little to add here, then.

== portal_catalog ==

Used to index objects, relations between objects, security information and some other frequently used data, to allow fast access, searching and sorting.

An object is recorded in catalog when you call .reindexObject on it. This method is called automatically upon every edit (technically, every setter - a method setThisProperty - triggers a reindex; if you write a script which is going to set many properties, better use _setThisProperty which does not reindex, and then call reindexObject; or even better call edit(property1 = value, property2 = value2) which reindexes once after setting all given properties).

Basic usage of portal_catalog is described here:

http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToSearchPortalCatalog

 TODO: advanced usage (I do not know enough...)

It is almost never needed to tweak catalog while implementing ERP5; some tricks are explained here:

http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToCreateRelatedKeys

http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToAddTableToCatalog

 TODO: check if related keys are not deprecated

== portal_categories ==

The idea and use of categories is described in:

[[ERP5_Handbook/Getting_Started#Categories|Categories]]

Base categories can be added with no restrictions (although it is always advisable to think for a moment, maybe one of the existing categories can do the job). Categories are indexed in MySQL; importantly, category memberships and relations between objects are also indexed, so the data model can be extended with little overhead.

Base category can be assigned to a portal type through property sheets, or simply through ZMI in portal_types tool. If an object has a given base category, it has all auto-generated accessors (setXXX, getXXX, setXXXList, getXXXlist).

Categories have a rich API; most heavily used methods are:
 .getCategoryChildLogicalPathItemList
returns all subcategories recursively as pairs, suitable for filling a dropdown or ListField;
 .getCategoryChildTranslatedLogicalPathItemList
same, but translated;
 .getCategoryMemberValueList
returns all object which are classified to this category, or any of its direct or indirect subcategories (this includes subcatories themselves, but you can give it portal_type argument).

From the other end, every ERP5 object (a Person, for instance) has a method 
 .isMemberOf
which returns True if the object belongs to the given category OR to any of its direct or indirect subcategories. For example, if a Person has a function: &quot;sales/retail/specialist&quot;, then 
 .isMemberOf(&quot;function/sales&quot;) == True.

Base category has a rich user interface with many cryptic options, most of which refer to programmable acquisition which is explained here: http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToUseProgrammableAcquisition

== portal_contributions ==

This is a versatile tool which can devour (or ingest, if you prefer) almost 
anything you throw into it, guess what it is, find the right place to put it,
analyze it and set various attributes of it.

More specifically: you call portal_contributions.newContent method, giving it some data (an uploaded file,
for instance) or a url, optionally many other things (see the method's docstring, it is quite good). The tool then:
* uses WebDAV machinery to find out portal type for the content (it uses content_type_registry, so this is the place to set it up)
* calls ZMI scripts:
** [Type]_getPropertyDictFromFilename
** [Type]_getPropertyDictFromContent
to find out properties of the object, and if it gets any, sets them on the object; the scripts are type-based, so e.g. if the object is qualified as Spreadsheet, the tool looks for a script named &quot;Spreadsheet_getPropertyDictFromFilename&quot; and if not found, calls a generic one &quot;Document_getPropertyDictFromFilename&quot;.

These scripts should return dicts of properties derived from file name and content; they can also return portal type, and this one will be eventually applied, so you can encode the content's type in its filename.
* finds out the right module to place the content in
* places the content in the right module

Contribution tool is used mostly by DMS module to ingest documents uploaded through web interface, sent in by email, or drag&amp;dropped through WebDAV. In the nearest future it may be used also to receive and ingest emails.

== portal_rules ==
Generic description about portal_rules needs to be here.
=== Invoice Transaction Rule ===
This rule is used by a builder to create '''Accounting Transaction Line''' after confirming '''Sale Invoice Transaction'''. You need to create a matrix of rules, which will be used to generate predefined '''Accounting Transaction Line'''.

If you need to define accounting system, this rule is what you need. Its definition will create proper accoutning movements, based on predicates.

Begin in portal rules tool create new '''Invoice Transaction Rule''', give it an '''Id''' and follow steps below for example based explanation.

==== Setting Predicates ====
After adding predicate you will be presented with a predicate screen. Set descriptive ''Title'', which will be used as matrix column or row header. After setting ''Membership Criteria'' you will be able to set some ''Membership Values''.

Predicates are grouped by a common ''Dimension'', so set it carefully.

Keep in mind, that predicates may be constructed for some type of objects. In case of accounting you might want to create separate predicates for Sale and Purchase. To achieve it fill '''Test Method ID''' field with '''Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsPurchase''' for purchase patch and '''Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsSale''' for sale path.

When your matrix is ready, you can go and edit a template for '''Accounting Transaction Line'''. To test it, confirm '''Sale Invoice Transaction''' which is in planned state and observe how '''Accounting Transaction Line''' objects are created and filled.

Do not forget to fill '''Source''' and '''Destination''' views with proper accounts. Until then, system won't be able to generate proper simulations.

==== Full example ====
This example is taken for real world situation - traders in Poland. Requirement is to have defined region category, at least 3 different regions - Poland, Europe Union and Rest of The World. Example region tree is:

* region/africa
* region/asia
* region/europe
* region/europe/eu
* region/europe/eu/bg
* region/europe/eu/de
* region/europe/eu/fr
* region/europe/eu/ie
* region/europe/eu/pl (yes, it is Poland)
* region/europe/eu/uk
* region/europe/non-eu/ua
* region/north_america
* region/south_america

Create Predicates in your '''Invoice Transaction Rule''':
# for purchase from Poland
#* title: Purchase from Poland
#* Dimension: region
#* Test method ID: Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsPurchase
#* Membership Criteria: source_region
#* Membership Values: only source_region/europe/eu/pl
# for purchase from Europe Union
#* title: Import from the Europe Union
#* Dimension: region
#* Test method ID: Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsPurchase
#* Membership Criteria: source_region
#* Membership Values: everything what is in source_region/europe/eu without source_region/europe/eu/pl and without source_region/europe/eu
# for purchase from rest of the world
#* title: Import from outside of the Europe Union
#* Dimension: region
#* Test method ID: Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsPurchase
#* Membership Criteria: source_region
#* Membership Values: everything in source_region without source_region/europe/eu and below
# for sale into Poland
#* title: Sale to Poland
#* Dimension: region
#* Test method ID: Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsSale
#* Membership Criteria: destination_region
#* Membership Values: destination_region/europe/eu/poland
# for sale to Europe Union
#* title: Export to the Europe Union
#* Dimension: region
#* Test method ID: Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsSale
#* Membership Criteria: destination_region
#* Membership Values: everything what is in destination_region/europe/eu without destination_region/europe/eu/pl and without destination_region/europe/eu
# for sale to rest of the world
#* title: Export to outside of the Europe Union
#* Dimension: region
#* Test method ID: Movement_explanationPortalTypeIsSale
#* Membership Criteria: destination_region
#* Membership Values: everything in destination_region without destination_region/europe/eu and below

Now play with created '''Accounting Rule Cell''', then create some orders - sale and purchase, expand them (by ordering or planning) and check for simulations (e.g. by using Base_viewSimulationTree). Of course you may go further and create some invoices.

'''Beware''': above configuration is for example purpose only.

'''Moussaka''' is a dish made throughout Turkey and the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] and eastern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]]. It is widely known as a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] and [[Macedonian]] dish based on [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] and minced [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], but is made differently across the region.

There is a comprehensive library of modules for connecting to databases from Perl programs. It is maintained by Tim Bunce and it is called DBI - database interface. The main website for DBI is [http://dbi.perl.org/ http://dbi.perl.org/].

==Installing the necessary modules==
To use DBI to connect to a database you need at least two CPAN modules. One is the main DBI module, simply called DBI. The other one is a ''DBD'' - a ''database driver'' module. There are DBI drivers for many mainstream database management systems, such as MySQL and Oracle. The examples in this tutorial concern Oracle; accordingly, the database driver for Oracle is called DBD::Oracle.

So, to run the examples in this chapter you need the modules DBI and DBD::Oracle.

===Installing DBI===
Installing DBI is straightforward. (For information about installing CPAN modules, see [[Perl Programming/CPAN|the chapter about CPAN]].)

===Installing DBD::Oracle===
When installing DBD::Oracle, there are a few things that you need to prepare.

====Getting the correct version====
First of all, when installing DBD::Oracle, make sure that you get a version by Pythian. Pythian maintains DBD::Oracle since version 1.17 (February 2006).

====Preparing environment variables====
You need to create the environment variables &lt;code&gt;ORACLE_USERID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ORACLE_SID&lt;/code&gt;. They are needed to test the connection to your database after DBD::Oracle is installed. The value for &lt;code&gt;ORACLE_USERID&lt;/code&gt; must be a valid username and password for your database. &lt;code&gt;ORACLE_SID&lt;/code&gt; must be set to database name as it appears in TNSNAMES.ORA. On a Unix-like system run:

&lt;code&gt;export ORACLE_USERID=&quot;''username''/''password''&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
export ORACLE_SID=&quot;''DATABASE_NAME''&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
 
On Windows you only need &lt;code&gt;ORACLE_USERID&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;set ORACLE_USERID=&quot;''username''/''password''@''DATABASE_NAME''&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

When you have finished defining these environment variables, install DBD::Oracle from CPAN the usual way.

==Using DBI==
 
Here is a very simple test script to get you going.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use strict;
use warnings;

# There is no need to use DBD::Oracle. The DBD is loaded automatically later.

{{Freistil/Header|title=Kopftuchverbot in Bayern ist nicht verfassungswidrig|note=ban on Muslim headscarves in Bavaria is not unconstitutional|date=16. Januar 2007|img=Woman in Tunisia.jpg|level=Advanced}} {{C|Das bayerische Verfassungsgericht|Bavarian Constitutional Court}} hat am heutigen Montag {{C|die Popularklage|popular plaint; a legal action that can be brought by any citizen}} der Islamischen Religionsgemeinschaft gegen {{C|das Kopftuchverbot|ban on Muslim headscarves}} abgewiesen. {{C|Damit|so}} dürfen muslimische Lehrerinnen auch in Zukunft in bayerischen Schulen kein Kopftuch tragen.

Die Islamische Religionsgemeinschaft, ein {{C|Verein|der Verein|association}} {{C|mit Sitz in|based in}} Berlin, hatte gegen das am 11. November 2004 mit den Stimmen der CSU-Mehrheit {{C|verabschiedete Gesetz|ein Gesetz verabschieden|(to) adopt a law}} {{C|geklagt|(to) sue}}, weil sie darin eine massive {{C|Beeinträchtigung|die Beeinträchtigung|impairment, damnification}} der {{C|Religionsfreiheit|die Religionsfreiheit|freedom of religion}} der Muslime sah. {{C|Außerdem|moreover}} {{C|verletze|verletzen|here: (to) infringe}} das Gesetz den {{C|Grundsatz der Gleichbehandlung|der Grundsatz der Gleichbehandlung|principle of equal treatment}}, {{C|da|because}} das Gesetz zwar allgemein das Tragen {{C|äußerlich sichtbar|outwardly visible}}er religiöser Symbole und Kleidungsstücke {{C|verbietet|verbieten|(to) prohibit}}, {{C|die Ordenstracht|habit (of nuns etc.)}} von {{C|Nonnen|die Nonne|nun}} jedoch ausgenommen ist. Der Verein hielt das Gesetz daher für verfassungswidrig.

In der {{C|Urteilsbegründung|die Urteilsbegründung|reasons for the judgment}} {{C|beriefen sich|sich berufen auf|(to) refer to, (to) base oneself on}} die Richter auf ein Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts aus dem Jahr 2003, in dem entschieden worden war, dass für ein Kopftuchverbot eine gesetzliche Regelung in den einzelnen Bundesländern {{C|notwendig sei|notwendig sein|(to) be required}}. Diese gesetzliche Grundlage habe der Freistaat Bayern geschaffen. Zudem müsse das Recht auf {{C|die freie Ausübung der Religion|free exercise of religion}} im Kontext mit anderen {{C|verfassungsmäßig|consitutional}} geschützten Rechten gesehen werden und auch die Religionsfreiheit von Schülern und Eltern beachtet werden, die die von der {{C|Lehrkraft|die Lehrkraft|teacher}} {{C|zum Ausdruck gebrachte|zum Ausdruck bringen|(to) express}} {{C|Überzeugung nicht teilen|jemandes Überzeugung teilen|(to) share someone's conviction}}.

Der bayerische Lehrerinnen und Lehrer-Verband (BLLV) und das bayerische Kultusministerium begrüßten die Entscheidung. So sagte der Präsident des BLLV, Albin Dannhäuser: „Schulen müssen Orte sein, an denen Toleranz und gegenseitiger Respekt gelebt werden.“

Das Tragen eines Kopftuches ist muslimischen Lehrerinnen {{C|außer in|here: not only in}} Bayern auch in mehreren anderen Bundesländern verboten. Als erstes Bundesland verabschiedete Baden-Württemberg Anfang Juni 2004 ein neues Schulgesetz, in dem das Tragen des Kopftuchs {{C|gesetzlich untersagt|jm. etw. gesetzlich untersagen|(to) enjoin so. from doing sth.}} war. Dieser {{C|Regelung|die Regelung|rule}} {{C|widersprach|widersprechen|(to) contradict}} aber im Juli 2006 das Stuttgarter {{C|Verwaltungsgericht|das Verwaltungsgericht|administrative court}} {{C|mit der Begründung, dass|on the grounds that}} der Gleichbehandlungsgrundsatz verletzt werde, da die Ordenstracht für Nonnen weiterhin erlaubt sei. Eine Stuttgarter {{C|Grund-|die Grundschule|elementary school, preparatory school}} und {{C|Hauptschul|die Hauptschule|secondary school}}lehrerin darf nun {{C|weiterhin|etw. weiterhin tun|(to) continue doing sth.}} im Unterricht ihr Kopftuch tragen. Als {{C|bisher|hitherto}} letztes Bundesland verabschiedete Nordrhein-Westfalen ein Kopftuchverbot. Berlin erließ das strikteste Gesetz, dort sind auch christliche und jüdische religiöse Symbole verboten.
{{Freistil/Footer|Kopftuchverbot in Bayern ist nicht verfassungswidrig|Adapted from:|Wikinews: ''[http://de.wikinews.org/wiki/Kopftuchverbot_in_Bayern_ist_nicht_verfassungswidrig Kopftuchverbot in Bayern ist nicht verfassungswidrig.]'' 15 Jan. 2007|License: [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ CC-BY-2.5]}}

{{Freistil/Detail
|title=Symbolism in German schools
|content=In German schools, influencing children in a political or religious way is strictly forbidden. That does not only refer to actively spreading propaganda material but also to passively displaying meaningful symbols. In this case, many complex questions have to be dealt with. What is a Muslim headscarf: a religious symbol or only a piece of clothing? What is more severe: a possible subtle influence on school children or the infringement of the teacher's religious freedom? The ''Kopftuchstreit'' forms part of a whole bunch of problems in connection to Islamism in Germany.}}

== New pages ==

Hi - could you look at the naming of your new pages such as [[Example project plan]] and [[Peer assessment]] for example.  You need to name these in accordance with Wikibooks naming policy ([[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]]) with a Booktitle/Chapter format.  Please correct the ones you have created - you can use the &quot;move&quot; button to move them to the correct name.

== Hi ==

I observe that you created the following pages in Wikibooks. I would like to know if these pages form parts of a book.

‎‎* {{bad link|II. Working with your team}} - this is a guideline for the students
* {{bad link|III. Peer assessment}} - this is a guideline for the students
* {{bad link|GROUP 2: Decision rules}}- this is a chapter
‎‎* {{bad link|GROUP 3: Dissatisfaction and post-purchase word-of-mouth}}this is a chapter
‎* {{bad link|GROUP 4: Travel motivation}}this is a chapter
* {{bad link|GROUP 5: Destination images}}this is a chapter

Hello.  Am I right in thinking that you are the instructor for this class based project?  I've just made a few changes to the structure of your book so that it fits in with our naming policy.  I'm an administrator here so if you need any more help with anything just leave me a message on my talk page or e-mail me. Regards --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:52, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

Yes, this is a class writing project, and students are compiling the chapters. I will be in touch as we may need more help in formating etc.

It is a class project, each section written by students.

}}
The name '''cactus''', plural '''cacti''' or '''cactuses''', has been traditionally given to any member of the [[flowering plant]] family Cactaceae. They are often used as [[ornamental plant]]s, but some are also [[Crop (agriculture)|crop]] plants. 

Cacti are distinctive and unusual plants which have adapted to extremely [[arid]] and hot [[Natural environment|environment]]s, showing a wide range of [[Anatomy|anatomical]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] features which conserve water. Their stems have expanded into green [[succulent]] structures containing the [[chlorophyll]] necessary for life and growth, while the leaves have become the spines for which cacti are so well known. 

Cacti come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. The tallest is ''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]'', with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m,&lt;ref&gt;Salak, M. (2000). In search of the tallest cactus. ''Cactus and Succulent Journal'' 72 (3).&lt;/ref&gt; and the smallest is ''[[Blossfeldia liliputiana]]'', only about 1 cm diameter at maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mauseth/ResearchOnCacti/large%20photo%20Blossfeld%20liliput%20plants.htm Mauseth Cactus research: ''Blossfeldia liliputiana'']&lt;/ref&gt; Cactus [[flower]]s are large, and like the spines and branches arise from [[areole]]s. Many cactus species are night-blooming, as they are [[pollination|pollinated]] by [[nocturnal]] [[insect]]s or small animals, principally [[moth]]s and [[bat]]s. Cacti's sizes range from small and round to pole-like and tall.

== Distribution and evolution == 
[[Image:Lightmatter cactusflower.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''[[Echinopsis spachiana]]'' in flower]]
Cacti are almost exclusively [[New World]] plants. This means that they are native only in [[North America]], [[South America]], and the [[West Indies]]. There is however one exception, ''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]''; this species has a [[pantropical]] distribution, occurring in the [[Old World]] in tropical [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sri Lanka]] as well as in tropical America. This plant is thought to be a relatively recent colonist in the [[Old World]] (within the last few thousand years), probably carried as [[seed]]s in the [[digestive tract]]s of [[Bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s. Many other cacti have become naturalized to similar environments in other parts of the world after being introduced by people.

Cacti are believed to have [[Evolution|evolved]] in the last 30 to 40 million years.  Long ago, the [[Pangaea|Americas were joined to the other continents]], but separated due to [[continental drift]]. Unique species in the New World must have developed after the continents had moved apart. Significant distance between the continents was only achieved in around the last 50 million years. This may explain why cacti are so rare in Africa; the continents had already separated when cacti evolved. Many [[succulent plant]]s in both the Old and New World bear a striking resemblance to cacti, and are often called &quot;cactus&quot; in common usage. This is, however, due to [[parallel evolution]]; none of these are closely related to the Cactaceae.

[[Prickly pear]]s (genus ''[[Opuntia]]'') were imported into [[Australia]] in the [[19th century]] for use as a natural agricultural fence and to establish a [[Cochineal|cochineal dye]] industry, but quickly became a widespread [[weed]]. This [[invasive species]] is inedible for local [[herbivore]]s and has rendered 40,000 km² of farming land unproductive.

== Adaptations to dry environment ==
[[Image:Cactus1web.jpg|thumb|left|Many species of cactus have long, sharp [[spine (botany)|spines]].]]
Like other [[succulents]], cacti are well-adapted to life with little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] have evolved into [[spine (biology)|spines]], which in addition to allowing less water to evaporate through [[transpiration]] than regular leaves, defend the cactus against water-seeking animals. The spines grow from specialized structures called [[areole]]s. Very few members of the family have leaves, and when present these are usually rudimentary and soon fall off; they are typically awl-shaped and only 1-3 mm long. Two genera, ''[[Pereskia]]'' and ''[[Pereskiopsis]]'', do however retain large, non-succulent leaves 5-25 cm long, and also non-succulent stems. ''Pereskia'' has now been determined to be the ancestral genus from which all other cacti evolved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/uocp-hdc051206.php&lt;/ref&gt; 

Enlarged [[Plant stem|stems]] carry out [[photosynthesis]] and store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of a true cactus where this takes place.  Much like many other plants that have [[wax]]y coatings on their leaves, Cacti often have a waxy coating on their stems to prevent water loss. This works by preventing water from spreading on the surface and allowing water to trickle down the stem to be absorbed by the roots and used for photosynthesis. 

Most cacti have very shallow roots that can spread out widely close to the surface of the ground to collect water, an adaptation to infrequent rains; in one examination, a young [[Saguaro]] only 12 cm tall had a root system covering an area 2 meters in diameter, but with no roots more than 10 cm deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalhousie&quot;&gt;[http://cactus.biology.dal.ca/biology.html Dalhousie University: Biology of Cacti]&lt;/ref&gt; The larger columnar cacti also develop a [[taproot]], primarily for anchoring but also to reach deeper water supplies and mineral nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalhousie&quot;/&gt;

Cacti have evolved to survive in dry environments in other ways as well, such as use of the [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalhousie&quot;/&gt;

== Uses ==
[[Image:Echinocactus grusonii kew.jpg|240px|thumb|left|''[[Echinocactus grusonii]]'' is a popular species in cultivation]]
Cacti, cultivated by people worldwide, are a familiar sight as potted plants, [[houseplant]]s or in ornamental gardens in warmer climates. They often form part of [[xeriscaping|xerophilic (dry) gardens]] in arid regions, or raised rockeries. Some countries, such as Australia, have water restrictions in many cities, so drought-resistant plants are increasing in popularity. Numerous species have entered widespread cultivation, including members of ''[[Echinopsis]]'', ''[[Mammillaria]]'' and ''[[Cereus]]'' among others. Some, such as the Golden Barrel Cactus, ''[[Echinocactus grusonii]]'', are prominent in garden design. Cacti are commonly used for fencing material where there is a lack of either natural resources or financial means to construct a permanent fence. This is often seen in arid and warm climates, such as the [[Masai Mara]] in Kenya. This is known as a [[cactus fence]].

As well as garden plants, many cacti have important commercial uses; some cacti bear edible [[fruit]], such as the [[opuntia|prickly pear]] and ''[[Hylocereus]]'', which produces Dragon fruit or [[Pitaya]]. ''[[Opuntia]]'' are also used as host plants for cochineal bugs in the [[cochineal]] dye industry in [[Central America]].

The [[Peyote]], ''Lophophora williamsii'', is a well-known psychoactive agent used by native Americans in the Southwest of the [[United States of America]]. Some species of ''[[Echinopsis]]'' (previously ''[[Trichocereus]]'') also have psychoactive properties.

==Etymology==
The word ''cactus'' is ultimately derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Κακτος ''kaktos'', used in classical Greek for a species of spiny [[thistle]], possibly the [[cardoon]], and used as a generic name, ''Cactus'', by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1753 (now rejected in favor of ''[[Mammillaria]]''). There is some dispute as to the proper plural form of the word; as a Greek loan into English, the correct plural in English would be &quot;cactuses&quot;. However, as a word in [[Botanical Latin]] (as distinct from [[Classical Latin]]), &quot;cactus&quot; would follow standard Latin rules for pluralization and become &quot;cacti&quot;, which has become the prevalent usage in English.

&lt;big&gt;'''Spleen'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Hematopoietic organ
*Several functions
**Lymphoid: cellular and humoral immunity
**Filtration: irreversible trapping of particulate matter (e.g. bacteria)
**Surveillance: Removal of damaged/senescent RBCs
**Platelet sequestration 
***Typically 1/3 of platelet number but can be significantly more in splenomegaly
***Appears to be a passive process, whereby platelets are trapped by adhesion to reticular meshwork of the splenic cords
***Can be released with epinephrine, so if normal platerel production is normal, no bleeding
**Extramedullary hematopoiesis
***Initially during embryonic development
***Resumption of function possible with severe anemia or myelofibrosis
*Normal spleen in adults measures 8-13 cm and is typically not palpable. Weight 150-250 g
*Splenomegaly 
**Multiple causes: inflammation/infection (increase in white pulp), congestive expansion (increase in red pulp), increased blood pool, increased macrophage activity, proliferative cellular infiltration, extramedullary hematopoiesis, storage diseases, cysts, solid tumors (primary rare, solitary met from colorectal, ovarian)
**Etiology varies: West - leukemia, lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders, hemolytic anemia and portal hypertension. Tropics - infectious diseases

==RT Indications==
[[Image:Tumor_Myelodysplastic_Spleen.JPG|thumb]]
*Symptomatic LUQ pain, mechanical discomfort related to large spleen, early satiety due to stomach compression
*RT used in patients with indications for splenectomy, who are high risk surgical candidates or who decline surgery
*Mechanism of splenomegaly important for RT
**Proliferative cell infiltration: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SLVL)
**Bone marrow myelofibrosis resulting in extramedullary hematopoiesis: primary myeloid metaplasia; or secondary to CML, polycythemia vera, or essential thrombocythemia
**Immune thrombocytopnia (ITP)
**Hypersplenism: typically seen as cytopenia caused by splenomegaly (e.g. portal hypertension)
*Disease-associated side effects (wt. loss, night sweats, low grade fever) often improve, but generally not primary indications
*Not likely to be effective in improving disease-related cytopenias (may in fact exacerbate them)

==RT Effects==
*Direct effect on radiosensitive extramedullary hematopoietic tissue or infiltrating lymphocytes
*Destruction of hematopoietic precursors residing or traversing the spleen
*Early and marked reduction in colony-forming granulocyte marcophages, persisting &gt;1 month
*A systemic effect and sometimes peripheral blood and bone marrow complete remissions (CRs) observed in several clinical situations 
**Mechanism is not clear, but could involve direct RT-induced killing of splenic neoplastic clls, immune modulation via proportional changes in lymphocytes subsets and increased anti-tumor activity, RT-induced release of cytokines (e.g. TNFalpha, IL-2), and bystander/abscopal effect
*Also, compared to splenectomy, a marked and persistent cytopenias (which may lead to significant complications)

==RT Overview==
[[Image:Tumor_Myelodysplastic_Spleen_RT.JPG|thumb]]
*No prospective or randomized trials
*No firm RT schedules, but low dose (&lt;=1Gy) intermittent (2-3 fx/week), to total &lt;=10 Gy recommended. One report suggests conventional 2 Gy/fx may be equally well tolerated. Consider dosing as follows (PMID 11230883 below):
**Lymphoproliferative: 4-10 Gy total in 1 Gy/fx 
**Myelofibrosis: 1-9 Gy total, with 0.25-0.5 Gy/fx
**Hypersplenism: RT typically not useful, but for example see PMID 18301984
*Patients should be continuously monitored, and fields adjusted with shrinking spleen
*RT should be stopped when therapeutic goal is achieved, rather than when prescription is reached
*Complications are primarily myelosuppression, and need to be monitored daily (CBC, exam)
**Toxicity tolerable in lymphoid disorders, higher in myeloproliferative disorders
**Decline in hemoglobin - can lead to MI
**Thrombocytopenia - can result in significant bleeding
**Retreatment as necessary, with consideration of renal dose

**Retrospective. 22 courses for 19 patients. Total dose 1.5 - 8.0 Gy (median 4.5 Gy), fractional dose 0.25 - 0.1 Gy delivered weekly or twice weekly. AP/PA. Median field reduction 25%
**Outcome: 85% successful in symptom palliation, but only 25% produced hematologic response
**Conclusion: splenic irradiation effective and well-tolerated palliative treatment option

**Retrospective. 49 patients (CLL 6, CML 14, NHL 6, MPD 16, OMF 6, AML 1) treated with 85 courses with A) low dose &lt;1 Gy/fx prolonged vs. B) conventional 2Gy/fx. Spleen pretreatment doses 3-70 Gy (mean 21 Gy)
**Outcomes: spleen reduction 55/85 patients (Group A 47/72, Group B 8/13), clinical improvement 62/85 (Group A 57/72, Group B 5/13). Rapid response in 23 patients, with field reduction during treatment
**Conclusion: Conventional short treatment showed rapid response, no difference in toxicity

**Retrospective. 17 patients (5 CML, 4 CLL, 4 Myelofibrosis, 2 PCV, 1 ITP, 1 AML). Symptomatic splenomegaly
**RT schedule: Week 1 - 0.5 Gy x2 fx, Week 2 - 0.75 Gy x2 fx, Week 3 - 1 Gy x2 fx
**Outcome: 22/25 treatments resulted in decreased pain and symptoms. 5 patients retreated, 1 patient 5 treatments
**Conclusion: Effective palliation. Retreatment possible. Less effective for ITP or leukocytosis

**Retrospective. 23 patients with MMM treated with 50 courses of SI. RT: Median total dose 2.8 Gy, given in median 7.5 fractions.
**Outcomes: 94% reduction in spleen size. 8/23 received multiple courses, 9/23 underwent splenectomy
**Toxicity: 43% significant cytopenia, 26% life-threatening cytopenia after a single course, 13% fatal sepsis or hemorrhage
**Conclusion: Good symptomatic relief, but high risk. Should not be offered to good surgical candidates for splenectomy

[[Image:Stop_hand.svg|left|30px]]
This is your '''last warning'''.  The next time you deliberately introduce incorrect information into a page you ''will'' be blocked from editing Wikibooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About A R King ==

My name is Alan R. King. I am a linguist, language teacher and translator. At present I work as a freelance translator. I studied linguistics formally in the United States and England.

Most of my linguistic work focuses in a variety of ways on languages and particularly on the study, development and support of minority or endangered languages in many parts of the world.

I am a Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language and a Founding Member of Iniciativa para la Recuperación del Idioma Náhuat - Te Miki Tay Tupal.

I have written several books, articles, etc., principally on the Basque and Nawat (Pipil) languages.

I live in the Basque Country, a stateless nation in Europe. Other countries where I have lived for a year or longer are Catalonia, El Salvador, England (where I was born), the USA and Wales.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Classical conditioning''', a form of associative learning. It requires an unconditioned reflex, where an unconditioned stimulus (US)brings about an automatic, unlearned (unconditioned) response (UR). If a neutral stimulus (NS) tends to precede it, an association is made and the conditioned response (CR) becomes transferred onto the (previously neutral) conditioned strimulus (CS); a conditioned reflex has been learned. For instance, food (US) elicits salivation (UR) in a dog as a natural response. If the sound of a bell (NS) frequently occurs before the food (US) is presented then the mere sound of the bell (CS) will elicit salivation (CR).

D is a language following in the footsteps of the C-language family. It has the same general syntax, so anyone familiar with C, C++, Java or C# should be able to easily pick up the language. You should see the [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/comparison.html language comparison] page for more details.

Since this page is about a short introduction to D, why not start with the all-famous [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world Hello World].

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;
 
void main()
{
  writefln(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
For the experienced C programmer, the import and writefln should look strange. We will discuss them in later chapters.</text>

[http://www.vim.org Vim] and [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Emacs] come bundled with D editing modes, and since D is syntactically very similar to the other C-style languages, any editor which supports those might rudimentally support D.

However, for an exhaustive list of D-supporting IDEs, [http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi?EditorSupport please refer here].</text>

      <comment>Update compiler availability:  gdc, ldc and dmd for OS X.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{A Beginner's Guide to D}}
There are currently three versions of the D compiler available. [http://www.digitalmars.com Digital Mars] provides the DMD compiler, while there is a front end for the [http://gcc.gnu.org GNU Compiler Collection] available called [http://dgcc.sourceforge.net GDC], and a front end for the LLVM compiler called [http://www.dsource.org/projects/ldc ldc].

The DMD compiler supports Windows, Linux x86, and OS X, whereas GDC and LLVM support many more platforms.

At the time of writing, the homepage boasts support for:

*Linux (tested on Fedora Core 5 x86 and PowerPC)
*Mac OS X 10.3.x, 10.4.x, 10.5.x
*FreeBSD 5.2.1
*Cygwin
*MinGW
*AIX (tested on 5.1)

On January 2, 2007, DMD released version 1.0 of their compiler, and GDC released version 0.21, which is based on the specification for DMD 1.0.

On January 9, 2009, the ldc project released a D frontend for the LLVM compiler.  It supports OS X, Windows and Linux.

On February 11, 2009, DMD released dmd 1.040 (GM) binaries for OS X 10.5, Windows x86 and Linux x86.

On February 14, 2009, DMD released dmd 2.025 (alpha) binaries for OS X 10.5, Windows x86 and Linux x86.</text>

== About This Book ==

Computers and computer systems are a pervasive part of the modern world. Aside from just the common desktop PC, there are a number of other types of specialized computer systems that pop up in many different places. The central component of these computers and computer systems is the microprocessor, or the CPU. The CPU (short for &quot;Central Processing Unit&quot;) is essentially the brains behind the computer system, it is the component that &quot;computes&quot;. This book is going to discuss what microprocessor units do, how they do it, and how they are designed.

This book is going to discuss the design of microprocessor units, but it will not discuss the design of complete computer systems nor the design of other computer components or peripherals. Some microprocessor designs will be implemented and synthesized in Hardware Description Languages, such as Verilog or VHDL. The book will be organized to discuss simple designs and concepts first, and expand the initial designs to include more complicated concepts as the book progresses. 

This book will attempt to discuss the basic concepts and theory of microprocessor design from an abstract level, and give real-world examples as necessary. This book will not focus on studying any particular processor architecture, although several of the most common architectures will appear frequently in examples and notes.

== How Will This Book Be Organized? ==


The first section of the book will review computer architecture, and will give a brief overview of the components of a computer, the components of a microprocessor, and some of the basic architectures of modern microprocessors.

The second section will discuss in some detail the individual components of a microcontroller, what they do, and how they are designed.

The third section will focus in on the ALU and FPU, and will discuss implementation of particular mathematical operations. 

The fourth section will discuss the various design paradigms, starting with the most simple single cycle machine to more complicated exotic architectures such as vector and VLIW machines.

Additional chapters will serve as extensions and support chapters for concepts discussed in the first four sections.

== Prerequisites ==

This book will rely on some important background information that is currently covered in a number of other local wikibooks. Readers of this book will find the following prerequisites important to understand the material in this book:

*[[Digital Circuits]]
*[[Programmable Logic]]
*[[Embedded Systems]]
*[[Assembly Language]]

All readers '''must be familiar with binary numbers''' and also hexadecimal numbers. These notations will be used throughout the book without any prior explanation. Readers of this book should be familiar with at least one assembly language, and should also be familiar with a hardware description language. This book will use both types of languages in the main narrative of the text without offering explanation beforehand. Appendices might be included that contain primers on this material.

Readers of this book will also find some pieces of software helpful in examples. Specifically, assemblers and assembly language simulators will help with many of the examples. Likewise, HDL compilers and simulators will be useful in the design examples. If free versions of these software programs can be found, links will be added in an appendix.

== Who Is This Book For? ==

This book is designed to accompany an advanced undergraduate or graduate study in the field of microprocessor design. Students in the areas of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Computer Science will likely find this book to be the most useful. The basic subjects in this field will be covered, and more advanced topics will be included depending on the proficiencies of the authors. Many of the topics considered in this book will apply to the design of many different types of digital hardware, including ASICs. However, the main narrative of the book, and the ultimate goals of the book will be focused on microcontrollers and microprocessors, not other ASICs.

== What This Book Will Not Cover ==

This book is about the design of micro-controllers and microprocessors only. This book will not cover the following topics in any detail, although some mention might be made of them as a matter of interest:

* Transistor mechanics, [[Semiconductors|semiconductors]], or integrated circuit fabrication ([[Microtechnology]])
* [[Digital Circuits|Digital Circuit]] Logic, Design or Layout ([[Programmable Logic]])
* Design or interfacing with other computer components or peripherals ([[Embedded Systems]])
* Design or implementation of communication protocols used to communicate between computer components ([[Serial Programming]])
* Design or creation of computer software ([[Subject:Computer programming|Computer Programming]])
* Design of System-on-a-Chip hardware or any device with an integrated micro-controller

== Terminology ==

Throughout the book, the words &quot;Microprocessor&quot;, &quot;Microcontroller&quot;, &quot;Processor&quot;, and &quot;CPU&quot; will all generally be used interchangeably to denote a digital processing element capable of performing arithmetic and quantitative comparisons. We may differentiate between these terms in individual sections, but an explanation of the differences will always be provided.</text>

yes please, i decided the old name was naff [[User:Franko2nd|Franko2nd]] 16:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
:Consider it done.  Check out the Templates available as you would be able to mark it yourself then (in case no one was around).  Equally it is quite possible to &quot;move&quot; pages to a new name - may be useful in the future.  Finally replying is usually an either or thing - each others talk pages or all on one of them - personally it doesn't worry me and I will find an answer most places.  Let me know if I can help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:42, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

cheers, can you forward me the page were these templates are plus how do you move pages to a new name? [[User:Franko2nd|Franko2nd]] 16:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
:&quot;Move&quot; - you are going to kick yourself - look at the top of the page (assuming monobook), tab marked &quot;move&quot; ...  Just rename there (tho don't make a habit of it). [[Wikibooks:Template messages]] is the other.  Hope this helps --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

== Microprocessors ==

Microprocessors are the devices in a computer which make things happen. Microprocessors are capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, moving data from place to place, and making basic decisions based on the quantity of certain values. 

[[Image:Personal computer, exploded 4.svg|thumb|center|600px|The components of a PC computer. Part number 3 is the CPU.]]

=== Types of Processors ===

{{Wikipedia|Microprocessor}}

The vast majority of microprocessors can be found in embedded microcontrollers. The second most common type of processors are common desktop processors, such as Intel's Pentium or AMD's Athlon. Less common are the extremely powerful processors used in high-end servers, such as Sun's SPARC, IBM's Power, or Intel's Itanium.

Historically, microprocessors and microcontrollers have come in &quot;standard sizes&quot; of  8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, and 64 bits. These sizes are common, but that does not mean that other sizes are not available. Some microcontrollers (usually specially designed embedded chips) can come in other &quot;non-standard&quot; sizes such as 4 bits, 12 bits, 18 bits, or 24 bits. The number of bits represent how much physical memory can be directly addressed by the CPU. It also represents the amount of bits that can be read by one read/write operation.  In some circumstances, these are different; for instance, many 8 bit microprocessors have an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus.
* 8 bit processors can read/write 1 byte at a time and can directly address 256 bytes
* 16 bit processors can read/write 2 bytes at a time, and can address 65,536 bytes (64 Kilobytes)
* 32 bit processors can read/write 4 bytes at a time, and can address 4,294,967,295 bytes (4 Gigabytes)
* 64 bit processors can read/write 8 bytes at a time, and can address 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes (16 Exabytes)

=== General Purpose Versus Specific Use ===

Microprocessors that are capable of performing a wide range of tasks are called '''general purpose microprocessors'''. General purpose microprocessors are typically the kind of CPUs found in desktop computer systems. These chips typically are capable of a wide range of tasks (integer and floating point arithmetic, external memory interface, general I/O, etc). We will discuss some of the other types of processor units available:

;General Purpose:A general purpose processing unit, typically referred to as a &quot;microprocessor&quot; is a chip that is designed to be integrated into a larger system with peripherals and external RAM. These chips can typically be used with a very wide array of software.

{{Wikipedia|Digital signal processor}}

;DSP:A Digital Signal Processor, or DSP for short, is a chip that is specifically designed for fast arithmetic operations, especially addition and multiplication. These chips are designed with processing speed in mind, and don't typically have the same flexibility as general purpose microprocessors.  DSPs also have special address generation units that can manage circular buffers, perform bit-reversed addressing, and simultaneously access multiple memory spaces with little to no overhead.  They also support zero-overhead looping, and a single-cycle multiply-accumulate instruction.  They are not typically more powerful than general purpose microprocessors, but can perform signal processing tasks using far less power (as in watts).
;Embedded Controller:Embedded controllers, or &quot;microcontrollers&quot; are microprocessors with additional hardware integrated into a single chip. Many microcontrollers have RAM, ROM, A/D and D/A converters, interrupt controllers, timers, and even oscillators built into the chip itself. These controllers are designed to be used in situations where a whole computer system isn't available, and only a small amount of simple processing needs to be performed.
;Programmable State Machines:The most simplistic of processors, programmable state machines are a minimalist microprocessor that is designed for very small and simple operations. PSMs typically have very small amount of program ROM available, limited scratch-pad RAM, and they are also typically limited in the type and number of instructions that they can perform. PSMs can either be used stand-alone, or (more frequently) they are embedded directly into the design of a larger chip.

{{Wikipedia|Graphics processing unit}}

;Graphics Processing Units:Computer graphics are so complicated that functions to process the visuals of video and game applications have been offloaded to a special type of processor known as a GPU. GPUs typically require specialized hardware to implement matrix multiplications and vector arithmetic. GPUs are typically also highly parallelized, performing shading calculations on multiple pixels and surfaces simultaneously.

=== Types of Use ===

Microcontrollers and Microprocessors are used for a number of different types of applications. People may be the most familiar with the desktop PC, but the fact is that desktop PCs make up only a small fraction of all microprocessors in use today. We will list here some of the basic uses for microprocessors:

;Signal Processing:Signal processing is an area that demands high performance from microcontroller chips to perform complex mathematical tasks. Signal processing systems typically need to have low latency, and are very deadline driven. An example of a signal processing application is the decoding of digital television and radio signals.
;Real Time Applications:Some tasks need to be performed so quickly that even the slightest delay or inefficiency can be detrimental. These applications are known as &quot;real time systems&quot;, and timing is of the upmost importance. An example of a real-time system is the anti-lock braking system (ABS) controller in modern automobiles.
;Throughput and Routing:Throughput and routing is the use of a processor where data is moved from one particular input to an output, without necessarily requiring any processing. An example is an internet router, that reads in data packets and sends them out on a different port.
;Sensor monitoring:Many processors, especially small embedded processors are used to monitor sensors. The microprocessor will either digitize and filter the sensor signals, or it will read the signals and produce status outputs (the sensor is good, the sensor is bad). An example of a sensor monitoring processor is the processor inside an antilock brake system: This processor reads the brake sensor to determine when the brakes have locked up, and then outputs a control signal to activate the rest of the system.
;General Computing:A general purpose processor is like the kind of processor that is typically found inside a desktop PC. Names such as Intel and AMD are typically associated with this type of processor, and this is also the kind of processor that the public is most familiar with.
;Graphics:Processing of digital graphics is an area where specialized processor units are frequently employed. With the advent of digital television, graphics processors are becoming more common. Graphics processors need to be able to perform multiple simultaneous operations. In digital video, for instance, a million pixels or more will need to be processed for every single frame, and a particular signal may have 60 frames per second! To the benefit of graphics processors, the color value of a pixel is typically not dependent on the values of surrounding pixels, and therefore many pixels can typically be computed in parallel.
    \mbox{Clock Time} = \frac{1}{\mbox{Clock Rate}}

== Abstraction Layers ==

Computer systems are developed in layers known as layers of abstraction. Layers of abstraction allow people to develop computer components (hardware and software) without having to worry about the internal design of the other layers in the system. At the highest level are the user-interface programs that people use on their computers. At the lowest level are the transistor layouts of the individual computer components. Some of the layers in a computer system are (listed from highest to lowest):
#Application
#Operating System
#Firmware
#Instruction Set Architecture
#Microprocessor Control Logic
#Physical Circuit Layout

This book will be mostly concerned with the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), and the Microprocessor Control Logic but we will also describe the Operating System (OS) in brief. Topics above these are typically the realm of computer programmers. The bottom layer, the Physical Circuit Layout is the job of hardware and VLSI engineers.

== Operating System ==

Operating System is a program which acts as an interface between the system user and the computer hardware and controls the execution of application programs. It is the program running at all times on the computer, usually called the Kernel.

== ISA ==

The '''Instruction Set Architecture''' is a long name for the assembly language of a particular machine, and the associated machine code for that assembly language. We will discuss this below.

=== Assembly Language ===

An assembly language is a small language that contains a short word or &quot;mnemonic&quot; for each individual command that a microcontroller can follow. Each command gets a single mnemonic, and each mnemonic corresponds to a single machine command. Assembly language gets converted (by a program called an &quot;assembler&quot;) into the binary machine code. The machine code is specific to each different type of machine.

=== Common ISAs ===

{{SideBox|Wikibooks contains books about programming in multiple different types of assembly language. For more information about Assembly language, or for books on a particular ISA, see [[Assembly Language]].}}

Some of the most common ISAs, listed in order of popularity (most popular first) are:

*ARM
*IA-32 (Intel x86)
*MIPS
*Motorola 68K
*PowerPC
*Hitachi SH
*SPARC

== Moore's Law ==

A common law that governs the world of microprocessors is '''Moore's Law'''. Moore's Law, originally by Dr. Carver Mead at Caltech, and summarized famously by Intel Founder Gordon Moore. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a single chip at the same price will double every 18 to 24 months. This law has held without fail since it was originally stated in 1965. Current microprocessor chips contain millions of transistors and the number is growing rapidly. Here is Moore's summarization of the law from Electronics Magazine in 1965:

{{quote|''The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year...Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. That means by 1975, the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum cost will be 65,000. I believe that such a large circuit can be built on a single wafer.''|Gordon Moore}} 

Moore's Law has been used incorrectly to calculate the speed of an integrated circuit, or even to calculate its power consumption, but neither of these interpretations are true. Also, Moore's law is talking about the number of transistors on a chip for a &quot;minimum component cost&quot;, which means that the number of transistors on a chip, for the same price, will double. This goes to show that chips for less price can have fewer transistors, and that chips at a higher price can have more transistors. On an economic note, a consequence of Moore's Law is that companies need to continue to innovate and integrate more transistors onto a single chip, without being able to increase prices. 

Moore's Law does not require that the speed of the chip increase along with the number of transistors on the chip. However, the two measurements are typically related. Some points to keep in mind about transistors and Moore's Law are:
#Smaller Transistors typically switch faster then larger transistors. 
#To get more transistors on a single chip, the chip needs to be made larger, or the transistors need to be made smaller. Typically, the transistors get smaller.
#Transistors tend to leak electrical current as they get smaller. This means that smaller transistors require more power to operate, and they generate more heat.
#Transistors tend to generate heat as a function of frequencies. Higher clock rates tend to generate more heat.

[[Image:Moore Law diagram (2004).png|center|600px]]

Moore's law is occasionally misinterpreted to mean that the speed of processors, in hertz will double every 18 months. This is not strictly true, although the speed of processors does tend to increase as transistors are made smaller and more compact. With the advent of multi-core processors, some people have used Moore's law to mean that processor throughput increases with time, which is not strictly the case either (although it is a likely side effect of Moore's law).

== Clock Rates ==

Microprocessors are typically discussed in terms of their clock speed. The clock speed is measured in '''hertz''' (or megahertz, or gigahertz). A hertz is a &quot;cycle per second&quot;. Each cycle, a microprocessor will perform certain tasks, although the amount of work performed in a single cycle will be different for different types of processors. The amount of work that a processor can complete in a single cycle is measured in &quot;cycles per instruction&quot;. For some systems, such as MIPS, there is 1 cycle per instruction. For other systems, such as modern x86 chips, there are typically very many cycles per instruction. 

The clock rate is equated as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Clock Time} = \frac{1}{\mbox{Clock Rate}}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the amount of time for a cycle is inversely proportional to the clock rate. A computer with a 1MHz clock rate will have a clock time of 1 microsecond. A modern desktop computer with a 3.2 GHz processor will have a clock time of approximately 3&amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, or 300 picoseconds. 300 picoseconds is an incredibly small amount of time, and there is a lot that needs to happen inside the processor in each clock cycle.

== Basic Elements of a Computer ==

There are a few basic elements that are common to all computers. These elements are:

*CPU
*Memory
*Input Devices
*Output Devices

Depending on the particular computer architecture, these elements may be available in various sizes, and they may be accompanied by additional elements.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Von Neumann Architecture ==

Early computer programs were hard wired. To reprogram a computer meant changing the hardware switches manually, that took a long time with potential errors.  Computer memory was only used for storing data.

[[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] suggested that data and programs should be stored together in memory. This is now called [[w:Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann architecture]]. Programs are fetched from memory for execution by a central unit that we call the CPU. Basically programs and data are represented in memory in the same way. The program is just data encoded with special meaning. The main criticism of this approach is, that security problems can arise when instructions can be manipulated as if they were data, and vice-versa.

A Von Neumann microprocessor is a processor that follows this pattern:

;Fetch:An instruction and the necessary data are obtained from memory.
;Decode:The instruction and data are separated, and the components and pathways required to execute the instruction are activated.
;Execute:The instruction is performed, the data is manipulated, and the results are stored.

This pattern is typically implemented by separating the task into two components, the '''control''', and the '''datapath'''.

=== Control ===

The control unit reads the instruction, and activates the appropriate parts of the datapath.

=== Datapath ===

The datapath is the pathway that the data takes through the microprocessor. As the data travels to different parts of the datapath, the command signals from the control unit cause the data to be manipulated in specific ways, according to the instruction.  The datapath consists of the circuitry for transforming data and for storing temporary data.  It contains ALUs capable of transforming data through operations such as addition, subtraction, logical AND, OR, inverting, and shifting.

We discuss the control and datapath in far more detail in a later section,
[[../Control and Datapath/]].

== Harvard Architecture ==

In a '''Harvard Architecture''' machine, the computer system's memory is separated into two discrete parts: data and instructions. In a pure Harvard system, the two different memories occupy separate memory modules, and instructions can only be executed from the instruction memory.

Many DSPs are modified Harvard architectures, designed to simultaneously access three distinct memory areas: the program instructions, the signal data samples, and the filter coefficients (often called the P, X, and Y memories).

In theory, such three-way Harvard architectures can be three times as fast as a Von Neumann architecture that is forced to read the instruction, the data sample, and the filter coefficient, one at a time.

== Modern Computers ==

Modern desktop computers, especially computers based on the Intel x86 ISA are not Harvard computers, although the newer variants have features that are &quot;Harvard-Like&quot;. All information, program instructions, and data are stored in the same RAM areas. However, a modern feature called &quot;paging&quot; allows the physical memory to be segmented into large blocks of memory called &quot;pages&quot;.  Each page of memory can either be instructions or data, but not both. 

Modern embedded computers, however, are typically based on a Harvard architecture. Instructions are stored in a different addressable memory block than the data is, and there is no way for the microprocessor to interchange data and instructions.

== RISC and CISC and DSP ==

Historically, the first type of ISA was the '''complex instruction set computers''' (CISC), and the second type was the '''reduced instruction set computers''' (RISC). It is a common misunderstanding that RISC systems typically have a small [[w:Instruction_set#Categories_of_ISA|ISA]] (fewer instructions) but make up for it with faster hardware. RISC system actually have &quot;reduced instructions&quot;, in the sense that each instruction does so little that it takes very little time to execute it. It is a common misunderstanding that CISC systems have more instructions, but typically pay a steep performance penalty for the added versatility. CISC systems actually have &quot;complex instructions&quot;, in the sense that at least one instruction takes a long time to execute -- for example, the &quot;double indirect&quot; addressing mode inherently requires two memory cycles to execute, and a few CPUs have a &quot;string copy&quot; instruction that may require hundreds of memory cycles to execute. MIPS and SPARC are examples of RISC computers. Intel x86 is an example of a CISC computer.

Some people group stack machines with the RISC machines;
others[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/arch/cisc/] group stack machines with the CISC machines;
some people [http://www.ultratechnology.com/ml0.htm], [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec6_1.html] describe stack machines as neither RISC nor CISC.

Other ISA types include DSPs, stack machines, VLIW machines, MISC machines, TTA architectures, massively parallel processor arrays, etc.

We will discuss these terms and concepts in more detail [[Microprocessor Design/Instruction Set Architectures#ISAs | later]].

== Microprocessor Components ==

Some of the common components of a microprocessor are:

*Control Unit
*I/O Units
*Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
*Registers
*Cache

We will give a brief introduction to these components below.

=== Control Unit ===

The control unit, as described above, reads the instructions, and generates the necessary digital signals to operate the other components. An instruction to add two numbers together would cause the Control Unit to activate the addition module, for instance.

=== I/O Units ===

A processor needs to be able to communicate with the rest of the computer system. This communication occurs through the I/O ports. The I/O ports will interface with the system memory (RAM), and also the other peripherals of a computer.

=== Arithmetic Logic Unit ===

The '''Arithmetic Logic Unit''', or ALU is the part of the microprocessor that performs arithmetic operations. ALUs can typically add, subtract, divide, multiply, and perform logical operations of two numbers (and, or, nor, not, etc). 

We discuss the ALU in far more detail in a later chapter, [[../ALU/]].

=== Registers ===
{{wikipedia|processor register}}
{{wikipedia|hardware register}}

In this book, we talk about lots of different kinds of registers.
Hopefully it will be obvious which kind of register we are talking about from the context.

The most general meaning is a &quot;hardware register&quot;: anything that can be used to store bits of information, in a way that all the bits of the register can be written to or read out simultaneously.
Since registers outside of a CPU are also outside the scope of the book, this book will only discuss processor registers, which are hardware registers that happen to be inside a CPU.
But usually we will refer to a more specific kind of register.

We discuss registers in far more detail in a later chapter, [[../Register File/]].

==== programmer-visible registers ====

The programmer-visible registers, also called the user-accessible registers, also called the architectural registers, often simply called &quot;the registers&quot;, are the registers that are directly encoded as part of at least one instruction in the instruction set.

The registers are the fastest accessible memory locations, and because they are so fast, there are typically very few of them. In most processors, there are fewer than 32 registers. The size of the registers defines the size of the computer. For instance, a &quot;32 bit computer&quot; has registers that are 32 bits long. The length of a register is known as the '''word length''' of the computer.

There are several factors limiting the number of registers, including:

* It is very convenient for a new CPU to be software-compatible with an old CPU. This requires the new chip to have exactly the same number of programmer-visible registers as the old chip.
* Doubling the number general-purpose registers requires adding another bit to each instruction that selects a particular register. Each 3-operand instruction (that specify 2 source operands and a destination operand) would expand by 3 bits. Modern chip manufacturing processes could put a million registers on a chip; that would make each and every 3-operand instruction require 60 bits just to select the registers, not counting the bits required to specify what to do with those operands.
* Adding more registers adds more wires to the critical path, adding capacitance, which reduces the maximum clock speed of the CPU.
* Historically, CPUs were designed with few registers, because each additional register increased the cost of the CPU significantly. But now that modern chip manufacturing can put tens of millions of bits of storage on a single commodity CPU chip, this is less of an issue.

Microprocessors typically contain a large number of registers, but only a small number of them are accessible by the programmer. The registers that can be used by the programmer to store arbitrary data, as needed, are called '''general purpose registers'''. Registers that cannot be accessed by the programmer directly are known as '''reserved registers'''{{fact}}.


Some computers have highly specialized registers -- memory addresses always came from the program counter or &quot;the&quot; index register or &quot;the&quot; stack pointer; one ALU input was always hooked to data coming from memory, the other ALU input was always hooked to &quot;the&quot; accumulator; etc.

Other computers have more general-purpose registers -- any instruction that access memory can use any address register as a index register or as a stack pointer; any instruction that uses the ALU can use any data register.

Other computers have completely general-purpose registers -- any register can be used as data or an address in any instruction, without restriction.

==== microarchitectural registers ====

Besides the programmer-visible registers, all CPUs have other registers that are not programmer-visible, called &quot;microarchitectural registers&quot; or &quot;physical registers&quot;.

These registers include:
* memory address register
* memory data register
* instruction register
* microinstruction register
* microprogram counter
* pipeline registers
{{wikipedia|register renaming}}
* extra physical registers to support register renaming
{{wikipedia|prefetch input queue}}
* the prefetch input queue
* writable control stores (We will discuss the control store in the [[Microprocessor Design/Control Unit]] and [[Microprocessor Design/Microcode]])
* Some people consider on-chip cache to be part of the microarchitectural registers; others consider it &quot;outside&quot; the CPU.

There are a wide variety of ways to implement any one instruction set.
The vast majority of these microarchitectural registers are technically not &quot;necessary&quot;.
A designer could choose to design a CPU that had almost no physical registers other than the programmer-visible registers.
However, many designers choose to design a CPU with lots of physical registers, using them in ways that make the CPU execute the same given instruction set much faster than a CPU that lacks those registers.


=== Cache ===

Most CPUs manufactured do not have any cache.

Cache is memory that is located on the chip, but that is not considered registers. The cache is used because reading external memory is very slow (compared to the speed of the processor), and reading a local cache is much faster. In modern processors, the cache can take up as much as 50% or more of the total area of the chip. The following table shows the relationship between different types of memory:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| smallest || || largest
|-
| Registers || cache || RAM
|-
| fastest || || slowest
|}

Cache typically comes in 2 or 3 &quot;levels&quot;, depending on the chip. Level 1 (L1) cache is smaller and faster than Level 2 (L2) cache, which is larger and slower. Some chips have Level 3 (L3) cache as well, which is larger still than the L2 cache (although L3 cache is still much faster than external RAM).

We discuss cache in far more detail in a later chapter, [[../Cache/]].

== Endian ==
{{wikipediapar||endianness}}
Different computers order their multi-byte data words (i.e., 16-, 32-, or 64-bit words) in different ways in RAM. Each individual byte in a multi-byte word is still separately addressable.  Some computers order their data with the most significant byte of a word in the lowest address, while others order their data with the most significant byte of a word in the highest address.  There is logic behind both approaches, and this was formerly a topic of heated debate.

This distinction is known as '''endianness'''. Computers that order data with the least significant byte in the lowest address are known as &quot;Little Endian&quot;, and computers that order the data with the most significant byte in the lowest address are known as &quot;Big Endian&quot;.  It is easier for a human (typically a programmer) to view multi-word data dumped to a screen one byte at a time if it is ordered as Big Endian.  However it makes more sense to others to store the LS data at the LS address.

When using a computer this distinction is typically transparent; that is that the user cannot tell the difference between computers that use the different formats. However, difficulty arises when different types of computers attempt to communicate with one another over a network.

With a big-endian 68K sort of machine,
        address increases &gt; ------ &gt;
        data   : 74 65 73 74 00 00 00 05
is the string &quot;test&quot; followed by the 32-bit integer 5.
The little-endian x86 sort of machine would interpret the last part as the integer 0x0500_0000.

When communicating over a network composed of both big-endian and little-endian machines, the network hardware (should) apply the Address Invariance principle, to avoid scrambling text (avoiding the NUXI problem).
High-level software (should) format packets of data to be transmitted over the network in Network Byte Order.
High-level software (should) be written as &quot;endian clean&quot; -- always reading and writing 16 bit integers as whole 16 bit integers, 32 bit integers as whole 32 bit integers, etc. -- so no changes are needed to re-compile it for big-endian or little-endian machines.
Software that is not &quot;endian clean&quot; -- software that writes integers, but then reads them out as 8 bit octets or integers of some other length -- usually fails when re-compiled for another computer.

A few computers -- including nearly all DSPs -- are &quot;neither-endian&quot;.
They always read and write complete aligned words, and don't have any hardware for dealing with individual bytes.
Systems build on top of such computers often *do* have a particular endianness -- but that endianness is written into the software, and can be switched by re-compiling for the opposite endianness.

== Stack ==

A stack is a block of memory that is used as a scratchpad area. The stack is a sequential set of memory locations that is set to act like a LIFO (last in, first out) buffer. Data is added to the top of the stack in a &quot;push&quot; operation, and the top data item is removed from the stack during a &quot;pop&quot; operation. Most computer architectures include at least a register that is usually reserved for the stack pointer.

Some microprocessors include a small hardware stack built into the CPU, independent from the rest of the RAM.

Some people claim that a processor must have a hardware stack in order to run C programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;banks&quot; &gt;

2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most computer architectures have hardware support for a recursive &quot;call&quot; instruction in their [[../Assembly Language/]].
Some architectures (such as the ARM, the Freescale RS08, etc.) implement &quot;call&quot; like this:
* the &quot;call&quot; instruction pushes a return address into a link register and jumps to the subroutine. A separate instruction near the beginning of the subroutine pushes the contents of the link register to a stack in main memory, to free up the link register so that subroutine can then recursively call other subroutines.
Some architectures (such as the 6502, the x86, etc.) implement &quot;call&quot; like this:
* the &quot;call&quot; instruction pushes a return address onto the stack in main memory and jumps to the subroutine.
A few architectures (such as the PIC16, the RISC I processor, the Novix NC4016, many LISP machines, etc.) implement &quot;call&quot; like this:
* The &quot;call&quot; instruction pushes a return address into a dedicated return stack, separate from main memory, and jumps to the subroutine.

I find it pretty strange that most of the examples on this page involve if statements and loops, even though you don't learn them until after this page. Should this book be restructured a little? [[User:Alexforcefive|Alexforcefive]] ([[User talk:Alexforcefive|talk]]) 03:09, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

In the table for the NOT operator the operator (not) is missing in the left column, i.e. the expression to be evaluated: e.g. it should say&quot;not True -&gt; False&quot;, &quot;not False -&gt; True&quot;.

I believe the &quot;jack and jill&quot; example is very confusingly coded:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses key-word (list) and built-in name (copy) for variables.
&lt;li&gt;Deletes 1st item but none others
&lt;li&gt;Uses &quot;count&quot; where &quot;index&quot; is intended
&lt;li&gt;Uses different pattern before and during the loop
&lt;/ul&gt;
I'm an experienced programmer who came here to learn Python, but i couldn't tell what the code was trying to do, until I re-wrote it!
I propose something like this (comments omited for brevity):
&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
L = [&quot;Life&quot;,&quot;The Universe&quot;,&quot;Everything&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;,&quot;Life&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;]
C = L[:]
C.sort()
n = len(C)
i = 0
prev = C[i]
i = i + 1
while i &lt; n and C[i] != prev:
    prev = C[i]
    i = i + 1
if i &lt; n:
    print(&quot;First Match:&quot;,prev)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then again, Alexforcefive, was correct. Why have examples that detract from the simple concept of &quot;decision&quot;?

I agree with Alex. I can understand using advanced examples sometimes to get the point across that an eloquent answer exists. But until then could we have a baby version too? What I mean is could we have a solution that involves only the material covered up to this point? Or an explanation of the new material used. My biggest problem, like he said, is that the 'while' keyword isn't covered until the 'loops' section yet it is used in both presented solutions to the exercise.

== Clock Cycles ==

The clock signal is a 1-bit signal that oscillates between a &quot;1&quot; and a &quot;0&quot; with a certain frequency. When the clock transitions from a &quot;0&quot; to a &quot;1&quot; it is called the '''positive edge''', and when the clock transitions from a &quot;1&quot; to a &quot;0&quot; it is called the '''negative edge'''.

The time it takes to go from one positive edge to the next positive edge is known as the '''clock period''', and represents one '''clock cycle'''.

The number of clock cycles that can fit in 1 second is called the '''clock frequency'''. To get the clock frequency, we can use the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Clock Frequency} = \frac{1}{\mbox{Clock Period}}&lt;/math&gt;

Clock frequency is measured in units of ''cycles per second''.

== Cycles per Instruction ==

In many microprocessor designs, it is common for multiple clock cycles to transpire while performing a single instruction. For this reason, it is frequently useful to keep a count of how many cycles are required to perform a single instruction. This number is known as the '''cycles per instruction''', or CPI of the processor.

Because all processors may operate using a different CPI, it is not possible to accurately compare multiple processors simply by comparing the clock frequencies. It is more useful to compare the number of '''instructions per second''', which can be calculated as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Instructions per Second} = \frac{\mbox{Clock Frequency}}{CPI}&lt;/math&gt;

One of the most common units of measure in modern processors is the &quot;MIPS&quot;, which stands for ''millions of instructions per second''. A processor with 5 MIPS can perform 5 million instructions every second. Another common metric is &quot;FLOPS&quot;, which stands for ''floating point operations per second''. MFLOPS is a million FLOPS, GFLOPS is a billion FLOPS, and TFLOPS is a trillion FLOPS.

== Instruction count ==

The &quot;instruction count&quot; in microprocessor performance measurement is the number of instructions executed during the run of a program.
Typical benchmark programs have instruction counts in the millions or billions -- even though the program itself may be very short, those benchmarks have inner loops that are repeated millions of times.

Some microprocessor designers have the freedom to add instructions to or remove instructions from the instruction set.
Typically the only way to reduce the instruction count is to add instructions such that those inner loops can be re-written in a way that does the necessary work using fewer instructions -- those instructions do &quot;more work&quot; per instruction.

Sometimes, counter-intuitively, we can improve overall CPU performance (i.e., reduce CPU time) in a way that increases the instruction count, by using instructions in that inner loop that may do &quot;less work&quot; per instruction, but those instructions finish in less time.

== CPU Time ==

'''CPU Time''' is the amount of time it takes the CPU to complete a particular program. CPU time is a function of the amount of time it takes to complete instructions, and the number of instructions in the program:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{CPU time} = \mbox{Instruction Count} \times CPI \times \mbox{Clock Cycle Time}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes we can improve one of the 3 components alone, reducing CPU time.
But quite often we find a tradeoff -- say, a technique that increases instruction count, but reduces the clock cycle time -- and we have to measure the total CPU time to see if that technique makes the overall performance better or worse.

== Performance ==

== Amdahls Law ==

{{Wikipedia|Amdahl's Law}}

'''Amdahl's Law''' is a law concerned with computer performance and optimization. Amdahl's law states that an improvement in the speed of a single processor component will have a comparatively small effect on the performance of the overall processor unit.

In the most general sense, Amdahl's Law can be stated mathematically as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\big(\frac{P_k}{S_k}\big)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &amp;Delta; is the factor by which the program is sped up or slowed down,
* ''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a percentage of the instructions that can be improved (or slowed),
* ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the speed-up multiplier (where 1 is no speed-up and no slowing),
* ''k'' represents a label for each different percentage and speed-up, and
* ''n'' is the number of different speed-up/slow-downs resulting from the system change.

For instance, if we make a speed improvement in the memory module, only the instructions that deal directly with the memory module will experience a speedup. In this case, the percentage of load and store instructions in our program will be ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the factor by which those instructions are sped up will be ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. All other instructions, which are not affected by the memory unit will be ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the speed up will be ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' Where:

:&lt;math&gt;P_1 = 1 - P_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

We set ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to 1 because those instructions are not sped up or slowed down by the change to the memory unit.

== ISAs ==
The '''instruction set''' or the '''instruction set architecture''' ('''ISA''') is the set of basic instructions that a processor understands.
The instruction set is a portion of what makes up an architecture.

Historically, the first two philosophies to instruction sets were: reduced (RISC) and complex (CISC).
The merits and argued performance gains by each philosophy are and have been thoroughly debated.

=== CISC ===
'''Complex Instruction Set Computer''' ('''CISC''') is rooted in the history of computing.
Originally there were no compilers and programs had to be coded by hand one instruction at a time.
To ease programming more and more instructions were added. Many of these instructions are complicated combination instructions such as loops. In general, more complicated or specialized instructions are inefficient in hardware, and in a typically CISC architecture the best performance can be obtained by using only the most simple instructions from the ISA.

The most well known/commoditized CISC ISAs are the Motorola 68k and Intel x86 architectures.

=== RISC ===
'''Reduced Instruction Set Computer''' ('''RISC''') was realized in the late 1970s by IBM.  Researchers discovered that most programs did not take advantage of all the various address modes that could be used with the instructions.
By reducing the number of address modes and breaking down multi-cycle instructions into multiple single-cycle instructions several advantages were realized:
* compilers were easier to write (easier to optimize)
* performance is increased for programs that did simple operations
* the clock rate can be increased since the minimum cycle time was determined by the longest running instruction

The most well known/commoditized RISC ISAs are the PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and SPARC architectures.

=== VLIW ===

We will discuss [[Microprocessor Design/VLIW Processors|VLIW Processors]] in a later section.

=== Vector processors ===

We will discuss [[Microprocessor Design/Vector Processors|Vector Processors]] in a later section.

=== Computational RAM ===

== Memory Arrangement ==
Instructions are typically arranged sequentially in memory. Each instruction occupies 1 or more computer words. The '''Program Counter''' (PC) is a register inside the microprocessor that contains the address of the current instruction.&lt;ref&gt;
Practically all modern CPUs maintain the illusion of a program counter sequentially walking through code one instruction at a time.
However, a few complex modern CPUs internally execute several instructions simultaneously (superscalar), or execute instructions out-of-order, or even speculatively pre-execute instructions down the &quot;wrong&quot; path, then back up and take the right path.
When designing and testing such internal structures, the concept of &quot;the&quot; PC is a bit fuzzy.

Some processor architectures, for instance the CDP1802, do not have a single Program Counter; instead, one of the general purpose registers is used as a program counter, and which register that is can be changed under program control.
&lt;/ref&gt;
During the fetch cycle, the instruction from the address indicated by the program counter is read from memory into the instruction register (IR), and the program counter is incremented by ''n'', where ''n'' is the word length of the machine (in bytes).

In addition to fetches of the executable instructions, many (but not all) instructions also fetch data values from memory (&quot;load&quot;) into a data register, or write data values from a data register to memory (&quot;store&quot;). The address of the particular memory word accessed in such a load or store instruction is called the &quot;effective address&quot;. In the simplest instruction sets, the effective address always contained in some address register. Other instruction sets have more complex &quot;effective address&quot; calculations &amp;mdash; we will discuss such &quot;addressing modes&quot; later.

== Common Instructions ==

=== Move, Load, Store ===

Move instructions cause data from one register to be moved or copied to another register. Load instructions put data from an external source, such as memory, into a register. Store instructions move data from a register to an external destination.

Instructions that move (or copy) data from one place to another are the #1 most-frequently-used instructions in most programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;kankowski&quot;&gt;
Peter Kankowski.
[http://www.strchr.com/x86_machine_code_statistics &quot;x86 Machine Code Statistics&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branch and Jump ===

Branching and Jumping is the ability to load the PC register with a new address that is not the next sequential address. In general, a &quot;jump&quot; or &quot;call&quot; occurs unconditionally, and a &quot;branch&quot; occurs on a given condition. In this book we will generally refer to both as being branches, with a &quot;jump&quot; being an unconditional branch.

A &quot;call&quot; instruction is a branch instruction with the additional effect of storing the current address in a specific location, e.g. pushing it on the stack, to allow for easy return to continue execution. A &quot;call&quot; instruction is generally matches with a &quot;return&quot; instruction which retrieves the stored address and resumes execution where it left off.

An &quot;interrupt&quot; instruction is a call to a preset location, generally one encoded somehow in the instruction itself. This is often used to reach commonly-used resources such as the operating system. Generally, a routine entered via an interrupt instruction is left via an interrupt return instruction, which, similarly to the return instruction, retrieves the stored address and resumes execution.

In many programs, &quot;call&quot; is the second-most-frequently used instruction (after &quot;move&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;kankowski&quot;/&gt;

=== Arithmetic Instructions ===

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is used to perform arithmetic and logical instructions. The capability of the ALU typically is greater with more advanced central processors, but RISC machines' ALUs are deliberately kept simple and so have only some of these functions. An ALU will, at minimum, perform addition, subtraction, NOT, AND, OR, and XOR, and usually also single-bit rotates and shifts. Many CISC machine ALUs can also perform multi-bit rotates and shifts (with a barrel shifter) and integer multiplication and division. While many modern CPUs can also do floating point mathematical operations, these are usually handled by the FPU, a different part of the machine.
We describe the ALU in more detail in the [[Microprocessor_Design#ALU_Design|ALU design chapter]].

=== Input / Output ===

Input instructions fetch data from a specified input port, while output instructions send data to a specified output port. There is very little distinction between input/output space and memory space, the microprocessor presents an address and then either accepts data from, or sends data to, the data bus, but the sort of operations available in the input/output space are typically more limited than those available in memory space.

=== NOP ===

'''NOP''', short for &quot;no operation&quot; is an instruction that produces no result and causes no side effects. NOPs are useful for timing and preventing '''hazards'''.

== Instruction Length ==

There are several different ways people balance the various advantages and disadvantages of various instruction lengths.

[[File:Mips32 addi.svg|thumb|right|A MIPS &quot;add immediate&quot; instruction includes the opcode (logical operation), the destination register specifier, the source register specifier, and a constant value, all in the same 32 bits that are used for every MIPS instruction.]]

Fixed-length instructions are less complicated for a CPU to handle than variable-width instructions for several reasons, and are therefore somewhat easier to optimize for speed.
Such reasons include: CPUs with variable-length instructions have to check whether each instruction straddles a cache line or virtual memory page boundary; CPUs with fixed-length instructions can skip all that.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocke&quot; &gt;
[http://domino.watson.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/0/22d06c5aa961e78085256bfa0067fa93?OpenDocument The evolution of RISC technology at IBM by John Cocke] &amp;ndash; IBM Journal of R&amp;D, Volume 44, Numbers 1/2, p.48 (2000)
&lt;/ref&gt; 


There simply are not enough bits in a 16 bit instruction to accommodate 32 general-purpose registers, and also do &quot;Ra = Rb (op) Rc&quot; -- i.e., independently select 2 source and 1 destination register out of a general purpose register bank of 32 registers, and also independently select one of several ALU operations.

And so people who design instruction sets must make one or more of the following compromises:
* sacrifice [[../Code Density | code density]] and use longer fixed-width instructions, typically 32 bit, such as the MIPS and DLX and ARM.
* sacrifice fixed-width instructions, requiring a more complicated decoder to handle both short 16 bit instructions and longer 3-operand instructions, such as ARM Thumb
* sacrifice 3-operands, using no more than 2 operands in all instructions for everything, such as the Atmel AVR. 3-operand instructions allow better reuse of data&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocke&quot; /&gt;; without 3-operand instructions, programs occasionally require extra copy instructions when both variable input operands to some ALU operation need to be preserved for some later instruction(s).
* sacrifice registers, so only 16 or 8 programmer-visible registers.
* sacrifice the concept of [[Microprocessor Design/Computer Architecture#Registers | general purpose register]] -- perhaps only 16 or 8 &quot;data registers&quot; are visible to 3-operand ALU instructions, as in the 68000, or the destination is restricted to one or two &quot;accumulators&quot;, but other registers (such as &quot;address registers&quot;) are visible to other instructions.

== Assemblers ==
Assemblers take in human-readable assembly code and produce machine code.
[[Image:Assembler.png]]

== Assembly Language Constructs ==

There are a number of different assembly languages in existance, but all of them have a few things in common. They all map directly to the underlying hardware CPU instruction sets.
; CPU instruction set : is a set of binary code/instruction that the CPU understands. Based on the CPU, the instruction can be one byte, two bytes or longer. The instruction code is usually followed by one or two operands.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
| Instruction Code
| operand 1
| operand 2
|}

How many instructions there are depends on the CPU. 

Because binary code is difficult to remember, each instruction has as its name a so-called mnemonic. For example 'MOV' can be used for moving instructions.
 MOV A, 0x0020
The above instruction moves the value of register A to the specified address.

A simple assembler will translate the 'MOV A' to its CPU's instruction code.

Assembly languages cannot be assumed to be directly portable to other CPU's. Each CPU has its own assembly language, though CPU's within the same family may support limited portability

== Load and Store ==

These instructions tell the CPU to move data from memory to a CPU's register, or move data from one of the CPU's register to memory.
; register : is a special memory located inside the CPU, where arithmetic operations can be performed.

== Arithmetic ==

Arithmetic operations can be performed using the CPU's registers:

* Increment the value of one of the CPU's registers
* Decrement the value of one of the CPU's registers
* Add a value to the register
* Subtract value from the register
* Multiply the register value
* Divide the register value
* Shift the register value
* Rotate the register value

== Jumping ==

During a jump instruction, the program counter is loaded with a new address that is not necessarily the address of the next sequential instruction. After a jump, the program execution continues from the new location in memory.

; Relative jump : the instruction's operand tells how many bytes the program counter should be increased or decreased.

; Absolute jump : the instruction's operand is copied to the program counter; the operand is an absolute memory address where the execution should continue.

== Branching ==

During a branch, the program counter is loaded with one of multiple new values, depending on some specified condition. A branch is a series of conditional jumps.

Some CPUs have skipping instructions. If a register is zero, the following instruction is skipped, if not then the following instruction is executed, which can be a jumping instruction. So Branching can be done by using skipping and jumping instructions together.

'''Snacks''' are small tidbits, usually eaten with the fingers, though occasionally with utensils. They may require utensils to prepare. They may even be nutritionally beneficial, but this is not a requirement. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Snacks&amp;oldid=625174]

'''Za'atar''', also '''zaatar''', '''zahatar''', is a mix of herbs and spices popular in the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]]. It was traditionally made from ''Syrian hyssop'' (also ''Syrian oregano'', ''white oregano''), but due to overharvesting, it is usually made from more common ingredients today.

''Green za'atar'' is made from [[Cookbook:Oregano|wild oregano]], [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and may also have [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]], [[Cookbook:Hyssop|hyssop]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] or [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel seed]]. Adding a little [[Cookbook:Sumac|sumac]] makes this ''red za'atar''.

Example mix:

* 3 Tbs roasted sesame seeds, ground in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]]
* 2 Tbs dried oregano
* 1 Tbs dried thyme
* 1 tsp salt
* ½ &amp;ndash; 1 Tbs sumac, for red za'atar

      <text xml:space="preserve">A careful reading of the First Commandment might cause one to wonder, why did the Jews need to be told that &quot;the Lord&quot; was their &quot;God&quot;?  First of all, it must be noted that where many Bible translations use the '''title''' &quot;the Lord&quot;, especially when that title is in all caps (i.e. &quot;the LORD&quot;), it means that the original Hebrew text contained the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton Tetragrammaton], representing the particular name of the Hebrew God, יהוה the exact pronunciation of which no one knows.  So the First Commandment ''really'' says:

I am יהוה your God.

Therefore, the First Commandment signifies יהוה's claiming of the Israelite nation as a people chosen to serve him.  It leaves no doubt as to the name of the God they were to worship (as indeed, there were many other gods in Egypt, the land which they had left, and Canaan, the land to which they were going, each with their own particular names).  It further leaves no doubt as to the identity of the God who brought them out of slavery in Egypt.

'''I am the Lord your God''', or '''I am Yahweh your God''', is the opening phrase of the Ten Commandments,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:1-21, Deuteronomy 5:1-23, ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175&lt;/ref&gt; which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''How Judges Think'', Richard A. Posner, Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 322; ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175; ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Geoffrey W. Bromiley, 1988, p. 117; ''Renewal theology: systematic theology from a charismatic perspective'', J. Rodman Williams, 1996 p.240; ''Making moral decisions: a Christian approach to personal and social ethics'', Paul T. Jersild, 1991, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text of the Ten Commandments according to the Book of Exodus begins:
{{quotation|I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me, and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.|Exodus 20:2-6 (WEB)}}

According to the Hebrew bible, Yahweh is the personal (proper) name of the God of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt; that was revealed to Moses in the account of the bush.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 3&lt;/ref&gt;  
Many English translations render the Hebrew YHWH as “LORD” or “Jehovah” but modern scholarship suggests that “Yahweh” is a more reasonable English rendering.  The introduction to the Ten Commandments establishes the identity of God by both his personal name and his historical act of delivering Israel from Egypt.  The language and pattern reflects that of ancient royal treaties in which a great king identified himself and his previous gracious acts toward a subject king or people.&lt;ref name=&quot;The NIV Study Bible 1995, p. 146&quot;&gt;The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Establishing his identity through the use of the proper name, Yahweh, and his mighty acts in history distinguishes Yahweh from the gods of Egypt which were judged in the killing of Egypt’s firstborn,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 12&lt;/ref&gt; and from the gods of Canaan, the gods of the gentile nations, and the gods that are worshipped as idols, starry hosts, or things found in nature, and the gods known by other proper names.&lt;ref&gt;In Search of God: The Meaning and the Message of the Everlasting Names, TD Mettinger, Fortress Press, 2005, See also: Isaiah 42:8, Deuteronomy 12, Psalms 96:5&lt;/ref&gt;  So distinguished, Yahweh demands exclusive allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;The Anchor Bible, Deuteronomy 1-11, Moshe Weinfeld, commentary on Ch. 5-6, pp. 236-356&lt;/ref&gt;  “I am the LORD your God” occurs a number of other times in the Bible also.
 
==Meaning==

By saying, “I am the LORD (Yahweh) your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery,” God introduces himself by name to establish his authority behind the stipulations that follow.  The implicit imperative is to believe that God exists and that his proper name is “Yahweh.”  This verse also serves as the motive clause for the following imperatives.  Since Yahweh alone freed Israel from Egypt, he is Israel’s King, hence its legislator.  Yahweh alone is also Israel’s God, and the worship of other gods is prohibited as the central doctrine of Biblical religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jewish Study Bible 2004, p. 148&quot;&gt;The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Anchor Bible, Deuteronomy 1-11, Moshe Weinfeld, Doubleday, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text follows an ancient royal treaty pattern where Yahweh is formally acknowledged as Israel’s king.  Israel is the subject people who are expected to render complete submission, allegiance, and obedience to him out of gratitude for his past mercies, respect for his sovereignty, and trust in his ongoing care.&lt;ref name=&quot;The NIV Study Bible 1995, p. 146&quot;/&gt;  The covenant logic establishes an exclusive relationship in which the subject population may have only one sovereign.  Ancient oaths and treaties prohibit subjects and vassals from accepting alternative sovereigns or protectors.  In the ancient near east, a suzerain’s (or sovereign’s) prior benefactions to a vassal (such as deliverance from an enemy) are a primary motive to accept an offer of covenant, thus the deliverance from Egypt motivates Israel’s acceptance of the covenant stipulations described in the following imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional Jewish interpretation===
&quot;I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before Me...&quot;  Maimonides interpreted this as a command requiring belief in God.  Ibn Ezra  interpreted this as a command to believe that Yahweh alone is God.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jewish Study Bible 2004, p. 148&quot;/&gt;  This command prohibits belief in or worship of any additional deities:
{{quotation|Whoever accepts a false god as true, even when he does not actually worship it, disgraces and blasphemes [God's] glorious and awesome name.
| Mishneh Torah, Chapter 2, Halacha 6&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Chapter 2, Halacha 6, translated by Eliyahu Touger http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912360/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|The idolater - it doesn't matter whether one commits idolatrous worship or makes a sacrifice or burns incense or pours a libation or prostrates oneself or accepts it as a god or says &quot;you are my god.&quot; But whoever embraces it or kisses it or honors it or sprinkles on it or washes it or anoints it or dresses it or puts shoes on it, transgresses a negative commandment.  Whoever makes a vow in its name or takes an oath in its name, transgresses a negative commandment. | Mishnah Sanhedrin 7:6&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mishnah/Seder_Nezikin/Tractate_Sanhedrin/Chapter_7/6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&quot;Do not make an image or any likeness of what is in the heavens above...&quot; This prohibits the construction or fashioning of &quot;idols&quot; in the likeness of created things (beasts, fish, birds, people) and worshipping them.

{{quotation|The essence of the commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is not to serve any of the creations, not an angel, a sphere, or a star, none of the four fundamental elements, nor any entity created from them. | Mishneh Torah, Chapter 2, Halacha 1&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Chapter 2, Halacha 1, translated by Eliyahu Touger http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912360/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New Testament view===
Since the New Testament is predominantly of Jewish origin, the traditional Jewish view of the need for the individual to adhere to God alone and avoid idolatry is found throughout the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 5:19-20, 1 John 5:21&lt;/ref&gt;   For example,  
Jesus quotes Deuteronomy when tempted to worship Satan in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Tem Commandments, Article 1, The Ten Commandments http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'&quot;|Matthew 4:10 (NIV)}}
Jesus repeats the Shema as the most important commandment.  
{{quotation|The most important one, answered Jesus, is this: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.  Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.”|Mark 12:29-30 (NIV)}}

Those who eat food sacrificed to idols are rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 2:14, Revelation 2:20&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as in the Old Testament, where sacrificing to other gods is portrayed as sacrificing to demons,&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 32:17, Psalm 106:37&lt;/ref&gt; idolatry is connected with the worship of demons in the New Testament, and God is described as jealous regarding idolatry.  

{{quotation|…the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he?|1 Corinthians 10:18-22 (NIV)}}

The New Testament asserts that God brings consequences to those who worship other gods.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 1:18-32&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that during the Old Testament age, God winked at the idolatry of nations other than Israel, but that in the New Testament age, God commands “all people everywhere to repent.”&lt;ref&gt;Acts 17:29-30 NIV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Study Bible comments on Acts 17 http://www.biblestudytools.com/Commentaries/GenevaStudyBible/gen.cgi?book=ac&amp;chapter=017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Gill’s Exposition of the Bible comments on Acts 17 http://www.biblestudytools.com/Commentaries/GillsExpositionoftheBible/gil.cgi?book=ac&amp;chapter=017&amp;verse=30&lt;/ref&gt;  Idols are described as “worthless things” and people are exhorted to turn away from them to the living God.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 14:15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Study Bible comments on Acts 14 http://www.biblestudytools.com/Commentaries/GenevaStudyBible/gen.cgi?book=ac&amp;chapter=014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wesley’s Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible http://www.biblestudytools.com/Commentaries/WesleysExplanatoryNotes/wes.cgi?book=ac&amp;chapter=014&lt;/ref&gt;  The teaching of Moses and the experience of Israel when they departed from it are used to support the insistence that believers abstain from idolatry and sexual immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15:20-21, 1 Corinthians 10:1-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation in Roman Catholicism===
The Roman Catholic Catechism teaches that “The first commandment summons man to believe in God, to hope in him, and to love him above all else.”&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2134&lt;/ref&gt;  It cites the requirement of the Shema, that “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your strength”&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 6:5, Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2133&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus answer when tempted by Satan. 
{{quotation|&quot;You shall worship the Lord your God&quot; (Matthew 4:10). Adoring God, praying to him, offering him the worship that belongs to him, fulfilling the promises and vows made to him are acts of the virtue of religion which fall under obedience to the first commandment.| Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 4:10, Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2135&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In their explanation of the first commandment, the Roman Catholic Catechism quotes Justin Martyr’s dialogue to support their teaching that Christians and Jews have trusted the same God.
{{quotation|There will be no other God…nor was there from eternity any other existing …but He who made and disposed all this universe. Nor do we think that there is one God for us [Christians], another for you [Jews], but that He alone is God who led your fathers out from Egypt with a strong hand and a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for there is no other), but in Him in whom you also have trusted, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.|Justin Martyr&lt;ref&gt;St. Justin, Dial. cum Tryphone Judaeo 11, 1: PG 6, 497. http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Catholic Catechism describes the phrase “I am the LORD” at the beginning of the Ten Commendments as an expression of God’s existence and his authority.
{{quotation|The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and charity. When we say “God” we confess a constant, unchangeable being, always the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that we must necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in him and acknowledge his authority. He is almighty, merciful, and infinitely beneficent. Who could not place all hope in him? Who could not love him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs in the Scripture at the beginning and end of his commandments: “I am the LORD.”| Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2086&lt;/ref&gt; }}
It goes on to explain how the Christian virtue of faith is central to obedience to the first commandment.
{{quotation|Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love to us. St. Paul speaks of the &quot;obedience of faith&quot; (Romans 1:5, Romans 16:26) as our first obligation. He shows that &quot;ignorance of God&quot; is the principle and explanation of all moral deviations. (Romans 1:18-32) Our duty toward God is to believe in him and to bear witness to him. The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our faith with prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that is opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against faith:   ‘’Voluntary doubt’’ about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true what God has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. ‘’Involuntary doubt’’ refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its obscurity. If deliberately cultivated doubt can lead to spiritual blindness.| Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2087-2088&lt;/ref&gt; }}  
The first commandment is also concerned with despair and presumption as sins against hope.
{{quotation|By ‘’despair,’’ man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to his promises - and to his mercy. There are two kinds of ’’presumption.’’ Either man presumes upon his own capacities, (hoping to be able to save himself without help from on high), or he presumes upon God's almighty power or his mercy (hoping to obtain his forgiveness without conversion and glory without merit). | Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2091-2092&lt;/ref&gt; }}  
Love and charity are viewed as essential elements of obedience to the first commandment.
{{quotation|Faith in God's love encompasses the call and the obligation to respond with sincere love to divine charity. The first commandment enjoins us to love God above everything and all creatures for him and because of him. (Deuteronomy 6:4-5) One can sin against God's love in various ways: - ‘’indifference’’ neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power. – ‘’ingratitude’’ fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to return him love for love. ‘’- lukewarmness’’ is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity. ‘’acedia’’ or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness. ‘’- hatred of God’’ comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who forbids sins and inflicts punishments.| Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2093-2094&lt;/ref&gt; }}  
Prayer, sacrifice, promises, and vows are also seen as essential duties required by observance of the first commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2098-2103&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that individuals maintain a liberty of conscience under the first commandment, not that any kind of worship is morally acceptable, but that each person should follow his convictions with free will without the threat of force from an outside agent.
{{quotation|Nobody may be forced to act against his convictions, nor is anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in association with others, within due limits.  This right is based on the very nature of the human person, whose dignity enables him freely to assent to the divine truth which transcends the temporal order. For this reason it continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation of seeking the truth and adhering to it.| Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2106&lt;/ref&gt; }}  
According to Catholic teaching, the first commandment condemns superstition, idolatry, divination, magic, irreligion, atheism and agnosticism.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2110-2128&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion.   Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is to fall into superstition.(Matthew 23:16-22)  The first commandment condemns polytheism. It requires man neither to believe in, nor to venerate, other divinities than the one true God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of &quot;idols, [of] silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.&quot; These empty idols make their worshippers empty: &quot;Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in them.&quot;(Psalms 115:4-5, Jeremiah 10:1-16) God, however, is the &quot;living God&quot;(Joshua 3:10, Psalms 42:3) who gives life and intervenes in history.  Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus says, &quot;You cannot serve God and mammon.&quot;(Matthew 6:4) | Catechism of the Catholic Church  &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2110-2113&lt;/ref&gt; }}  
Catholic teaching also asserts that divination (seeking guidance regarding the future through horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, etc.) are prohibited by the first commandment, because these forbidden practices contradict the honor we owe to God.  Likewise, magic and sorcery and similar sources of supernatural power over others are prohibited, even if for the sake of restoring health.
{{quotation|God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can constitute a lack of responsibility. All forms of ‘’divination‘’ are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to &quot;unveil&quot; the future.(Deuteronomy 18:10, Jeremiah 29:8) Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone. All practices of ‘’magic’’ or ‘’sorcery,’’ by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. | Catechism of the Catholic Church &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2115-2117&lt;/ref&gt; }}  
Catholic teaching also regards the first commandment as a prohibition of atheism and agnosticism.
{{quotation| Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin against the first commandment. | Catechism of the Catholic Church &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part Three, Section Two, The Ten Commandments 2140&lt;/ref&gt; }}  

===Reformation and Post-Reformation Views===

John Calvin viewed “I am the LORD thy God” as a preface to the Decalogue and “have no other gods” as the first commandment.  However, he also allowed for viewing “I am the LORD they God” as the first commandment, provided one also allows it to serve as a preface to the whole Decalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Second, Chapter 8, John Calvin, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.ix.html&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary on the first commandment, Calvin describes superstition as akin to a wife committing adultery in front of her husband.
{{quotation|…we must beware of superstition, by which our minds are turned aside from the true God, and carried to and fro after a multiplicity of gods. Therefore, if we are contented with one God, let us call to mind what was formerly observed, that all fictitious gods are to be driven far away, and that the worship which he claims for himself is not to be mutilated. Not a particle of his glory is to be withheld: everything belonging to him must be reserved to him entire. The words, “before me,” go to increase the indignity, God being provoked to jealousy whenever we substitute our fictions in his stead; just as an unfaithful wife stings her husband’s heart more deeply when her adultery is committed openly before his eyes.|John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion&lt;ref&gt;Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Second, Chapter 8, John Calvin, p. 329 http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.ix.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Martin Luther describes the first commandment as prohibiting both the literal honoring of other gods as well as trusting in idols of the heart: money, good works, superstition, etc. 
{{quotation| Thus, for example, the heathen who put their trust in power and dominion elevated Jupiter as the supreme god; the others, who were bent upon riches, happiness, or pleasure, and a life of ease, Hercules, Mercury, Venus or others; women with child, Diana or Lucina, and so on; thus every one made that his god to which his heart was inclined, so that even in the mind of the heathen to have a god means to trust and believe. But their error is this that their trust is false and wrong for it is not placed in the only God, besides whom there is truly no God in heaven or upon earth. Therefore the heathen really make their self-invented notions and dreams of God an idol, and put their trust in that which is altogether nothing. Thus it is with all idolatry; for it consists not merely in erecting an image and worshiping it, but rather in the heart, which stands gaping at something else, and seeks help and consolation from creatures, saints, or devils, and neither cares for God, nor looks to Him for so much good as to believe that He is willing to help, neither believes that whatever good it experiences comes from God.| Martin Luther, Large Catechism, The First Commandment&lt;ref&gt;Large Catechism, The First Commandment, Martin Luther  http://www.ccel.org/ccel/luther/largecatechism.i_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like Calvin, Matthew Henry considers “I am the LORD thy God” to be a preface.  Henry explains the preface and the first commandment from a covenant viewpoint: God delivered Israel from Egypt, and they belong to him by mutual agreement, so they are bound to obey his covenant stipulations.  
{{quotation| The preface of the Law-maker: ’’I am the Lord thy God,’’ v. 2. Herein, 1. God asserts his own authority to enact this law in general: &quot;I am the Lord who command thee all that follows.&quot; 2. He proposes himself as the sole object of that religious worship which is enjoined in the first four of the commandments. They are here bound to obedience by a threefold cord, which, one would think, could not easily be broken. (1.) Because God is the Lord—Jehovah, self-existent, independent, eternal, and the fountain of all being and power; therefore he has an incontestable right to command us. He that gives being may give law; and therefore he is able to bear us out in our obedience, to reward it, and to punish our disobedience. (2.) He was their God, a God in covenant with them, their God by their own consent; and, if they would not keep his commandments, who would? He had laid himself under obligations to them by promise, and therefore might justly lay his obligations on them by precept. Though that covenant of peculiarity is now no more, yet there is another, by virtue of which all that are baptized are taken into relation to him as their God, and are therefore unjust, unfaithful, and very ungrateful, if they obey him not. (3.) He had ’’brought them out of the land of Egypt;’’ therefore they were bound in gratitude to obey him, because he had done them so great a kindness, had brought them out of a grievous slavery into a glorious liberty. They themselves had been eye-witnesses of the great things God had done in order to their deliverance, and could not but have observed that every circumstance of it heightened their obligation.| Matthew Henry &lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20, Matthew Henry http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Ex.xxi.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Wesley makes the common observation that Israel is obligated to obey God’s commandments because he delivered them from Egypt, and he adds the observation that Christians are likewise obligated to serve Christ, having been rescued out of bondage to sin.
{{quotation|Herein, God asserts his own authority to enact this law; and proposeth himself as the sole object of that religious worship which is enjoined in the four first commandments. They are here bound to obedience. 
1.	Because God is the Lord, Jehovah, self - existent, independent, eternal, and the fountain of all being and power; therefore he has an incontestable right to command us. 
2.	He was their God; a God in covenant with them; their God by their own consent. 
He had brought them out of the land of Egypt - Therefore they were bound in gratitude to obey him, because he had brought them out of a grievous slavery into a glorious liberty. By redeeming them, he acquired a farther right to rule them; they owed their service to him, to whom they owed their freedom. And thus, Christ, having rescued us out of the bondage of sin, is entitled to the best service we can do him. The four first commandments, concern our duty to God (commonly called the first - table.) It was fit those should be put first, because man had a Maker to love before he had a neighbour to love, and justice and charity are then only acceptable to God when they flow from the principles of piety.| John Wesley&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20, John Wesley http://www.biblestudytools.com/Commentaries/WesleysExplanatoryNotes/wes.cgi?book=ex&amp;chapter=020&lt;/ref&gt;}}
John Wesley uses the first commandment in Deuteronomy 5 as a motivation to pose a list of introspective questions.
{{quotation|I think it needful to add a few questions here, which the reader may answer between God and his own soul. Thou shalt have none other gods before me - Hast thou worshipped God in spirit and in truth? Hast thou proposed to thyself no end besides him? Hath he been the end of all thy actions? Hast thou sought for any other happiness, than the knowledge and love of God? Dost thou experimentally know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent? Dost thou love God? Dost thou love him with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength; so as to love nothing else but in that manner and degree which tends to increase thy love of him? Hast thou found happiness in God? Is he the desire of thine eyes, the joy of thy heart? If not, thou hast other gods before him. | John Wesley&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible, comments on Deuteronomy 5, John Wesley http://www.biblestudytools.com/Commentaries/WesleysExplanatoryNotes/wes.cgi?book=de&amp;chapter=005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his exposition of Exodus 20 on the “Thru The Bible” radio program,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thruthebible.org/site/c.irLMKXPGLsF/b.4104119/k.949F/Welcome_to_Thru_the_Bible_RadioThe_Bible_Study_Program_Taught_by_Dr_J_Vernon_McGee.htm&lt;/ref&gt; J. Vernon McGee,  quotes Romans 1:21-25 and Colossians 3:5 to support his assertion that the idolatry forbidden by the first commandment includes not only the worship of idols and foreign gods, but also idols of the heart such as greed, alcohol, and sexual immorality.
{{quotation|Anything that you give yourself to, especially in abandonment, becomes your “god.”  Many people do not [explicitly] worship Bacchus,  the cloven footed Greek and Roman god of wine and revelry of long ago, but they worship the bottle just the same…Whether or not folks realize it, they worship the god Bacchus.  Other people worship Aphrodite, the goddess of sex.  Some people worship money.  Anything you give your time, heart, and soul to, becomes your god.  God says we are not to have any gods before Him.| J. Vernon McGee&lt;ref&gt;Exodus Volume II, J. Vernon McGee, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other Occurrences==
In addition to the best known occurrences at the beginning of the Decalogue, “I am the LORD your God” appears a number of other times in the Bible.  A search at www.biblegateway.com reveals 39 occurrences in the NASB.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=%22I+am+the+Lord+your+God%22&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=49&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase is often used to establish God’s authority while giving commands concerned with holiness.

For example, Leviticus 18 gives a number of commands prohibiting sexual perversions and the sacrifice of children.  It demands that God’s people behave differently from the nations around them, lest they be destroyed in the same manner.
{{quotation|I am the LORD your God.  You shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes.  You are to perform My judgments and keep My statutes, to live in accord with them; I am the LORD your God.  So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, by which a man may live if he does them; I am the LORD. | Leviticus 18:2-5 NASB}}
In a similar manner, Leviticus 19 gives additional commands regarding separation from mediums and spiritists, the honoring of the aged, and kindness to foreigners.
{{quotation|Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God. You shall rise up before the gray headed and honor the aged, and you shall revere your God; I am the LORD. When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.  The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God. | Leviticus 19:31-34 NASB}}
The prophet Isaiah asserts that failure to obey the commandments is the reason for Israel’s captivity and had the nation obeyed the commandments, they would have had peace like a river. 
{{quotation|I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to profit, Who leads you in the way you should go. If only you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your well-being would have been like a river, And your righteousness like the waves of the sea. Your descendants would have been like the sand, And your offspring like its grains; Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from My presence.  Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare with the sound of joyful shouting, proclaim this, Send it out to the end of the earth; Say, “The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob.&quot; They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts He made the water flow out of the rock for them; He split the rock and the water gushed forth. “There is no peace for the wicked,&quot; says the LORD. | Isaiah 48:17-22 NASB}}

The prophet Joel looks forward to future blessing through which God’s people will know that Yahweh is their God through his wondrous deeds on their behalf.
{{quotation|You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; Then My people will never be put to shame. Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am the LORD your God, And there is no other; And My people will never be put to shame. | Joel 2:26-27 NASB}}

'''Cholley''', also '''chole''', '''choley''', '''cholay''', '''white cholay''', '''chana masala''', is a popular and versatile [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistani]] chickpea dish, that is sometimes referred to as chana or channa. It is commonly cooked in Northern India (especially Punjab) and Pakistan for breakfast, but is not limited to the first meal of the day, being regularly found at dinner parties, picnics, wedding receptions and other special events. Cholley features chickpeas, onions, tomatoes and spices, with variations including additions of [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] (alu). This dish works well with a range of accompaniments including [[Cookbook:Samosa|samosas]], [[Cookbook:Puri|puri]], [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]], [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Bhatoora|bhatura]].

Add fresh water and salt, then cook until the chickpeas are tender (10 minutes at 15psi in a pressure cooker).
#Subsequently, heat the oil in a thick-based pan. Add the coriander seeds, and optionally the cumin and nigella seeds, cooking them briefly until they crackle. Quickly add the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and [[cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] until the onions are transparent. Add garam masala, tomato and salt and cook for one minute before adding the boiled chickpeas. 
#Reduce the heat, and allow the cholley to [[cookbook:simmering|simmer]] for around 15 minutes. Check that the gravy has thickened before removing from the heat. 
#Once done, place the cholley in a serving bowl, add your coriander garnish and serve with [[Cookbook:Samosa|samosas]], [[cookbook:rice|rice]] or [[cookbook:bread|bread]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just exactly what is &quot;the name of the Lord&quot;?  In most Bible translations, the title &quot;the Lord&quot; (or usually &quot;the LORD&quot;) is substituted for the unique name of the Hebrew god, יהוה, commonly known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton Tetragrammaton].  Therefore, יהוה is the &quot;name of the Lord&quot; which is not to be taken in vain.

In [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism Judaism], this commandment is taken so seriously that the uttering of God's name is forbidden, lest it somehow be used in an improper way.  Thus, in the reading aloud of scripture or in prayer, it is replaced with Adonai (&quot;My Lords&quot;, commonly rendered as &quot;The Lord&quot;), though occasionally replaced with &quot;Elohim&quot; (GOD). Other written forms such as י‎ (yod) ה‎ (heh) (YH or Yah) are in fact pronounced during prayer.  Ironically, because of this practice, no one today knows exactly how God's name is to be properly pronounced today.

'''You shall not make wrongful use of the name of your God''' is one of the Ten Commandments, which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''How Judges Think'', Richard A. Posner, Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 322; ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175; ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Geoffrey W. Bromiley, 1988, p. 117; ''Renewal theology: systematic theology from a charismatic perspective'', J. Rodman Williams, 1996 p.240; ''Making moral decisions: a Christian approach to personal and social ethics'', Paul T.

== Ancient Understanding ==
The ancients considered the name as expressing the nature or function, almost the very being, of a person or thing.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Commandments: The individual commandments, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Vol. 6, Freedman, D.N., editor-in-chief, New York: Doubleday, 1992, ISBN 038526190X, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the revelation of a personal name to Israel,“I am the Lord your God|I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery,” invited relationship and revealed something of the character of Yahweh.  The holiness of the name was not meant to remove it from use but from abuse.  There are numerous examples in the Hebrew Bible where God’s name is called upon in oaths to tell the truth or to support the truth of the statement being sworn to.&lt;ref&gt;Oath, in The Zondervan Topical Bible, Viening, E., ed., Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1978, ISBN 0310337100, pp. 719-720&lt;/ref&gt; However, the name was not meant to be used as a magic word. “Far from man being able to use the name to control God, it is the name which controls man both in worship ... and in service [to one’s fellow man].”&lt;ref&gt;Name: The name of God, in New Bible Dictionary, Douglas, J.D., editor-at-large, Wheaton: Tyndale House Publishers, ISBN 0842346678,  pp. 812-813&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the account in the Torah, a review of the Ten Commandments was publicly proclaimed by Moses as the people of Israel ended their 40 years of nomadic wandering and prepared to enter the promised land.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 5; Dunn, J.D.G. and Rogerson, J. W., Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible, Wm B. Eerdman’s Publishing, 2003, ISBN 0802837115,  p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In Deuteronomy 5:11, the Israelites are commanded not to swear falsely by the name of Yahweh; yet in the subsequent chapter they are instructed to swear only by the name of Yahweh (as opposed to other gods).&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 6:13; Oath, in Dictionary of the Bible, McKenzie, John, Simon and Schuster, 1995, ISBN 0684819139,  p. 623&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, there was an expectation for calling God as a witness to dealings between people, with serious consequences for those who would misuse the name of God.  Invoking God’s name as proof of truth was not restricted only to human dealings.  In one of Daniel’s visions, the angel that appears to him swears by God to the truth of the apocalyptic message.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 12:7; Bevan, A.A., A short commentary on the Book of Daniel for the use of students, University of California: University Press, 1892, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  In a number of passages, Yahweh is quoted as swearing by his own name to emphasize the definitive truth of accompanying statements.&lt;ref&gt;See, for examples, Jeremiah 44:26, 46:18; Ezekiel 5:11, 17:9, 18:3, 20:3, 20:31, 33:11, 16 and 27; Hosea 4:15; Zephaniah 2:9; Live, in Carpenter, E.E. and Comfort, P.W., Holman Treasury of Key Bible Words: 200 Greek and 200 Hebrew words defined and explained, Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers, 2000, ISBN 9780085493528, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The truth of assertions in court, as well as the trustworthiness of commitments in public and personal affairs were often supported by oaths or self-curses that would take effect if the assertion proved false or the promise was unfulfilled.  There are numerous examples in the Book of Samuel of people strengthening their statements or promises with the phrase, “As surely as Yahweh lives …” &lt;ref&gt;See, for examples, 1 Samuel 14:39, 45, 17:55, 20:3, 20:21, 25:26, 25:34, 26:10, 26:16, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  and such statements are referred to in Jeremiah as well. The value of invoking punishment from God was based on the belief that God cannot be deceived or evaded.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20:7, The Jewish Study Bible, Tanakh translation, Berlin A., Brettler, M.Z. and Fishbane, M., eds, Oxford University Press, 1999 ISBN 0195297512, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a narrative in the Book of Numbers describes how such an oath is to be administered by a priest to a woman suspected of adultery, with the expectation that the accompanying curse will have no effect on an innocent person.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 5:19-24; Isaacs RH, Every Person's Guide to Jewish Sexuality, Jason Aronson Publishers, 2000. ISBN 0765761181, pp.74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Such oaths may have been used in civil claims, regarding supposed theft, for example, and the commandment is repeated in the context of honest dealings between people in Leviticus 19:12.  Theft may lead to deceit, denial and cover-up; these are likely to be aggravated by false oath, thus profaning the sacred name of God – so God becomes a party for what began as a purely civil matter.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Leviticus 19:12, The Jewish Study Bible, Tanakh translation, Berlin A., Brettler, M.Z. and Fishbane, M., eds, Oxford University Press, 1999 ISBN 0195297512, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; At one point of the account of the dedication of the Temple of Solomon, Solomon prays to Yahweh, asking him to hear and act upon curses uttered in a dispute that are then brought before his altar, to distinguish between the person in the right and the one in the wrong.&lt;ref&gt;First Kings 8:31-32; Hooker, Paul, First and Second Chronicles, Westminster John Knox Press, 2001, ISBN 0664255914, p. 138, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophet Isaiah rebuked Israel as the Babylonian Captivity drew near, pointing out that they bore the name of God, and swore by him, but their swearing was hypocritical since they had forsaken the exclusive worship of Yahweh for the worship of idols.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 48:1-2; Isaiah 40-66, InterVarsity Press,2007, ISBN 0830814817,  p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The Israelites had been told in Leviticus that sacrificing their children to idols and then coming to worship God caused God’s name to be profaned, thus breaking the commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 18:21, 20:3, 21:6;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Ex.xxi.html, Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible, Vol. 1] Commentaries on Leviticus 18:21, 20:3 and 21:6&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the Book of Jeremiah, Yahweh told him to look around Jerusalem, asserting that he would not be able to find an honest man – “Even when they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ they are sure to be swearing falsely.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 5:1-2; Calvin, J, McGrath A, and Packer, J.I., Crossway Classic Commentaries: Jeremiah and Lamentations, Good News Publishers,2000 ISBN 1581341571, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeremiah prophesies to the people that they are mistaken to think they can break the commandments, “steal and murder and commit adultery and swear falsely,” and expect to be safe because they go to the Temple that bears the name of Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 7:9-15; Calvin, J, McGrath A, and Packer, J.I., Crossway Classic Commentaries: Jeremiah and Lamentations, Good News Publishers,2000 ISBN 1581341571, pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeremiah also refers to a situation in which Israelites repented and took oaths in God’s name – only to renege by reclaiming as slaves persons they had freed as part of their repentance. This hypocritical act was also considered profaning God’s name.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 34:16; Pixley, J., Jeremiah, Chalice Press, 2004, ISBN 0827205279,  pp.109-110&lt;/ref&gt;   The reputation of Israel was linked to God’s reputation, since they were “his people,” – therefore God was not going to tolerate the misuse of his name.  After a time of punishment, however, he promised to restore them for the same reason – the sake of his name.  In Jeremiah 12, an opportunity is also described for Israel’s neighbors to avoid destruction and prosper if they stop swearing by their idol and swear only by the name of Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 12:16-17; McKane, W., A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Jeremiah: Introduction, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1986, ISBN 0567050424, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Telushkin, a Modern Orthodox rabbi, wrote that the commandment is much more than a prohibition against casual interjections using God’s name.  He pointed out that the more literal translation of Lo tissa is “you shall not carry” rather than “you shall not take”, and that understanding this helps one understand why the commandment ranks with such as “You shall not murder” and “You shall not commit adultery”. God has chosen to use people who bear his name to represent him and bring knowledge of him into the world.  When a person who bears God’s name commits an evil act, he or she discredits God as well.&lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, J., Jewish Literacy: The most important things to know about the Jewish religion, its people and its history. New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1991, ISBN 0688085067, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish tradition, the word translated “Name” (shem) powerfully refers to the character or reputation of the one who bears it.  The revealed name of God (Yahweh) thus can be understood as the invocation for the very presence of God himself to show Himself to those who are praying.  Thus, it is considered a serious matter and not to be taken lightly.&lt;ref&gt;Name: The name of God, in New Bible Dictionary, Douglas, J.D., editor-at-large, Wheaton: Tyndale House Publishers, ISBN 0842346678,  pp. 812-813&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first commandments listed by Maimonides (Rambam) in the Mishneh Torah is the responsibility to sanctify God’s name.  As the purpose of creation is to demonstrate the greatness and unity of the Creator, this responsibility belongs to the entire Jewish nation, not only to the scholars or religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;The Kaddish Prayer: A new translation with a commentary anthologized from Talmudic, Midrashic and Rabbinic sources. New York: Mesorah Publications, Ltd., 2001, ISBN 0899061605, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  Maimonides thought the commandment should be taken as generally as possible, and therefore he considered it forbidden to mention God’s Name unnecessarily at any time.  Jewish scholars referred to this as motzi shem shamayim lavatalah, “uttering the Name of Heaven uselessly.”&lt;ref&gt;Terumah 3b&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid guilt associated with accidentally breaking the commandment, Jewish scholars applied the prohibition to all seven biblical titles of God in addition to the proper Name, and established the safeguard (geizerah) of circumlocution when referring to the Name of God.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L.A., My people’s prayer book: traditional prayers, modern commentaries, Vol. 1: The Sh’ma and its blessings, Jewish Lights Publishing, 1997, ISBN 1879045796 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;   In writing names of God, a common practice includes substituting letters or syllables so that the written word is not exactly the name, or writing the name in an abbreviated manner. Ultra-Orthodox Jews will not even pronounce a name of God unless it is said in prayer or religious study.  The Sacred Name (Tetragrammaton), is never pronounced by these Jews but always read as “Adonai (the Lord),” “HaShem (the Name),” or sometimes “AdoShem”.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm, Norman, The Shema: Spirituality and law in Judaism, Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2000, ISBN 082760713X, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaddish (literally – “sanctification”) is an important prayer in a Jewish prayer service whose central theme is the magnification and sanctification of God’s name.&lt;ref&gt;Donin, Hayim Halevy, To pray as a Jew: a guide to the prayer book and the synagogue service, Jerusalem: Moreshet Publishing Co.,1980, ISBN 0465086284,  p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the Shema and Amidah, it is one of the most important and central prayers of Jewish liturgy.  A version of the Kaddish is used as a prayer of mourning.

== In the New Testament ==
In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that a person’s word should be reliable and one should not swear by God or his creation, nor even by their own head, “because you cannot make even one hair white or black.”&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:33-37;&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, the Apostle James reiterates the instruction to just say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and keep your word,  “so that you may not fall into condemnation.”&lt;ref&gt;James 5:12&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars understand this teaching to mean that every oath involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2153&lt;/ref&gt; 

Appeals to various authorities or collateral to validate the truth of a promise or claim had expanded in Jesus’ day, and a hierarchy had been established by tradition that was not in line with the original commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, T., Thorson, S., Applied  New Testament Commentary, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook, ISBN 9780781448659, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus is quoted as warning that they were blind and foolish who gave credibility to such arguments: “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the sanctuary is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath.’ You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the sanctuary that has made the gold sacred? And you say, ‘Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath.’ How blind you are! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it; and whoever swears by the sanctuary, swears by it and the one who dwells in it; and whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it.”&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:18-22; Long, T.G., Matthew, Westminster John Knox Press, 1997, ISBN 0664252575, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lord’s Prayer, which is portrayed in the gospels as a model for prayer, begins “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name …”    The first few lines are reminiscent of the Kaddish – an important prayer in a Jewish prayer service whose central theme is the magnification and sanctification of God’s name.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L., My People’s Prayer Book: Tachanan and closing prayers, Jewish Lights Publishing, 1997, ISBN 1879045842,  p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Gospel of John, Jesus made appeals to the power of the name of God&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, C., The Gospel According to John: an introduction and commentary, Wm B. Eerdman’s Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802827713, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; and also claimed the name of God as his own, which constituted blasphemy if it were not true.   The Gospel of John relates an incident where a group attempts to stone Jesus after he speaks God's name: “I tell you, before Abraham was, I AM.”&lt;ref&gt;John 8:57-59; Stott, J., Warren, R., Basic Christianity, Wm. B. Eerdman’s Publishing Co., 2008, ISBN 0802864635,  p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; They interpret his statement as a claim of divinity.  Since they do not believe that he is God, they consider this blasphemy, which under Torah carries a death penalty.  In the account of Jesus’ questioning by the Sanhedrin in the Gospel of Matthew, the high priest charges Jesus “by the living God” to tell the truth and answer whether he is the Messiah.  Jesus says that he is the Messiah, and makes parallels between himself and the “Son of Man” referred to by the prophet Daniel, which evokes an emphatic response that he has blasphemed (broken the commandment) and deserves death.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:63-66;Levy, L.W., Blasphemy: verbal offense against the sacred, from Moses to Salman Rushdie, UNC Press, 1995, ISBN 0807845159, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  When giving the Great Commission, Jesus claimed authority from

The author of Hebrews reviewed God’s promise to Abraham as assurance that outstanding promises will yet be fulfilled.  “Human beings, of course, swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute.” &lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 6:16 (NRSV)&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the promise of God to Abraham, God swore by his own name to guarantee the promise, since there was nothing greater for him to swear by.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, A.C., Harrington, D.J., Hebrews, Liturgical Press, 2007, ISBN 0814658156, pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; Philo pointed out that it is natural that God would swear by himself, even though this is “a thing impossible for anyone else.”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, F.F., Epistle to the Hebrews, Wm.

== In the Catholic Church ==
{{quotation | Yahweh our Lord, how majestic is your name throughout the world! | Psalm  8:1 (NJB), Catechism of the Catholic Church 2160}}

The Catholic Church teaches that the Lord’s name is holy and should be introduced into one’s speech only to bless, praise or glorify that name.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2143&lt;/ref&gt;   The name should be used respectfully, with an awareness of the presence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2144-2145, 2153&lt;/ref&gt;  It must not be abused by careless speech, false oaths, or words of hatred, reproach or defiance toward God, or used in magic.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2148-2149&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Jesus Christ is believed to be the Messiah, and “the image of the invisible God,”&lt;ref&gt;Luke 15:11-32; Catechism of the Catholic Church 1701&lt;/ref&gt;  this commandment is applied to the name of Jesus Christ as well.

The sentiment behind this commandment is expressed in the Lord's Prayer, which begins, &quot;Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.&quot; According to Pope Benedict XVI, when God revealed his name to Moses he established a relationship with mankind; Benedict stated that the Incarnation was the culmination of a process that &quot;had begun with the giving of the divine name.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, pp. 143-145&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict elaborated that this means the divine name could be misused and that Jesus' inclusion of &quot;hallowed be thy name&quot; is a plea for the sanctification of God's name, to &quot;protect the wonderful mystery of his accessibility to us, and constantly assert his true identity as opposed to our distortion of it.&quot;

Taking an oath or swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms.  It is to invoke the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one’s own truthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2150&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quotation |Promises made to others in God's name engage the divine honor, fidelity, truthfulness, and authority. They must be respected in justice. To be unfaithful to them is to misuse God's name and in some way to make God out to be a liar. (1 John 1:10) | Catechism of the Catholic Church 2147}}

For the same reason, the Catholic Catechism teaches that it is a duty to reject false oaths that others might try to impose; an oath may be made false because it attests to a lie, because an illegitimate authority is requiring it, or because the purpose of the oath is contrary to God’s law or human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2151-2153&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Reformation and Post-Reformation Views ==
Matthew Henry described five categories of actions that constitute taking God’s name in vain: 1) hypocrisy – making a profession of God’s name, but not living up to that profession; 2) covenant breaking – if one makes promises to God yet does not carry out the promised actions; 3) rash swearing; 4) false swearing; and 5) using the name of God lightly and carelessly, for charms or spells, jest or sport.  He pointed out that though a person may hold himself guiltless in one of these matters, the commandment specifically states that God will not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Ex.xxi.html, Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible, Vol. 1] Commentary on Exodus 20:7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran Witness, a doctrinal document representing the Lutheran faith, supports the view that oaths should not generally be taken at all, except “for the glory of God and the welfare of our neighbor.” Specifically, it states that proper use of God’s name includes administration of oaths in court, and in swearing-in a spiritual or political leader to their respective offices, which include responsibilities toward God and fellow human beings.&lt;ref&gt;The Lutheran witness, Volume 11, General English Lutheran Conference of Missouri and Other States, English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States, Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States, Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod, Edited and published under the auspices of the Cleveland District Conference by C.A.

In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin sets the stage for discussing this commandment by noting that an oath is calling God to witness that what we say is true, and that an appropriate oath is a kind of worship of God in that it implies a profession of faith. When human testimony fails, people appeal to God as witness, as the only one able to bring hidden things to light and know what is in the heart.  False swearing robs God of his truth (to the observer), and therefore it is a serious matter.  With regard to the casual use of God’s name, Calvin summarized, “remember that an oath is not appointed or allowed for passion or pleasure, but for necessity.” He wrote that the frequency of casual use of the name of God has dulled the public conscience but that the commandment, with its penalty, still stands.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John, (Beveridge, Henry), Institutes of the Christian Religion, Hendrickson Publishers, 2008, ISBN 1598561685, pp. 246-248&lt;/ref&gt;

For future reference, there are two ways to get a page deleted. The first is to use the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|&lt;your personal justification for speedy deletion&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Or, for more questionable modules that should be voted on before deleting, use the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and list the page on [[WB:VFD]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{SPM header}}

== Preamble ==

If you use drag-and-drop in ''Finder'' to install the updates, it will actually perform a folder copy and not a folder merge so that updated files will be overwritten but unchanged old files will be deleted (see [http://macosx.com/forums/mac-os-x-system-mac-software/303820-copy-folder-deletes-original-folder-contents-then-copies-new-ones.html this thread]). Using the command line option as described below will overcome this.

== SPM8 ==

Mac Intel with 32 bit MATLAB is a supported SPM8 platform. Precompiled MEX files (*.mexmaci) are included in the SPM distribution.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm8.zip] and its updates [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8_updates/ spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
 cd /Users/login
 unzip spm8.zip
 unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
 addpath /Users/login/spm8
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation === 

Should you want to compile SPM MEX files (this can currently happen if you are using Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)), there are two requirements:
* you need to have Apple's development environment [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ Xcode] installed. It should be available on the &quot;Mac OS X Install&quot; DVD that came with your Mac. Navigate to &quot;''Optional Installs''&quot; and then to &quot;''Xcode Tools''&quot; and double click the &quot;''Xcode Tools''&quot; package to install. You will know that you need to install this tool if ''make'' is a ''command not found'' later on.
* You also need to have the ''mex'' executable in your system path. To do so, type the following in a Terminal:
 export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MATLAB74/bin
with the appropriate path where MATLAB is installed. The exact syntax might be different if you are using another shell.

Then, in a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM8 installation, type:
 cd /Users/login/spm8/src
 make distclean
 make &amp;&amp; make install
 make toolbox-distclean
 make toolbox &amp;&amp; make toolbox-install
 make external-distclean
 make external &amp;&amp; make external-install

Note: when compiling with Mac OS X 10.5 and wanting to keep compatibility with Mac OS X 10.4, it is advised to set the preprocessor macro:
 export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
See [http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/Darwin/SymbolVariantsRelNotes/index.html Apple Development:Symbol Variants]

== SPM5 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Mac Intel with 32bit MATLAB (*.mexmaci) are included in the SPM distribution.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
 cd /Users/login
 unzip spm5.zip
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
 addpath /Users/login/spm5
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

If you want to compile SPM5 MEX files by yourself, you need to have Xcode installed and ''mex'' in your system path (see SPM8 for details).

Then, in a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM5 installation, type:
 cd /Users/login/spm5/src
 make distclean
 make &amp;&amp; make install

== SPM2 ==

=== Installation ===

Follow the default installation for a UNIX system.

Precompiled MEX files for Mac Intel with 32bit MATLAB (*.mexmaci) are available as an extra package:
* [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm2_updates/SPM2_MAC_INTEL_MEX.zip ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm2_updates/SPM2_MAC_INTEL_MEX.zip]

To run SPM2 on an Intel Mac, you will need to make a few changes to the '''spm_platform.m''' file.  These are relatively straightforward and have to do with Intel Macs identifying themselves as MACI (instead of MAC) as well as the big vs. little Endian issue.  

First, add MACI to the list of platform definitions.  In the spm_platform.m file you will see a list that looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
PDefs = {	'PCWIN',	'win',	0;...
		'PCWIN64',	'win',  0;...
		'MAC',		'unx',	1;...
		'SUN4',		'unx',	1;...
		'SOL2',		'unx',	1;...
		'HP700',	'unx',	1;...
		'SGI',		'unx',	1;...
		'SGI64',	'unx',	1;...
		'IBM_RS',	'unx',	1;...
		'ALPHA',	'unx',	0;...
		'AXP_VMSG',	'vms',	Inf;...
		'AXP_VMSIEEE',	'vms',	0;...
		'LNX86',	'unx',	0;...
		'GLNX86',	'unx',  0;...
		'GLNXA64',      'unx',  0;...
		'VAX_VMSG',	'vms',	Inf;...
		'VAX_VMSD',	'vms',	Inf	};
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Simply add a line like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
		'MACI',		'unx',	0;...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, at the bottom of the spm_platform.m file you need to add MACI in the list of supported platforms:

&lt;pre&gt;
case {'SUN4','SOL2','HP700','SGI','SGI64','IBM_RS','ALPHA','LNX86','GLNX86','GLNXA64','MAC', 'MACI'}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Compilation ===

If you want to compile the MEX files by yourself, download an updated Makefile and spm_platforms.m file from:
* [http://web.me.com/markusnowak/SPM2_on_Intel_Macs http://web.me.com/markusnowak/SPM2_on_Intel_Macs]
and follow the instructions given there (they have been updated for Snow Leopard).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basics==

Like many other musical styles, salsa has many of the well-known music (beat) measures. If you are a musician, or you are able to  tell rhythm, then you can perform your basic step. It is important to note however, that we have 8 &quot;tics&quot; when dancing. This means that you are going to do your steps twice as quickly as the &quot;1-2-3-4&quot; count. It is also important to mention that the foot movements are done in every tick but 4 and 8.
So, for the basic salsa step there would be a total of six movements (1-2-3, 4 5-6-7, 8) So, in the eight measures. Movements to make the basic step: 
* left foot forward (tick 1)
* right foot stepping in place (tick 2)
* left foot comes back next to the right foot (tick 3)
* (tick 4 is left alone)
* Right foot moves back (tick 5)
* Left foot steps into place (tick 6)
* Right foot goes back next to * left foot (tick 7)
* (tick eight is left alone)

There are quite a few steps for the salsa dance, but this is the one that seems to be the most comonly used for the leader (being the male).

===Variations and turns===

Once the basic step is performed, it can be done in some different ways. For example, one can step to the sides instead of stepping to the front and back. So the left foot would move left, then step back next to the right foot; thus, the right foot is moved right and stepped back to the left foot. When turning, the leader raises his right hand and and motions it to the desired turning side. Raising the hand is important since there has to be constant contact with the fingers as the person rotates. So if the person is turning, their hand is too, always touching the fingers, so that at the end of the turn the hands can be back together again. 

==Points of connection==

* Preferably, leader's right hand grabs onto follower's shoulder, follower grabs leaders shoulder.
* right elbow has to be under the follower's arm
* left leader's hand is held with right follower's hand.

Note: These three points of connection are the ones commonly used; although there can be variations of such points, depending on the type of turn and type of steps which are implemented.

:Probably best to work on a section until you're happy with it and then save it back, rather than saving it multiple times while in progress. Reason being, somehow both I and withinfocus started jumping on your edits... don't know why, I'm not usually paying that much attention to it; and it's entirely possible that we'll step on each other while that's going on. If you're happy with it when it goes back, likely we will be also and we won't be trying to re-edit while you're editing. One thing my (professional editor) father told me, by the way: If you aren't sure about a passage, read it out loud. If it sounds all right, it will read all right.

::Good tips!![[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:You do know that you don't need to include underscores in links, don't you? &lt;nowiki&gt;Once the front end has dealt with it, [[../Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[../Characters/Hermione_Granger|Hermione]] work identically... which means that if you're working on a character, you can say [[../other character/]] and have it come out correctly.&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:52, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Nope, didn't know that. Actually, I haven't done much at all on the links because it's done differently than the way it is on other Wikipedia sections, and I haven't really learned the difference. I've been working around the links as much as possible, hoping someone would just add them in . . .[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 23:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

:We'll get there. &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt; Meanwhile, another thing: you do know that the book summary at the start of the book will be going away, don't you? I see you're updating the whole-book summary for OotP; that will all go away when the per-chapter summaries are complete, as it did for PS, CoS, and PoA earlier. It would be better to just work on the per-chapter summaries... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

I was definitely wondering why the summary was there. I'll be incorporating the changes I made into the individual chapters, so hopefully it won't disappear too soon.

:The whole-book summary will stay there at least until all the individual chapter summaries are complete. When I completed the PS chapters, I found that there were a couple of things in the whole-book summary that hadn't made it into the chapter summaries, so I ended up re-instating the whole-book summary briefly while I added the missing bits into the chapters. The whole-book summary was, if I understand correctly, pulled verbatim from Wikipedia, and is different from what we want; it's being kept only until &quot;something better&quot; is in place. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

I recognized the text from the Wikipedia because I edited and rewrote much of it. I'll work on making it &quot;better.&quot; ;-) [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 05:28, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

:Hey – looks like you've pretty well finished the per-chapter summaries for OotP, except for internal linkage. Thanks... means I can just power through and add links, and that one will be done... I see you've been doing work on the summaries for HBP as well. Thank you very much for that. Are you reasonably happy with the HBP summaries? Because it would be a great relief to be able to cross that off the to-do list... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:08, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

I think the HBP summaries look very good. I was hoping someone would do the links on OotP! A very tedious, but important task. I also just finished CoS. All chapters looked very good, but I did some minor text streamlining. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:Okay, I'm very close to the end of GoF – chapters are big, they seem to take me about an hour each, and it's been a while since I had that sort of time. But I'll get to the end of it soon... meanwhile, maybe I can start linking up OotP. Matt was saying that there is a lot of re-linking that has to be done on HBP; a lot of it links in to Wikipedia and should link here instead, so I'll sort that out. Reason I asked about summaries is that Matt also said that HBP seems a little sort on content; on the other hand, it seems to me that the book itself is a little short on content relative to books 2 through 5. I will re-check; but if you're happy with them, I don't anticipate more than tweaks being necessary. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:32, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

Some of the OotP chapters are also short on content--deliberately so for now. I haven't read the book in a long while, and I had to rely on the Spark Notes synopsis to refresh my memory on general plot points until I have a chance to review the book. I'm looking over Goblet, and overall it is looking good. Just some text tweaking is needed. Yes indeed, each chapter does take a long time to write (I have a much better appreciation of what JKR or any author goes through when writing a book!); this is definitely a labor of love for most of us. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:Ah. Well, see, I can't rely on Spark Notes or Coles or anyone... because a whole lot of the strength of this series lies in the multiple setups and payoffs, something that JKR is a master at; and so many notes keep only the payoffs and skip the setups, making the whole thing flat. So if you try to compress too much, you lose it all. On the other hand, it's possible that I'm leaving too much in... but I always was wordy. Anyway, I always go straight from the books – have 'em on the desk even now. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:15, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

It's hard to strike a balance between too much and too little. Spark Notes (I'd never heard of Coles) is way too little in my opinion, but it was helpful in refreshing my memory so I could frame out each OotP chapter synopsis that I worked on as a starting point. Making the synoposis too long is not good either; readers might as well just read the book. Anyway, I'm still working on OotP and have been fleshing out the chapters I did. I thought HBP looked OK, by the way.

:I'm going to growl at you a little about the stuff you pulled out of GoF chapter 27 and moved to 37. Yes, it goes in 37 as that's where it is revealed; but it should be in 27 as well, because that's where it plays a part in things. I've tried to be careful to put the stuff that gets revealed later into Greater Picture where possible; I guess I missed with that lot today, putting it in Analysis instead of Greater Picture. Would you be so kind as to restore that info, shifting it to the Greater Picture section, so that I don't have to? That's both the Bertha Jorkins memory stuff, and Barty's Boomslang skin. Thanks... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:13, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

I totally understand your &quot;growling,&quot; and I don't want you to be upset. The chapters should be analyzed and provide strong plot hints without giving away the ending. Otherwise it is confusing and ruins the ending for the readers by giving away too much. Wiki readers should be treated as if they're reading the actual novels and given an opportunity to figure things out. 

However, I see no reason Jorkin's disappearnce cannot be mentioned in the &quot;Greater Picture&quot; section, as there is a specific spoiler warning there.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:That is sort of the way I've been looking at this as well. What I have to figure is that this will be used as a study guide; our students will be reading along in the chapter notes as they read the books, and so the analysis shouldn't tell too much of what is going to be revealed in later chapters. I've tried to do that in the GoF analysis as well; in particular, I have mentioned Barty Crouch in the analysis a number of times, and that he is in disguise, but I have, I hope, not revealed that he is Moody outside of the Greater Picture.

:Speaking of which – the stuff you've put in the analysis area of chapter 37 is going to be moved into the chapter 37 summary, because it's all stuff that Barty tells us under the influence of Veritaserum. It's good that it's there now, but I'm going to have to move it – guess I'd better hurry and write that chapter summary, no? &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:38, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

Yes, absolutely it should be moved. I just parked it in the Analysis area temporarily until the rest was written. I thought it would look weird just sitting in the Summary area without anything else. I agree about the study guide use. I also see it as a handy reference for those who enjoy the movies, but don't read the books, but want to know more of the backstory.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:Eager, aren't you? Editing a chapter (GoF 35) that I hadn't even finished writing yet? &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

I can't help it!! *stands up* My name is Raven and I'm a . . .  COMPULSIVE EDITOR . . . . !!!! *sobs* Excellent overall content, by the way on all the chapters you've done. Not too much or too little. Text flow just needed some streamlining.

:Not to worry; seems you're not the only one. Maybe people just like tinkering with what I write, to the extent that they feel compelled to attack it as soon as it its the disk. I don't know what that says about my writing... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:33, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

You have the potential to be an excellent writer. As I mentioned, your work just needs streamlining. I took Technical Writing, and it changed my writing style tremendously. These are a few rules that were literally HAMMERED into me:

1. Use as few words as possible. If you can say it with two words rather than three, do it. That doesn't mean sentences should be overly short and choppy, but make them economical. Look at every sentence and determine what can be eliminated. For examaple: Rather than the phrase, &quot;determine what can be taken out,&quot; I wrote, &quot;determnine what can be elminated.&quot; One word instead of two!! 

2. Create fluid, rhythmic sentences that sound pleasing to the reader's ear. Vary sentence structure. Novices tend to write many sentences the same way. 

3. Avoid negative sentence structure whenever possible (Do NOT use &quot;not.&quot;) This is actually the hardest thing for me to avoid. 

4. Avoid prepositional phrases. They weaken sentence structure. My least favorite preposition is &quot;of,&quot; and I always do a &quot;search and destroy&quot; mission to eliminate these phrases. These can't always be eliminated, but do so whenever possible. 

Example: 

From: After another cart ride, Hagrid removes the only contents of the second vault, a small grubby parcel, without explaining what it is.

Changed to: After another cart ride, Hagrid removes the second vault's only content, a small grubby parcel, without explaining what it is.


5. Avoid any familiar or cliched phrases. If it sounds even remotely familiar, toss it. Avoid phrases like, &quot;due to the fact that&quot; or &quot;in that event.&quot; They only add &quot;dead weight&quot; to sentences.

6. Avoid overusing semicolons, colons, em dashes, etc. Use only one or two per article. They are effective literary devices&amp;mdash;but only when used sparingly. The same for starting sentences with an article.

7. Avoid overusing adjectives and adverbs. 

8. Write in an &quot;active voice&quot; and use action verbs.

These rules really were drilled into me, and I always try to implement them, and I'm my own harshest critic. I never write something once, and then leave it be. I'll edit it numerous times to improve it as much as possible. I hope that provides a better understanding about my writing style.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:Hmm. Not sure I agree with all of those... removing prepositional phrases does have a tendency to make the resulting text a bit over choppy. And are we writing technically here? Or are we trying to write a bit more colloquially? I'll grant that I over-use semicolons, but writing summary it seems there is little other way to do it; we have two sentences that ought to be joined because they are dependent, yet dissimilar enough that we can't really hang just a comma in there. And I tend to write as if speaking, which perhaps isn't the best for this application, but it usually suits my humble purposes; but that style does affect what actually hits the page. Of course, my main exposure to these books so far has been reading them aloud to my youngest... perhaps that affects my perception of the appropriate style? Naaah, couldn't be. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:49, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

Just to clarify--&quot;technical&quot; does not mean writing in a dry, boring &quot;scientific&quot; or &quot;high tech&quot; manner. It is conveying any type information to readers in a succint, easily digestible and understandable manner, which can also be in a more personal style. Of course, the beauty of Wikipedia is even after dozens of people put their stamp on each page, it seems to come out okay in the end.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

== Triwizard Tournament ==

I was actually thinking of breaking that into five sections: a tournament overview, and a subsection for each of the three tasks and the Yule Ball, all of which would be Major Events. Seems to me that having the entire Tournament be a major event is a bit overpowering, as it encompasses the entire book... thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:47, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

:I think it's a good idea. Breaking down the three tasks would especially be useful for readers, and maybe a smaller section on the Yule Ball, as that seems to be a traditional part of the tournament.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

OK! I was pretty much done with it, anyway. Have at it! [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:Done... though I do have to go and improve each of the tasks writeups now. Wiki got rather vexed at me because it saw you had fixed a typo while I was in the midst of editing... but I had fixed that typo also and so that was moot. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:37, 20 May 2007 (UTC)

Man, they're touchy! It was a typo &quot;I&quot; had made just prior to your message to me, so I thought I should fix it.

:More a matter of timing... it's all automated. Wiki software knew that I had hit &quot;edit this page&quot; at time t, you had hit it at time (t+1) and saved it at (t+2), and I didn't hit save until (t+60)... so I needed to know that an edit had happened while I was editing. And it wouldn't let me save until I had merged the changes... which I did by dumping the existing text and substituting with mine, which incorporated that change. This is the only way to do these things when you're working with lots of people editing the same text, as I have learned with my playing with source control systems... but it can be startling. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:25, 20 May 2007 (UTC)

:Um... question. It seems that in the description of the Second task, you have twice now changed the description to say that it is the &quot;Black Lake&quot;. I have to admit that I don't remember ever seeing that wording in canon; it is simply the lake, where the Giant Squid lives, where the Durmstrang ship floats, and which the first-years sail across in their little boats. Do you have a reference for the name? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:21, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

I was certain I had read that it was called the Black Lake (maybe on one of the Wikipedia HP pages???), but I'll check to verify. If I can't verify it, I'll change it back. I want everything to be 100% accurate. :-)  [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

I'm glad you did! It looks much better. Thanks!!! :-)[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]]

:Links: You did have the link to the DA correct, but it was a bit larger than it needed to be. Wikibooks has a hierarchical structure, with pages and subpages; so for instance the page &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a subpage of the page &quot;Major Events&quot; which in turn is a subpage of the page &quot;Muggle's Guide to Harry Potter&quot;. The notation &quot;../&quot; means &quot;go up one page in the hierarchy&quot;, so if you are in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;../&quot; takes you up to &quot;Major Events&quot;. Thus, since &quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot; is also a subpage of &quot;Major Events&quot;, you only have to step up once before choosing your page, hence: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Dumbledore's Army/]]. What you did was: [[../../Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which says: up to Major Events, up to Muggle's Guide, back down to Major Events, and down to Dumbledore's Army. It is equally valid, but a little more convoluted.
:Where this is useful is reaching (e.g.) character pages: to reach the character Harry Potter, you would enter &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../../Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you were on a subpage of Major Events, for instance. Do note that chapters in the books are actually three levels down, so the reference for the character Cho Chang from a book chapter would start with the ../ sequence three times: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../../../Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]].&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:19, 26 May 2007 (UTC)

:Oh: one quibble. You said &quot;''&quot;Elipses&quot; (. . .) are only used to denote text that has been deleted. It does not indicate a pause in someone's speech.''&quot; First, that is, I think, ellipses (two l's); and second, Rowling uses it to denote either a pause or a trailing off at the end of a sentence, and whether that usage is technically correct or not, it has become accepted. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:48, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

Yes, it is two l's. That was a typo, but unfortunately, you cannot go back on the History log to correct a mistake in your comments. It is perfectly acceptable to have ellipses trailing off the end of a sentence, as that indicates text has been deleted or is incomplete or if you are quoting it from the book that way. However, I'm unaware that it is acceptable style-wise to indicate a pause in general prose by using dots. This is not my opinion; I was specifically taught that you do not use ellipses this way. That is the purpose of the em dash. However, I'll dig a little deeper into other usages for this.  [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 17:41, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

:I'm certainly not going to argue with your teacher about how it is supposed to be used. However, I do have a copy of GoF right in front of me, and that is how it &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; used – when Wormtail is speaking with many pauses because he's in pain from his missing hand, the pauses are indicated with ellipses, not em dashes. And much as I dislike to quibble – arguing this sort of fine point seems so trivial, somehow – when I have used ellipses, it is almost always a quote, because I have little use for it otherwise. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:37, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

I mentioned above that it is acceptable if it is being quoted from the book. However, it does not always translate  well when taken out of context for a synopsis. I would use this as  &quot;sparingly&quot; as possible and only to emphasize a particular point. Also, when using ellipses (according to my handbook anyway) always have a space between each dot. When trailing at the end of sentence, four dots are used, three to indicate the deleted text and a period to end the sentence. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 14:00, 30 June 2007 (UTC)

:Spacing between dots is a pain because you need to use non-breaking spaces to keep it from breaking mid-ellipsis. So an ellipsis would be &quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;.&amp;amp;nbsp;.&amp;amp;nbsp;.&quot; (as seen in the edit window) which would come out looking like &quot;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&quot; And of course, when I have used ellipses in book quotes, I have seen them get edited out. But trivialities like that are really not worth battling over, so I left them edited out.

:This does seem to have the potential to degenerate into the sort of pointless argument that can derail a useful project&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt; so I'm going to suggest we just leave it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:57, 30 June 2007 (UTC)

I never argue&amp;mdash;I debate. ;-) I restored the quoted text in Chapter 32 as it is in my (American) book. It uses ellipses and em dashes. Since spacing out ellipses appears to be a huge pain in the ass, I just did the dots together.

== Yet more Muggles ==

I see your recent edit to Prisoner of Azkaban chapter 7 that you have Harry actually changing the Boggart into a Dementor. Would you be so kind as to back that out, and also remove the associated question? Yes, that happens in the movie, but it does not happen in the book; in the book, Lupin deliberately steps in before the Boggart can change, because, as he later says, he didn't think the class was ready to be presented with Lord Voldemort.

By the same token, and to forestall any edits that you might add: in the movie, Hermione howls like a wolf to distract the changed Lupin right after the Shrieking Shack episode. In the book, that does not happen; Hermione is absolutely petrified that something she does could have an effect on her prior self. &quot;'''You must not be seen!'''&quot; is the watchword, and she lives by it. In the book, instead, the changed Sirius herds Lupin away from the kids, and Lupin bounds off into the Forest to escape.

:Thanks for the info. It's been awhile since I've read the books, and I try to avoid using the movies as reference. I do remember that Hermione does not &quot;howl&quot; as it is shown in the movie. In fact, as I recall, Lupin sort of disappears from the main action. Also, if I get something wrong, feel free to take it out. That's what we're all here for--&quot;checks and balances&quot;. 

:By the way, there was a PoA Study Question about the slogan the Weasley twins charmed onto Percy's Head Boy badge. However, there was no mention about it in the synopsis--at least not that I could find. I don't have my PoA book handy, and I do remember them calling him &quot;Big Headed Boy&quot; but I couldn't remember if that was what they put on the badge. I sort of vaguely worded it so there would be some reference to the study question, but it needs further clarification.  Cheers!!! [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 12:08, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

There have been occasions in the past where I edited things out, and then had them re-appear; I suppose I should have mentioned them to the editor in question at the time I backed them out, but... In any event, your latest set of changes is an improvement over the original, so getting you to do the work was actually the Right Thing. &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt;

In PoA, the Twins tell Percy that they will be getting to King's Cross station in Ministry cars, with little flags on the fender with the letters HB, for Humongous Bighead. As Harry returns from collecting Ron's rat tonic (and overhearing the Weasley parent's conversation about Sirius), he finds the twins listening to Percy tearing his and Ron's room apart searching for the badge. &quot;We've got it,&quot; Fred whispered to Harry. &quot;We've been improving it.&quot; The badge now read ''Bighead Boy''. This is the second time Fred had bewitched Percy's badge; at Christmas, in CoS, he had changed Percy's Prefect badge to read &quot;Pinhead&quot;.

:Just so you know, I don't &quot;intentionally&quot; go back and edit something out that someone else has changed just because they changed it. I tend to look at something later and think, hmmm, that doesn't seem right or whatever and just make the change on the spot, totally forgetting what was there before. Just let me know when you do make changes and why it needs to stay that way. I'm totally reasonable!!! Honest. Your work here has been exemplary, and I could not have done this without having had such an excellent starting point. I may be stronger at streamlining prose, and that just comes from years of practice and being mercilessly edited by others far better than myself, but your technical and organizational abilities and attention to detail have been superb. Keep up the good work. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 17:49, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

Not a problem... we'll just have to try and keep it all civil, no? Anyway – I went back in there and tweaked a little, to get the order of events right. Hope I didn't mess things up too badly... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:02, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== Welcome back! ==

You seemed to be missing for a couple of weeks there... I missed the caw of the PNW Raven.

If I might make an impertinent suggestion? You've been going over DH for a while now... perhaps I could ask you to take a look at HBP instead? I've been filling in the chapter summaries there, and I have now completed the first 23. Of course, '''I''' think they are perfect. But all the same, a second eye across them would be a good thing, I think. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:56, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

I'm back! I was working on the general Wiki HP and the Deathly Hallows pages. I'll take a look at HBP, as well as D.H. HBP is perfect? Don't worry, I'll &quot;fix&quot; that. ;-)[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 12:20, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

:Quibbling at you now about DH chapter 5: it's not Moody's image at Grimmauld Place, but Dumbledore's, though we do hear Moody's voice. Also, while George loses an ear, it is Fred who dies in the final battle. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:18, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

I was actually going to check about Moody--whether it was his image or voice. I was relying on my memory--always a bad resource. Re: George, &quot;I wrote what I meant, and meant what I wrote,&quot; to paraphrase from ''Alice in Wonderland''. ;-) Yes, I know it was Fred who died. As soon as I read the part about George losing his ear, I was positive that Fred was done for. I'm certain Rowling was tipping readers off that George was going to lose a part of himself (that part being Fred). I didn't want to give away too much in the analysis, but I'll work on the wording and maybe even move this to a different location, but that is what I meant.  OK, just keep whacking me over the head when I get it wrong. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 02:48, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

:&amp;lt;whack&amp;gt; Good catch! Though I think I'd still tweak the wording a little... rather than &quot;another person&quot; I think I'd say &quot;the Weasley family&quot;. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:56, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

I'll be working on this. It's in a pretty rough form right now, but I just might change it to &quot;the Weasley family&quot; now that I moved it to The Greater Picture.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 12:28, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

:One more trivial thing... You keep misspelling Umbridge's name. It is &quot;Dolores&quot; with an O, which as it happens is the Spanish word for &quot;Pains&quot;, as in the butt. I could write a small essay about why people in Spain and Mexico name their girl children &quot;pains&quot;, but I will spare you -- you have enough of my verbiage to cope with of late. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:15, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

I actually never realized it was spelled that way or that it was Spanish for &quot;pains.&quot; So appropriate. I just love how Rowling names her characters.  And thanks for for &quot;sparing&quot; me from the essay. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 13:49, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

:Some of the names are a bit over the top, actually... &quot;Pius Thicknesse&quot;? &quot;Charity Burbage&quot;? Actually, sometimes the names are just too appropriate. How could Lupin's parents have known to call him Remus? He wasn't a werewolf when he was born. I can understand Sibyll Trelawney's first name, as she came from a line of seers. Rubeus Hagrid? He's certainly ruddy enough, but who is the hag riding him? Would that be his Giant heritage? Or Rita Skeeter? And Skeeter -- talk about an appropriate name. Or for that matter, Cornelius Fudge. But she has said that the Weasleys are named in part because she is so fond of weasels. But milady wife, whose name is Jane, is upset that Rowling used her first name for Umbridge's middle name... she feels mildly insulted, as the only person in the series with her name is an evil bullfrog... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:05, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

Hahaha! I totally agree that it's way over the top! Being a children's book, it doesn't bother me so much, but one of my biggest peeves about literature and movies is characters who have such conveniently descriptive names that so accurately define their personalities. It's way overdone, and I wish writers would just stop doing this. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 18:24, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

:One quick note -- I haven't yet gotten past chapter 19 in OotP. I'm going to have to rework your reworks when I get out that far. I'll let you know when I've gone over the rest of that one... but if you look at OotP 20, you'll see how little there is there. And you'll also see that it's wrong. (Umbridge doesn't ask about giants specifically, because she doesn't know where Hagrid was.) [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:57, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

OotP is the least worked on Muggle's Guide book. I reworked what was there, which wasn't very much, and wrote most of the last one third of the chapters, with the idea of adding more detail later. My main concern was that there was something for each chapter. Just continue on, and I'll be checking as well. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 14:38, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

== Conference ==

[[WB:AN#Seeking wikibooks evangelist to speak at documentation conference|Seen this?]] [[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] is suggesting maybe one of us two should think of attending. Thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:07, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

:Wow, this is really cool! I'd love to see Wikibooks get more attention. I'd consider being a presneter, but it's impossible for me to commit to anything right now. I'm virtually trapped in Seattle because of my mother--she's elderly, handicapped, and it's constant trips to the E.R. every few months. Even if I arrange for someone to stay with her (she can't be left alone), if an extreme emergency cropped up, I'd have to cancel. I would be interested in attending as part of a group where it's not solely dependent on my presense. Portland is an easy commute for me. 

:BTW, my Wiki experience is really paying off. Last week my boss asked me to write an article on, get this, Precommercial thinning in PNW forests. He's a forestry professor. He had me go through all our old publications to glean info and write an intro to thinning for a new forestry web project we're doing. He was blown away by what I came up with (I know nothing about forestry) and he wants me to do more. Just one of the bennies of being a Wiki editor that could be mentioned at the conference. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 14:18, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Questions... ==

Just thought I should give you a heads up. ChazzJr is deleting questions that are too easily answered (in his opinion). I've been following after and re-instating some of them, but not all. It was my understanding that the questions were to be study questions rather than review questions; they were to be an invitation to further thought, rather than the sort of thing that can be answered by a simple inspection of the summary. So for instance, in DH c33 the question &quot;What shape was Snape's Patronus?&quot; is pointless, but &quot;Why was Snape's Patronus a doe? Can we guess the shape of Lily's Patronus?&quot; is an interesting exercise. But... your thoughts are always welcome, of course, and we can debate if necessary. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:15, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

:It's certainly good to have thought-provoking questions, and I don't want too many overly simplistic ones. I do think it's beneficial, however, to have a variety for different reader levels (children through adults). I'm thinking that parents or teachers may want to use the easier ones for younger readers who can't quite handle the more speculative questions. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 02:06, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

An intriguing idea. I would suggest that it might be a good idea in that case to order the questions from easy to speculative; at the moment, the ones I've seen seem to be pretty randomly ordered. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:55, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

:Many questions, but definitely not all, have been ordered chronologically according to events in a chapter. That's mainly because I've been scanning each chapter as a whole, then work my way down thinking of questions for each paragraph with the idea that some will be weeded out later. However, these were interspersed among questions that were already there, so the order is not entirely chronological. I like the suggestion of an easy-to-difficult hierarchy, and maybe even labeling them as such by section, such as &quot;Questions for Younger Readers&quot; or whatever.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 13:34, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

I mentioned to ChazzJr the idea of putting the easy questions first; he seemed to think that was a good idea and is likely to pursue that course, rather than deleting the easy ones as he had been. Making sections could be a big undertaking – I think there are 199 chapters total, plus all the characters and all the magic... a large job. I'll see what withinfocus thinks... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:20, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

:OK! Let me know what withinfocus thinks. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 18:44, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

::Eh, I don't think I would support new section creation, but I would support new sub-sections within the existing ones. Yes, it is a lot of work, but it doesn't have to be done all at once. What would you guys suggest the sub-headings be called? Maybe &quot;Review&quot; and &quot;Critical Thinking&quot;?

:: Also, I didn't know you were female, so I am now informed! -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:06, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

:::I would go for &quot;Review&quot; and &quot;Further Study&quot;, which seems to be the typical two for this sort of thing. I agree that creating new sections would not be good, but subsections would be just about right for this. As for the male / female confusion: I hope I did not insult with my assumptions... and I, too, am now better informed. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:13, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

Sub-headings is what I had in mind. &quot;Review&quot; seems best to me. And NOT offended at all about the gender confusion. I actually get that all the time because my real first name is a bit gender-neutral. I get all types of mail--Mr. Ms. Miss, whatever, it doesn't matter to me. LOL  Actually, I don't know what gender either of you are . . .??? [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 13:55, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think that withinfocus has ever made a secret of the fact that his first name is Matt. My first name is Charles (hence Chazz, by way of the old New Yorker cartoonist Chas. Addams). ChazzJr has, of course, mentioned that he is my second son. My first son has not yet decided to edit Wikipedia. And now you know. &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:25, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

Back to the topic... I have tentatively modified [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20]] to have the sub-headings. Thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:18, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

There are actually two IP addresses that seem to be doing a lot of work -- the 205 one, which is you, and the 68 one, for whom I have also left a message. I had thought the 205 one might be someone you roped in, actually, as the IP address does resolve to somewhere near your hometown, while the 68 one resolves to Michigan.

== Interview with Rowling ==

Just to keep you in the loop... Someone editied Dumbledore as a result of seeing [http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more this news story], and I reverted as vandalism, but it now seems that it was true. However... withinfocus and I are discussing how we deal with this revelation on our respective talk pages. A third opinion would be useful, I think... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:24, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:I kind of have to argue the &quot;off the cuff&quot; concept. If she felt she had to correct a scriptwriter at one point, then it must have been pretty central to who Albus was. And I think that it's about the only thing that would prevent the young Albus in correctly perceiving the equally young Grindelwald. I know that an older boy can have a certain glamour for a younger one that conceals the less savoury parts of his personality; but when they are of approximately equal age and experience, I don't think that would apply. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:46, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

== Summaries? ==

Doing summaries again, are you? &lt;small&gt;**sniff**&lt;/small&gt; I'm not needed... Seriously, though — good job. Thank you. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:45, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

You are definitely needed!! In fact, I was hoping you'd look at what I've written on Deathly Hallows and add the links . . . And I thought your additions to OotP and HPB quite good--just the right amount of detail. I just did some polishing, but I think your prose has really improved nicely. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 22:59, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

:So often I find I am interrupted before I reach the end of things, and as a result I've gotten a bit twitchy about actually getting things finished. Because of that, I was planning on wrapping OotP before I went on to DH... and as I only have five chapters of OotP left, that shouldn't take too long. It says here. And with the work you've been doing on DH, I hopefully will be able to just burn through that... there is light at the end of the tunnel! Or is that a train? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:41, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

We'll get there! [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 00:15, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

:And OotP is done. Just had a first look at DH chapter 11, and added a bunch of links. It looks good, but of course, I'm going to have to read through the chapter again to be certain that everything of import is there and in order. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:42, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

OK! [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 00:11, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:Finished review of chapter 11. From my biased viewpoint, it looks like you were spot on; only two tiny areas where I felt correction was necessary, plus the links of course. Thank you for that... excellent work. Chapter 12 tomorrow, if I can... and then onwards! [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 08:05, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

Glad I got it mostly right. I have the book right next to me as I'm writing, going page-by-page. It's certainly no easy task sifting through it all and deciding what to put in or leave out. Up till now, I've concentrated on reworking what others have written, so I appreciate all the time, effort, and patience it takes to do this, although it's quite enjoyable as well. Well, onwards! [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 12:36, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:For what it's worth, likely this weekend I will have a stretch of time with no internet access, but will have a laptop. If that happens, I can write summaries for chapters 13 (which I note you've skipped) and 18; possibly also 24 and 25. It's a whole heap easier to create new than to edit when I don't have a live connection... but I can also just capture the page contents, and edit about eight chapters during that stretch. Whichever you prefer... I'm pretty easy. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:26, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

Yikes! No internet access? The horror! Thank god for wireless cafes and libraries. I just finished Chapter 17 (I think it's pretty good) and have already started Chapter 18 offline, and will continue with that. Maybe we can split up 24 and 25. Please feel free to do 13. I was planning to it later, but the others interested me more. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 15:35, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:My mother is now living alone, since my father passed away; I visit her every month, to keep things running over there. The problem is that there is a two-hour ferry ride each way, and the Ferry Corporation has not yet seen fit to install internet access even on their big boats. So I typically have two two-hour stretches where I perforce edit offline. I generally can do one or two chapter summaries each way... which means that if you want to leave 13 and 25 to me, I likely will have them in place by (our) midnight Saturday. Sunday afternoon, I'll take four to six chapters and bring them up to spec offline, if I can. Almost there... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:49, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

I sympathize regarding watching over your mother. I know how hard this is. Sounds like a good plan for the chapters. I'll do 18 and 24. Almost there . . . [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 17:24, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:Looks like 22 needs a lot of work as well. I'll try for 13 and 22, and 25 by Sunday, unless you want the headache. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:39, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

== Chapter 18 analysis and stuff ==

I would have commented on your talk page, but I wasn't sure that it was you that was writing that. There seem to have been about two or three different IPs editing with your style today, and I wasn't certain they were you. Your IP address evidently changes fairly frequently. In any event, the way you split things up looks good, but I think it needed a tad more information below the spoiler. I have re-tweaked it; hope I didn't wreck things.

I have done 13, 22, and 23. 23 looked like it was going to be easy, but it appeared that someone had done it from memory and the event order was scrambled, which made it hard to straighten out. If you still want to do 24, let me know; if I haven't heard from you by about noon, I'll likely try to fit 24 and 25 in on the ferry ride back.

Oh – and my mother seems to be doing all right. There is some trouble, as always, with technology, but she seems to be handling the regular parts of living just fine. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:51, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:Sounds like you've got your hands full... don't sweat the small stuff, and Wikibooks is definitely small stuff. I'll work on 25, and try for 26, 27, and maybe 28 offline. We are nearing the end of this bit now... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:02, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

I've been dealing with the &quot;old ladies&quot; for a long time, so it's gotten pretty routine. Wikipedia is my escape from it all. It really is something I enjoy very much and always look forward to working on.  We are almost there. I'm looking forward to your &quot;Shell Cottage&quot; synopsis. There's a few later chapters that need work; I'm going to work on those and then start more on analysis. There's a lot of good stuff, but want to tie things together more. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 21:10, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:Shell Cottage is going in shortly... but fair warning: when I ran out of stuff to do in 25, I went on to 26 and 27. I will be combining your changes to 26 with mine as best I can, but I may lose some of your deltas... I'll try not to, but it's tricky. Stay tuned... but I'll be dropping 25 and 27 in first, because mine are the only changes that have happened to those two since I grabbed them this noon. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:37, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
:Right: 26 is merged. Would you be so kind as to take a look at it and see if I got everything?
:Oh -- and thank you for your kind words about 13. That was a bit of a pain to write... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:02, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

::Just as a follow-up... three IP addresses? Actually, it seems, only two, but neither of them the one you had used earlier. If you look at the edit history for DH chapter 18, you'll see that on 3 November, it was edited by you, me, and two anonymous editors. I believe both of the anon editors were you, the style seems right. You'll also note that one is a 67 address, one is a 66 address, and the one where I posted earlier is a 68 address. Residential providers will often change IPs every few days, or even more frequently... and it looks like yours changed sometime between 0620 and 0742 on the 3rd.

== Fenrir ==

Being away from my books at the moment, I can't comment authoritatively. I'll look at the book this evening and confirm, but I can't believe that the Death Eaters would want an uncontrollable werewolf in their midst, I don't think Fenrir would use Wolfsbane potion, he seems a little too focused on the defenders of Hogwarts to be transformed, it's unlikely Harry would be able to recognize him transformed as he has only ever seen Fenrir's human shape, and it's certainly true that whenever we see Lupin, he is human. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:57, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

I'll look this over again too when I get home, but by the description, it strongly seemed to indicate that he was transformed at the time. I was wondering if this was actually an error on Rowling's part, but it seemed like if Fenrir, or any werewolf was transformed, then Lupin should have been too. Interesting thought about whether Fenrir used the Wolfsbane potion or not. Even if he did, he would probably be as vicious and bloodthirsty as he normally was, he would just know what he was doing at the time. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 21:01, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:The exact words are, &quot;A grey blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen. [para] 'NO!' shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand Fenrir Greyback was thrown backwards... He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet.&quot; Chapter 32, &quot;The Elder Wand&quot;, in my edition page 519; note nothing about fur. Again in &quot;The Forest Again&quot; Fenrir is skulking, chewing his long nails; if he was transformed, those would be claws. So I'm going to stick by my statement: Fenrir is acting like a wolf because he feels like it, not because he has transformed. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:20, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

I'm going to leave the analysis as is except the part about Harry being able to recognize Fenrir because he is in his human form and he wouldn't know what he looks like as a werewolf. It actually doesn't say in the book that Harry recognizes him at all. It is the author's voice that identifies him as Fenrir. I also rechecked the description in my book and it says &quot;gray blur&quot;. So you're right about that. However, claws VS nails. Not sure about that. Canines, which would include werewolves, are also referred to as having nails. When I had a dog, the vet or groomer trimmed her &quot;nails&quot; (their words), so that term could probably apply to either state Fenrir is in, I think. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 12:47, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

:And I quibble: Seems to me that &quot;nails&quot; is the term used when the animal is domesticated, &quot;claws&quot; when it is not. I'm certain that a recent inquest, where someone was killed by either a bear or a wolf pack, did use the term &quot;claws of wolves&quot; when describing an injury. Also: Dogs' nails tend to be blunted by their habits of walking over concrete surfaces; wolves' claws, especially werewolves one would think, would have sharpened ends still, so they would be more of a weapon. On the author's voice: Which of the Trio has seen Fenrir in wolf shape? The author can't tell us that it is Fenrir if none of the main characters recognizes him. And I unquibble.

== Nagini ==

DH chapter 34: Do Ron and Hermione already know that Nagini is the sixth (as far as they know) Horcrux? I'll check this as well, but I'd appreciate a pointer to where Harry had told them. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:49, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

You might be right about this. I was thinking that they all knew earlier on that Nagini was the Horcrux. I'll also check into this more.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 21:02, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:And that is why you shouldn't trust your memory. My memory is pretty good... but apparently not good enough. Thanks for the correction. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:11, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

We're gong to have to change our names to &quot;Checks&quot; and &quot;Balances&quot;! [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 12:37, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

== DH chapter 30 ==

An order of events correction: I made this change once, and you seem to have changed it back, so rather than getting into an edit war, I'll ask you to change it one more time...

McGonagall does summon the other three heads of house, and Flitwick and Sprout show up while she's dueling Snape; but it is not until after the fight has moved into the classroom and Snape has done a flit that there is any mention of Slughorn, at least in my edition. He's puffing along so far behind, likely from having to climb the stairs from the dungeons, that he doesn't even show until the excitement is nearly over.

Hope I'm not being too starchy here... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:49, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

:UK/Canadian books versus US books? Would not surprise me at all... In any event, I will check, and if it turns out mine is different, we might want to show both versions to forestall later edit wars, no? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:24, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

::We here in Canada got the UK edition, word for word. I think the US editors thought that the US in general wouldn't get a lot of the UK shadings of meaning... at one point, Ron says of Dumbledore, &quot;I told you he was barking.&quot; In the UK, that means &quot;extremely eccentric&quot;, with the implication &quot;harmless&quot;, and there isn't an equivalent term in US English. At another place, Dumbledore offers someone a plate of &quot;chipolatas&quot;, which are sausages, though I think few in the US would understand that. I think the differences are chalked up to &quot;translation&quot;... two countries separated by a common language. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:50, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

There's definitely different colloquial terms, but my feeling is they should have left it British and just included a footnote at the bottom explaining the different meanings. They lost a great opportunity to educate one culture about another. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 00:56, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

:I stand corrected. Slughorn is mentioned... but in my own defen&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;e (another Britishism) I will say that he looks like an afterthought on that paragraph, which is why I missed him. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:19, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

:Editors tend to dislike putting footnotes in fiction. It was done a lot in the 19th and early 20th century writing, but has fallen out of favour. Some works come with a glossary -- Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' for instance -- but even there a lot of words are understandable from context... Of course, I'm Canadian, so I just sail through these British things, they have been taught to me from the beginning. (Except chipolatas -- I had to look that one up.)

:The vagueness of the narration may, in fact, be one of the strengths of the books. We don't, in honesty, need to know that Fenrir was (or was not) transformed; it creates a little less dissonance if he wasn't, but it doesn't matter. We don't know whether or not Bellatrix is dead, because while she falls, the word &quot;dead&quot; is never used. The fact that she was hit in the heart implies death, but that is uncertain. But what that means is that the series will continue to reward a re-read; the more times you read it, the more you see in there.

:For what it's worth: I believe all the chapter summaries are now complete and up to standard. I will be going over them again in a while -- possibly a long while -- but for the next while I'll be concentrating on other areas of the book.

== New Page Freeze ==

Please see [[User talk:Chazz#New Page Freeze|here]] and [[User talk:Withinfocus#PDF Version|here]] for some news on creating a PDF for our book. If you need to create any new pages in the book or see one created, please tell me about it. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:00, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

== Redlinks ==

Raven, a just a word of warning. withinfocus asked for  a bot to turn all our relative links absolute, to make the PDF version of the book easier to generate. Whiteknight created a bot to make that happen, and the bot messed up slightly. If you see a redlink, and it is of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Somewhere/valid/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, let me know, but leave it alone for now. We may be able to fix it with a revised bot, but we'll need to have the original messed-up version to start from. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:38, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

:I've been talking with Whiteknight about this, and it looks like an easy enough fix... he says he'll hammer on it a bit tonight. I'll keep you posted... but it was disconcerting to see a whole page turn red like that. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:43, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

::Looks like Whiteknight has successfully completed the reformat. Now to see if we can make it into PDF... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:33, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

== Usage ==

I didn't know whether we could see page stats on Wikibooks, so I asked withinfocus, and he said, basically, no. Breaking it down into English, there are three ways we can find page statistics, and these are:
# Raw page statistics on the Wikimedia servers. This is inherently unreliable, because many pages are actually cached on the &quot;squids&quot; (proxy servers), and don't actually hit the web servers. So for instance, the Wikibooks front page may have a million hits in a day, but only a few hundred of those get through; it being such a popular page, most of the time the page is served from the cache in the proxy servers.
# Wikimedia tool server. This has been turned off by the foundation, apparently due to server loading. I believe Whiteknight may have asked to have it turned back on, but to no avail.
# Third-party, like Google Analytics. Unfortunately, the statistics gathered by Google Analytics are sufficiently detailed that many in the Wikimedia Foundation are opposed to them, as it seems to violate the Wikimedia privacy policy. Note that we can't see that information, but it is collected by Google, and it is unknown what they do with it.

So I'm afraid that there isn't really any way that we can find out whether we are preaching to a full house or to a void... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:35, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

== Welcome back... ==

I have to admit I was wondering if you had gone off and left us. Welcome back to the ranks of the editors, Raven. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:52, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

:I'm back! Well, I actually never left, just been very busy and overwhelmed with life lately. An elderly family friend passed away a few months ago, and I was the Power of Attorney and now the executrix of her estate. Then my mother got very sick about a month ago and is still recovering in the hospital. She's doing better, but it's going to be awhile before she's back home. I was also doing some work on the Pirates of the Caribbean and It Takes A Thief (reality TV show) Wiki pages. Anyway, thanks for the warm welcome back, I really appreciate it, and you'll be seeing me more regularly. I've been wondering what you've been up to. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 23:05, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

::Ah, well... it's been busy here, as well, though not as busy as you have been. No, I've been, in my methodical way, going through the characters to establish their roles in the books. The end is in sight -- I've just finished with Rubeus Hagrid and am now ready to start with the S's; though I've had to leave the Trio and several semi-major characters out until I can re-read the series. (The Trio in particular are going to be rough, as I have to super-condense their roles.)

::I'm very sorry to hear of your troubles; hope things even out soon. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:14, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for the good wishes, and I'll be sure to check out what you've been working on. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 01:57, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

== Stable Versions ==

Raven, hi -- good to see you're still around.

You may have noticed this thing that's showing up on a lot of pages lately that says &quot;There are no reviewed revisions of this page&quot;? Wikibooks has added the capability to mark pages as up to standard or otherwise, and Matt and I are currently trying to determine what &quot;standard&quot; is so that we have a criterion. There are apparently four levels of quality. Editors can mark an article as being levels one through three, and Reviewers can mark it as being, I guess exemplary. For one reason or another, I seem to have been made an Editor, though I haven't yet marked any articles because I don't have a criterion. Matt, of course, is administrator and so is also Reviewer.

Could you stop by [[User_talk:Withinfocus|Matt's talk page]], and add your opinions? I really think you would be a great help to us.

And can I also suggest that you stop by [[WB:RFA]] and ask for Editor status at least? Again, IMHO you could be a great help to us that way.

thanks. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:21, 22 November 2008 (UTC)

:I'm definitely still around! I did noticed the message at the top of the page and was wondering what it was all about. I will stop by Matt's Talk Page and add some comments. I'll also look into Editor status. I'd like that. Thanks for suggesting it. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 00:56, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

I have indeed reviewed this, and I will make comments. Sorry for the delay. I've been very distracted--my mother's been in/out of the hospital and nursing home (she's in again). Anyway, I'll be giving my input on this.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 19:42, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

::Seems Matt has put the discussion [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter#Review Standards|here]]... just so we are all (literally) on the same page. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:52, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

::Oh, and... if there are three drop-down boxes and a [review] button on the bottom of your view of a page, then you are either editor or reviewer already. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:45, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

== Langlock ==

Forgive me for asking, but do you have a reference that indicates that Langlock is for a specific subject? I've not seen it used that way... and we don't know that Langlock is the static jinx left at Grimmauld Place by Moody. The one time Harry uses Langlock it seems to be general rather than specific.

Oh, and your comments about the Black Lake from aeons ago: I finally found out where that came from. It is referred to repeatedly as The Black Lake in the film GOF. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:49, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

:Hi! I'm snowed in here! Anyway, I went to the Langlock page from a &quot;Tongue-Tying Curse&quot; link on one of the synopsis pages. I can't remember specifically which page. I assumed this must be the official name for the Tongue-Tying Curse, but it seemed odd. Are they the same? I had read an explanation for the Tongue-Tying curse on another web site--maybe Sparknotes???? and was remembering it from that. My understanding is that the Tongue-Tying curse ties a person's tongue into a knot, preventing them from speaking about a specific thing. What is your take on the Tongue-Tying curse explanation? I'm a little confused about it. So would appreciate any help. If they are two different curses, then the link is incorrect.

Yes, the Black Lake was specifically a movie reference, and therefore should not be used here. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 23:11, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

:Snowed in here, too. I'm an east coast boy originally, and it seems odd to me that only three inches of snow can paralyze a city as big as Seattle... but I guess, if it is so rare that you don't recognize the white stuff falling out of the sky... And of course I'm very twitchy. My mother is in hospital in Victoria, where there is also a heavy snowfall warning, and I can't get over there to visit her or tend to her house and dog...

:The only summary page that links to Langlock is DH9. The original DH9 text does say &quot;tongue-tying curse&quot; rather than &quot;Langlock&quot;, and the effects are subtly different. I'll have to go into HBP and see where Langlock is mentioned in the original text (apart from HBP19, where it is used but not mentioned in the summary, along with Peeves). I should also mention the Undetectable Extension Charm, I suppose, which is what Hermione uses to make her beaded bag larger on the inside than on the outside. In any event: I will deal with it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:46, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

Well, that explains it; no wonder I was confused! Thanks for clearing that up. Re the weather. It's not so much the acutal snow, but that it's usually very wet and slippery, then freezes over the streets. Seattle is so hilly, that the icy roads are just treacherous. I'm sure it's much the same where you live. Sorry to hear about your mother. Mine is in a nursing home right now for rehab, but I can't even get up to see her, the streets are so bad. I've been home since last Wednesday. Stay safe.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 23:59, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

== Deletions by an IP address ==

This morning early there were a couple of deletions of text from the analysis area of GoF:23. Basically the idea was right but the execution was wrong: the text in question did constitute a spoiler, so probably should not have been in Analysis but in Greater Picture. I reinstated the text in GP myself a bit later. But I am curious: I see you're doing a lot of GoF work now, and I was wondering: were those edits yours? Like me, you sometimes get logged out by surprise, and those edits are tied to an IP address only... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:50, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:Hi Chazz. Well, I'm pretty certain those edits were not mine. I am still logged in, and haven't gotten unlogged for awhile now, and certainly not today. I'll take a look at this, but glad you reinstated it if you feel it belonged in the GP. 

:Update - OK, I just checked this, and this is not a chapter I've worked on recently. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]])

::Okay... good to know. Not that I really suspected you of deleting ad lib, but it's good to know I hadn't messed up your plans, if you had any for that page. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:20, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:I think DH is pretty much done and ready to be critiqued, although I'll continue to tweak it and add additional analysis as it occurs to me.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 20:38, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

::Of course, now that I've mentioned it, I see you're back in there... not a big problem, just don't want us both to be editing at once, that can cause confusion. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:49, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

== Featured Book ==

I'm pleased as well, but I'm a little tentative about it. The Featured Book template was added to the MG by a user who had signed up only two days before and only had about a dozen edits under his belt. And we don't seem to be on the Featured Books list, though I agree we should be. I've let it lie, particularly as withinfocus chose to make a feature books advert page, rather than remove the notice... but I am a little unsure of exactly how we became featured. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:32, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

== MG:DH Disapparating from dragonback ==

I have to argue about Harry and Hermione Disapparating from Bathilda's window. As I read it, they are already on the ground before Hermione Disapparates them away. I believe that the only person who was seen to Apparate from a location analogous to the dragon's back was Mundungus from the back of Moody's broom; and Fletcher can evade capture by a house-elf for a prolonged stretch, so it's safe to assume that his escape skills are quite finely honed. 

I can undo that bit of editing, of course, but that would lead to an edit war, even if only a brief one. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:45, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

:Actually, in Godric's Hollow, it was Hermione who was doing the Apparating; I can think of only one occasion when the three of them Apparate separately. Apart from the trip from Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage, there is always one of them, usually Hermione (who, after all, passed her Apparation test on the first try), bringing the others by side-along Apparation. It might be that Hermione was afraid that they would get separated if they tried to Apparate to a safe location, and couldn't get close enough to the others to get the necessary hold on them for side-along Apparation.

:Oh, and welcome back, eh? It's been a while since we've seen your dulcet keystrokes... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

== GoF revisions ==

I see you've been going over GoF again... I was doing the same, rather more laboriously, and had gotten up to GoF:28. You seem to have started at 1 and are quickly overtaking me... should I stop until you're done? Or did you want to hold off for a while and let me finish? Oh, and good to see you're at it again. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:07, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
:My father, who was a scientist, used to say, &quot;It's not the science that is hard, it's the living.&quot; Sounds like you've had your fair share of that... Don't let me stop you editing, we do need your touch. I've finished GoF:28, and will probably reach the end of GoF:37 in about two weeks; if you could do your stuff up to GoF:28, then concentrate on PS and CoS for that time, that would be excellent. And always, if something leads you back into something else, by all means follow the link. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:18, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
::Yes, my father was a scientist and an editor of scientific journals, so I come by my language skills honestly, I guess... My mother was also trained scientifically, got as far as her M.Sc., before deciding that the office politics in universities was not for her. So I guess I get it from both sides. Curiously, my kid brother is much more of a prose poet, selecting the perfect word to make a point instead of hammering it into the ground the way I tend to; he has a book of short stories and an autobiographical work published, and a novel coming out, and his writing style is completely different.

== Back again, I see... ==

Good to see you're back looking at the Muggles' Guide. I think I should mention that I haven't quite finished my overhaul of OotP; real-life nonsense has made that take longer than I had planned, so I'm still on chapter 37 with 38 still to go.

::A thought on reworking the character page for Harry: We really need to ultracondense the story, much as was done for PS. Rather that tweaking what's there in CoS and later, it would be much better to rip it out and see if you can condense it to eight to twelve paragraphs per book, hitting only the real high points. I had planned to do that while I was doing character work, but I've gotten sidetracked by the chapter summaries... still in mid re-read for the semi-important character summaries (Dean, Seamus, Pansy, Draco, and like that).

::Same ultra-condensation idea applies to Ron and, possibly, to Hermione, though I seem to recall that Hermione may have already had that treatment. We may also have to do some refining of Dumbledore, Snape, and Voldy, who are similarly all through the series.

== Small issue in Chamber of Secrets... ==

Welcome back, again, and I hope you don't mind if I quibble at you a little... Twice now you've changed a tense in the analysis of CoS:7. Specifically, Hermione suggests that Draco had bought his way onto the team before he calls her a mudblood. Granted, in that section of the analysis, the order is somewhat confusing, as we talk about what Draco said before we talk about what Hermione said to trigger it; but if we leave it as &quot;Hermione says that...&quot; instead of &quot;Hermione had said that...&quot;, that gives the impression, at least in the analysis, that Hermione's accusation was in response to Draco's insult, rather than it being the other way around. The best correction might be to discuss Hermione's speech before Draco's, but that may require splitting the paragraph in two. If you want to do that, that might be for the best; but I don't know if there is enough there about what Hermione said to make it worth a whole paragraph, and moving her part in this to the front of the paragraph without splitting it does seem to give us a two-topic paragraph, which would be ungainly.

:Hi there! I have no quibbles at all about changing that back. Sorry, I hadn't check the history logs, and did not see your messages about this, otherwise I would not have changed it again. I was actually unaware I was changing it more than once. I tend to just keep going over the same text again and again, and if I see something I think needs changing, then I do, without always realizing it had been changed by someone else. Yes, you're quite right, it should be in the past tense as Draco is responding tp Hermione after she made her comment. Thanks!

Actually... I hadn't thought about that. No, what we're doing is not exactly fanac, and so it likely had slipped under the radar; we're actually trying to figure out, to a certain extent, how it was done, rather than jumping into it with all four feet. We have been trying for a more scholarly approach, rather than the breathless worship many fan sites seem to show... and why that should make us ineligible, I don't know, but I can see how it would drop us down the roster a few notches.

Though WithinFocus offered to put my name up for admin status (and this would be the third time someone offered), I had to turn him down; my overall available time seems to be more limited now than it was before, and I don't see that trend changing, and I really can't afford the additional hit that becoming admin would incur.

::::Rambam Rashi seems to be something of a grammar purist; he came in, started at the beginning, tweaked a few minor things in each book over the course of about a month, and then departed and I've never seen him again. I believe he read his talk page -- I left some comments there which were acted upon -- but he did not reply.

I had forgotten that aspect of the timeline, actually.

== Possible new subsection... ==

A thing that repeatedly occurs to me is that there possibly would be a home for &quot;aphorisms&quot;, likely as a sub-section of Major Events. Specifically, I can think of two that reverberate through the entire series, and keep being nagged by the thought that there should be a central place where all these reverberations can be written up. The two I am thinking of are both from Dumbledore (of course): at the end of the first book, where he says &quot;To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; And at the end of the second, where he says &quot;It is our choices, Harry, far more than our abilities, that determine who we really are.&quot; The first of those is echoed quite strongly in the seventh book, in Harry's eventual thoughts of the Hallows, but has an ongoing echo throughout the series, most notably in the fourth book (where Harry is the stronger wizard because he is prepared for death), and in the sixth (Dumbledore's preparations). The latter can be seen in Harry, in James Potter, in Tom Marvolo Riddle, and in Dumbledore himself.

I sort of unilaterally added a section in Major Events for ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''; this one is questionable enough that I figured I ought to get a little more input before just bolting something in. Your thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:44, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:Actually, there is already a page on Themes at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Themes]], though perhaps that should be broken into separate pages for each theme. There are only three items on there at the moment, and they are all three somewhat sketchy, though, so breaking it into subpages at this point is a bit premature.

:There is bound to be overlap between themes and aphorisms, because the aphorisms are actually written to point up the themes, I think. But as we're approaching from different angles, I don't see that as a big problem.

:My initial thought was to have Aphorisms as a section of Major Events, and have specific aphorisms listed there to fit into the Major Events template. But I am not wedded to that idea.

::Sorry for my long silence; I've been trying to think up alternatives.

::Changing &quot;Major Events&quot; would be a big deal, because it would be a template change and I'd have to enlist someone with a bot to change all references to anything that was a major event. It would be possible, but we'd have to be ruddy sure that was what we wanted to do. That said, if we could think up a more inclusive name, I'd be in favour; &quot;Major Events&quot; doesn't seem to cover continuous things like prefects and Quidditch, organizations like Dumbledore's Army and Death Eaters, or overviews like aphorisms and themes. But for the life of me, I can't think up a reasonable name for such a section. Story Artifacts? Major Story Points?

== Cross links ==

Raven, frankly, I'm not the one to ask about this. I don't know what policy is about cross linking, that should be referred to an admin, possibly Adrignola. Personally, though, I don't know even if we want the sort of attention that linking to fan sites would bring us. We've had problems in the past with people adding characters who appear only in fan publications, and while we are putting together a more or less complete detailing of the Potter universe from the ten published books, that is not our main purpose; we're trying to make a more scholarly work, one that analyzes the work rather than simply regurgitating or expanding it. With withinfocus' departure, I have become something of the control editor on this project, and already I'm finding time that I wanted to use for writing is being taken up with monitoring other people's edits. A sudden influx of new editors, unfamiliar with WB's standards and traditions, quite likely would overwhelm me. I don't object to having people find us; we do get a number of new editors over time, and I welcome them as much as I can. But the sheer volume of editing that would, I expect, result from such a crosslink would almost certainly be too much for us... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:16, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

:I don't have a policy to pull out of my pocket at the moment on it, but external links ought to go to sites that provide something of value beyond what the textbook can.  It shouldn't be there simply for promotion. Maybe one of those sites has compiled something that we can't host here, such as a video.  If you select one that attracts the right audience, cross linking may provide a mutually beneficial relationship. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:14, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

However, I don't want to be so hidden that those who would find value in the Muggles Guide are left unaware that it exists. If we could target the right audience (particularly young readers), I think it could be beneficial, though I agree we should be cautious and selective about who we aim for.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 23:45, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Adrignola, I think you misunderstand. The suggestion is to provide incoming links -- post or promote the Muggles' Guide on various Potter fan sites. There is, in my humble opinion, very little there that would enhance the understanding of Potter-as-literature, but fans, with an encyclopedic knowledge of the Potter series, might be able to add something here.

:::But I do worry about it, I really do. While MuggleNet does have some quite insightful analysis (suggesting that Kreacher had accompanied Regulus into the Horcrux cave, for instance, shortly after the publication of book 6), an awful lot of what is on that site is extensions to canon and discussion of those extensions. My worry is that some people on fan sites would see us as a blank canvas on which they could write their fanfic. It would only take a handful, and we'd be looking at a full-time job of cleanup.

I would assume most links would be two-way, as the neighboring web site usually wants to be listed as well. Chazz, I think you have made some very good insights. My own preference would be to restrict this web site only to established editors, much as Wikipedia does on high-profile pages that are subject to frequent vandalism, the Harry Potter ones included. As I see it, yes, we want to protect the integrity and quality of the Muggles Guide, but it also creates a dilemma of sorts. We have a well-written, insightful reference guide that many would find useful, yet we want to keep it low-profile to avoid vandalism, fanfic, and less than scholarly contributions. How do we reconcile those two positions?[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 16:21, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

:I hope I've not been belaboring the points. There is a conceptual device that many people put on their talk pages, a WikiStress meter, which indicates their overall stress level when Wikiing. While I haven't seen any such, I can well imagine a related WikiFatigue meter, indicating how tired of the process they are. At the moment, while my WikiStress is hovering in the low yellow, as it has been for years, my WikiFatigue is climbing towards redline; I have seriously considered hanging things up and departing. And I see the added work of policing several hundred new editors, or even merely several dozen, as being far more than I would be able to stand.

:How to strike the balance? Well, that I do not know. The problem is that any fan site would be floodgates; we open it to one fan, we open it to all. That we may have to do that at some point, I do not doubt; perhaps, though, the first thing to do is to mention it privately to the specific individuals who have shown insight in items published on fan sites. If we can get a few more motivated, insightful, and scholarly contributors that way, perhaps we can use that as a way to move ahead...

::And while I do not (now) panic when someone changes my &quot;deathless prose&quot;, and welcome additional editors to the project, I can see us being overwhelmed by fanac, and having the project carried away completely by the fen. Which is the core of my complaint...

::As to leaving, I am afraid that with me, it's likely to be similar to what happened with some of the earlier contributors, notably Jokes_Free4Me, jguk, hagindaz, and Hedwig0407. Particularly if an influx of new editors makes me leave, I fully expect that when I do choose to come back, the book will no longer resemble what I had thought I was working towards, and so I will no longer feel that I have anything worthwhile to contribute. Unless I'm forced out, though, it won't be any time soon that I depart; I do still have two big things that I have to finish up before I can contemplate hanging up my spurs: the walkthrough of DH, and the semi-major characters.

== About destroying Horcruxes... ==

That is, I would say, a very good question. I don't have an equally good answer; however, I can speculate. And the key to my speculation is this: Why did Dumbledore travel all the way back to Hogwarts from the Gaunt shack (HBP:23) and fetch the Sword of Gryffindor out of a display case to break the ring Horcrux if the Elder Wand, of which he was the full master, could have done the job? I suspect that the difference is this: a Horcrux is a soul fragment that is bound to an object. What was in Harry was in fact not a proper Horcrux at all, but simply a piece of soul more or less along for the ride. In order to speculate on what happened there, we also have to speculate on the nature of the Avada Kedavra curse. To wit: Harry's experience in DH:35 leads us to believe that one of the effects of the Curse is to separate soul from body. But that cannot be the full effect; the Curse also works on spiders, and nobody teaches us that spiders have souls, and the end effect of the Dementor's Kiss is not a dead body, but one that is merely &quot;as good as dead&quot;. So we have to assume that the Curse also damps the life force somehow... but we can assume that it did not do so in DH:35 primarily because Voldemort was not the master of the Wand. (Otherwise, Voldemort would have died in the Forest from that spell rebound.) So, the Curse separated Harry's soul, with its rider, from his body. The soul fragment, separated from Harry by the shock, would likely have tried to return to Voldemort's soul and reattach, and been rebuffed; and then would have evaporated, as the other Horcrux soul fragments apparently did.

It is almost certain that the magic that was used to make a Horcrux out of Nagini was the same as the magic that was used to make the other Horcruxes, in which case the soul fragment would be bound, not to Nagini's reptilian soul but to her body, and as such it would have remained intact despite Nagini's death, bound to her remains. Of course, the fact that she was killed with the Sword of Gryffindor, and its Basilisk-venom infusion, will have put an end to the Horcrux.

So, I speculate thusly: A soul fragment bound to an object, a Horcrux, is proof against ordinary magic, even magic as strong as that produced by an extraordinary wand. (At least, evidence is that Dumbledore believed so, and we have seen nothing against that.) The soul fragment within Harry is not actually bound to him, but is merely clinging to his soul, and as such is only as strong as Harry himself; if the host dies, the soul fragment is detached and vanishes.

You seem to keep altering text to indicate that the shard of Voldemort's soul is actually within Harry's scar. Do you have authority for that?

== Possible new books... ==

Frankly, I must confess that I am not entirely pleased at the thought of more HP books. Yeah, I know that Rowling feels she has lost something with the end of the books; it is actually possible that she feels it almost as the loss of a friend, as do many readers. But one of the big things about the series was that it was complete in itself; it has a clear beginning, middle, and end, with the tasks set to our hero being scaled appropriately: saving himself, saving his friends, saving the world, in that order. In my opinion, Harry's story is told; and if JKR goes on and writes yet more in that story, one would certainly wonder if she were falling victim to the lure of the almighty pound.

Now, on the other hand, if she wanted to tell some of Albus Severus', James Sirius', or James' stories, that would be a different kettle of fish. It would, of course, still be seen in certain quarters as falling prey to capitalism; it would be derivative, probably, though arguably less so than fanfic; but it would not be trying to bolt new content onto a completed story.

:I guess I'm a bit jaded... but then I'm allowed to be, I'm an old guy. But I have seen far too many cases where someone wrote a story, and then was compelled for one reason or another to revisit the story, and the results have been... less than satisfactory. Case in point: ''The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever''. When that story arc was done, it should have bloody well been done; the ''Second Chronicles'' were a serious disappointment, as in order to make it work, the author had to jettison all the character development of the main character that had occurred in the first series. And similarly, Kurtz' Deryni series, which started strong but suddenly weakened with the second trilogy. Or Piers Anthony's Apprentice Adept trilogy... and the second trilogy (shudder). Or the two or three books that supposedly rounded out Anthony's five-book Incarnations of Immortality. I would hold up the ''Silmarillion'' as a classic bad example, but it is suggested that Tolkien would never have published that; it was his own internal reference. C. S. Lewis said that seven books is enough for any adventure, which is why he destroyed Narnia in the seventh book; HP is complete in seven books also, and while it could, in theory, be revisited, I cannot believe that adventures of a grown-up Harry would be as entertaining as what we have read. I greatly fear that if Rowling revisits, people will be disappointed, and it will weaken the entire series as a consequence. If she does return to the Wizarding world, the only way she could make it work would be with a separate series of adventures. Dumbledore and Grindelwald, for instance; perhaps Dumbledore also had a hero, and we could have an epic story out of him? Harry's father's demise was just too ignoble to make a good story, but there is possibility in Harry's children still...

== HP Exhibit ==

Raven, I knew about the traveling exhibit — there's a lot of discussion of it on one of the sites I visit — but I can't quite justify the three hour drive each way unless I can get one of the other family members interested. And so far, no such luck on that. Do keep me posted; if it's worth looking at, I might just be able to swing it... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:32, 22 October 2010 (UTC)
:October 31st is a big day in the series, at least the first four. Lily and James' murders, the Troll in the dungeons and the formation of the Trio, Nearly Headless Nick's deathday, the Petrification of Mrs. Norris, Sirius Black's first attempt to break into Gryffindor Tower, and Harry's being made fourth Triwizard champion. I would hope they commemorate it somehow... The timing of the train is a little inconvenient for me, as it seems to require an overnight stay in Seattle; possibly two overnights, as last time I checked (granted, about a decade ago) it ran Seattle to Vancouver in the morning, and Vancouver to Seattle in the evening. So I'd have to run down, overnight, visit the exhibition, hang around Seattle all day, overnight again, and back in the morning. Might well be simpler to drive... And it was [http://www.mugglenet.com Mugglenet] where I read about the exhibit. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:51, 22 October 2010 (UTC)

== Harry's relationships ==

Just a quick note... I removed the line about Harry becoming brother / sister in law to Hermione. I have been told that the in-law relation is only valid through one marriage, not two, so while Ginny and Hermione will be in-laws, and Ron and Harry will be, Harry and Hermione will not... But that's just a quibble. The rest of that looks very well thought out. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:18, 8 November 2010 (UTC)

== Dumbledore and the soul shard ==

That is a very good question.

In DH:33, we learn that Dumbledore was sure of the existence of the soul shard, had been since the before the overheard conversation in March of HBP. (The conversation in question, where Snape produces a Patronus, occurs the evening after the conversation overheard by Hagrid and discussed with Harry and Hermione as they leave the Hospital Wing after Ron's birthday accident.) At that time, he is aware that Harry's connection with Voldemort and his parseltongue ability are due to that shard. You will note that he never uses the word &quot;Horcrux&quot; in that conversation; this is an argument that what is riding Harry is not a Horcrux, rather just an attached bit of soul, as I had surmised earlier.

So how far back can we take it? Certainly as far as Christmas in OotP. The telling point there is that Dumbledore asks what Harry's viewpoint is, and does not seem surprised to learn that it was through the snake's eyes that Harry witnessed the attack on Arthur. (The author has indicated, though she has not said outright, that the machine producing the snake-like coils of green smoke is indicating the dual-intelligence nature of Nagini, either Nagini and Horcrux in Nagini, or Voldemort in Voldemort and Horcrux. She has not been specific.) This, for Dumbledore, would have been confirmation of two soul shards: the Horcrux in Nagini and the shard in Harry, and would have been explanation for the abilities that Harry had shown, and the communications channel.

So when did Dumbledore really know? The appearance of Voldemort riding Quirrell in PS would have told Dumbledore that Voldemort knew how to make Horcruxes and had done so. The diary in CoS indicated that Voldy had made at least two. I suspect that it was over the summer that Dumbledore put two and two together, recognizing that if he had made two, Voldy's soul would be frayed enough that a chunk could shear off at his disembodiment, and if it then attached to the last living being in the house, it would have ended up riding Harry, thus explaining, in particular, how a wizard with no bloodline back to Slytherin could speak to snakes. I suspect that Dumbledore was reasonably sure of its existence through most of PoA and GoF, but did not concern himself with it overly until Voldy re-embodied at the end of GoF.

I believe that Dumbledore knew, from the beginning, that Harry would have to fight Voldy, based on the prophecy. I do not think that Dumbledore initially thought Harry had to die because of that. I suspect that, after the end of CoS, he believed that Harry would die in the encounter; but when he learns Voldy used Harry's blood in his re-embodiment at the end of GoF, Dumbledore believed that Harry could not be killed by Voldy. Again, it is necessary to be careful with wording; in DH:33 Dumbledore says that Harry will &quot;set out to meet his death&quot;, but he neither says that Voldemort will kill him, nor that he will die. It is Snape who says that Harry must die. Dumbledore, at this point, knows that Harry must be hit with a spell hard enough to destroy or at least detach the soul fragment, and insists that it must be done by Voldemort only because Harry is to some extent safe from Voldemort. If anyone else was to kill Harry, it would destroy the soul fragment, but if Voldy does it, Harry is likely to survive the experience.

So: to restate. Dumbledore knows that there is at least one Horcrux by the end of PS. By the end of CoS he knows that there are at least two, and suspects the soul shard in Harry. His belief in the soul shard is firmed up by events in GoF, and he is quite sure of its existence by Christmas in OotP. Dumbledore always knew Harry and Voldy would have to fight, but was never sure of the outcome until the end of GoF, where he learned that Voldy had taken Harry's blood and thus extended Harry's protection. At that point, he knew that despite Harry's vulnerability to any and all other wizards, Voldemort alone could never kill him, unless Harry allowed it. I suspect that knowing this, Dumbledore started a campaign, with Snape's assistance almost certainly, to convince Voldemort that he had to fight Harry directly. Dumbledore's program of strengthening and training Harry was specifically to make him less vulnerable to other chance encounters, and to give him the confidence in himself that would be required to allow him to face Voldemort.

Clear as mud?

I note that since 13 November, you have trimmed Dumbledore's entry from 144,000 characters to 103,300, a 28% decrease in length. After working so hard to get him slimmed down, are you sure you want him to bulk up again? &lt;grin&gt; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:34, 28 November 2010 (UTC)

:Actually, Dumbledore is a very straightforward character... he sees his course, he acts upon it, and he is pretty much unchanged, except for a certain sense of urgency in HBP, throughout the series. But he does play his cards exceedingly close to the vest. Which means there is a lot of work for those of us trying to analyze him: we have to figure out what he knew and when, in order to show why he did things.

:For complex characters, nobody in the book matches Severus Snape. That analysis is going to be a real pain to write...

:I... hesitate to admit it, but I have not yet even seen HBP. I don't know why not; I did offer to take my kids to see it, but they weren't interested, so I didn't make time. So before I can see DH1, I have to find a copy of HBP and make time to watch it. Life gets complicated sometimes...

Of course, I would also be getting the ultimate versions of all eight, over time... and I'd need to get a blu-ray DVD player as well, and maybe an HDTV, or at least monitor. But that's for another time... sometime when I have money, and time, to burn.

== Caps ==

Raven, I hope you'll excuse me for asking what may be a silly question, but... should we standardize on a capitalization for Wizard and Wizarding? Reason I ask is that in DH:20 and DH:21 you've just taken the initial capitalization off those words, while in a lot of other places I saw that you had put it on. It makes little difference to me which it is, but we should decide whether those are properly capitalized or not, and then stick to it, so we don't have edit wars over that sort of trivia... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:29, 6 December 2010 (UTC)
:Okay; we'll go in that direction. I seem to recall that Wizarding was capitalized in PS, though wizard was not except in titles (Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry); my arguably fading recollection was that it was not capitalized after that. Then again, once we get into CoS there isn't much call for it; Harry thinks about his friends, rather than about the Wizarding world. My inclination, actually, would be to capitalize Wizarding and leave wizard lower case throughout, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to dredge up anything resembling a reason for that. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:29, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

== Nagini is not a Basilisk ==

... is the short answer, but not the complete one.

Nagini, large and dangerous as she is, is only a snake, albeit a venomous one; probably something exotic, as her venom is one of the things that is used to keep &quot;baby Voldy&quot; alive. That said: we know that if Nagini had bitten Harry with venom, he would have died almost instantly, as Snape did. So Nagini must have simply bitten Harry. Why she did this is simple: one of the things Harry hears in his mind is Voldemort's instructions to Nagini to hold Harry, rather than killing him. Which Nagini then tries to do.

We've already learned that Dittany is a potent healing substance -- I'm reluctant to call it a potion, it may be a simple extract of the plant, or may be treated magically in some way to enhance its healing effect. I don't believe it would be good against Basilisk venom; the way the Trio are sprinkling Dittany around in DH, it is far too common a curative to be considered &quot;uncommon magic&quot;, and if it could cure Basilisk venom, surely the diary Horcrux would have been able to Summon some to heal itself with. In fact, I don't believe Dittany would have healed Harry if Nagini had envenomed him; I believe he would have been dead before Hermione reached the door. So Nagini was following instructions; and the Dittany was used to heal the un-envenomed puncture wounds, at which it no doubt excelled... though traces of venom likely caused some scarring. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:14, 14 December 2010 (UTC)

:I must admit that it would seem more like Voldemort to have a basilisk, but it would also be far more dangerous, as of course basilisks also kill with their stare... and Malfoy Manor would be littered with dead Death Eaters who happened to glance at her. But no... it's only in CoS that we see a basilisk, and even there it is kept locked up almost all the time, even though it is nominally under Riddle's control.

== The Twins and time travel ==

You recently restored some text indicating a possibility that the Twins could perhaps travel in time. I think I have to react with extreme skepticism... because if they could, why would they have bet with Bagman? Within 24 hours after they had won, their money would have disappeared; surely they could have gone back in time to warn themselves. Additionally, there is the fact that Hermione never did go forward in time, only backward; it seems that there is a limitation there, and it seems to me a natural one, that you cannot go forward, because the future has not yet occurred and so you don't have a target to aim at.

However. More to the point: The twins made some very bad decisions, decisions that could have been avoided if they had time travel, and the fact that they made those decisions indicates that they didn't know what was going to happen. I tend to believe that the accuracy of the Twins' wager was more due to attentive following of the sport and the players, and a view of the players' capabilities unbiased by team or national loyalty. It is only just possible that they had found some technique for clairvoyance, and the reason they did not see Bagman's defection or Fred's death was because they were not looking for it. But it is pretty much impossible, in my opinion, that we will ever see Fred again.

If you want to leave that text standing, or modify it to include my thoughts, be my guest... I will even go through and add the links later. But my immediate thought is that it does not belong because it is just too far out in left field to even qualify as speculation. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:01, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

:I certainly did not appreciate having someone anonymously deleting my text as &quot;nonsense&quot; and without discussing it with me. The Twins time traveling is hardly &quot;out in left field&quot; as we have seen characters do just that. I came across several online comments by readers several years ago on the possibility that the Twins could have used this method to determine the Match's outcome. It seemed plausible to me (more likely than having found a clairvoyance technique), and led to my speculation that George would consider using it again to save Fred. He would, in fact, do anything to save his brother. I also read speculation on the Harry Potter WIKI that both Bill Weasley and Percy Weasley could have used a Time Turner to achieve so many OWLs while studying at Hogwarts. If that is true,then maybe the Twins &quot;borrowed&quot; it from Percy at some point while he was still at Hogwarts and were unable to access it later to go back and change their resulting losses. Regardless, it is reasonable they could have time traveled, and it could be endlessly speculated about other ways they obtained the results to no point and with less proof. 

:Also, saying that it is not possible to go forward in time based on Hermione only being seen going back is without merit. Hermione would have been under strict restrictions on how she was to use the Time Turner and may have only been allowed to use it one way, or she simply chose not to go forward in time, only back (being as she is a creature of habit). We simply don't know. I wrote the section as an intersting speculation based on what we've seen the characters are capable of doing in the series, and on how Rowling plants clues long before they are explained. George's missing ear also seemed a little too obvious to me as a means to tell the two apart. Just how all this would happen, if it was included in a future book, is up to the author, I'm just saying it is possible, and of all the characters who were killed or presumed killed, then Fred and Mad Eye Moody seem the only ones who could possibly reappear.

== Trelawney ==

A thought occurred to me... Trelawney's name is one of the few things that are different in the US and UK versions. Everywhere else there has been that sort of difference, we have used the UK variant, but Trelawney's name was apparently grandfathered in with the US spelling. In your opinion, is it worth my walking through the text and correcting it to the UK version? Or am I being exceptionally picky? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:31, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
:So Trelawney is now Sybill throughout. I've left the American spelling in the All Pages list / collection so that if the redirect page is edited, we can still see that; and I'm going to suggest that the redirect page be left as people will try to search on the US spelling. But as far as the visible book goes, it looks like Trelawney is entirely back in the UK... or at least, will be once the print versions of the books are regenerated.

== GoF 14: why does the House-Elf stuff keep moving from GP to Analysis? ==

At least once, I moved the lengthy analysis of Hermione and the House-Elf Liberation Front from Analysis to Greater Picture. The last time I did this, I left the rationale in the edit comment: to wit, that mentioning Dobby in the Analysis was something of a spoiler because we had not yet found that he was working in the kitchens at Hogwarts. Rather than resume a slow-motion edit war, I will quietly request that you edit that section to remove Dobby, or at least the mention of Dobby's being employed by Dumbledore. In order to prevent it from reappearing in the analysis, you could mention Dobby's influence on Hermione and SPEW briefly in GP... but again, I'll let you handle that so as to not appear to be willfully mangling your edits.

:I actually have no memory of this previously being moved, and, honestly, I rarely look at the comments on the history log, or, if I do, it is so long after the fact, I just kind of note it and mentally file it away. I am certainly not engaging in an edit war here. I was rereading the section and it just seemed like there was no reason to have it in the Greater Picture as I didn't think there were any particular spoilers (I had not considered that Dobby's current status was still unknown yet). I can certainly reword it to reflect that. In future, it would be helpful if you would PM me directly about changes like this, as I will certainly take immediate note of it, and I can relate my opinions regarding it.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 22:50, 25 February 2011 (UTC)

== GoF:36: the weaker wizard? ==

I am prepared to be overruled on this, but my recollection is that in his office, telling Harry about the Priori Incantatem effect, Dumbledore never implies that it is the weaker wizard's wand that is forced to disgorge the last few spells it cast. While he does state that, it isn't until DH:35. I believe that if Dumbledore had said, or even implied, that Voldemort was the weaker wizard at that point, Harry would have been astonished, and his reaction would have made the scene more memorable. I have corrected the text to say &quot;one wizard&quot;, rather than &quot;the weaker wizard&quot;. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:46, 16 March 2011 (UTC)

:::I didn't view it as anything that Harry was or wasn't told by Dumbledore, but only what can be seen from our vantage point.

::::I absolutely agree. When I first read the scene with the beads being forced back on to Voldemort, it took me aback because, as a reader, I had been conditioned to that point to think that Dumbledore, &quot;the only one he ever feared&quot;, was the only wizard stronger than Voldy. When Dumbledore later did not comment on that, I held it in reserve, not knowing whether it was a one-time thing, whether Harry would normally be stronger than Voldemort or whether it was only because he was weak from being recently re-embodied. I think I mention in GP that Harry's being stronger in this instance is a thing that the reader observes, and Harry doesn't. 
::::Your original wording had it as part of Dumbledore's explanation to Harry about what the Priori Incantatem effect was, which was not quite true to canon, and if it had been, would have led to much more reaction from Harry than we have seen, because his conditioning regarding Voldy's strength would have been even stronger than ours. I believe Harry's being told he was stronger would have led possibly to overconfidence on Harry's part if he accepted Dumbledore's statement, or to a weakening of the bond between Harry and Dumbledore if he rejected it and thus assumed Dumbledore was getting old and &quot;barmy&quot;.

== DH:18 minor spoiler ==

Raven, while I understand your intent, to give more of an overview or overhead view, when writing the analysis and summary I believe we had decided to avoid, or try to avoid, mentioning things that the protagonists were not yet aware of. In that light, I have to ask you to back out your edits from the analysis in DH:18... at least to the extent of removing mention of the Hallows. Neither Harry nor Hermione has heard that term yet... that doesn't happen until a few days hence, when Xeno mentions it.

== Bellatrix ==

It looks like we're getting into an edit war, again, as I just changed this, and you seem to have changed it back... Bellatrix is deathly afraid that the Sword of Gryffindor is real, because she believes the real one was in her vault, and if what she sees before her is real, her vault has been broken into. If she is, as you say, afraid that the Sword is not what it appears to be, why does she relax and allow Voldemort to be called once Griphook says it is fake? The fact that the sword in her vault was fake when it was placed there is not known to her... so she is most afraid that the Sword is what it seems to be. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:10, 1 July 2011 (UTC)

:Oh, sorry, I was misreading that. Go ahead and change it back.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 00:15, 1 July 2011 (UTC)

::Like so? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:19, 1 July 2011 (UTC)

== Recent big edits ==

Raven, a few months back I noticed that you were doing relatively large edits of the chapters in MG, excising hundreds of words at a crack, and I stopped following up, because I guessed that any clean-up would be useless if you were going to visit the next day and repeat the process. Are you pretty much finished with that? If so, I'll start going back through and checking grammar and confirming nothing major has been mistakenly pulled... if not, I'll wait until you give me the go-ahead. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:23, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

:I'm still working on it. I've been concentrating on character pages. As all the book synopsis are now so detailed, I've been streamlining the plot reviews on the character pages, as it was redundant. I still check back to the books and tweak them as needed. I think &quot;Voldemort&quot; and &quot;Neville&quot; are pretty much done, at least for now. &quot;Dumbledore&quot; is probably next, then &quot;Snape.&quot;

:Also, did you sign up for Pottermore? I got an early registration, but they don't start letting people in until mid-August, and will do so in batches. I made it on Day 5, so I'm assuming they will go by order of the days people registered. Can't wait![[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 14:29, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

::Unfortunately, I was never near my machine when the Pottermore beta windows opened. So while I'm aware of it, I will have to wait until general availability in October... My understanding is that it's actually a random selection from all people who managed to get a Quill, so you could get your invitation tomorrow. I'm a little curious as to how Pottermore will affect MG, to tell the truth. Does it become part of canon? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:11, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

:::That's an interesting point as to how Pottermore could affect MG. I guess we'll have to see how that unfolds. I was quite surprised to get registered. I had been trying unsuccessfully, and took a chance to look while I was a work on Day 5, and there it was! I had to dive into the filing cabinet to get my purse to get a calculator so I could solve the riddle and then find the quill. I was in a panic the whole time, as I didn't want my boss coming by just then (oops, he just now came by was I am writing this, but didn't notice what I was up to). Well, the general registration will soon be open. I'll let you know what I think about it.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 18:18, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 Proposal :Accelerating Wikibooks. Help Needed! ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

== Pottermore as a source ==

Raven, it's hard for me to have an opinion about Pottermore, as I did not get a beta invite, and so I have no real idea what's on there. My opinion, for what little it's worth, is that so long as Pottermore content originates with Jo, we can consider it as a part of canon, we may be able to include it. The additions to the overview on Ollivander certainly don't hurt. However, we must always keep in mind that the idea of the project is HP as a literary work; while introducing background information on characters derived from sources like Pottermore can provide insight into motivations and character behaviour, and similar sorts of background on places and events can be helpful in understanding, it is the literary work, the main seven books, and why they are literature that should remain our focus. Anyone can write a simple catalog of the Potterverse; we are still trying at least to do more than that, to show why it has become worthy of so much attention. At least, in my not-so-humble opinion. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:09, 27 September 2011 (UTC)
:Looks like people are now importing Pottermore information: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Deathly_Hallows/Chapter_4&amp;curid=128836&amp;diff=2362408&amp;oldid=2306777 this edit] comes from an IP editor. In my opinion, it doesn't belong, as it does not enhance the Guide as an analysis of the literary side of HP, and additionally directly contradicts something Ollivander says in DH... but I'm beginning to think that my vision, and Matt's before mine, of what the MG is supposed to be is now no longer operative. Would you be so kind as to add an opinion? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:11, 11 June 2012 (UTC)

Well, I'm not happy about that at all. As I discussed with you sometime earlier, some static information, IMHO, from Pottermore is fine, but I really just wanted to stick to statistical information or minimal background info (such as with McGonagall's earlier life) to round out the character pages and other sections, not &quot;bulk up&quot; the chapter synopsis and analysis sections with &quot;added on&quot; trivial details that, as you say, is in opposition to what is in the books. I vote for deleting it, because, as you mentioned, it contradicts what's in the book and, it just adds unnecessary and confusing detail. Has there been a lot of new editors coming in or is this pretty isolated?[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 22:23, 13 June 2012 (UTC)
:I'll back that one out, then; we seem to be in agreement. So far, it's been pretty isolated... this is the only one recently. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/All_pages This link] is what I usually use to see changes to the book; and as you can see there's not a huge amount more than usual going on. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:36, 13 June 2012 (UTC)

== Fleur Delacour ==

Raven, with all due humility, could I ask you to back out the edits on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]? Her Veela ancestry does constitute a bit of a spoiler... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:49, 28 September 2011 (UTC)
:OK, I can modify it. I do want to include what her wand is.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 11:24, 28 September 2011 (UTC)

== Possible new section: connections ==

Raven, I'm thinking of putting in an optional subsection of the Greater Pictures section for book chapters, to be titled Connections. This would specifically call out items in the chapter that are connected to events earlier or later in the story. For instance, the chapter in PS that has Harry catching the Snitch in his mouth would have links forward to DH where the secret within the Snitch is first suggested and then later revealed. Moody's use of the &quot;Put-Outer&quot; in OotP would be linked back to PS:1 where we first see it, and to the chapters in DH where it is given to Ron, where it leads him back to Harry and Hermione, and where he uses it to help escape from the cellar in Malfoy Manor. I'll be going through the chapters in a while to try and bring them all up to standard, and would be adding that as I go. Any thoughts? Good idea? Bad idea? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:32, 14 May 2012 (UTC)
:Well, I'm glad you're glad I'm working... but I never really left. I did cut back a lot, and I will not be able to put as much time in as I once did. But I have been working in small ways all along... lately I've been working my way through Major Events, bringing them up to standard and adding a few, one editor suggested adding Voldy's first downfall, and the visits to Godric's Hollow and Xeno as major events, so I've done that. I've kept resolutely out of the chapter summaries of late, as you seemed to be whipping back and forth across them at a substantial rate and I was never sure whether you were finished (mostly) with a book, or whether we'd end up in an edit war. If you're OK with my methodical progression through the books, I'll start on that update as soon as I have finished wit the Major Events sections.
:Oh, and congratulations on finding full-time work! In this economy that's not a small achievement... and if it has been a while since you worked full time, it can be an adjustment. Been there (not from choice), done that... but better now. And I've just graduated a son from post-secondary school &amp;mdash; he's a trained video editor now.

:::Great. You're making good progress. I look forward to seeing the connections, once you get them strung together. I'm working on chapter analysis, trying to improve continuity. It just seems like there's many good comments, but often seem just tossed in and not quite at the right place (by order of relevance or importance.

::::So, I think that's all the Connections sections in PS. I'm not happy about the analysis in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|PS:17]], seems very ragged to me and actually inaccurate -- Voldy doesn't care about Machiavelli's facade of morality, we can see in DH that he believes power is sufficient -- and there is some stuff in there that constitutes minor spoilers.

== Oh, dear... ==

There are rumours now of a new three-book series to be set in the Potter universe... wonder if the quality will be as good. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:58, 22 May 2012 (UTC)
:Never mind... apparently it's a three-volume boxed set of hardcover editions of ''Quidditch Through the Ages'', ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', and ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. Nothing we don't already know about. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:01, 23 May 2012 (UTC)
::Well, I'm rather disappointed. I want more Harry Potter! I never saw any reason for her to stop just because Voldy is dead, and I'd love to synthesize/analyze some new HP material on Wikibooks. Maybe she's afraid she can't maintain the quality. Oh well. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 20:26, 24 May 2012 (UTC)

== New &quot;character&quot; added... ==

A nameless editor added Binky, Lavender's pet bunny. Your opinion: keep or revert? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:34, 17 June 2012 (UTC)
:Oh good grief! What next? Unless Binky talks, is magical, or is in some way sentient and/or plays any kind of significant role in the series, then it should probably be reverted. I can't see including sub-minor, miscellaneous pets, particularly ones that are only mentioned in passing. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 14:53, 17 June 2012 (UTC)
::Now reverted. The only reason I even thought about keeping it is that Binky has about as much play as some of the minor characters we have kept -- people who are seen at their Sorting, and never again. But they at least have the advantage of being sentient, where Binky is just a bunny, as far as we are told. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:57, 17 June 2012 (UTC)
:::If Binky had actually been at Hogwarts with Lavender or was seen elsewhere in the story, then I'd think it might be worthwhile having him/her listed. Otherwise, it seems just insignificant enough to not include it. However, after having read the Binky entry, I wouldn't have objected if you had wanted to leave it.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 02:02, 18 June 2012 (UTC)
::::My feeling is that we are writing a work that casts light on the literary merits of the series, rather than a simple encyclopedia. For an encyclopedia, Binky would be valid; but for the actual works, Binky is not a character, but an effect. And as such, my feeling is that he does not merit inclusion as a character... But I'm wondering just how relevant my ideas are to the direction the book seems to be taking. We do seem to keep getting encyclopedia-type entries appearing, like this one... not often, only one a month or so at the moment, but I suspect that with the resurgence in popularity triggered by Pottermore, we may see more of that... and I'm not sure that the vision I have is relevant any more. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:42, 18 June 2012 (UTC)
I think the core of the book remains the same--a reader's guide to an in-depth understanding of the series as a whole, as well as to the character's and their motives. I think most works like this often have a small part that is &quot;encyclopedic&quot;  or perhaps more accurately, a &quot;glossary.&quot; And while ours does seem to contain that, I see it as being incidental to and separate from the original vision. Having factual information can surely help the reader, without taking away from our mission. However, I agree we don't need to add such minor trivial items like Binky. The Harry Potter Lexicon is more suitable for that. I say let's keep removing this type of stuff.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PNW Raven|contribs]]) 18:10, 20 June 2012 (UTC)

== Connections redux ==

Good to see you back again!

Just thought I'd mention that the connections are slow going; I've gotten up to about GoF:29 on them, if you wanted to take a look and comment / criticize... plus they are not complete, even now. I just had to go back and tweak connections in PS:8, because of the connection with an eagle owl in GoF:29, I think.

Speaking of which: Harry, at one point, is lying on the grass outside the school and sees an eagle owl fly towards the school, loop around the Owlery, and fly away. Do you happen to remember what book that's in? I'm thinking possibly PS:17, but I haven't found it yet... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:20, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

:Hi, Chazz! I hope all is well in your neck of the woods. I was hoping you were still around. Well, I never really left here and I keep checking from time-to-time. I have been busy writing a novel (when I'm not working)!!  Really! I hope to have it finished in another year. I have 13 chapters (out of 20) done so far. That will be the rough draft. Then I'll do a rewrite and have it edited. I'll let you know when it's finished. I'm going to publish it online (Amazon Kindle and others). It's young adult fantasy and in similar universe as HP (of course) but very different. I'll keep you posted.

:I do remember about Harry lying on the grass outside, but not which book. Seems like it was one of the earlier ones. If I can find out, I'll let you know. I think your &quot;connections&quot; are brilliant. Keep up the good work. --PNW Raven

::There is not much chance that I'm better at literary analysis than you are, but if you want me to cast a jaded eye across your novel before it goes live, you have but to ask...

::It's been some hectic up here. I haven't really had a weekend for the past month or more... but I suppose that's all to the good, I get to invoice more. We're still here, still doing OK... though ChazzJr seems to have given up on his literary work. A shame, that. And how are things going with you, then? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Everything is going okay, for the most part. I hate my job, and I can't wait to retire, and I'm working toward that end, saving as much as I can. I'm giving it another two-and-a-half years. I work on the novel in the morning hours, getting a few hours in a day. I hope Chazz Jr. is able to get back to his literary work, if that is what he truly wants to do. I had always wanted to write a book, so I figured I'd better get going. Actually, it's a trilogy, so a lot of work ahead. Hopefully a few people will read it. It's good that there's alternative options for writers. I'll still be working on Muggles Guide, too. It's definitely my place to go to get away from it all. 

Oh boy, I've forgotten how to put a &quot;signature&quot; at the end of these posts so it dates it and creates a link with your name . . . How do you do that? --Raye

:It's never fun being in a job you don't like, just for a paycheck and a pension... I guess I'm just lucky. Sort of. Problem is that mine is the sort of job where you don't really get time off... so long as I keep enjoying it, I'll have work. As to the book: I have just recently read and critiqued another YA novel; it was pretty dreadful, I ended up giving the author about ten pages of recommendations, and I have heard that they were pretty valuable. i haven't yet seen the end result, though... apparently I set him a pretty tough course of work. I would be remiss if I were to not offer you the same service.

:ChazzJr seems to feel his metier lies in professional wrestling, which he knows is fake: he has enough training in the field to recognize not only the fakeness but the skill involved in making the fakery. He is currently working on getting the necessary body strength and ability to go in that direction. We'll see how that turns out...

:The signature mark is four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Forgetting that doesn't seem to hinder your other Wiki work, though... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:26, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Climate is commonly considered to be &quot;''the weather averaged over a long period of time, typically 30 years''&quot;. The concept of &quot;climate&quot; includes the statistics of the weather—such as the degree of day-to-day or year-to-year variation.&quot;{{ref|climate}}

Climate is variable across the globe; it is affected by landscape, relief, and activities (both human and physical). There are also microclimates.  These are areas within a climatic region that can vary (e.g. top of hill, sunny side of hill, shaded side of hill, bottom of the hill, etc.). Climate is  variable across time, including deep time. 

It is important to note that weather is not the same as climate. Weather is the state of conditions at a certain point in time, as opposed to climate which covers  a longer period of time. The different parts of the weather include: temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity.

The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called meteorology. People who study weather and climate are known as meteorologists.

==Temperature==
Temperature is the measure of how hot or cold the air is. It is commonly measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Temperature is a very important factor in determining the weather, because it influences other elements of the weather. 

Temperature may be affected by:

*Sunshine
*Latitude
*Altitude
*Aspect
*Sea Proximity and Temperature
*Ocean Currents

====Sunshine====
The amount of sunshine at a certain place can influence its temperature. The amount of sunshine can be measured in sunshine hours. That is worked out by the number of hours of daylight and how many of these are cloud free. Sunshine is variable due to daylight hours as during the night there is no sunshine as the Earth is pointing away from the sun at the given spot. Also due to the Earth's tilt some times of the year have more sunshine (summer) and some less (winter).

====Latitude====
Latitude is the distance of a location from the equator. The hottest temperatures on Earth are found near the equator. This is because the sun shines directly on it for more hours during the year than anywhere else. As you move further away from the equator towards the poles, less sun is received during the year and the temperature become colder.

====Altitude====
Altitude is the height you are above sea level. The higher up you are the lower the temperature will be. This is because air that is higher up is less dense than it is at lower altitudes and air temperature depends on its density. As a general rule for every 1,000m higher you go the temperature will drop by 6.5 °C.

====Aspect====
Aspect is the direction in which you are facing. So if you are facing towards the equator then the temperature will be warmer than facing away. Therefore in the Northern Hemisphere if you wanted to lie in the sun on a hillside you would do so on the south facing slope (if you were in the Southern Hemisphere it would be the North Facing Slope).

====Sea Proximity and Temperature====
Sea temperature changes slower than land temperature. If the temperature on land drops then the area next to the sea will be kept warmer for longer than areas inland. Islands therefore have a less dramatic climate than continents. Different seas have different temperatures therefore allowing one side of an island to be a different temperature to the other side.

====Ocean Currents====
Currents are driven by the prevailing winds passing over the surface of the ocean. Therefore winds blowing from tropical areas bring warm currents and vice versa.

==Humidity==
Humidity is the level of water in the air, the more water vapour in the air the higher the humidity. If the humidity level exceeds the amount of water air can hold condensation occurs forming dew if it's warm or frost if it's cold. When air is at a high altitude and has a high humidity then clouds start to form. Humidity varies with temperature. Warmer air can hold more moisture. Humidity is measured in percentages on the scale of air's ability to hold moisture. Therefore condensation occurs at 100% humidity for a given temperature thus reducing the humidity again.

==Precipitation==
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. Precipitation can be snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, mist and rain. The water cycle drives the water from the oceans/seas on-shore were it falls as precipitation and then flows via rivers back in to the sea.

====Types of Rainfall====
[[Image:Konvektionsregen.jpg‎ |200px|thumb|left|Convectional Rainfall]]
*'''Convectional Rainfall'''

This is where a water surface is heated by the sun, e.g. the sea. The air above the sea then becomes heated making the air less dense so it rises and cools. As we know cooler air can not hold as much water vapour as warm air therefore when the rising air becomes too cold to hold the moisture the condensation occurs giving us clouds. Once there is too much water in the cloud for the air to support gravity forces the water to be released in what we know as rain.

*'''Frontal Rainfall'''

When two air masses met, one is warmer than the other the warmer air is forced to rise over the colder air. As this warm air rises it cools and forms clouds just like the air in convectional rainfall. 

[[Image:Steigungsregen.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Relief Rainfall]]
*'''Relief Rainfall'''

Wind bringing moist air from the seashore starts to rise up a hillside. As this air rises the air passes its Dew Point, the point at which condensation occurs, and the vapour forms clouds. The water vapour then falls as precipitation on top of the hill or on the other side.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

====Cloud Types====
[[Image: Wolkenstockwerke.png|right|thumb|320px|Cloud classification by altitude of occurrence]]

Clouds are split into different groups depending on their height, shape and size. The most common terms are:

*Cirrus - Wispy, white clouds found at high altitudes
*Cumulus - Fluffy or heaped white clouds at relatively low altitudes
*Stratus - Low altitude layered cloud very rarely bringing precipitation
*Nimbus - Rain Clouds
*Cirro - High Altitude Clouds
*Alto - Medium Altitude cloud

The above terms are put together to form names of certain clouds:

*Cumulonimbus - Very large clouds bringing heavy rain, notice how the name comes from cumulus and nimbus above.

==Air Pressure and Wind==
Air pressure is simply the weight of the air above the Earth. Low Pressure is when air is warmer and therefore lighter. High pressure is colder air becoming heavier.

In meteorology pressure is charted on maps with isobars. The higher the number the higher the pressure.

Wind is simply the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure. The speed of the wind is determined by the difference between the high and low pressure. The greater the difference the faster the wind speed. Also the closer the isobars are on a weather chart the stronger the winds.

The wind brings with it the temperature of the area it is coming from, therefore a high pressure in a warm region will make the temperature in the low pressure area higher.

Wind-chill is the effect of the wind making it feel colder than it actually is. As the wind speed increases air is moving more quickly and therefore removes warm air therefore making it seem colder than the actual temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Weather Fronts==

There are three types of weather front:

*'''Warm Front'''

A warm front is warm air moving into an area of cold air this forces the warm air to rise over the cold air. As the warm air lifts into an area of low pressure clouds form as flat sheets

*'''Cold Front'''

A Cold front is cold air moving into an area of warm air. The cold air pushes under the warm air forcing the warm air to rise. The warm air then condenses producing rain.

*'''Occluded Front'''

An occluded front is where two fronts, a warm and a cold meet. If the cold front cuts under the warm front it is known as a cold occlusion. If the cold front rises over the warm one it is known as a warm occlusion. Both types of occluded fronts can bring rain.

==Global Air masses==

Globally there are very large areas of high and low pressures. The form bands around the Earth that are parallel with the line of latitude. At the equator (0°) there is a low pressure band with two more, one near the Arctic (60° North) and one near the Antarctic (60° South). Between the low pressure lie high pressure belts one at 30° North and one at 30° South, just north and south of the tropical latitudes.

As air moves from high to low pressures it produces the global prevailing winds, known as trade winds. The trade winds are strongest between the high and low pressures with wind speeds relatively low at the pressure belts.

The trade winds do not blow in a straight line towards the poles as they are blown of course by the spinning of the Earth. In the northern hemisphere the winds are blown to the right and to the left in the southern hemisphere. Therefore making prevailing winds mainly south westerly in the North.

===Atmospheric circulation===
The low pressure area at the equator is the driving force for the whole current system of the Earth. As warm air rises at this low pressure area it cools and condenses forming clouds and precipitation. The low pressure then takes cold air from the north and south to replace the rising air. This cold air is then itself heated pushing the now dry warm air further north and south. This dry air starts to sink back to Earth at the tropics creating the High Pressure areas. This falling dry air makes the areas have a much drier climate forming deserts and savannas.

This dry air is then sucked back towards the equator where the process is repeated. The areas where this cycles of winds happen is known as the Hadley Cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recording The Weather==

Weather conditions are measured at weather stations. These stations contain a variety of instruments to record weather data.

The most important instruments of a weather station are:

*'''Hydrometer''' - Are a special type of thermometer that measures the humidity by calculating the water vapour in the air.
[[Image:Standard_rain_Guage.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Standard Rain Gauge]]
*'''Rain Gauge''' - This is a container that collects precipitation and measured it in millimeters (mm).

*'''Barometer''' - These instruments measures the air pressure. They may be either mercury or aneroid (vacuum) barometers. Often they are attached to a pen that charts movements in pressure on a piece of paper. The resulting chart is called a barograph.
[[Image:Heliograph wendelstein 2002 00a.jpg|thumb|left|sunshine recorder]]
*'''Sunshine Recorder''' - The recorder is a chart which has the sun's rays focused onto it using a magnifying glass so it ''burns'' a record of the hours the sun shone.

*'''Maximum and minimum thermometers''' measure the highest and lowest temperature in degrees Celsius.

*'''Wind Vanes''' show the direction of the wind.

*'''Anemometers''' are used to measure wind speeds, usually in km/h. The wind is caught in small cups and the speed is calculated by measuring how fast the cups rotate.

===Clouds===

Recording cloud type and cloud-cover is done manually, using the naked eye. Meteorologists measure cloud-cover in eighths of the sky or oktas.

* 0 oktas = a completely cloudless sky
* 4 oktas = half the sky is covered in clouds
* 8 oktas = the sky is fully clouded-over

==Mapping weather==

The internationally agreed way in which to map the weather is by using synoptic charts. Data is collected across a large area from weather stations, balloons, ships, aeroplanes, and satellites. Informations on a synoptic chart is updated at least every six hours.
The following information is displayed on a synoptic chart:
*temperature
*precipitation
*atmospheric pressure
*wind speed
*direction
*cloud coverage

&lt;!-- The following symbols are used to chart the conditions: --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Global Climate Zones'''== 
Different forests of the world experience different climatic conditions. 

A forests climate influences the types of vegetation and animals that live there.  It is therefore possible to divide the world into a number of climatic zones each with its own characteristic climate, vegetation and wildlife.

* Tropical forests are found near the equator in Central America, parts Africa and Asia. They are very hot and humid and contain a huge variety of plants and animals - round half of all the world's species. Trees are mostly hardwood.

* Temperate deciduous forests contain trees that lose their leaves and are found across Europe and USA.

* Coniferous forests contain pine trees are found further north than deciduous forests, in Scandinavia, Russia and Canada.

* Desert is the driest of areas. The largest expanse of desert is found in North Africa. Areas of scrubland that border the desert are called desert scrub.

* Savannas or tropical grasslands are hot and dry, dominated by grass, scrub and occasional trees. They have two distinct seasons - a dry season when much of the vegetation dies back, and a rainy season when it grows rapidly. Savannas are found in central Africa (Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania), northern Australia and central South America (Venezuela and Brazil).

* Temperate grasslands are areas dominated by grass, where trees and large bushes are scarce. The weather is less harsh than the savannas. Famous grasslands include the Puszta in Hungary, Veldts in South Africa, Pampas in Argentina, and Prairies in USA.

* Mediterranean is a pleasant climate - not too hot or cold. As the name suggests it is found around the Mediterranean Sea and to a lesser extent elsewhere.

* Tundra surrounds the poles. It has an extremely cold climate, with limited numbers of plants and animals.

* Mountain areas can be very cold at night and during winter. The growing season is short and at higher levels trees will not grow.

[[Image:ClimateMapWorld.png|Climatic Zones of the world]]

==Climate Types==
The above climatic zones can be grouped into the following types:

# Tropical
# Monsoon
# Dry
# Warm
# Cool
# Cold

One of the easiest ways to tell these zones apart is to look at the climatic graph - a graph showing the average rainfall (usually shown as a bar graph) and average temperature (usually shown as a line graph) for each month in an average year.

===Tropical===
[[Image:Tropical-area-mactan-philippines.jpg|thumb|A tropical landscape]]

* Generally winds are light, but occasionally tropical winds can be very powerful.
* The tropics lie between the latitudes of the Tropic of Cancer (23°26'22&quot; North of the Equator) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23°26'22&quot; South of the Equator). However tropical climates are also experienced by some regions outside the tropics.

===Monsoon===
* Monsoons occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.
* There are two distinct seasons dry and wet.
* The climate in South-East Asia, India and across the Indian Ocean is dominated by torrential monsoon rains. Monsoons also affect parts of Africa and South America.
* The savannas regions of the world, the most extensive of which are in Africa, also have very pronounced wet and dry seasons. The only difference to the main monsoon areas is that the dry season is longer and the wet season shorter.

===Dry===
[[Image:Morocco Africa Flickr Rosino December 2005 84514010 edited by Buchling.jpg|thumb|A desert landscape]]
*In the dry climatic zone there is little rain - sometimes no rainfall at all. This produces desert or semi-desert regions.
*Desert skies are characterized by bright clear sunny skies, with no sign of cloud formation.
*Deserts are found on every continent except Europe.
*Deserts will spread into neighboring areas of grassland or bush. This may be caused by the climate, perhaps due to lack of rainfall, but it can also be helped along by man, through overgrazing and cultivation. This process is called '''desertification'''.

===Warm===
*The warm climate regions are found north and south of the equator, midway between the areas that have a rainy season and the areas that have a cool climate. They lie in Europe, North America and Asia in the northern hemisphere and parts of Australia, South America and the southern tip of Africa in the southern hemisphere.
*The seasons are of similar lengths. The temperatures are comfortable - not too cold in the winter, not too hot in the summer.
*The precipitation (usually rain) is well-balanced, with slightly more rain during the winter months than the summer months, but no rainy season. In the hottest months, local winds help keep the temperature cool.

===Cool=== 
*This climate covers the northern parts of Europe and America, extending from the warmer climate in the south to the very cold climate of the polar region above. 
*The cool climate zone includes the coniferous forests and parts of the temperate grasslands.
*The winter season will tend to be longer than the summer season, and brings cool winds and regular night-time frosts.

===Cold===
[[Image:Austral-Ice.jpg|thumb|A cold landscape]]
*The cold climate zone lies between the coniferous forests and the poles. It includes the Arctic and Antarctic as well as parts of Russia and Alaska.
*Mountain tops have their own cold climate no matter where they are located. 
*Above the tree line, mountains have a climate similar to that near the poles. At lower altitudes the climate becomes less cold. The foothills may even be sub-tropical.
*There are few summer months. The mean temperature for the year is below 0°C and temperatures will not get higher than 10°C. The ground may remain frozen all year round.
*Precipitation (ice, snow, rain) is fairly low, but balanced throughout the year. Irregular strong winds blow across the barren landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Weather Extremes==

Weather extremes are the point at which the weather can have a dramatic effect on human activity. The extremes covered in this chapter are:

*Hurricanes (also known as tropical storms, cyclones, or typhoons)
*Droughts

==Hurricanes==
[[Image:Cyclone Catarina from the ISS on March 26 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Cyclone Catarina, a South Atlantic tropical cyclone viewed from the International Space Station]]
The strongest tropical storms are called either hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones. The different names mean the same thing, but are used in different parts of the world. The term &quot;hurricane&quot; is used to describe storms in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans.

===How Hurricanes form===

[[Image:Hurricane profile.svg|thumb|250px|right|Tropical cyclones form when the energy released by the condensation of moisture in rising air causes a loop over warm ocean waters.]]

Hurricanes need a lot of heat to form, which is why they usually occur over tropical seas. It works like this:

* Rising warm air rises fast, causing towering clouds, heavy rainfall, and intense low pressure.

* The low pressure sucks in air, causing very strong winds which spiral—clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere or anticlockwise on the Southern Hemisphere—around the centre of the low pressure area, at speeds of around 120 km/h (75 mph).

* Seen from above hurricanes are huge circular bodies of thick cloud around 450 km (300miles) wide. The cloud brings heavy rain, thunder, and lightning.

* In the centre is the eye of the hurricane, about 45 km across (30miles) across. Often there will be no cloud in the eye. Seen from below it will seem calmer, with a circle of blue sky above. The eye is formed because this is the only part of the hurricane where air is sinking.

* In the northern hemisphere, the prevailing easterly tropical winds tend to steer hurricanes toward land - although their course is unpredictable. As they move inshore their power gradually reduces, because their energy comes from sucking up moist sea air.


===Effects of Hurricanes===
The intense winds of tropical storms can destroy whole communities, buildings, and communication networks. As well as their own destructive energy, the winds generate abnormally high waves and tidal surges, which cause flooding in coastal areas. The most destructive elements are the high seas and the flooding that accompany the storms.

==Droughts==

Droughts occur when a long period of abnormally dry weather leads to a severe water shortage. Extreme weather conditions are not the only cause of droughts, however - they are often caused by the activity of man as well. Human activities which can help trigger droughts include:

* Constructing a dam on a large river may help provide electricity and water to irrigate farmland near the reservoir. But it may also cause drought downstream by severely reducing the flow of water.

* Widespread cutting down of trees for fuel reduces the soil's ability to hold water - drying out the ground, triggering desertification, and leading to drought.

===Effects of drought===

* Droughts endanger people's lives and livelihoods through thirst, hunger (due to crops dying from lack of water), and the spread of disease. 

* Millions of people died in the 20th century due to severe drought and famines. One of the worst hit areas was the Sahel region of Africa, covering parts of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the Sudan.

* Droughts and famines can have other geographical impacts - for example, forcing people to migrate to a new home, thus putting pressure on resources in neighboring countries.

==Climate change==

The climate and weather has always affected Humans in the way we live from everyday climates to the extremes mentioned above. Although throughout the 20th and beginning of the 21st century it has become clear that Humans can affect the climate. 


===What is global warming?===

The average temperature of the Earth has fluctuated over the past 10,000 years, but has recently been rising. Global warming refers to this rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. To understand the way in which humans are contributing to global warming we must first understand the Greenhouse effect.
[[Image:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumb|250px|right|A representation of the exchanges of energy between outer space, the Earth's atmosphere, and the Earth surface. The ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by the Earth surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect.]]
The greenhouse effect is greenhouse gases acting like a giant blanket around the Earth. This effect is completely natural and it is what keeps the Earth at a comfortable living temperature. The greenhouse gases in the upper atmosphere helps keep some of the heat reflected by the Earth's surface from escaping into space.

Climatologists believe the way humans affect global climate is by the way humans used the world's resources. The theory is that human activities contribute to global warming through the production of greenhouse gases. The main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases are naturally occurring in atmosphere, but are believed to have increased through burning more fossil fuels, such as oil, petrol, and coal. 

Plants use CO2, but, it is argued that man is producing more carbon dioxide than plants can consume. This balance is not helped by deforestation around the world. The gases encourage the atmosphere to retain more radiation from the sun. This is because less radiation is reflected by the outside of the atmosphere, while less heat is released by the atmosphere into space. This therefore increases the temperature of the Earth.

===Impacts of global warming===

In the last 100 years it is believed that the average temperature of the earth has risen by 0.6°C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8°C, as a result of global warming. There are several possible effects of such a significant increase in atmospheric temperature.

* Sea levels may rise around the globe by as much as a meter over the next hundred years, caused mainly by the melting of ice caps and glaciers. The islands of Tuvalu in the South Pacific are an example of a place which is already being slowly invaded by the sea. The highest part of the islands is only four meter above sea level.

* Extreme weather conditions will become more common. Many scientists argue that global warming is contributing to an increased frequency of droughts and severe storms such as hurricanes. 

* Diseases associated with warm climates - such as malaria - may become prevalent in many more countries.

===Tackling global warming===

International efforts have been made to encourage governments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In Kyoto, Japan in 1997, many governments pledged to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The treaty has not however been signed by the United States, the largest producer of CO2.

Environmental campaigners encourage consumers to boycott businesses and companies who do not act in a sustainable way. Individuals are also encouraged reduce their personal consumption of resources, that contribute to global warming, by driving smaller cars and making the heating in their houses more efficient.

[[Image:Old carving knife and forks.JPG|right|thumb|Carving knife and forks]]

'''Carving knife''' is the term for blades that resemble a [[Cookbook:Chef's Knife|chef's knife]], but may be longer and more slender. It is useful for cutting large samples of poultry and other meats, often used in conjunction with a [[Cookbook:Fork|fork]]. It is important that any knives are kept sharp, as blunt knives require more force to use, actually increasing the likelihood of injury (cuts from a sharp knife heal more quickly than those from a blunt one). A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|knife sharpener]] can be used to keep knives sharp.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nature vs. Nurture==
Behaviors exist on a continuum from being to a large extent contingent on genetic factors (i.e., instinctive), to others which are mostly acquired through experience. Instinctive components are those that are exhibited without the benefit of, or need for, prior experience. They come to the fore when, for instance, newly hatched, inexperienced individuals of a particular species of spider construct their webs with little variation, despite the lack of a tutor.  Learned behaviors are those that are acquired through interactions with the surrounding world.

'''Nature vs. Nurture''' describes a debate about the degree to which individual differences in physical and behavioral traits are the product of an individual's innate qualities (&quot;nature&quot;) versus those shaped by personal experiences (&quot;nurture&quot;). This dichotomy aims to delineate how much of the human (psychological) make-up is the result of environmental influences and how much is a result of phylogenetic heritage. In today's view there are multiple problems with phrasing the issue in this either-or form. Most significant of all, as the two are NOT mutually exclusive concepts. It is now clear that in every instance both influences play significant roles as all development represents a complex interaction between inherited factors and environmental conditions.

Essentially, an individual’s phenotype is a result of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to its development. A '''genotype''' is the entire set of genetic material an individual inherited from its parents. A '''phenotype''' is the observable characteristics or traits of an individual’s genotype, which include morphologic, physiologic, and behavioral traits. The '''environment''' encompasses every other aspect, besides genes, of an individual and its surroundings (hormone levels, diet, family life, etc.). 

===The Four Primary Relations of Developmental interactions===

In order to better understand and study how this complex network of interactions between an individual’s genotype, phenotype and environment work in concert to affect the development of an individual, it is useful to break down these interactions into four primary relations: '''(1)''' how the parent’s genotype contributes to the individual’s genotype, '''(2)''' how the individual’s genotype affects its phenotype, '''(3)''' How the individual’s environment affects its phenotype, and '''(4)''' how the individual’s phenotype affects its environment. &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Parent’s Genotype → Offspring’s Genotype====  

Parents each contribute 50% of their genetic material to comprise the entire genome of their offspring. The genes that are coded for within an individual’s DNA affect development and behavior. Although an individual’s entire genome is inherited from its parents, because there are mechanisms that contribute to genetic diversity (such as mutation and recombination) no two individuals will have the exact same genotype (with the exception of identical twins). &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Individual’s Genotype → Individual’s Phenotype==== 

An individual’s genotype contains all of the genes that were parentally inherited, but not all of those genes are expressed in the individual’s phenotype. This occurs through several mechanisms, which include developmental changes and dominance patterns. 

'''Developmental changes:''' In any given cell at any given time in an organism’s body, some genes will be active (turned on) while others will be inactive (turned off). Regulator genes primarily control when genes will be turned on or off, both for changes that occur only during critical times in development as well as for matters of day-to-day operation. Genes are typically used in concert with other genes, forming a complex network of genetic expression, and are rarely used in isolation. 

'''Dominance patterns:''' Many genes have more than one '''allele''' (a different form or expression of the same gene). Due to Mendelian inheritance patterns, such as dominant-recessive or co-dominant patterns, many genes are never expressed or are only partially expressed. Therefore, all of the different alleles of a gene that influence the expression of a particular trait or characteristic (e.g. eye color) may result in a different phenotypic expression (e. g. brown, green, blue, hazel). However, the phenotypic expression of most traits or characteristics are the resulting summation of multiple genes (polygenic inheritance), and some genes can affect multiple traits. &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Individual’s Environment → Individual’s Phenotype==== 

As stated earlier, an individual’s phenotype is the result of the interactions of both their genes and the environment. Therefore, any given genotype will develop differently under different environmental conditions; this is called '''phenotypic plasticity'''. The concept of the '''Norm of Reaction''' describes this potential variability in the phenotypic expression of an individual genotype: “all the phenotypes that can theoretically result from a given genotype in relation to all the environments in which it can survive and develop.” &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. Norms of Reaction. 4 September 2013.&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norms_of_reaction&gt; [accessed 2013 December 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example of phenotypic plasticity is the recessive autosomal metabolic genetic disorder, Phenylketonuria (PKU). This disorder is due to a mutation in a gene on chromosome 12 which codes for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Because the mutation renders the enzyme nonfunctional, people who possess two copies of this recessive gene cannot metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many foods. If individuals with PKU eat a normal diet, the accumulation of phenylalanine builds up in the bloodstream and leads to impaired brain development, intellectual disability, seizures and other health issues. However, if individuals with PKU are placed on a strict phenylalanine-free diet shortly after birth they can develop and live healthily. Therefore, individuals with PKU (The genotypic trait of interest), under different environmental conditions (the presence or absence of Phenylalanine in the diet), will develop drastically different behavioral phenotypes (impaired brain development vs. unimpaired brain development). &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. Phenylketonuria. 19 December 2013. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria&gt; [accessed 2013 December 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents also contribute greatly to their offspring’s environment. Parents have a great influence over what experiences their children are exposed to, including the quality of parental care and nutrition that they receive. It is important to note that parent’s behavior toward their offspring is influenced partially by their genetics as well as by their previous developmental experiences, which all contributes to their particular parenting style. Therefore, an individual’s environment is also greatly affected by the phenotype and genotype of its parents. &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, mice with a mutation that inactivates the fosB gene are significantly deficient in their nurturing ability towards their young. This suggests that nurturing ability in mammals has a genetically induced component. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. R., Hong, Y., Bronson, R. T., Dikkes, P., Greenberg, M. E. 1996. A defect in nurturing in mice lacking the immediate early gene fosB. Cell Press. 86: 297-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual’s Phenotype → Individual’s Environment==== 

The genetic predispositions in behavior an individual has and exhibits will naturally evoke certain responses from those around it. For instance, active kittens who do not like to be held will receive significantly less snuggling than those who enjoy to sleep curled up on a human’s lap. Therefore, an individual also has a significant influence on its own environment which in turn influences its phenotype. 

Additionally, an individual actively shapes its own environment by seeking the experiences and surroundings that suit its interests, temperament, and abilities. For instance, children who enjoy reading will tend to read more than children who don’t enjoy to read. The more they read, the better they will become at reading which will allow them to read more challenging books and lead them to develop a more advanced vocabulary. With this more developed skill-set and general knowledge that they have acquired though pursuing their interests, children who enjoy reading will most likely experience greater success in school. &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Studying The Four Primary Relations===

These four primary relations, typically summarized by the term gene-environment interactions, form the basic perspectives through which the complex web of interactions that influence development can be understood. These various gene-environment interactions are comprised of many time-sensitive and precisely-incorporated changes that work together to produce every trait. Therefore it would be foolish to say that a complex phenotypic trait, such as behavior, was purely genetically or environmentally determined. Likewise, neither can it be claimed that either an individual’s genotype or its environment are more significant in the development of its phenotype. Therefore the Nature vs. Nurture Debate is a fallacy, however the debate did frame many questions which are still of great interest. The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with studying how these relationships between the genetic and environmental factors that result in the variation observed in the behavioral and developmental phenotype &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Tobin, A. J. 1999. Amazing Grace: Sources of Phenotype Variation in Genetic Boosterism. In: Behavioral Genetics (Carson, R. A., Rothstein, M. A., eds.). The Johns Hopkins University Press, MD, pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral geneticists study this through two main premises: the extent to which a behavioral or phenotypic trait is influenced by genetic factors, and the extent to which a behavioral or phenotypic trait is influenced by environmental factors. 
Twin Studies: An extremely valuable source for research in the heritability of behavioral traits in humans are adoptive twin studies, because scientists cannot control and manipulate human pedigrees or developmental environment. These studies compare monozygotic (identical) twins who were raised together with those who were separated at birth and raised apart. Because identical twins share 100% of their genome, differences between the twins can be assumed to be due to environmental factors. &lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R., Deloache, J., and Eisenberg, N. 2006. How Children Develop, 2nd ed. Worth Publishers, NY, pp. 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia. Twin Study. 19 December 2013. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_studies&gt;.

# Measure ½ cup hot broth; stir into rice mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low, maintaining a [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] throughout adding broth.
# Cook and stir until broth has absorbed. Repeat, adding ½ cup broth 3 more times, cooking and stirring until broth has absorbed.
# Add saffron-flavored broth to rice and cook until absorbed.
# Continue to add remaining broth, ½ cup at a time, cooking and stirring until rice is tender but firm and mixture has slight creamy consistency. (Not all broth may be necessary. Total cooking time of rice will be about 20 minutes.)

[[Image:Laguiole steak knives.jpeg|right|thumb|A set of Laguiole steak knives]]

'''Steak knife''' is the term for small knives used at the table for eating. It is about the size of a [[Cookbook:Butter Knife|butter knife]] but is sharpened and usually [[Wikipedia:Serration|serrated]] for more effectiveness when cutting through tough, meaty samples. It is important that any knives are kept sharp, as blunt knives require more force to use, actually increasing the likelihood of injury (cuts from a sharp knife heal more quickly than those from a blunt one). A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|knife sharpener]] can be used to keep knives sharp.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], depending on appetite and number of people
*[[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|Mayonnaise]], depending on desired texture and taste
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]] to taste

==Equipment==
*A small 2-quart pot [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]
*A small spoon or [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]]
*[[Cookbook:Fork|Fork]] 
*[[Cookbook:Paring Knife|Paring Knife]] 
*Plate or small bowl
*Gas or electric stove, at medium-high to high heat

== Procedure ==
Follow the procedure for [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|Hard Boiled Eggs]]. Allow the eggs to cool, then cut them in halves, so that half the yolk is in each half. Carefully remove the yolk and mash them together with a fork, until the yolk is like a coarse powder. Add a spoonful of mayonnaise (about one spoonful per three medium eggs) to the yolks and mix it with the fork until evenly mixed. Use more mayonnaise for a richer, smoother texture. Add about half a spoon of mustard or more or less to taste.
Scoop the mixture into the empty egg whites until each is evenly filled. Sprinkle a little dried paprika on the yolk of each re-filled egg.
Keep covered and refrigerated until ready to consume.
Enjoy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">To save a timeline from Premiere pro to a DVavi 

This is useful when you need a dvavi for an external encoding application, or for archiving files. DVAVI files are as good a quality as you can get when editing with Premiere Pro. They are also large in filesize so are not very good for archiving but a DV avi file may be  more readily accessible than storing the Video on tape.  

Select File &gt; Export &gt; Movie

[[Image:save_as_avi_prempro.jpg]]

Then click on settings button 

Select the General tab on the left and make sure that Microsoft DVAVI is selected under File Type

[[Image:Settings4_prempro.jpg]]

Select the Video tab on the left and make sure Compressor is set to DV(PAL)  [only NTSC if you are in N.America]


[[Image:Settings4_prempro.jpg]]

Select the Audio tab on the left and make sure the Sample type is set to 48000

[[Image:Settings4_prempro.jpg]]

Click OK

Give the file a name and save it

=Scheveningen Variation=
'''5... e6''', building a so-called &quot;small center&quot;, is the signature move of the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence. '''5... e6''' strengthens Black's control of the important '''d5''' square and opens '''e7''' for the development of his dark-squared bishop. If Black is able to safely play '''... d5''' later on, he will have a good position. 

In contrast to the Najdorf Variation, '''5... a6''', the Scheveningen commits Black earlier to a certain pawn structure in the center and delays queenside operations, but does more to promote Black's early development and castling. Both systems are considered very solid choices for Black, however '''5... a6''' has been played by even the best Scheveningen specialists (including Garry Kasparov) to avoid the dangerous ''Keres Attack'', '''5... e6 6. g4!'''  (Although by no means winning for White, statistics sharply favour the white pieces.)

I rewrote an earlier version of this page that said that the Dragon was one of the easiest Sicilian systems to play. While the general themes are easy to understand, the sharpness of the variation makes it a very dangerous line for both players and I wouldn't say it's easy to learn all the myriad pitfalls. I also elaborated on the basic plans for both sides. [[User:MadeofPlants|MadeofPlants]] 21:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
:I agree with this change, I have been playing the dragon for years, and I would not claim to be good at it, to understand all the nuances, or anything like that. It's a difficult variation, all the more so because the people who typically play it are grandmasters and such. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before starting reading the book, you need to know how to use the “Actions” window.

[[Image:mfas_image001.jpg]]

Actions toolbox is used for helping you to write script. The script is written in Script pane. There are 2 modes of programming in Flash MX. The first one is Normal Mode, which is for beginners and the code is written with the help of Actions Toolbox and Expression text field, and the second one is the Expert mode, which consists only of Actions Toolbox and Script Pane. If you use Normal Mode, then the Expression text field helps you to write the expression in it. And the Actions Combo Box is used to navigate from one object to another.

      <comment>/* X, Y Coordinates */ bagh</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Properties ==

Every Symbol instance in Flash has properties, which control the object itself and how it is displayed and its interaction with the environment.   However, Graphic type symbol instances cannot be referenced with action script, since you can´t assign them an instance name. 

{{Sidebox|Actionscript 3.0|Actionscript 3.0 removes the leading underscore for the various properties.}}
Properties in ActionScript contain an underscore before the property name, to indicate that it pertains to the display or environment.  The properties of a symbol instance can be modified in design time or in runtime using action script, an essential task for animation. 

In this chapter we will learn to use properties.

=== X, Y Coordinates ===

x and y are the coordinates of the object. As the screen is 2D the object doesn’t have the 3rd z coordinate. Now let's write a small program. We will draw a ball and then move it to a specified location.

'''Step 1'''

Select the oval tool [[Image:Mfas_image003.jpg]] from the toolbar and draw a circle.

'''Step 2'''

Select the oval you have drawn and press F8. &quot;Convert to Symbol&quot; dialog will appear. Type &quot;mov_ball&quot; in the &quot;Name&quot; field, choose &quot;Movie Clip&quot; behavior and press &quot;OK&quot;

'''Step 3'''

Now select the oval. In the properties window (at the bottom of the screen by default) in the &quot;Instance Name&quot; field (Near &quot;Swap&quot; button) type &quot;ball&quot;. Now we can customize our ball’s properties.

'''Step 4'''

Right click the keyframe in the &quot;Timeline&quot; window and choose &quot;Actions&quot;. &quot;Actions&quot; window will appear. In the Script pane write the following:

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
ball._x = 200;
ball._y = 200;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example will set the position of the ball to (200, 200). But let's analyze the code. &quot;ball&quot; is our object in the scene. &quot;_x&quot; is the x coordinate of the object and &quot;_y&quot; is the y coordinate of the object. In ActionScript, the properties begin with &quot;_&quot; including the x and y coordinates. In many languages, &quot;;&quot; is put after each line, so that the program could find the end of the statement.
|}

=== Width, Height Measures ===

Width and height are the vertical and horizontal sizes of the object. The use of them are just as the use of x and y properties. Add the following lines to the previous example and you will understand.

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
ball._height = 50;
ball._width = 100;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== XScale, YScale ===

Scaling the local coordinate system affects the _x and _y property settings, which are defined in whole pixels. For example, if the parent movie clip is scaled to 50%, setting the _x property moves an object in the movie clip by half the number of pixels as it would if the movie were set at 100%.

=== Visible ===

This property makes the object visible and invisible. To test this property we will need to add one button to the scene. Draw something like button in the scene and convert it to button (using F8), or you can just add the any button from &quot;Common Libraries&quot; in the &quot;Window&gt;Common Libraries&quot; menu. After you have added the button right click it and choose &quot;Actions&quot; from the popup menu. In the Script pane type the following:

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
 on (release) {
    ball._visible = false;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

But note, if you are using the Normal mode then don’t write this. Choose &quot;Properties&quot; from the left side of the &quot;Actions&quot; window and then double click &quot;_visible&quot;. You will notice than the first and third lines will be written automatically, but the second line will just be &quot;_visible&quot;. In the &quot;Expression&quot; field above the Script pane write &quot;ball._visible = false&quot;. But if you are using the Advanced mode, then copy all the code written above. The first line is the beginning of &quot;Release&quot; event. &quot;Release&quot; event occurs when the user clicks the button. The structure of writing events is &quot;on  (&lt;name of event&gt;) {&quot;. The &quot;{&quot; tells the program the beginning of the event. And &quot;}&quot; tells the end of the event. So when the user clicks the button, the code written between &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; is being executed. The second line makes the ball invisible, using &quot;_visible&quot; property. This property can be set to &quot;true&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;), this means visible, and to &quot;false&quot; (&quot;no&quot;), this means invisible. This type of construction ( &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;) is called &quot;Boolean&quot;, which you will learn later.

=== Rotation ===

Rotation property specifies the rotation of the object in degrees. To test this property follow the steps.

'''Step 1'''

Select the Rectangle Tool [[Image:Mfas_image004.jpg]] in the Toolbox, draw a rectangle, double click the drawn rectangle and press F8 to convert it to symbol. When the &quot;Convert to Symbol&quot; dialog will appear, type &quot;mov_box&quot; as the name of the symbol, choose the &quot;Movie Clip&quot; behavior and press OK. Select the rectangle you have drawn and give &quot;box&quot; name to it. 

'''Step 2'''

Now right click the Keyframe in Timeline window and choose &quot;Actions&quot; from the popup window to show &quot;Actions&quot; window. When the window is shown, turn on Advanced Mode [[Image:Mfas_image005.jpg]] and write the following:

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
 box._rotation = 45;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now test the movie by pressing Ctrl + Enter and you will see the result.

=== Quality ===

Property quality is not very important. It only changes the quality of the scene. But it doesn’t change the quality of the object, since its quality property is set. Rather it changes the quality of all the movie. For example if you write the following:

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
 box._quality = &quot;LOW&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

then this will decrease not only of the quality of box object, but also the qualities of all other objects.

=== Name ===

This property changes or reads the name of the object. To understand how to use this property let's test it. We will use the example which we used when we were learning &quot;Rotation&quot; property. Right click the keyframe in Timeline window to see the &quot;Actions&quot; window. Now add the following lines to the code:

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
 box._name = &quot;box2&quot;;
 box._rotation = 45;
&lt;/source&gt;

Test the movie and you will notice that nothing has changed. Why? Because you have changed the name of the &quot;box&quot; to &quot;box2&quot;, so now the object with the name &quot;box&quot; doesn’t exist. But if you only replace the word &quot;box&quot; in the second line to &quot;box2&quot; and it will look like &quot;box2._rotation = 45; &quot;, then, by testing the movie you will see that the box is rotated.

=== Alpha ===

Alpha gives the object transparency. If alpha value is set to 0, then the object is completely invisible. If the value is set to 100, then the object is completely visible. You can set alpha value to your object both in design time by choosing &quot;Alpha&quot; in &quot;Color&quot; combo box in the Property window and in runtime, by using ActionScript. To test this add the following line to the previous example.

&lt;source lang=actionscript&gt;
 box._alpha = 30;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following line will make the box transparent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Properties ==

=== XMouse, YMouse ===

Say you have a button and the user clicks it. You want to get the position of the mouse. This property will help you get the coordinates of the mouse. 

'''Step 1'''

Create any button (by drawing it yourself or taking it from Common Libraries) and set its name to &quot;button1&quot;. 

'''Step 2'''

Select the Text Tool [[Image:Mfas image006.jpg]] from the Toolbox and draw it. Then select it and in the Properties window set its width to 100, height to 20, font size to 20, Var to &quot;info&quot; and change the Text Type to &quot;Dynamic Text&quot;. There are 3 types of Text Type
*	Static Text – you choose this type of Text if you don’t want the value of the Text to be changed. For example, if you just want to &quot;hello&quot; in the Text and you don’t want &quot;hello&quot; to be changed during runtime, then you use &quot;Static Text&quot;. This is good for usual texts.
*	Dynamic Text – this type of Text can be change at any time during runtime. This type of Text is very useful if you want to write information of current process.
*	Input Text – this is a text field and is almost the same as &quot;Dynamic Text&quot;. The only difference between these two types is that &quot;Input Text&quot; Text can be changed by the user, but &quot;Dynamic Text&quot; can’t be changed at all.
So we use &quot;Dynamic Text&quot; type in our example to see the values of xmouse and ymouse. &quot;Var&quot; property is value of the Text. For example if you have a &quot;Input Text&quot;, which’s &quot;Var&quot; property is set to &quot;zzz&quot; and want to retrieve its value, then you can get it from the &quot;zzz&quot;. I mean that the value of the textbox is stored in &quot;zzz&quot;. But by using the &quot;Var&quot;, in our case &quot;zzz&quot;, you can also change the value of the Text&quot;. For example if you write

&lt;code&gt;
 zzz = &quot;hello&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;

then the value of the Text will become &quot;hello&quot;;

'''Step 3'''

Right click the button you have created and choose &quot;Actions&quot; from the popup menu to open the actions of the button. Make sure that the &quot;Advanced Mode&quot; is turn on and write the following:

&lt;code&gt;
 on (release) {
    info = &quot;x: &quot; + button1._xmouse + &quot;; y: &quot; + button1._ymouse;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

The first and the third lines are the beginning and the end of the &quot;Release&quot; event (discussed in property &quot;Visible&quot;). The second line sets our Dynamic Text’s value to the mouse coordinates using &quot;_xmouse&quot; and &quot;_ymouse&quot; properties. So when you click the button you will see the coordinates of the mouse in the Dynamic Text. But the null point is the center of the object. So if you click the left side of the button, the x coordinate will be less than 0 and if you click right side of the object, then the x coordinate will be more than 0.

=== CurrentFrame ===

This property tells you which frame of current Movie Clip is being played now. I wrote Movie Clip instead of object, because this property is available only for Movie Clip. This time we will create more complicated example.

'''Step 1'''

Select the Rectangle Tool [[Image:mfas_image004.jpg]] in the Toolbox, draw a rectangle, double click it and press F8 to convert it to symbol. When the &quot;Convert to Symbol&quot; dialog appears, set its’ name &quot;g_box&quot; and behavior &quot;Graphic&quot;.

[[Image:mfas_image007.jpg]]
[[Image:mfas_image008.jpg]]

'''Step 2'''

Press F11 to see the Library window and click &quot;Create New Symbol&quot; [[Image:mfas_image009.jpg]]. When the &quot;Create New Symbol&quot; dialog appears, set its’ name to &quot;m_box&quot; and the behavior to &quot;Movie Clip&quot; and press OK. When you are in &quot;m_box&quot; [[Image:mfas_image010.jpg]], add &quot;g_box&quot; graphic from the library. Then right click the 32-nd frame in Timeline window and choose &quot;Insert Keyframe&quot;. Now click any frame between 1 and 32 and in the Properties window from the Tween combo box choose &quot;Motion&quot;. Then in Rotate combo box choose
&quot;CW&quot; (Clockwise) and in the &quot;Rotation Count&quot; field type 1. This will make the box 1 time to rotate in clockwise direction.

'''Step 3'''

Now go to the &quot;Scene1&quot; and select the Text Tool [[Image:mfas_image006.jpg]] from the Toolbox. Draw a Text and set its’ width to 40, height to 20, font size to 20, Var to &quot;info&quot; and change the Text Type to &quot;Dynamic Text&quot;.

'''Step 4'''

Now right click our box and choose &quot;Actions&quot;. When the Actions windows appears make sure the &quot;Advanced Mode&quot; is turned on and type the following the movieclip m_box:

&lt;code&gt;
 onClipEvent (enterFrame) {
    _root.info.text = _currentframe;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

Now lets understand the code. The word &quot;onClipEvent&quot; is an event handler like &quot;on&quot;. The word &quot;enterFrame&quot; is the event. If we use &quot;on (event) {&quot; in our previous examples for Buttons, then for Movie Clips we use &quot;onClipEvent(event) {&quot;. Now lets discuss the second line. &quot;_root&quot; is the main object in the Flash. Imagine something like this: you are sitting in the car, the car is in the garage, the garage is in the building, the building is in the city. As you see the chief of all these is the city of course, the building is sub chief and so on. This mean that if you want to see the building you must first go out of the car, then out of garage, then out of the builing and only then you will see it. So if we programmly describe your position then it will be &quot;_root.building.garage.car.you&quot; where _root is the city. In our example we are in &quot;onClipEvent (enterFrame) &quot; event, so if we want to access var info, then we will have to access if via &quot;_root&quot;, this means &quot;_root.info&quot;. Now you ask why we write &quot;_currentframe&quot; without anything. Because we are already in the Movie Clip. For example if you are sitting in the car and you need to take keys from it. You will not get out of the car, then again enter it to take the keys, you will just simply take them and then get out. So that’s why in our example we use &quot;_currentframe&quot; without anything. But if you want to access it via &quot;_root&quot; then you will write &quot;_root.box._currentframe&quot;.

'''Step 5'''

Now test the movie and you will see the result.

=== TotalFrames ===

_totalframes property just tells you how many frames are in the Movie Clip. For testing it we will use the previous example. Right click the keyframe in the Timeline window in Scene1 and choose &quot;Actions&quot;. Then write the following in the Script pane:

&lt;code&gt;
 trace(box._totalframes);
&lt;/code&gt;

Trace is used to record programming notes or to display messages in the Output window while testing a movie. The use of trace is the following &quot;trace(expression);&quot;. For example if you write &quot;trace (&quot;hello!!!&quot;);&quot; then &quot;hello!!!&quot; will be displayed in the Output window. But this action is working only in Macromedia Flash MX. I mean that if you publish your movie, the user won’t see the Output window. So use it just for yourself to test the movies. Now lets go back to our example. This code will write the frames count to the Output window, and it will be 32.

=== URL ===

_url property retrieves the URL of the SWF file from which the movie clip was downloaded. As in the previous property add &quot;trace(box._url)&quot; and you will see the path of the SWF file.

=== Target ===

This returns the target path of the Movie Clip. This is nearly what we discussed in &quot;TotalFrames&quot;. For example as we mentioned there, if we were in car then our target will be &quot;\building\garage\car&quot;. Or another example: if you create a Movie Clip and set its name &quot;m1&quot; and then create another Movie Clip and put the previous Movie Clip in this one and name the new one &quot;m2&quot; then if in &quot;m1&quot; actions you write:

&lt;code&gt;
 onClipEvent (enterFrame) {
    trace(_target);
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

then the return path will be &quot;\m2\m1&quot;

=== DropTarget ===

Discussed later.

=== FocusRect ===

This is a Boolean (true, false) value that specifies whether a movie clip has a yellow rectangle around it when it has keyboard focus. If the focus is set, then it returns true else false.

=== FramesLoaded ===

The property _framesloaded tells how many frames of the movie were loaded. This is very useful to monitor the download process.

=== SoundBufTime ===

Discussed later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Operators (1) ==

In this chapter you will learn all of the operators which are used in ActionScript.


'''Usual operators'''
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Operator||Description
|-
|&quot; &quot; || Text. Example: &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;button&quot;
|-
|() || performs a grouping operation on one or more parameters, or surrounds one or more parameters and passes them as parameters to a function outside the parentheses. Example: trace (&quot;hello!!!&quot;);
|}

'''Arithmetic operators'''
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Operator||Description
|-
|
-
|| used for negating or subtracting. Example: a = 5 – 2; b = a -1;
|-
|% || calculates the remainder of expression1 divided by expression2. Example trace (12 % 5);  returns 2
|-
|* || multiplies two numerical expressions. Example: a = 5 * 5; b = a * 2;
|-
|/ || divides expression1 by expression2. Example: a = 20 / 4; b = a / 5;
|-
|
+
|| adds numeric expressions or concatenates (combines) strings. Example: a = 5 + 5; b = &quot;hel&quot; + &quot;lo&quot;;
|}

'''Assignment operators'''

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Operator||Description
|-
|
-=
|| assigns expression1 the value of expression1 -expression2. a = 5; b = 2; a -= b instead of a = a - b;
|-
|
%=	
|| assigns expression1 the value of expression1% expression2. a = 12; b = 5; a%=b instead of a=a % b;
|-
| *= || assigns expression1 the value of expression1 *expression2. a = 2; b = 4; a *= b instead of a = a * b;
|-
|
/=	
|| assigns expression1 the value of expression1/expression2. a = 4; b = 2; a /= b instead of a = a / b;
|-
|
+=	
|| assigns expression1 the value of expression1 + expression2. a = 3; b = 2; a += b instead of  a=a + b;
|-
|
=	
|| assigns the type of expression2 to expression1. b = &quot;hello&quot;; z = b; c = z + &quot;!!!&quot;;
|}

Other operators are discussed later after chapter [[../Chapter 3|Data types]].

=== Comments ===

Comments are useful for keeping track of what you intended, and for passing information to other developers if you work in a collaborative environment or are providing samples. There are two types of using comments. The first one is a one line comment and the other one: multi-line comment. For implementing one line comment just put &quot;//&quot; followed by your comment at the end of the line, if the line is not empty, and at the beginning of the line if it is empty. Examples:

This example demonstrates the use of comment at the end of the line
 box._rotation = 45;  //This rotates &quot;box&quot; object by 45 degrees

This example demonstrates the use of comment in an empty line
 //This is just a comment

This example demonstrates the use of comment in an empty line in work
 //Rotating &quot;box&quot; object by 45 degrees
 box._rotation = 45;

Note that you cannot use any type of comment inside the script!
For implementing a multi-line comment you must just put your comment between symbols &quot;/*&quot; and &quot;*/&quot; (Note that all rules applied for one line comment are also applied for multi-line comment). Examples:

&lt;code&gt;
 /* We are now going to
    rotate our box by 45
    degrees */
 box._rotation = 45;
 
 box._rotation = 45; /* Rotating our box by 45 degrees */
 
 /* Rotating our box by 45 degrees */
 box._rotation = 45;
 // Box has been rotated!
&lt;/code&gt;

You cannot use comments like this:
 box._rotation = 4/*just comment*/5;
This is a syntax error.

In this chapter we will learn how to use variables and data types. First lets talk about variables. Variables are very useful to keep data in them, but each variable has its data type. Below are listed data types available in ActionScript:

|String	|| This is a text variable. For example if you set its value to &quot;5&quot; and then add 6 to it, the result will be &quot;56&quot; not &quot;11&quot;. To have the result &quot;11&quot; you will have to use Number.
|-
|Number	|| This is a number variable. If you want to add some numbers, then you must use this data type. But for example if you have a number variable which’s value is 5 and you add a string variable &quot;5&quot; to it then the result will be &quot;55&quot; not 10.
|-
|Boolean || As we discussed in the previous chapters, Boolean is a data type which has only two values: true and false.
|-
|Date || This is a date variable. You can keep your date in it or you can just access the current date (time, hours, minutes, year, month…).
|-
|Array || This is a collection variable. You can keep on one but as much values as you want.
|-
|Object || This data type is used to create or use objects.
|}

=== General concepts and difference between Number and String data types ===

Lets write a small program to test this data types. Create a new movie and open Frame 1’s actions by right clicking the first frame in the Timeline window and choosing &quot;Actions&quot;. In the Script pane type the following:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var num = new Number();
 2.   var txt = new String();
 3.
 4.   num = 5;
 5.   txt = &quot;hi&quot;;
 6.
 7.   trace(num);
 8.   trace(txt);
&lt;/code&gt;

The first line declares a new number variable: &quot;num&quot;. The word &quot;var&quot; is used to declare variables. After &quot;var&quot; must follow the variable’s name, in our case it is &quot;num&quot;. You can declare variables without assigning any data type. For example:

&lt;code&gt;
 var i;
&lt;/code&gt;

&quot;var i;&quot; means that we declare i variable without assigning any data type. In in our code &quot;var num = new Number();&quot; we declare &quot;num&quot; variable and assign &quot;Number&quot; data type. This means that &quot;num&quot; variable can keep and work with only numbers. The word &quot;Number&quot; and other data types must be followed with the brackets. If there is nothing written in the brackets then the value of the variable is set to its default. In our case, our num variable is 0 at first. If you delete the line 4, you will notice, that the traced value is 0. In line 2 we declare another variable &quot;txt&quot; but this time we assign it &quot;String&quot; data type. This means that &quot;txt&quot; variable will not be able to calculate or simply work with numbers. In line 4 we set the value of &quot;num&quot; to 5 and in line 5 we set the &quot;txt&quot; value to &quot;hi&quot;. And finally when we trace these two variables in lines 7 and 8 we saw the output:

[[Image:mfas_image011.jpg]]

Now lets make a test. 

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var num1 = new Number(20);
 2.   var txt1 = new String(&quot;Hello&quot;);
 3.   var num2 = new Number(5);
 4.   var txt2 = new String(&quot;...&quot;);
 5.
 6.   num1 += num2;
 7.   txt1 += txt2;
 8.
 9.   trace(num1);
 10.  trace(txt1);
&lt;/code&gt;

In first 4 lines we declare 2 number and 2 string variables and set their values. In lines 6 and 7 we calculate two same data type variables with each other and keep the result in the first variable. For example in line 6 &quot;num1&quot; variable is 20, by using &quot;+=&quot; operator we add &quot;num1&quot; &quot;num2&quot;. We can replace the line with &quot;num1 = num1 + num2&quot;. This is the same. If we add 5 to 20 the result will be 25. In line 7 we combine two strings with each other. The result is kept in &quot;txt1&quot; as in &quot;Hello…&quot;. Now test the movie by pressing Ctrl + Enter and you will see the results 25 and &quot;Hello…&quot;. Now lets test the same example but only change lines 6 and 7:

&lt;code&gt;
 6.   num1 += txt2;
 7.   txt1 += num2;
&lt;/code&gt;

What do you think will happen? Test the movie and see. The variable &quot;num1&quot; will become a string, because the result will be:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Data types ==

=== String ===

In the previous section you understood the difference between String and Number data types. Now we will analyze String data type in details. The following is the structure of declaring String variable:

 var &lt;name&gt; = new String( [expression] );

Parameter &lt;name&gt; is the name of the variable you want to declare, and the parameter [expression] is the value you want the variable to be assigned when it is created.

==== Methods ====

|}

===== charAt =====

''String.charAt( &lt;index&gt; );''

This method returns the character in the position specified by the parameter &lt;index&gt;. The first character of the string is indicated by 0, so if you want to read the first character of the specified string you must put 0 as &lt;index&gt; parameter, for reading the third character you must put 2 as &lt;index&gt;. Now lets write a program which will get the second character of string “hello”.

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;hello&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.charAt(1));

&lt;/code&gt;

===== charCodeAt =====

''String.charCodeAt( &lt;index&gt; );''

For understanding what this method does you must first know something about the keyboard and “ASCII value”. Each “symbol”, which is printed on the screen has an equivalent code. For example the code of the capital letter “A” is 65. In the American Standard(“ASCII”) there are 127 character codes. All computers in the world support ASCII standard. In this character set (character codes from 0 to 127) are only the standard codes of the symbols. For example the code of the symbol “©” in Microsoft® Windows® is 165. In other operating systems it can be another code. Here is the list of symbols with their equivalent codes:

These characters aren't supported by Microsoft Windows.

&lt;nowiki&gt;
* *Values 8, 9, 10, and 13 convert to backspace, tab, linefeed, and carriage return characters, respectively. They have no graphical representation but, depending on the application, can affect the visual display of text.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You will understand the use of this method later. For now you must know this. Now lets write a program which will print all codes of the characters of string “hello”.

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;hello&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.charCodeAt(0));
 3.   trace(tmpString.charCodeAt(1));
 4.   trace(tmpString.charCodeAt(2));
 5.   trace(tmpString.charCodeAt(3));
 6.   trace(tmpString.charCodeAt(4));
&lt;/code&gt;

===== concat ===== 

''String.concat( &lt;val1&gt;, …, &lt;valN&gt; );''

This method combines the value of the String object with the parameters and returns the newly formed string. But note, it doesn’t change the string, it just returns it. This example shows the use of this method:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;Hello!!!&quot;);
 2.   tmpString = tmpString.concat(&quot; How&quot;, &quot; are&quot;, &quot; you?&quot;);
 3.   trace(tmpString);
&lt;/code&gt;

===== fromCharCode ===== 

''String.fromCharCode( &lt;c1&gt;, …, &lt;cN&gt; );''

This method returns a string made up of the characters represented by the character codes (ASCII values) in the parameters. In this method “String” must not be replaced with a name of String variable for example: “mystring.fromCharCode”, it must be left as “String”. In this case “String” is represented by as a String object. The following example creates a “hello” string:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String();
 2.   tmpString = String.fromCharCode(104,101,108,108,111);
 3.   trace(tmpString);
&lt;/code&gt;

===== indexOf ===== 

''String.indexOf( &lt;strsearch&gt;, [startindex] );''

This method searches the string you specified by the parameter &lt;strsearch&gt; and returns the position of the first occurrence of it. If the string is not founded it returns -1. For example this code searches for “ll” string in “tmpString” variable, which’s value is “hello”:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;hello!!!&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.indexOf(&quot;ll&quot;));
&lt;/code&gt;

The method “indexOf” will return 2, which means that the beginning of the string you was looking for is at character 3(don’t forget that the first character of the string is 0). The parameter [startindex] tells Flash to begin searching the string from the specified character. In the following example the value returned by “indexOf” method is -1, which means, that the string wasn’t found.

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;hello!!!&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.indexOf(&quot;ll&quot;,3));
&lt;/code&gt;

===== lastIndexOf ===== 

''String.lastIndexOf( &lt;strsearch&gt;, [startindex] );''

This method searches the string you specified by the parameter &lt;strsearch&gt; and returns the position of the last occurrence of it. If the string is not founded it returns -1. For example this code searches for “ZZ” string in “tmpString” variable, which’s value is “ZoZZooZZoZoZZ”:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;ZoZZooZZoZoZZ&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.lastIndexOf(&quot;ZZ&quot;));
&lt;/code&gt;

The method “indexOf” will return 11, which means that the beginning of the string you was looking for, from the end of the string, is at character 11(don’t forget that the first character of the string is 0). The parameter [startindex] tells Flash to begin searching the string from the specified character. This means that the part of the string which is followed after the specified character is not involved in the search process. In the following example the value returned by “indexOf” method is 6:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;ZoZZooZZoZoZZ&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.lastIndexOf(&quot;ZZ&quot;,9));
&lt;/code&gt;

===== slice ===== 

''String.slice( &lt;startindex&gt;, [endindex] );''

This method returns a string that includes the &lt;startindex&gt; character and all characters up to (but not including) the [endindex] character. If you do not specify [endindex] parameter then the return value will be a string that includes the &lt;startindex&gt; character and all characters up to the end of the String. In this example we slice the word “How” from the String “How are you?”:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;How are you?&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.slice(0,3));
&lt;/code&gt;

Now lets slice all characters from 4 till the end of the String:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;How are you?&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.slice(4));
&lt;/code&gt;

===== split ===== 

This method is discussed later after Array data type.

===== substr ===== 

''String.substr( &lt;startindex&gt;, [length]  );''

This method returns the characters in a string from the index specified in the &lt;startindex&gt; parameter through the number of characters specified in the [length] parameter. It is nearly the same as method “slice” but in this function you specify the length of the string to be cut, not the index of the last character. This example illustrates the use of this method:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;How are you?&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.substr(4,3));
&lt;/code&gt;

===== substring ===== 

''String.substring( &lt;startindex&gt;, [endindex]  );''

This method returns a string consisting of the characters between the points specified by the &lt;startindex&gt; and [endindex] parameters. If the parameter [endindex] is not specified then the string which is returned consists of the characters from the point &lt;startindex&gt; till the end of the string. This example illustrates the use of this method:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;How are you?&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.substring(0,2));
&lt;/code&gt;

===== toLowerCase ===== 

''String.toLowerCase( );''

This method returns a copy of the specified String, with all of the uppercase characters converted to lowercase. For example a string “Hello” will be converted to “hello”:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;Hello&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.toLowerCase());
&lt;/code&gt;

===== toUpperCase ===== 

''String.toUpperCase( );''

This method returns a copy of the specified String, with all of the lowercase characters converted to uppercase. For example a string “Hello” will be converted to “HELLO”:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;Hello&quot;);
 2.   Trace(tmpString.toUpperCase());
&lt;/code&gt;

==== Properties ====

===== length ===== 

''String.length''

This method returns the length of the string. For example the length of string “hello” will be 5:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;hello&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpString.length);
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Data types ==

=== Number ===

In section [[../|General concepts and difference between Number and String data types]] you understood the difference between String and Number data types. Now we will analyze Number data type in details. The following is the structure of declaring Number variable:

 var &lt;name&gt; = new Number( [initnumber] );

The parameter &lt;name&gt; is the name of the variable you want to declare, and the parameter [initnumber] is the value you want the variable to be assigned when it is created. 

&lt;div id=&quot;mnumber&quot;&gt;

!Method || Description
|-
|toString ||returns the String representation of the specified String object.
|-
|valueOf ||returns the primitive value type of the specified Number object.
|}

===== toString =====

''String.toString( );''

This method returns the string representation of the specified String object. You already know the difference between Number and String objects so there is no need to explain why we need this method.

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var i = new Number(555);
 2.   trace(i.toString());
&lt;/code&gt;

===== valueOf =====

''String.valueOf( );''

This method returns the primitive value type of the specified Number variable (object).

=== Boolean ===

Now lets test the Boolean data type. Add a new button or movie clip in the scene and set its’ name to “testobject”, then open the actions of Frame 1 and write the following in Script pane:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var show = new Boolean(false);
 2.   testobject._visible = show;
&lt;/code&gt;

The first line declares a Boolean variable “show” and sets its’ value to “false”. In the third line we set “testobject’s” property “Visible” to the “show” variable we declared. If you test the movie you won’t see the “testobject”, because the show value is “false” but if you change the word “false” in line 1 to “true” then the object will be shown.

&lt;div id=&quot;mboolean&quot;&gt;

===== toString =====

''String.toString( );''

This method returns the string representation of the Boolean object. Now you ask why do you need to use this method if you can do without it by just writing for example: “x=x+true;”, where x is a String variable. To understand the use of “toString” method you must first understand the Boolean data type. Actually the Boolean data type is a masked number data type. The values “true” and “false” are numbers. “true” is 1 and “false” is 0. To test this, we can write a simple code:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var i = new Number();
 2.   i = false;
 3.   i = i + 0;
 4.   trace(i);
&lt;/code&gt;

If you run the program, you will see “0” in “output window”. Lets understand what we have done. First we declared a Number variable “i”, then assigned “false” to it. If you omit the third line, the output will be “false”. But what have we done? In line three we added 0 to variable “i”. Why have we done this? Because we wanted Flash to think that we added some number to variable “i” which would change the value of it. So it converted the stored “false” value to number and then added 0 to it. Briefly we made Flash convert the value “false” to number. If we write “true” instead of “false” in line 2, then you will see that the traced value is 1. This means that actually “true” and “false” values are numbers and correspondingly equal to 1 and 0.

===== valueOf =====

''String.valueOf( );''

This method returns true if the primitive value type of the specified Boolean object is true, false if it is false.


=== Date ===

This is a very complicated data type, it has 37 methods. Now we will learn some of them.

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var d = new Date();
 2.   
 3.   trace(&quot;Date: &quot; + d.toString());
 4.   trace(&quot;Hours: &quot; + d.getHours());
 5.   trace(&quot;Minutes: &quot; + d.getMinutes());
 6.   trace(&quot;Seconds: &quot; + d.getSeconds());
 7.   trace(&quot;Milliseconds: &quot; + d.getMilliseconds());
 8.   trace(&quot;Year: &quot; + d.getFullYear());
 9.   trace(&quot;Month: &quot; + d.getMonth());
 10.  trace(&quot;Date: &quot; + d.getDate());
 11.  trace(&quot;Day: &quot; + d.getDay());
&lt;/code&gt;

The first line declares a new Date variable “d”. So now the date is stored there. In lines 3-11 we trace the values of our “d” variable.

&lt;div id=&quot;mdate&quot;&gt;

{{Useful}}

This page describes in detail the process for nominating featured books.

== Featured books ==
'''[[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured books]]''' serve to highlight quality books that readers can learn from and authors should be inspired by. Books that have successfully been [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations|nominated]] by the community are listed for rotation on the [[Main Page]] and may be included on other pages as well.

== Criteria ==
What makes a book &quot;good enough&quot; to be featured is not specified, but some common general ideas are:

{{featured book criteria}}

Featured books that no longer meet the community's criteria should be withdrawn until the community is satisfied again. This process is intended to be fluid and not a big deal.

== Discussions ==
Anyone can nominate any book and participate in the discussion process at [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations]]. You should be prepared to defend your argument. [[Wikibooks:Decision making|The strength and quality of the arguments]] made decide what the outcome of the discussion is. A neutral person should determine what the consensus is. Reasonings or explanations should include &quot;{{tl|support}}&quot;, &quot;{{tl|oppose}}&quot;, &quot;{{tl|neutral}}&quot;, or simply &quot;{{tl|comment}}&quot; before it for convenience.

Where consensus is determine to support featuring, a {{tl|goodbook}} template for the book will be created and added to the appropriate places for rotation on Wikibooks' [[Main Page]], and {{tl|featured book}} added to the feature book's main page, talk page or some other page as desired by book contributors. Where consensus is determine to support withdrawing a featured book, the {{tl|goodbook}} template will be removed from rotation on Wikibooks' [[Main Page]], and {{tl|former featured book}} added to the book's main page, talk page or some other page as desired by book contributors. If you need help to add or remove a book from Wikibooks' [[Main Page]] rotation, you can [[WB:AN|ask an administrator]] for assistance.

{{tl|featured book candidate}} or {{tl|featured book removal}} should be added to a book's main page as appropriate to inform and encourage participation by the book's contributors. Nominations made in bad faith can be removed immediately. Criticisms from previous nominations should be addressed before nominating a book again.

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Goodbook/BOOKNAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is generally used to added featured books to rotation for Wikibooks' [[Main Page]], where BOOKNAME is the full book title. Goodbook needs a book cover image and a short summary describing the book's scope and audience. &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Goodbook/BOOKNAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; may be added to other organizational pages as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Data types ==

=== Arrays ===

Arrays are almost the most useful data type of all others. This data type was designed for keeping not one but many values in it. For  example you want to have 10 users’ names in variables. So you must declare 10 variables with different names. It will be hard for you do add another user. But using arrays you can just declare one variable and keep all 10 users’ names in it. Now we will learn how to use array and its methods.

 var users:Array = new Array();
 var users:Array = new Array(10);
 var users:Array = new Array(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;);

The example above shows you the usage of array. Line 1 just declares an array named “users”. Line 2 declares an array with 10 elements. This means that in that array can be kept 10 values at indexes 0 through 9. The first element in an array is always 0. Line 3 declares an array and sets its’ first 5 elements values. “c” will be the element with the index 2 in this array, because as we have already said the index of the first element in an array is always 0. Now lets write a small program to understand arrays better. Write the code written below to Frame 1 actions.

 1.   var users:Array = new Array(3);
 2.
 3.   users[0] = &quot;User 1&quot;;
 4.   users[1] = &quot;User 2&quot;;
 5.   users[2] = &quot;User 3&quot;;
 6.   
 8.   trace(users[0]);
 9.   trace(users[1]);
 10.  trace(users[2]);

In line 1 we declare array “users” which consists of 3 elements. In lines 3-5 we set “users” each element. If you have an array and you want to get or set any of its element then you must write the name of the array, then “[]” and the number of element inside the quotation marks (“[]”). For example in line 3 we set the first element of “users” to “User 1”. You can use arrays for storing any data in them. For example you have an array which consists only of 2 elements. You can set the first elements value a string (e.g. myArray[0] = “hello”) and the second element a number (e.g. myArray[1] = 5). And finally in the lines 8-11 we trace our “users” array. Now we will create a more complicated example. Follow the steps:

'''Step 1'''

Select the Text Tool [[Image:mfas_image006.jpg]] from the Toolbox and draw Text. Then select it and in the Properties window set its’ width to 80, height to 25, font size to 20 and change the Text Type to “Static Text”. Type “Number:” in it.

'''Step 2'''

Select the Text Tool [[Image:mfas_image006.jpg]] from the Toolbox and draw Text. Then select it and in the Properties window set its’ width to 30, height to 25, font size to 20, var to “input”, change the Text Type to “Input Text” and select “Show Border Around Text” button [[Image:mfas_image013.jpg]]. Place this Text near the previous Text. This will be our input field.

'''Step 3'''

Select the Text Tool [[Image:mfas_image006.jpg]] from the Toolbox and draw Text. Then select it and in the Properties window set its’ width to 110, height to 25, font size to 20, var to “output” and change the Text Type to “Dynamic Text”.  Place this Text under the two previous labels. The scene must look like this.

[[Image:mfas_image014.jpg]]

'''Step 4'''

Set the Fill Color to green and the Stroke Color to black. Then select the Rectangle Tool [[Image:mfas_image004.jpg]] in the Toolbox, click the “Round Rectangle Radius” button [[Image:mfas_image015.jpg]] in the Options window, set the “Corner Radius” to 5, press OK and draw a rectangle. Double click the rectangle you have drawn and set its width to 35 and height to 25. Select the Text Tool [[Image:mfas_image006.jpg]] from the Toolbox and draw Text. Then select it and in the Properties window set its’ width to 25, height to 18, font size to 13, color to red and change the Text Type to “Static Text”. Type “OK” in it and place it in the center of the rectangle. Now select the whole rectangle and this text (by dragging mouse) and convert it to button. In the “Convert to Symbol” dialog set the button’s name to “button” and press OK. Select the button you have created, place it near the Input Text and in the Property window set its name to “btnOK”. The scene must look like this.

'''Step 5'''

This is enough for our design. Now open the Frame 1 actions and type the following in the Script Pane:

 1.   var users:Array = new Array(4);
 2.   
 3.   users[0] = &quot;John&quot;;
 4.   users[1] = &quot;Amy&quot;;
 5.   users[2] = &quot;Smith&quot;;
 6.   users[3] = &quot;Jane&quot;;


Then right click “btnOK” and choose “Actions” to view its’ actions. In the Script pane type the following:

 1.   on (release) {
 2.      output = users[input];	
 3.   }

I think you understood everything. The first part of code was nearly the same as in the previous example, and in the second part of code we write a code which must be performed when the user click our “btnOK”. In lines 1 and 3 is written the beginning and the end of “release” event, and in line 2 we write the element of the “users” array which the user has written as “input” is the text which the user has written in the Input Text and “output” is the Dynamic Text in which the element of array is written.
The arrays can also be multidimensional. For example you have some users and their phone number and address. For not making 3 different arrays it is easier to create one multidimensional array. The example below shows how to do that.

 1.   var users:Array = new Array([&quot;User1&quot;,&quot;Phone1&quot;,&quot;Address1&quot;],
 2.                         [&quot;User2&quot;,&quot;Phone2&quot;,&quot;Address2&quot;],	
 3.                         [&quot;User3&quot;,&quot;Phone3&quot;,&quot;Address3&quot;]);
 4.   Trace(“Name: “ + users[0][0]);
 5.   Trace(“Phone: “ + users[0][1]);
 6.   Trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[0][2]);
 7.   Trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[1][0]);
 8.   Trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[1][1]);
 9.   Trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[1][2]);
 10.  Trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[2][0]);
 11.  Trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[2][1]);
 12.  Trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[2][2]);

In lines 1 to 3 we create a multidimensional array “users”. You can write all these lines in one line. The variable is declared in three lines because it is easier to read. If you combine these lines then the result will be a very long line. Why we don’t put “;” after each line? Because the lines 2 and 3 are the other parts of the main line. So by putting the “;” in the 3-rd line we tell the computer that this was the end. The program will think that this is only one line. Now lets understand how we create a multidimensional array. This is the type of writing multidimensional arrays:

 var &lt;array name&gt;:Array = new Array( [ &lt;first array&gt;, &lt;second array&gt;, &lt;…&gt; );

When you write “var myarray = new Array( [], [], [] );” you create an array with 3 subarrays. Imagine something like this:

* Myarray
** 0
*** value
** 1
*** value
** 2
*** value

If you write “var myarray:Array = new Array ( [ [], [] ], [], [ [] ] );” then this is something like this:

* myarray
** 0
*** 0
**** value
*** 1
**** value
** 1
*** value
** 2
*** 0
**** value

This is like there is a folder, in which there are three folders. In the first folder there are two folders, in the third folder there is one folder. So if you want to get value from the second folder of the first folder then you must write “myarray[0][1]”. We do the same in our example. If we draw the structure of our array then it will be:

*	users
**	0
***	0
****	User1
***	1
****	Phone1
***	2
****	Address1
**	1
***	0
****	User2
***	1
****	Phone2
***	2
****	Address2
**	2
***	0
****	User3
***	1
****	Phone3
***	2
****	Address3

In this structure you see that the names on folders are only numbers. You can also give them names by writing the following:

&lt;code&gt;
 1.   var users:Array = new Array( { name: &quot;U1&quot;, phone: &quot;P1&quot;, address: &quot;A1&quot;},
 2.                          { name: &quot;U2&quot;, phone: &quot;P2&quot;, address: &quot;A2&quot;},
 3.                          { name: &quot;U3&quot;, phone: &quot;P3&quot;, address: &quot;A3&quot;} );
 4.   trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[0][&quot;name&quot;]);
 5.   trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[0][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 6.   trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[0][&quot;address&quot;]);
 7.   trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[1][&quot;name&quot;]);
 8.   trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[1][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 9.   trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[1][&quot;address&quot;]);
 10.  trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[2][&quot;name&quot;]);
 11.  trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[2][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 12.  trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[2][&quot;address&quot;]);
&lt;/code&gt;

In the previous example we used “[ ]” for making new arrays. But if you want to give names to arrays you must use “{ }” instead of “[ ]”. If we were writing values after “[]” then now we must first write the name of the folder without quotes (“”) then put “: ” after the name and write the value in the quotes. If you want to add more values then you must put “,” and do the same. But if you give names to the arrays you must get their value also by using their names. If we make the structure of this example then it will be:

*	Users
**	0
***	name
****	“U1”
***	phone
****	“P1”
***	address
****	“A1”
**	1
***	name
****	“U2”
***	phone
****	“P2”
***	address
****	“A2”
**	2
***	name
****	“U3”
***	phone
****	“P3”
***	address
****	“A3”

===== Length =====

This property returns the length of the specified array. The following code illustrates the use of property “Length”:

 1.   var tmpArray:Array = new Array(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;);
 2.   trace(tmpArray.length);

The output is 3.

== help requested ==
I have recently finished to write a book on [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]] in Russian wikibook [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]]. I want to find somebody to translate it to English. Can you help me with this?
P.S. I am interesting to write some books on math and computer science. On math I am currently working on [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]] and on computer science on [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] and [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (all this is on currently on hold). In my English texts I have a lot of grammar mistakes, so I need somebody to correct one. I want that all that I am writing will be on English. It can be translating of written on another language text or original text. 

P.P.S. I have some material on math in Hebrew. Also hebrew wikibook has some material. It can be nice, while not mandatory, if you will know Hebrew too.

Я недавно закончил писать книгу в русском викиучебнике  [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]] . Я хотел бы найти кого-то ктобы перевёл бы его на английский [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]]. Не могли бы вы мне в этом помочь? 
P.S. Я хочу написать пару книг по математике и компьютерным наукам (программированию). По математике я начал работать над [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]], а по компьютерным наукам над  [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] и [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (пока я оставил это). Я пишу на английском со многими грамматическими ошибками, мне нужен кто-то, чтобы их исправлять. Я хочу, чтобы все мои книги были на английском. Это может быть как перевода с другого языка, так и оригинальный, изначально написанный на английском текст.
P.P.S. По математике, у меня часть материала на иврите, да и в ивритском викиучебнике можно взять. Было бы прекрасно, если бы вы владели также ивритом. Но вовсе не обязательно. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 16:01, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
This book is intended as a compendium to the Movie Making Manual, or a ‘Volume 2’ which addresses the specific needs and concerns of Digital Video Production in contrast to using film as a recording medium.  Digital Video uses the common abbreviation of DV, and this book will use DV and DVP (Digital Video Production) frequently.  Many of the concepts and techniques used for creating moving images using film is the same or similar as when using DV, however many tools and techniques used for each medium are specific to that application.  This book concentrates specifically on video production techniques concentrating on digital video rather than analog since analog is all but an obsolete technology.  This book also assumes the reader is at least somewhat proficient with the basic terminology of video production and computer use so not every little thing will be spelled out, however there is an appendix with abbreviations, definitions, and terms to assist as much as possible.

[[Movie Making Manual/Digital Video/Introduction|Previous | Introduction]]

==Analog vs. Digital==
Digital information recording is an evolution from analog which is most heavily influenced by computers and their popularity and accessibility.  Originally video production had a large gambit of machines and electronics specifically created for that industry.  As computers became more advanced, cheaper, and more accessible applications for the computer spread to almost every industry.  The widespread application of computers for manipulation of video was hampered because video requires relatively massive storage, processing, and data transfer requirements.  As hardware has become cheaper and more powerful, and storage space in particular has become plentiful, using a computer to manipulate video has become more economically viable than not.  Currently video production is towards the end of a transition in technology from an analog based system to a digital based system.

==Digital==
===Why use digital?===
Digital has advantages and disadvantages like any tool, but the general consensus is that digital is better, and for good reason. In post-production of analog video, there are basically two editing options.  There is ''assemble'' (aka ''linear'') editing, in which the final product is assembled from the various pieces in order from the beginning to end.  If a change needs to be made at any point, then everything from that point to the end of the change must be recreated from the original source material. This, of course, is problematic if the needs of the production are the least bit dynamic. [[w:Avid Technology|Avid]] was the first popular computer based “nonlinear” editing application, originally created for film editing. It was a small step toward moving into professional video editing applications. Non-linear editing allows the editor to “ripple” an insert so that everything that comes after the change is shifted to accommodate the shift.  As computer-based editing became more popular, the choices were either staying with the hardware controlled tape-to-tape linear systems or digitizing the analog footage into a computer for digital editing. Since computers are digital systems--not analog--the video signal is translated into a digital signal. The evolutionary step was a short one to have the video signal recorded in a digital format.

==Analog==
===Limitations of Analog===
When using an analog system, there are some major inherent limitations that can be problematic. The first is when you’re editing video the process doesn’t take the physical tape material, slice it with a razor, and combine it with other clips as one would with film.  Rather a VTP would read the information from the source tape and send the signal to a VTR, which would record the signal onto a new tape.  This is called a &quot;generation&quot; and analog has a tendency of not making a 100% exact copy during this process.  As video is pushed through more and more generations, the signal degrades until it is essentially unrecognizable. There are tools that help reduce this--like waveform monitors, signal amplifiers, etc.--but most analog video is unusable after 5 to 10 generations (for professional standards).  On the other hand, as long as the information isn’t reprocessed (such as in color correction, transitions, etc.) DV can withstand dozens of generations and some manufacturers have reported over 100 generations with no perceptible loss in picture quality. **citation needed**  On the other hand, there are limitations to a digital system mainly in regards to sample rates and aliasing.  However as the delivery of the video signal is not analog anyway (pixels) digital information processing on these discrete units seems to make the most sense.

==Production Process==
The production process in video is very similar to film.  This is due to many reasons, but the main one is that motion pictures have created a workflow process that makes sense and works.  Therefore video productions generally proceed through the following phases: Development, Preproduction, Production, Postproduction, and Distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Performing an oil change on your own automobile can be a fun, albeit sometimes messy, and cost effective way to ensure long term reliability. Changing any given vehicles oil is a very basic procedure and, when done carefully, even the novice mechanic can complete the job in under 30-45 minutes. 
The first step to performing an oil change for the Honda Accord lies in the preparation. Ensure you have a quality floor jack with a weight rating of acceptable strength to lift the front of the vehicle. Once the vehicle is lifted jack-stands will also be needed to support the car. 
Some other tools needed to complete the task include an oil filter wrench, a catch bin to recover the drained oil, and a set of metric sockets with a ratchet, or metric wrenches.

Of course you will also need to purchase new oil and a new oil filter as well. Most four cylinder automobile engines will call for around four quarts but always be sure to check the Honda specifications for the precise amount required. As stated before a new filter is needed as well and should at least meet if not exceed OEM quality for its contaminant trapping ability. This simply refers to the filters ability to trap particles which if left to circulate the oiling system, could damage critical engine components.  

Once you have all the tools and parts needed to complete the procedure it's time to get to work. Begin by finding a solid level surface where the job can be performed. Once the car is in position turn off the engine and engage the emergency brake. Next, slide the floor-jack under the front of the vehicle being careful not to scrape the front valance as it tends to hang low on accords, this is particularly true for body styles from 1994 and later. The floor-jack must be squarely situated on the frame or cross-member to support the weight of the vehicle when it is lifted.

== Is there a local wiki viewer? ==

Is there a program that I can run on my computer and that displays wiki source (input) as it shows up on wikibooks (or wikipedia)? Your help is greatly appreciated. In case this question has already been answered (I have searched without success) then my apologies and please point me to the answer.--[[User:Koantum|Koantum]] 04:00, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:Are you looking for something that renders the finished product, or are you looking for something that only downloads the wiki source text? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:55, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

Either case, you can use eclipse editor and use plog4u plugin for wikipedia.  With this you can do both edit the source in Raw format and preview your work inside the editor. [[Image:Eclipse.png|thumb|right]]  Download the eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org and visit http://www.plog4u.org to download the plugin to render wiki source.

== VfDs - a third way? ==
As some may know I've taken some interest in this process recently.  By and large the views of the community are clear.  However I see one at the moment which - to me - does not have that clarity.  The page was listed for VfD and then when the process was effectively complete and an editor arrived who wished to address the problem.  That editor acknowledges that the task will not be easy.  By way of a test I have suspended that vote for one month.  I do realise that we could close it as keep and then re-list but this way seems to leave some pressure on the editor and us to review the matter in a timely way.  As with everything here this is not a concrete action so if anyone wishes to revert it the link you need is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion&amp;oldid=664651] (assuming no other edits since).  However if you do revert it please come up with a way of dealing with what I am sure is a rare event in a fair and positive way.  I was going to put the Future in this category too but having read the recent comments I ain't that brave! Over to you folk, thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

:It's generally my position that it is better to improve an existing article then to delete it outright, although I also acknowledge that some books simply will not be improved ever. However, if there is an editor who is active, and who claims to want to help, i say we should certainly let them try. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:46, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

: I agree with Whiteknight's position above. I do think it is a difficult task to deceide whether a book is likely to be improved. I'm unsure if a month-long waiting period would be constructive but don't think it would be too bad to close the debate with a note that the consensus is that the book needs to be improved if it should be allowed to stay. If we implement the sub-page method, past VfDs will be easy to find. The page won't be listed anywhere (though the sub-page could be categorized) and would only be renominated someone noticed it again (if no-one does, it hardly is harming anyone, right?). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:53, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

::I guess I would see it as a very rare event (in this case the VfD was actually closed when an editor arrived and wanted to improve it).  I looked at [[User talk:Sean Heron]] where you had posted and the editor responded with the fact it was going to take time.  Delete didn't seem right and keep - I would argue - was against what had been the closure, I thought compromise might be useful.  Personally I still think it should be deleted and that, given a continuing lack of editing, it will be - but I'm trying to be less of a deletionist than I am! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== Newbies and page naming ==

No idea what to do about this but I guess there must have been around 6 folk in the past three or four days who I've seen not following naming policy on a new book (or existing one) by not having subpages correctly named (they leave them as additional book names).  I have always placed the welcome template plus a bit more info on naming so far but it seems pretty consistent (mis)behavior.  Any thoughts? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

:Often this happens because people use redlinks to make a new page... the TOC of a new book often lists the planned chapters just using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[chapter]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; rather than &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/chapter/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../chapter/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It's one of the major differences between wikimarkup here and wikimarkup on Wikipedia. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

::Kinda &quot;bites&quot; newbie a bit but a great start from my point of view.

::How about seeing if one of the bots can have a feature added to take care of this? Renaming pages that are not following proper naming convention and fixes page links to follow the proper naming convention. Maybe even inform the major contributors or mention it on the book's main talk page when its done. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:59, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

:::So a template for the book talk pages - good idea.

:::Yeah, on both counts... we should probably have a short, to-the-point help page about naming and linking to book chapters to link from (a friendlier version of) that template.

::I think the idea of a &quot;help book&quot; is a good idea. We can get around Johnny's objection by breaking the help pages into neat little chapters, and people can pick and choose what chapters to read or not read. We can have a central TOC for the help book, and arrange the topics by order of importance, with the chapters that are most important to a newbie at the top, and the more esoteric help topics at the bottom. It would work like a set of individual &quot;help pages&quot;, but with the added organizational structure that is expected in a book.

They are Image:Brazil flag medium.png, Image:Portugal flag medium.png, Image:Angola flag medium.png, Image:Mozambique flag medium.png, Image:Guinea bissau flag medium.png, Image:East timor flag medium.png, Image:Cape verde flag medium.png, and Image:SãoTomé and P flag medium.png.

== Software documentation ==

I'd like the community's oppinion on whether software documentation is within the scope of the Wikibooks project.

I [[Special:Search/documentation|found]] a few documentation wikibooks around but not wanting to fall for the [[w:Is-ought_problem|is-ought fallacy]] and since I found the line drawn at game guides might just separate it from the &quot;educational material&quot; fundamental rule, I thought I'd request comments.

The software in question is called ''uim'' (Universal Input Method) and is used to input characters not available directly throught the keyboard mapping (e.g. a latin keyboard can then be used to input \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a\u3001\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca\u3068\u6f22\u5b57). The documentation will introduce the concepts of Input Methods, how uim implements these, which tools are a part of it and how to use and customize it.

I see this as a good addition to Wikibooks as think it could well benefit the human condition. My caution is largely due to my desire not to get this into trouble some months down the road. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

:For myself, I would think that software documentation is completely within the perview of Wikibooks.  The issues related to the computer video game books, however, would suggest that there is certainly an element within the Wikibooks community that would feel different from myself, especially as I was a very outspoken supporter of keeping the video game guides on Wikibooks.  I do think, however, that you can make a case that computer software documentation is much more likely to be used in a textbook situation than perhaps a guide to playing the World of Warcraft, but I think it is mainly a matter of perspetive and the sort of computer software you are describing.

:You are very justified with your fears that such content might be deleted some time down the road, and it is reasonable to ask the Wikibooks community this question in general, as the issue from my perspetive has not been completely resolved.  The whole wording of the anti-video games policy is so vague that from a certain point of view you could say that a book about Microsoft Word should be deleted as it describes a walk-through of some computer software.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:38, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

::I agree wholeheartedly that software guides should be included. They are instructional resources, they teach valuable subjects (well, for some software). However, due to the original research clause, it's probably against policy to write a users manual for a peice of software that doesnt currently have documentation. Also, wikibooks shouldnt be a webhost for software projects that want to write documentation for new software. However, for popular software packages, additional wiki documentation could be a wonderful thing. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:26, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Regarding the original research clause, it has been discussed here in the Staff Lounge an also on [[Wikibooks talk:Original research]] that the phrase original research is not necessarily fitting for Wikibooks as it is for Wikipedia. [[User:SBJohnny|SBJohnny]] listed a number of things which would (and therefore currently do) fall under original research. These include projects which are well accepted projects. I proposed that we limit the clause to ''scientific'' research. I never followed up on that and since [[Wikibooks:Original research]] hasn't seen much action lately, I'll take that suggestion to [[WB:WIW]].
::: &quot;''wikibooks shouldnt be a webhost''&quot;. Though I understand the argument that people shouldn't use Wikibooks just to save themselves space, I think we should judge the worth of a book on its potential, not the authors' alternative hosting facilities. I'd liken software projects to class projects both of which would be developing the document outside Wikibooks if they could not use the venue and are creating quite specific projects to which perhaps no-one outside that group might be qualified to contribute. I hope that software developers will be as warmly welcomed to Wikibooks as classes have been.
::: &quot;''However, for popular software packages''&quot;. A few questions: Why is popular important? If an obscure book is educational, that should be grounds for keeping it with the project (we have a book on stamp collecting, for god's sake! &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt;). How would you propose to measure the popularity (as a percentage of: the human population, those who have access to it, those who use that type of software, those who run the platform for which it is available, etc. or some combination of these)? What happens if the popularity wanes?
::: Furthermore; the software I proposing the documentation of enables east asians to write Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters using a western keyboard. The people living in these countries (and this doesn't take into account expatriates) represent over 23% of the world population. Given the fast rise of China, the low price of *nix software and China's look to Linux as their OS of choice (mainly, I understand, for transparency reasons), a user handbook ''could'' become enormously popular. If we wait till the software is popular, there will be far less need for it and few would read it.
::: I don't mean the last paragraph to be an argument for acceptance, but an example of how difficult it would be to estimate the prospective popularity of new software.
::: Thank you both for your comments on this issue. I think it is a very important task to get these issues sorted out. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:46, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== VfD page ==

Ok sorry about it but don't hire a cleaner if you don't want the rubbish dealt with!  The category revealed a number of pages still tagged that weren't current.  Basically bad closings and an odd one that never made it to the listing.  I've done some but have stopped or the page will be overwhelmed.  So
# Try and get these cleared as quick as we can so that we can focus on current stuff
# Please someone clear the games ones up.  As I said on the RfA page - close them one way or another - it isn't my subject.  This will allow us to focus on actual current ones.

Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:57, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

:OK the category now only contains current listings (other than query listed below).  So anyone placing a VfD and not listing it or closing a VfD without finishing properly (removed VfD tag and place survived tag) will have me after them! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:03, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

OK I reckon this is a wind up to test cleaners - I just can't see the punch line!  It was marked for VfD in 2004 - the archives don't go back that far.  Do I list it or just removed the tag --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:57, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

:While I do think it is a good idea it looks as though you maybe taking on rather a lot of new projects.  You have started some very big books however most of them seem to have mostly headings and sub headings.  Would it not be better to work on these before tackling new ones? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:01, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with what you say. I will just continue working on those projects. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 13:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

::I've been in this same boat, where I've started a large number of books, but I simply don't have the time/energy to work on all of them. To that extent, some of my books have become really good, but others have stagnated. A suggestion which I have, and that I definately think you would benefit from, is that you should create outlines for books that you want to create in the future on your user page. Once you have outlines written out, post messages here and on talk pages to invite other editors to read over your outlines and make suggestions. Once you have your outlines created, and you have attracted some interest from other contributors, you can introduce your new books, one at a time, at regular intervals (I know I was trying to create 1 new book every month, for a while, but I havent created a new one recently). This way, When you have time to create a new book, you can simply introduce one of your outlines, and when you dont have time, your other ideas don't become stubs and get deleted. Read my [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|Guide for writing new books]], for some suggestions about the process. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:34, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Intermediate Mathematics - Wikijunior ==

I would like to suggest a vote if immediate action can be made to form a mathematics book on Wikijunior. This is an effort to lay foundations for other books to be made, to focus on the deprived area of textbooks and to compile a book which is generic in its syllabus. This book will be made on Wikijunior, aimed at 11 - 14 with older and younger editions to be made after this is completed, though I will also need for Wikijunior to extend their age range. I will be gratetful if voting can commence here now as well as at the following link [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Wikijunior:New_Title_Suggestions#Wikijunior_Intermediate_Mathematics new title suggestions.] --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 19:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

: You could create the book and list in the [[Wikijunior/Non-Canonical_Books|non-canonical books]] list, especially if you plan on writing a substantial amount of content yourself. The subject seems extremely broad to me. There is a book that is currently second in the voting for next quarter (beginning in January) called &quot;[[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:New_Book_of_the_Quarter/2006-4th_Quarter_Vote#Fifth_Grade_Math|Fifth Grade Math]]&quot; you might consider supporting that book. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 23:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
::When I have the time I will produce the book on Wikibooks mostly with the aid of my notes. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 00:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I notice that user 82.10.207.212 has requested a speedy delete for this book - [[Wikijunior_Mathematics]] - whoever this user is says that the book should not be there because it's not passed the 'candidate process'... does this seem fair? this book was created by a new user and this just scares people away.  I created my book [[Wikijunior_Europe]] only a few days and I didn't pass the candidate process vote either.  Is this actual Wikibook policy or are there special rules for Wikijunior? [[User:Xania|Xania]] 00:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

::::The speedy delete tag was not appropriate for any number of reasons in my view. Personally, I'm against deleting books simply because they didn't follow the new title policy. I only speak for myself, though. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::I dont think there are specific rules for wikijunior, but the candidate voting was created to ensure that all new wikijunior books would get good attention from the community.

== Help page project ==

This has come up in several topics on this page... since we seem to have given up on the policy of the week for a while, maybe we could collaborate instead on help pages, welcoming new users, etc. A lot of this of course relies on policies, but we can double up on that when the need arises. 

One way we could try to organise it is to build a wikiproject on this, nominate candidates for collaboration there, and then announce them here (whichever one has the most votes). [[Wikibooks:Wikiproject on Help Pages]] seems as good a name as any, [[WB:HP]] for a shortcut. 

I think this would be helpful, because most of the folks posting on the SL these days are interested in getting new contributors to the project, and having the help section well organised could go a long way towards that. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Ummm ... I don't mean to bite, but could you please clarify the purpose of this? And who is {{User|The Staff}}? Herby? We already have a list of wikibookians (can't remember where), general staff discussion takes place here and specific discussions (such as wikiproject) should rather take place on specific pages (in the project namespace). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:38, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

: &quot;''since we seem to have given up on the policy of the week for a while''&quot;. &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt; Yes, this is largely my fault as I haven't resumed this work since my brief time off WB. I think the help pages are in dire need for work, but still feel I'd like to concentrate my efforts on policy for now. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:38, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

::I guess all I can say is go take a look at the [[Wikibooks:Wikiproject on Help Pages]].  We need to involve more people.  We may have a list of wikibookians but the one I'm working on is current/active ones who may wish to know more.  We need to talk to people and we need &quot;staff&quot; however you define that.  The project is Johnny's so at least I can't be blamed for that!  BTW  don't consider I'm bitten but back into the &quot;doghouse&quot; for now! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:45, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Winter break is coming up for me within the next few weeks, and I am going to have plenty of time to really get my hands dirty around here.

== [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]] ==

I would like to make this page more active, posting messages and news to the bulletin board. Also, I would like to encourage all wikibookians, big and small, to watch that page for changes. If you have a peice of news (new book, new policy, new admins, big changes, etc), post a quick message on the bulletin board. Hopefully, this will be a method that all wikibookians can stay involved in the project. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Changing the Sidebar ==

I would like to propose a few changes to the sidebar:
#Remove Wikistudy and Wikiprofessional, because neither of these are particularly popular, and don't necessarily warrant links on the sidebar.
#Change &quot;Books by subject&quot; to &quot;All Bookshelves&quot;, or simply &quot;Bookshelves&quot;.
#Change &quot;Books near completion&quot; to &quot;Featured Books&quot;
#Add a link to [[WB:BB|the bulletin board]] to the &quot;Community&quot; section.
#Remove the link &quot;Catalogue&quot; from the &quot;Tools&quot; section. The card catelog office simply isn't maintained, and it is linked to from the community portal.
What do people think about these changes? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:36, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
* Fully agree with this suggestion --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

: I believe in addition to the above changes that:
:# Remove the &quot;books alphabetically&quot; link, also not maintained.
:# Community should be combined with the Navigation sidebar.
:# Tools should be combined with the Toolbox sidebar.

:This means that combined with the above changes we could have something like:

:Navigation
:* main page
:* help
:* bulletin board
:* staff lounge
:* community portal
:* wikijunior
:* bookshelves
:* featured books
:* donations

:Toolbox
:* recent changes
:* what links here
:* related changes
:* module cleanup
:* user contributions
:* email this user
:* printable version
:* upload file
:* special pages

:::: One of the problems with WB and attracting people here is that it's hard to define exactly what should be in this project.  Cookbook recipes are a fine examples of things which are popular and part of this project so maybe we should link to the Cookbook from the sidebar?  It's just a thought but what do y'all think?  It's certainly busier than 'Wikistudy' or 'Wikiprofessional'. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:34, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== Refactoring ==

I feel that my previous question (up the page), &quot;Obsolete naming schemes,&quot; is totally unnecessary now, as it was answered extemporaneously and sets no major or minor precedent. Is it therefore appropriate to refactor it out? I hardly doubt that it would matter...but I checked, and the proposed [[Wikibooks:Talk page|talk page guideline]] was rejected with the note on the [[Wikibooks talk:Talk page|talk page]] that &quot;we all have the gist of this one. It doesnt need to be an actual policy.&quot; Anyways, since it was a question totally unrelated to any now- or previously-existing article, policy, image, etc., I was intending to refactor it out. Comments? Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 08:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== Redesigning top of Main Page? ==

Hi all,

I propose we redesign the top of the main page. You can see my proposed changes at [[Template_talk:Main_Page_introduction#Redesign]]. What do you think? Cheers, [[User:Unforgettableid|Unforgettableid]] 01:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

:Hey Unforgettableid. I took a look at this design, and I have to admit that I dont particularly like it. I most don't like that you pointed all those links to wikipedia, when some of them should have pointed to local pages ([[Wikibooks:About]], for instance). The design isn't bad, but it also isnt much different from the current version. Also, I think I like the current wording better. Sorry! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:24, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

::I have to agree with Whitenight. We don't want the first links on our site to be to another orginization, who's content we have no control over. If we Wikibooks users don't like our About page, we can simply change it. If we don't like the Wikipedia article about Wikibooks, we'd have to work with the Wikipedia community to make changes, and there's no guarantee that it would end up exactly correct. Additionally, our &quot;about&quot; page can be directed to new users, encouraging them to participate, while Wikipedia's article on us would contain lots of information, but wouldn't take an opinion on whether someone should be involved or not as that would violate their NPOV policy. I also like the wording the way it is better than the proposed verbage. Nice try, keep thinking of ways to help improve Wikibooks. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== How to view/understand Edits (NOT in history) ==  
Hi, I recently made a change to &quot;How to start a Wiki.&quot; It was under the Pick a License section ([[Wiki_Science:How_to_start_a_Wiki#Things_to_do_immediately_after_starting_a_wiki]]): the issue is that for a newbie (the intended audience), a guide telling him/her to simply pick a license is not really helpful. Where do you find said licenses, what are their main differences, when, at what step do you pick such a license, are these included in wiki software? A small clarification/guidance would be very helpful.

The changes I had made are no longer visible, but why is this not in the page history? Is there a better area to address this then in that very section?

== Orphaned fair use images ==

I have come across a couple of orphaned fair use images. Wikibooks, as far as I know, does not have a template like {{[[:w:Template:Orphaned fairuse not replaced]]}}. Is there a need for one? Or should I just report orphaned fair use images to an admin and let he or she delete them? I rather like the latter option, because it seems to be [[:meta:instruction creep|instruction creep]] to create new templates immediately when ''small'' problems arise.

:I would note that this is something that other than for the most general information would have to be kept updated on an annual basis and need huge maintainance in order to stay relevant.  On the other hand, this is something that is almost ideal as an electronic reference as dead-tree versions of this sort of content is bound to go out of date much faster, and as a wiki can even be updated for changes to the tax code that happened this week.  So yes, I would strongly recommend that if you (or others) want to get a book like this going on Wikibooks, please do so.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:23, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

== Scrapbooks ==

I've been thinking for a while about what to do with &quot;abandoned&quot; stubs, book fragments, transwikis, and so on, and I'm wondering if we could maybe start organizing these into &quot;scrapbooks&quot;.

I'm thinking the scrapbooks could be organized to follow the top categories first, then subcategories when they get too big. Once the scrapbooks are together, we could have some sort of templates to use to alert new book authors to the existence of these scrapbooks, so they can sift through them and potentially save a lot of work for themselves, as well as cleaning out the scrapbooks. 

Any thoughts? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:29, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

:In principle - very good idea.  I am a deletionist (slightly) but at least that way they would be collected together.  Drawing new authors attention to this is great (see [[Wikibooks:Wikiproject on Help Pages]]) for more on that. That said I think a discussion is required about categories.  I pointed an editor here [[Category talk:Main page]] yesterday and think we should all have a look at how cats are being used (I won't mention alpha cat'ing honest). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:44, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

::I agree with this point completely. I had suggested something like this a long time ago, but that suggestion was lost in the midst of a bigger conversation. Books that are stubs, but which do have some valuable content should definately be saved rather then deleted. At least, we should save the content, and not the lousy stub-book structure. Each bookshelf could get a scrapbook, and we could simply dump content into the scrap book that isn't a book, but which really doesnt need to be deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Yeah, that's the goal... organise the &quot;abandoned&quot; stuff into a useful form. I'll try to make some headway on that in the how-tos category, which definitely needs it. Someone else will have to do the programming stuff though :).

::::On a little more thought, I think this might be a good use of the colon convention, because it can make a pseudonamespace that will be easily identifiable yet not make the top link go back to the main scrapbook page. E.g.: [[Scrapbook:Foo/Bar]] rather than [[Scrapbook/Foo/Bar]]. That way [[Scrapbook:Foo]] would be the bookname, rather than &quot;Foo&quot; being rendered as a scrapbook chapter.

:::::: I like that idea a lot, Darklama. I get the sense that we don't need more pages to maintain right now.

=====Scrapbooks continued=====
Well, the category should be wherever the content belongs, e.g. a programming scrapbook would go in the programming category. Categorizing them in a special cat would more or less just end up hiding them in an even less-travelled corner. Template's definitely a good idea though. 

Iamunknown: hrm? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:46, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

: ''Iamunknow: hrm?'' what? I'm confused. :S And I tend to disagree with my previous statement that we only have cats. I just fear that the list will not be judiciously maintained enough. If we had a couple of dedicated librarians like was going to happen at [[WB:CCO]], I would be less reluctant to have lists. It makes sense tho. Maybe if we use a {{scrapbook}} template, there can be conspicuous text ''imploring'' the user who decides to become an active contributor to ''please'' remove the title from the scrapbook list. Or maybe we can ask them to not remove the scrapbook, but instead to let someone else do it, or to request at a certain page that the scrapbook be removed. I don't know. Again, my only reluctance is that these lists would become outdated and useless. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== BOTM and COTM, January ==

I wasn't here at the beginning of the month, and it seems that somebody has already updated the BOTM and COTM listings for December. I'm not going to change that now, even though we had agreed here that we would suspend both these projects for the month of december. I have therefore erased the content of the BOTM and COTM voting pages for january, and posted a message that we would not be having BOTM or COTM winners for that month. In the time between now and January, I want to suggest we discuss a few things:

#I would like to replace the BOTM and COTM projects entirely with a continuous method for listing books that are (a) &quot;good books&quot; (previously BOTM candidates), and (b) &quot;books needing collaboration&quot; (previously COTM candidates). These books could then be listed en masse on the main page (which is better then only having two books on the main page, i think).
#Cleanup the help pages to make them more &quot;helpful&quot;. 
#Fix any loose ends we have with policy
#Work to increase wikibooks membership/contributors.

I think these are much better uses of our time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:51, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

: I'm not sure if completely removing the BOTM and COTM is a good idea. As for me, when more books are marked on the main page as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;needing collaboration&quot;, they do not seem as special as when only one book is given a certain title. We should make a clear distinction between &quot;normal&quot; books and &quot;special&quot; books, so that the &quot;special&quot; books gather more attention. Similarly, people get more attracted to presidential ellections rather than parliamentary ones, because there is one, discrete candidate. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:43, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

::That's true, but from the pool of &quot;good books&quot;, we could easily select a particular book to spotlight. This would be similar to the way that en.wikipedia handles it's &quot;Today's Featured Article&quot; on the main page: A list of &quot;Good articles&quot; are compiled, and from that list, a random entry is selected to be displayed on the main page. Depending on the popularity of the project, we could rotate out books monthly, weekly, or even daily, so that a number of books received a large spotlight on the main page. 
::Basically I am trying to make two points:
::#BOTM and COTM winners are typically decided with very few votes, and they also draw very little special attention to themselves. We need to make it easier for books to get recognized, and we need to get more support for projects like this.
::#The time that is spent prepating the BOTM and COTM templates and voting and lists, etc, along with the space that they take up on the main page could be better put to use for other projects, at least for 1 month. We can start BOTM and COTM back up in February, if we decide to.
::I'm just trying to find ways to get more people involved here at wikibooks. The current BOTM and COTM projects aren't doing a good job of that, and so I am looking for alternatives. If we can't find good alternatives, we can bring BOTM and COTM back. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:43, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Book Creation Program ==

I have started laying the groundwork for a new program, an &quot;Automatic Book Creator&quot;. This program will be used to create new books according to established norms and style guidelines. My plan for this program is to include the aility to create a new book from an outline. This would mean that the program will:
#Create a table of contents for the new book
#Create a TOC template for the book, to be optionally included on every page.
#Create a navigation template for the book, to be optionally included on the top and bottom of every page, with optional &quot;next&quot;, and &quot;previous&quot; links.
#Create a printable version of the book, transcluding all the pages from the TOC
#Create all subpages for the book (no red links), with each page containing the navigation and TOC templates, if desired. Also, subheadings in the page could be specified from the outline.
#Create all necessary categories for the book, including a category for related images, stub pages, etc. Also, creating a stub template for the book.
#Place the new book on an approprate bookshelf, add it to the alphabetical list of books, and add it to the new book template on the main page.
My idea is that this program could help to standardize the book creation process, and reinforce some of the known &quot;best practices&quot; when creating new books. I'm going to start working on this today, does anybody have any suggestions? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:16, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

::Sorry about the long delay, I dont tend to check the messages at the top of the staff lounge with any regularity. I had a basic prototype version of this program done, but it doesnt work as well as I would like it to, and I have more features to add to it. I had basically given up on working on it recently in favor of other projects. Since there is still some interest in it, however, I will pick it up again once I get back home (after christmas). The way it is now (in case anybody wants to start writing up outlines of it in anticipation is as follows:

 text of main page TOC
 
 =Page 1=
 text on page 1
 
 =Page 2=
 text on page 2
 
 {Template 1}
 text of template 1
 
 ...

:All the first level-headings are converted into pages, and the text directly under the first level headings will be moved onto that page. Templates are defined using a single set of curly brackets (to avoid confusion with templates included in the page text). There are also a few special characters that are denoted with a forward slash and capital letters. For instance, to create a basic book, we would write:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 == Table of contents ==
 {{MyBookPage}}
 \TOC
 [[Category:My Book|{{PAGENAME}}]]
 = Page 1 =
 {{MyBookPage}}
 This is page 1
 = Page 2 = 
 {{MyBookPage}}
 This is page 2
 {MyBookPage}
 {| style=&quot;whatever&quot;
 |-
 |\TOC
 |}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Books on Chemical Engineering ==
As a newcomer I briefly looked at the set of books in the Engineering group. Although there is a section called Chemical Engineering, it looks like there are actually no books or even segments contributed under this heading. Did I just not find them, or are there really no entries in this part of the library?  Many of the subjects taught in Chemical Engineering programs at the University are treated in the section called Mechanical Engineering, and this is consistent taxonomy.  However, as a Chemical Engineer, I would like to see some content in the Chemical Engineering area.  

One unique feature of the Chemical Engineering approach to study of the engineering sciences is the organization of principles into &quot;Unit Operations&quot;.  This structure is a hallmark of Chemical Engineering and the focal point of the Chemical Engineering curriculum in most colleges.  I was really surprised to find that clicking on that keyword in the Chemical Engineering section outline produced the blank page response.

For some time I have had thoughts about writing a book and did actually prepare outlines and some selected partial texts in the past. However, nothing was ever completed or advanced beyond the scrap notes in my files.  With this new-found system of Wikibooks the opportunity to create a book seems more realizable.  I have an idea to create a book in the Wikibooks library appropriate to the Chemical Engineering profession.  

The book I have in mind would treat the history of Chemical Engineering and its impact on commerce, not the technological and engineering principles.  I think this could be made very readable and could provide insight to the place of Chemical Engineering in the evolution of modern industry and consumer product developments.  Some books have been published on this topic, but I think the subject has not been presented comprehensively.

If there are others that would like to join in this effort I would like to see your comments and ideas for the book. [[User:Joconco22|Joconco22]] 17:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)joconco22

:The sad fact is that there aren't many engineers on wikibooks. Before I joined, the Electrical Engineering section was almost completely empty, except for a few stubs and outlines. I don't want to sound arrogant, but if I hadn't written alot of material on the subject myself, the EE section would still likely be very empty. None of the other engineering disciplines have any good material yet. The ME department has some material, but it's deceptive, because there are many books, but they are all poor. The CE department is in a similar boat (CE = Civil). If you have the time/drive/energy to write a book on ChemEng, that would be a fantastic help for our project. I would be more then happy to help you in this project, but I don't know much about ChemEng, so I can't really add any substantive content. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== Time question regarding each textbook ==
Dear Wiki... Gods:

I was looking over the United Nations WikiTextBook on this website and realized that there is a '''UN Today''' section. I find it a bit unfeasible to have a current events section, as textbooks are not supposed to cover current events. However, if WikiTextBooks is based on &quot;yearly&quot; editions, I would be more than willing to add to that particular section. Please let me know what is allowed and what isn't.

:Current events and news typically belong on Wikinews, not wikibooks. However, the classical definition of &quot;textbook&quot; doesnt exactly apply to wiki software. Keep in mind that ''wiki isn't paper'', and our &quot;textbooks&quot; are not limited by the constraints of classical textbooks. In otherwords, our content can change on a daily basis, if needed, to state at the forefront of any particular field. To answer your question more directly, wikibooks do not have &quot;editions&quot; like regular textbooks, they are constantly evolving. To that end, you can make any changes you want, at any time, without having to worry about meeting an arbitrary publication deadline. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== FHSST using obsolete naming convention ==

Yet another post. I tend to post several messages in a short amount of time. Make sure to read the ones prior to this as well! Anyways...I just noticed that practially all of the [[:Category:FHSST Physics|FHSST Physics books]] and some of the [[:Category:FHSST Biology|FHSST Biology book]] use the obsolete ''colon'' naming convention. There are sooo many pages in the FHSST Physics book. They need to be changed. Does anyone have AWB? Make sure they're done properly (obviously). Some of the pages aren't really properly named...e.g. [[FHSST Physics Newtonian Gravitation:Newtonian Gravitation]] should be [[FHSST Physics/Newtonian Gravitation]] and [[FHSST Physics Newtonian Gravitation:Normal Forces]] should be [[FHSST Physics/Newtonian Gravitation/Normal Forces]].

The deletion policy included a line that the concensus process was not &quot;sorted out&quot;, and was a bit vague about how decisions on VfD are made. I think that this matter has already been sorted out by [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]. Even though the later is a guideline, not a policy (something that I would like to change, if i had my druthers), It still does answer the question of how, generally, a decision should be made on VfD. I have therefore deleted the offending sentences on [[WB:DP]], and posted a link instead to [[WB:DM]]. If anybody feels this was inappropriate, please let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

As another point worth making, the current text of [[WB:DP]] states that the only acceptable votes on a VfD are '''keep''' or '''delete''' votes. In practice, there are plenty of other options that are invoked regularly, such as &quot;strong&quot; keep or delete votes (whether we differentiate between them and their weaker siblings is a matter for some debate under [[WB:DM]]), &quot;transwiki&quot; votes, &quot;merge votes&quot;, and neutral &quot;comments&quot;. I propose we update the text of [[WB:DP]] to mirror the way VfDs actually happen, and explicitly mention these other options. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

: Well, the wording on the policy is &quot;should consist of&quot;, which, according to [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines#Definition of terms]] is a recommendation, not a requirement. This is, however, contained in a policy, which is supposed to list requirements. This is partly the reason for my [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Policies_and_guidelines&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=676899 recent] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Staff_lounge&amp;diff=677038&amp;oldid=677011 suggestions].

== Advice for conducting (an) elementary science textbook(s). ==

I need some of advice to help develop a science textbook; it may be an easy question to some so please comment.
It is whether to make a book with all of the elementary science aimed at ages 8 - 11 or to separate them as in beginner chemistry and so on? --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:35, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:That's a difficult question. I am inclined to say that you could combine all the various subjects into a single book ''if you could construct a central narrative to make them all cohesive''. Remember, a book is not a collection of unrelated or loosely-related articles. On the other hand, school students of that age typically do have all those subjects (biology, physics, chemistry, etc) thrown together into a vague amalgamation called &quot;science class&quot;. Also, if you look at the tables set up on [[Wikistudy]] (not that the tables there are an authority), there is a section only for &quot;General Science&quot;, which sounds like an excellent place to shelve your new book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:35, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Merging policy and guideline sections ... and the concepts as well. ==

For maximum exposure, I'd like to alert the community of a couple of suggestions I've made on [[Wikibooks talk:Policies and guidelines]].

[[Wikibooks_talk:Policies_and_guidelines#Merging_Policies_and_guidelines_sections|Merging Policies and guidelines sections]] is a minor content reorganization suggestion. [[Wikibooks_talk:Policies_and_guidelines#Merging_policies_and_guidelines_into_one_category|Merging policies and guidelines into one category]], however, is a more radical suggestion and shouldn't be done without careful consideration and debate over pros and contras. Basically this latter suggestion is about getting rid of the policy versus guideline distinction since we have the requirement versus recommendation distinction which could (and, I believe, does) exist on the same official policy or guideline page.

Please have a look, request for clarification if I've been unclear and comment if you have any comments on the matter. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:44, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

: Are you proposing a new category (that will merge the other two) or the removal of the existing two and substitute them by the new one ? I prefer having the existing ones as a quick method to get the intended content (policies OR guidelines) if you are proposing creating a new one then I'll support the change if you are proposing the removal of the existing please extend a bit more on the benefits of it. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Vandalism &amp; protection ==

Sort of thinking out loud. In the past few days there has been some outbreaks of vandalism from named users (the IP vandalism is much lower due to blocks on open proxies I guess).  After the past two, as the only admin on, I've semi protected some templates/help page type stuff [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=Herbythyme&amp;page=].  I really don't feel strongly about this but was it worth it and should we do more or indeed less? thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:17, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

: [[Wikibooks:Protected page]] states that one of the intentions for temporary protection is to combat &quot;a recent target of ''persistent'' vandalism&quot;. I think it is a worthy goal to keep the number of protected pages down to a minimum so temporary protections are definately the way to go.
: One thing to have in mind, though, is that if the vandal is out to disrupt regardless of the content, then protecting one page will just mean another will get hit. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
::that said, I can't see any downside to semi-protecting pages against page moves. Especially high-profile pages that have no reason to be moved (Policy pages, guideline pages, bookshelves, etc). We don't need to protect these pages from being edited, but there is absolutely no reason why such pages should be able to be moved by users who aren't qualified to move them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:58, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks v. wikiversity and textbooks v. educational materials ==

How is the statement on [[Main Page|the main page]] any different than [[v:Main Page|wikiversity's main page]]? Isn't &quot;textbooks&quot; an obvious subset of &quot;free learning materials,&quot; or am I missing something? I wasn't around for the Wikiversity split, but it is frustrating thinking about it. I'm sure we lost many good editors. Why did we split? And why are we limited to textbooks? For one thing, we aren't really...it is kind of a stretch to call the [[Cookbook]] or the [[World Stamp Catalogue]] a textbook. But this is where the ambiguity of the word &quot;textbook&quot; comes in, because those books could certainly be used in a classroom at any level, and in that ''context'' would qualify as a textbook! So therefore the word by its standard denotation is inherently subjective. Hmm...maybe a new scope that eliminates the ambiguity, like &quot;free-content educational, reference, and how-to materials.&quot; That just kind of accepts the ambiguity, and subjectivity for that matter, with open arms. At least then we wouldn't have to split at the seams to wikiversity, strategywiki, et al. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 08:30, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

: I understand your frustration about the abiguous overlap with Wikiversity. I arrived after the split as well and have never really understood it. Perhaps a more knowledgeble editor can enlighten us (at [[WB:VFD]] I mentioned that it would be very interesting to have something like a project history page &amp;mdash; an essay, perhaps). I bet this is going to be brought up regularly so a reference page would come in handy.
: As for the textbooks. I've on several occations argued that we should not use &quot;textbook&quot; as a definition of what belongs here. Rather just use &quot;wikibook&quot; and define that at [[WB:WIW]].
: I don't mind using &quot;textbook&quot; on the main page for brevity in the initial introduction, but perhaps something like &quot;free content educational material&quot; ... but then it's pretty much identical to Wikiversity's. *sigh* Since a merger of the two is probably out of the question, I guess this overlap is just something we'll have to live with. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 11:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

::I'm an administrator on both projects, so I'll try to take a stab at this. Wikiversity's mission is to develop classroom materials, and to ''be'' a classroom for learning. There are tutors and tutorials, research projects (''Original'' research), and even NPOV is somewhat flexible. Many of the &quot;courses&quot; involve simply collecting materials for use under a syllabus, and in many cases wikibooks textbooks are among those collected materials (as are wikisource documents, wikipedia articles, and so on). Above all else it's an experiment in how to use wikis as an alternative form of education. WV is still a very young project, and the foundation has given it unusual latitude in creating itself. We're still working on the what it is and what it isn't.
::We (the wikiversity administrators) do keep an eye out for material that is moving towards textbooks, and part of the plan is to have import from wikiversity enabled on wikibooks for cases where the wikiversity material is an improvement on the wb textbook materials. However, if you click [[v:Special:Random]] a few times, you'll see that most of it is ''not'' textbook material, but rather organizational material... in fact the entire project is in some sense an experimant in organisation... look at the namespaces and you'll see it.
::As for why the split was made: my understanding is that it was in part that wikiversity was initially proposed around the same time as wikibooks, and was hosted here for a while because they didn't have anywhere else to go. It was also in part because the wikiversitans ended up at loggerheads with the wikibookians on too many occaisions (such as on VFD). There was some resistance against their being here in the first place, then later resistance against the split. 
::I see the projects as complimentary, though at this point wikibooks has more to offer wikiversity than the other way around. As they evolve, the relationship will evolve, and we'll see where it goes. No hurry. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:::I think that the ultimate goal of wikibooks is to produce textbooks that can be used in real classes, in the place of dead-tree textbooks. The benefits to this would include additional noteriety and publicity for our project, and also the alleviation of expensive textbook bills for students (especially university students). Another important point is that places where there are no textbooks (think poor, third world, etc) can dowload and print copies of our books for a fraction of the cost of importing a real published textbook.
:::That said (and hopefully no new information was to be found in that last paragraph), Once we have textbooks, we still need to use those texts in the setting of a classroom environment. A textbook without necessarily supporting instruction is worthless. Imagine also a poor place with no access to traditional textbooks, and no access to trained teachers? It's not hard to imagine such a place. People who are untrained or poorly trained can still be &quot;teachers&quot; if they have access to a good textbook, a good syllabus, and other good learning resources. If wikibooks provides the textbooks, and wikiveristy supplies the class, then suddenly people who were never able to learn before suddenly have access to a classroom environment. Sounds a little grandiose I suppose, but it's still a noble goal. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:55, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

== Easier Navigation of Books ==

I notice that when I look through books, if I want to go on to the next chapter, I have to scroll to the top of the page. This does not seem efficient. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 08:52, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

: It is up to the specific book authors to agree on a navigation aid that they think is best. If easy access to the top of the page is all you need, then this is probably the task of your user agent (e.g. browser). Try hitting the &quot;Home&quot; button on your keyboard (if you have it, I can't remember what it is on the English variants ... my keyboard speaks German). On my browser, [[w:Opera (web browser)|Opera]], this takes me to the top of the page.

== A little confused ==

Rob's comments here [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Isle of Arran]] made me stop and reflect.  When I read [[Isle of Arran:Contents]] I understood it to mean that the book being transwiki'd '''away''' from Wikibooks.  However I now realise thinking thro Rob's comments that this is not the case.  Equally yesterday I was looking at [[Wikiversity:Department of Buddhist Studies/Philosophy of Mahayana Buddhist Schools]].  To me both this notice and the one on Arran may indicate to the reader that these are not really Wikibooks or of value to us (&amp; by implication them).  If simplistically it had that effect on me it may well do on others.  Surely (within guidelines) books that are transiki'd can exist on Wikibooks as well (we do after all have a tag that says &quot;more info on WP&quot; or similar).  I was working on [[Fencing]] here - there is more on WP - I know as I have contributed to that too but I do not see that it means that WB page is not worthwhile.

It's the tags I think I am really getting at - do they send the wrong signal to people?  Should they be reviewed/removed? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:Well, they're two separate issues. Transwikiing to another project is not, in and of itself, a reason to delete material on wikibooks (likewise most articles imported from wikipedia don't need to be deleted there just because they were copied to wikibooks). However, the Isle of Arran book probably does need to be reworked a bit to become more of a &quot;textbook about the island&quot;, just as many of the wp articles we copy need to be altered to remove how-to sections, etc. 
:The use of the &quot;moved to wikiversity&quot; template was originally designed to steer wikiversitans to the wikiversity project. Wikiversity had been hosted on wikibooks for 2+ years, and a lot of the scattered diaspora needed to be informed. It was also a way for us to keep track of what had and had not been already imported to wikiversity. We were originally thinking that the content on wikibooks would just end up being deleted, but it was decided to just leave them here. If the wikiversity pages can be incorporated into textbooks, then they should be. If they're useless for wikibooks, they should just be deleted (as long as they've been safely imported first). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:57, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

: ''Comment started here, moved to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Isle of Arran|vfd]]. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:52, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:Rob's comments on this issue brought up a good point, and one that is sufficiently different from the VfD discussion to warrant a place here. Historically, it has been de facto policy here at wikibooks that we don't transwiki material outside of WMF projects, and we also didn't transwiki material to/from non-GFDL wikis. The purposes of these restrictions were as follows:
:#To ensure that the WMF projects continued to increase it's content, and not simply export content to other communities
:#To ensure that there was sufficient material licensed under the GFDL to facilitate our own projects
:#To keep with the intentions of the original authors of the content, who released their works under a particular license, to a particular project. 
:Recently the videogame guides have been moving to Strategy Wiki, which is not a WMF project, and seems to violate these principles. However, I would disagree with that, in general, because the videogame manuals have been moving themselves out of their own accord (in response to threats, of course, but not in response to policy). The [[Isle of Arran]] book is a perfect example, where people are taking a book that has been submitted to wikibooks under the GFDL, and trying to transwiki it to travelwiki that isn't GFDL (I dont think so anyway). I'm pretty sure such a move, without express consent of the authors, is a violation of copyright anyway. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:34, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

== Citing sources, etc. ==

I'm hoping to enlist some help in cleaning up policies and templates involved in citing sources. This has come to my attention in part because a lot of the wp articles I've transwikied have sources cited using some templates they have (see [[w:Category:Citation_templates]]), and a lot of them end up not working here because (a) we don't have most of them, and (b) when they're imported, they often don't seem to work correctly.

I'd also like to get a bit more done on [[WB:OR]], as well get some sort of general policy started ([[WB:CITE]], similar to how [[w:WP:CITE]] is configured). 

Any takers? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:37, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:The problem I see is that textbooks typically cite sources differently from encyclopedia articles. In a given textbook, the individual &quot;facts&quot; don't generally need to be referenced, so long as a &quot;list of resources&quot; is published at the end of the book. I own many textbooks, and I've never seen one that goes to such lengths to cite sources in the body of the text like wikipedia does (or other encyclopedias, for that matter). I think it might almost be best for each individual book to have it's own citation templates, pointing to a separate page with the sources listed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

== Proposals of the Week: [[Wikibooks:Be bold]], [[Wikibooks:Original research]] ==

The ideas of &quot;being bold&quot;, and &quot;No original research&quot; are fundamental to wikibooks, but neither of these ideas are discussed specifically in policy. [[WB:WIW]] does mention that wikibooks is not a place for original research, but doesnt explain the term to any degree of satisfaction. As [[WB:WIW]] is supposed to be more of an overview of policy, and cannot go into sufficient detail, We need to formalize an original research policy to hammer out the details. For this week, I would like to increase both of these proposals, and:
*Move [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] to {{tl|Guideline}}
*Move [[Wikibooks:Original research]] to {{tl|policy}}

:I'd like to say that we should approach the prospect of allowing some forms of original research with great caution. I agree that the kinds of writing this proposed policy was designed to permit are clearly a good thing, but I also worry about what else we might be letting in the door. NOR is one of most fundamental policies of Wikimedia projects, and is the key distinction of Wikimedia from other, similar projects -- we do not act in our capacity as experts, but merely as scholars who report on the state of a field of inquiry, without bias or personal agenda.

:::::Well, I think the allowed OR schemas in the policy are actually fairly narrow (as they should be). OR ''is'' permitted on two of our sister projects, namely wikinews and wikiversity, and that freedom has been a great benefit. 
:::::The wikipedia issue is completely different from ours: their MoS forbids not only Original Research but also Primary Sources of any kind. It would be absolutely insane to require all books to follow that sort of thing: books like encyclopedias (including wikipedia) have very srtict guidelines about inclusion that simply aren't appropriate for textbooks and references of other kinds. 
:::::Fortunately, we have only occaisionally had to deal with &quot;OR witch-hunting&quot; on wikibooks. It's occasionally used as a deletion reason on VfDs, but almost always these deletion proposals are offered by wikipedians, rather than experienced wikibookians. The policy as written now is more a statement of our handling of the issue as an established fact, rather than a proposal for change. The goal is simply to codify the rules as we already apply them. If it were much narrower, a lot of books would need to go (Including the Cookbook, the Wikimanual of Gardening, the Muggle's Guide, and the Movie Making Manual... ''all'' of these books include original research and interpretations of primary sources). If it were much broader, we might also have problems with things like ''unverifiable'' OR, which is somewhere we shouldn't be going. If you feel there are gaping loopholes through which trash might come in, I'd have no problems with closing them, but not if it makes the policy into a long list of what's not permitted... the more specific a policy gets, the more loopholes there are. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:21, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
::::One point that is worth making here is that ''Original Research is already forbidden by policy'', namely [[WB:WIW]]. This new proposal would probably be better instituted as a set of guidelines for enforcing that policy. Even with the staunch definition &quot;Original Research is not allowed&quot;, there is still alot of grey area as to what qualifies as OR, and what doesnt. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

=== Original research ===

I think it would be far easier to agree on what is allowed here then trying to define what original research is and making a bunch of confusing exceptions to the rules. A clear definition of what is allowed I think is far more productive and useful to the community then trying to figure out ways to patch up holes with inconsistent policies and guidelines. Lets try to learn from the mistakes of Wikipedia with all its policies. Clearity benifits everyone. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

=== Attitude about Original Research ===

I will say that my experience with Wikiversity has significantly tempered my attitude towards original research.  Keep in mind that the primary justification for having the original original research prohibitions on Wikipedia is really a more pragmatic justification:  They wanted to say (politely) to UFO and para-normal authors that their content is not really welcome on Wikipedia.  Original research is also something that is usually not found in an encyclopedic setting.

We have had some issues in the past that have resulted in VfDs, including most notably the Wikimania proceedings that were for a time hosted here on Wikibooks.  I argued quite strongly (with surpringly some wheel warring between myself, Brion Vibber, Anthere, and Kernigh) that the contents needed to be removed from Wikibooks precisely because of original research restrictions.  And if Wikimania articles didn't qualify as original research, I don't know what does.  The major headaches grew from the fact that many of the contributors were using references to Wikibooks to support other academic articles, precisely because it was original research.

How much original ideas like those found in some Wikibooks qualify as original research certainly something that can be debated.  I also believe strongly that there is an appropriate place that some very legitimate original research can take place with Wikimedia projects, with a strong suggestion that Wikiversity be the place that &quot;pure original research&quot; ought to be located at.  That some strong guidelines and &quot;community approval&quot; needs to take place to make sure the quacks don't run the asylum should also be a part of any such effort.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

== Reproducing UK legislation ==

I intend to return shortly to work on the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom]] book. With that in mind, may I ask whether it will be ok to reproduce UK legislation. I know there have been issues regarding Crown Copyright generally. However, insofar as Crown Copyright pertains to UK legislation, there is a general waiver (reproduced [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/crown-copyright/copyright-guidance/reproduction-of-legislation.htm here]), which is subject only to a few caveats (see paragraph 12). As long as I comply with those caveats, which do not appear to me to contradict the GFDL (we cite the sources anyway), I personally see no difficulty. But I'd welcome the others' views. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

: 12 (d): ''&quot;the Material should not be used in a derogatory or misleading manner, nor should it be used for the purposes of advertising or promoting a particular product or service or for promoting particular personal interests or views;&quot;'' -- that might be a problem for the GFDL (it's esentially like a non-com CC licence). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

:: What bit of the GFDL causes the problem? And why is it different (if it is) for fair use images? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:01, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I think the potential compatibility problem with GFDL is that copyrighted content licensed for use under the GFDL (aka Wikibooks) is thus licensed to allow any derivative downstream works. Therefore, someone with a vested interest might consider using the UK legislation reproduced here in ''&quot;a derogator or misleading manner...[or for] advertising...promoting a particular product or service or...personal interests or views.&quot;'' Or, it could be construed that, if this text were published, that the UK legislation used therein would be promoting our particular product, namely ''Wikibook: Taxation in the United Kingdom''. I'm not sure the validity of these arguments, but they're potential issues I thought up on the spot. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 16:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

: First off, I would like to say &quot;welcome back!&quot; It will be good to have you around here again Jguk. Second, I think the reproduction of the material should be okay, so long as you properly cite your sources, and perhaps provide a link to that website above in your book. If your worries are about the reproduction of source materials, perhaps you could ask the people at wikisource what their opinions are on the matter (they should have more experiance with this kind of stuff, I would think). Worst comes to worst, You could simply post links to the legislation text, and write the annotations here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

I've updated the sidebox as per some comments that were made previously. I have removed links that weren't needed, and added a link to the bulletin board.

What do people think of the new change? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)]

: I think that recent changes and donations, and featured books and bookshelves, should switch places, like so:
:* Main Page
:* Help
:* Donations
:* Wikijunior
:* Featured Books
:* Bookshelves
:* Recent changes
: I think that recent changes is important, and I often am on RC patrol, but I don't think it is as important to the visitor. Also, its always nice to have donations go first. :) And finally, my reason for switching the book links is that featured books are exactly that, ''featured'', which I would assume means that we want visitors to look at them first, because they're well-done and look good. A comparison might be a local library, where they have &quot;featured books&quot; at the front on a display table, for everyone to ooh and ahh at, and then have lots of bookshelves a little ways further.

== Short policy summaries ==

On my user page I have written up 4 short summary essays that attempt to distill wikibooks policy down to the bare essentials. These essays can be found at [[User:Whiteknight/Philosophy#Nutshell_Essays]]. It is my hope that people will be able to read these, and similar documents, in lieu of having to read pages and pages of formal policy. I think having short summaries like this will encourage people to be more familiar with policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

: I don't know how I like this idea. It seems like POV could easily slip in even under the utmost good faith. It would be nice if we could tighten the prose and consolidate the clauses of our policy pages. Furthermore, I am beginning to consider the need for a Wikibooks history page. As I am uncovering interesting tidbits, I find I can more readily participate in discussion, especially since I know precedents and processes better. I intend to write a draft over the holidays as I learn more. Also, consider seeing my related suggestion on the [[Wikibooks talk:Protected page|protection policy talk page]].

== Math: would be great.... ==

Hi,

I'm studyng math analysis II in italy. 
What would be great is to have a book with all kind of exercise, we could find in an Analysis's test (or whatever subjectT).

Find a good book with exercise is very hard and they cost a lot.

Ika

: Question: What is the syllabus? Is it an analysis course as in a generalisation of Calculus? Or real analysis or complex analysis? More info would be appreciated. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 20:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

*graphing fuction in in 2 or more variables, max min point, differentation, Integral in more variables, SEries in more varibles ecc.

Can any one please give me a copy of a Treasury Manual used in Commercial Banks. This document shall detail the process flows of transactions that take place in a bank's dealing room.

== Recent MUMFUM vandalism ==

There have been more incidences of this type of vandalism in the past few days.  It seems to be a distributed attack so there's no use blocking IP addresses.  We can, of course, combat the problems when they happen but as most of these attacks consist of moving help pages, templates and other wiki pages would it be a good idea to protect all of these kinds of pages from moves by all users except sysop?  I know that protection should only be used as a last resort but when do people really need to move such pages anyway?  Does anyone have any ideas?  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 12:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:In principle I am against protection (including my own pages).  I fully agree with the frustration tho.  The one that was just moved I protected against moving (I'm guessing you saw that one). One issue is the lack from time to time of RC patrollers. I'd welcome input on ways to deal with it.  The pattern (about 4/5 hours before this time) has changed some maybe some of the checkuser based action has had an effect? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

::I sent an email about this problem to the checkuser-l mailing list, in hopes that those other users will be able to give us some suggestions on dealing with this problem. In response to Xania, I do agree that high-profile pages (policy, guidelines, bookshelves, high-traffic pages) should be semi-protected against page moves. These pages have no reason to be moved, they should not be moved (barring agreement from the community at large), and if they are going to be moved, non-sysop users probably shouldn't be doing it. However, these pages should not be protected against editing, because this is a wiki after all, and people should be free to change the content of pages without requiring special permissions. If a vandal sees that he can continue to do the same thing over and over again (page move vandalism against the same high-profile pages, for instance), they are going to keep coming back to our project. I think we need to take a harder stance on these guys, semi-protect the pages that they are targeting, block the usernames and IP addresses of any new user who writes the word &quot;Mumfum&quot;, or creates a page with &quot;Mumfum&quot; in the title. They are playing a game with us, and by not taking our response to the next level, we are essentially playing the game with them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

== Looking for contributors to the Holocaust wikibook ==

Hiya, I have created a wikibook on the events of the Holocaust. So far ideas have been that: ''The book will look at the situation in which the Holocaust was able to take place. It will look into those involved and where and when important events took place, to try and establish a clear picture of the extend of what has happened. What happened after the war and what ongoing impact will the events of the Holocaust have now?'' I have set up a basic structure and now looking for people to start discussing, writing and shaping the book. If you're interested, you can contact me: [[User_talk:WietsE]] or leave a message on the books talk page: [[Talk:The_Holocaust/Content]]. O yeah, and have a look at the book itself: [[The_Holocaust]]. Cheers, [[User:WietsE|WietsE]] 19:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks newsletter ==

[[User:Herbythyme]] and I, along with a few other editors here and there have kicked up the idea to have a wikibooks newletter. The idea behind the newsletter is to get into contact with some of the active contributors to wikibooks who aren't quite part of the community yet. We would like to send out news and information to various contributors, at least once (if not on a regular basis). These newsletters could be &quot;delivered&quot; via bot to the user talk pages. To do this, we will need a few things:
#Important information to include in the first newsletter. If there is only one newsletter, we need to say everything important in one shot. If we send them out on a regular basis (monthly?), we would need new content on a regular basis. 
#A list of recipients. I am creating [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]] as a place to list users who should get the newsletter. People can feel free to add themselves, and add the names of any users who are active on the project. Keep in mind, most people who contribute to wikibooks don't check staff lounge or the bulletin board, and won't see this message here. If you know of another user who is active, please list their names. If a person wants to opt out of this newsletter, they can remove their name from the list.
I would like to send out the first newsletter by the new year, at the latest. Help is greatly appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

::Good questions (and comment!). 
::#[[User:Herbythyme]] has suggested the name &quot;Wikibooks Gazette&quot;, but I would be perfectly content just calling it &quot;newsletter&quot;. Depends how fancy we would like to get, but I would prefer not to get too pretentious. 
::#There isn't a centralized page yet, but there very well could be. All I have envisioned is a short(ish) message, delivered to the usertalk pages of active wikibookians. This can be used to highlight certain news items (probably from posts here on staff lounge, or news items on the bulletin board), and to remind wikibookians to become more active in the community. However much discussion we need to make this happen probably needs a place to live, but again, we don't need to go crazy about it.
::#I don't think that we should archive it. The bulletin board and the staff lounge are both already archived, and the newsletter will likely be a distilled version of those pages. No sense archiving everything twice.
::#The logo thing can go in the first newsletter!
::I'm going to start the page &lt;s&gt;[[Wikibooks:Newsletter]]&lt;/s&gt; with a draft text of the first newsletter.

:::I still strongly am in favour of an archival schema. Trying to understand what has happened here at Wikibooks is awful.

A suggestion would be: &amp;#91;[Wikibooks:Wikibooks Gazette/Archive/YYYY/MM/DD/]]. That way, you could look at it by day, month, and year.

::::I'm not going to oppose an archival schema, it sounds like more busy work to me (and I hate busywork), but If you want to do it you are more then welcome to.

We don't want to spam people's user talk pages with this. I would recommend yearly archives, with 1 archive page per year, all the gazettes from that year would be separated by headings telling on what date the newsletter was distributed.

== Discussion backlog ==

The staff lounge has a backlog of unresolved issues. Because questions and issues are asked and discussed here, the issues seem to regularly get lost up the page. Thus I propose that the staff lounge remain as a general place to ask questions and a new page be created to be the center for discussion. It would have links to subpages where they are housed. A notice could be placed here when a new topic was brought up. Comments? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:17, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:I know what you are talking about, discussions frequently do get lost as new issues are brought up. However, this is not a new problem, and I would argue that wikibooks has been working just fine without fixing it. Also, I think that breaking things up into multiple subpages defeats the purpose of having a centralized discussion area. If people have to go searching for the correct place to ask a question, I think they are less likely to ask it in the first place. As a final point, I would say that keeping all those pages organized would be additional busywork, and i can't see introducing any new busywork for our already overworked staff members.
:As we all know, wikibooks is a concensus-based community, where decisions are made through community concensus. To that end, it typically is much harder to change the status quo then it is to keep things going the way they are. Discussions here that stagnate, or which are simply forgotten or ignored can be considered to have failed to change the status quo, which is in itself an implicit decision on the matter. I would like to try and warn against ensuring that every single issue is explicitly &quot;Closed&quot; with some sort of a decision: sometime just letting a conversation die out is the answer. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I agree that it is difficult to change to status quo. But I'm in disbelief that you recognise this and simultaneously insist upon changing it with weekly policy updates. You are explicitly creating a deadline. It is also outlandish to expect a proposed policy to be approved with significant improvements and appropriate consensus within a week. On Wikipedia, ''guidelines'' don't get approved within months, unless by divine &amp;mdash; or administrative &amp;mdash; intervention. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Your criticism is acknowledged, but I think you are misinterpreting the &quot;Proposal of the Week&quot; thing. I guess it was heavily explained before you became active here, and I take for granted that everybody knows what I am talking about. The PotW (as I will informally call it) is not an attempt to force a decision on a policy proposal in the span of one week. That's absurd, in most cases. PotW was originally created to spotlight old policy proposals that have stagnated for some time, and needed to be reevaluated. Some of these old proposals were either (a) already being followed even though they werent official, or (b) already basically decided upon, but nobody had ever finalized the discussion. To that end, we were looking at these proposals, and if they could be quickly enacted without changing the wikibooks status quo, we did so, but if they couldn't (which is the case far more often), at least the proposal got some much needed publicity, and the discussions were allowed to continue beyond the designated week. In many of these cases, (such as the [[Wikibooks:Be bold]], and [[Wikibooks:Original research]] policies that i've mentioned above), the text of the proposal already reflects the status quo, and it should be an easy transition to enact a policy that fits the way we do business around here already, as opposed to making a new policy that changes the way we do business (a change to the status quo, which would be by definition a harder thing to do). I hope that clears things up. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:One thing that I could suggest (so as not to blow off the problem entirely) is that discussions could be moved to their own subpages off the staff lounge, such as &quot;Staff lounge/DISCUSSION TOPIC&quot;. I don't propose all discussions get separated out this way, just discussions that are becoming very long, or which are old but unresolved. (when such a discussion is over, the discussion could then be properly archived, and the page deleted so it could be recycled for future discussions with the same name). Sound like a compromise? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

== Auto-archive ==

A suggestion: Perhaps we should have the Staff lounge autoarchived by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Werdnabot/Archiver/Howto Werdnabot] or such? At 184 kilobytes, the page is long, slow to load, and a bit unwieldy to browse through. Cheers, [[User:Unforgettableid|Unforgettableid]] 00:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

I think that something's got to be done.  I don't like the idea of creating sub-pages like seems to have happened over at vfd.  An auto archive might be an idea.  At the moment I rarely visit this section because the page is just so big and it's impossible to find anything.  I'd favour an auto-archive option unless someone here has a better option?  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 00:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:discussions are already archived when they are about 1 month old (give or take). If we shuffle things out of here too much faster then that, we risk losing discussions before they are over. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:57, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: Disagree, with non human intervention, archiving could reduce the display time of a debate to 14 days, this is to low, a default archiving of 30 days with human intervention on closed and non important posts should suffice. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:03, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

''reset''

I have archived this page before by hand and was informed that a bot would also do it, at the time I have noticed that it wasn't archiving messages with more than 30 days, reducing discussion time will probably cause more troubles that it solves, some questions get a response in a few days and should not be archived in less 16 days, people could miss important discussions.

I hadn't noticed that the time frame for auto-archiving was being discussed here, and ask that  it given more visibility.
 
This is a '''High impact decision''' a change to the general state of things, that has a general community impact or calls for the establishment of a sequence or set of task with undefined time duration. Even if we all agree a subsequent measurement of consensus with a straw poll (if needed) and more importantly at least there is need to publicize what is being proposed   , there should also be a place to keep the reason given and the result of the vote to serve as a bases for future discussions for the same problem (or similar problems) that is, for historic reasons. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:03, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:I would hardly call this a &quot;high impact&quot; decision, it deals with the content of only a single module, and the method and rate in which the text of the page is archived doesnt affect the community at large. The fact that the text is archived, and not deleted outright shows that no major changes are happening, and people who wish to continue a particular discussion can find it in the archives. I have a semi-automated bot that can archive the page, but it requires me to actually look at the timestamps, and read the text of the thread, to determine whether to archive or not. I dont think any hard and fast rules should really be applied here, somethings can get archived in only a few days, and other things should not be archived for a long time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== COTM: rethought, reconfigured, and resurrected ==

The '''collaboration''' of the month is a very good idea, but has ''never'' lived up to its ideals. If I understand correctly, the original idea was to have a &quot;good book needing work&quot; be a &quot;community project&quot;. That's never worked, of course, because wikibooks just isn't that kind of community: our community (for the most part) is a group of people who love writing about what we (individually) are passionate about, as opposed to a community that wants to build a website called &quot;English Wikibooks&quot;. We're a bunch of considerate, polite, respectful people who take care not to go messing around in books we're not familiar with. We hang out together and respect and encourage one another's work, but our &quot;community&quot; is one of people working side-by-side, rather than a community oriented towards achieving a particular goal.

I'd like to suggest that we reincarnate the COTM as a project that reaches out to our sister projects. Rather than just having the COTM a &quot;token honorary position&quot; here on wikibooks, we could instead make it a project for our community leaders and ambassadors to take on, and try to get interest from our sister projects. From '''Wikipedia''' we might be able to find some knowledgeable (or at least enthusiastic) contributors by posting on the village pump and relevant wikiprojects. From '''Wikiversity''' we could get people interested in teaching or learning the materials addressed by the book (and perhaps a project there to discuss the book). From '''Commons''' we could find illustrators, and perhaps inspire some photographers.

I, and perhaps some others (where's [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] these days, anyway?) are &quot;known elements&quot; on these other projects, and could smooth the way towards making this a &quot;monthly cross-project tradition&quot;. But to make this work we'd need to make a little change: we need to get rid of the &quot;minimum '''wikibooks''' edits&quot; requred on those votes, so we could allow established users on other projects to help us choose. We have a very bad reputation (which IMO is well deserved) for being an &quot;overly closed&quot; (if not xenophobic) community, and if this is going to work, we're going to need to be open to voices from other projects. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

:I've made my arguments against the COTM, and I think that even if we open it up in the way that you are talking about, they will be doomed to fail. Unfortunately for us, regardless of what decisions we make on this matter, we are going to be doomed to learn some lessons the hard way. I don't think that allowing Wikipedians to vote, and sending out &quot;ambassadors&quot; to wikipedia and wikiversity are going to revitalize this initiative. We can certainly try though. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:47, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:To revisit this issue, and prevent it from being driven out of sight and mind entirely, If we want to rework the COTM project to be something better, I'll agree to it contingent to a few conditions:
:#that we plan how specifically to increase it's popularity (and therefore try to correct the problems we've had in the past)
:#That we set a moritorium on it, in case the new provisions do not correct the problems.
:The problem that COTM has had is that it simply doesnt attract contributors. If we can't fix this problem, we should abandon it and find something else that does work. A better use of our time all together would be to work to formalize a &quot;wikipress&quot; initiative, where we take the books that are attracting contributors, and set them up to be published. I think authors will work harder to write good books if we provide more incentives to good books. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:39, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Boldness ==

Boldness according to Wikibooks policy should not be reckless. Take a look at a few actions of [[User:TeamZissou]]. I issued a bold challenge to have a discussion about the user's bold delete of the prophecy table appendix on the main page of [[Christianity]] on the user's first day on Wikibooks. My entry was deleted from TeamZ's talk page a day later and at the same time TeamZ tried to delete my user page. My user page also inflamed TeamZ because it was actually my sandbox for formatting the prophecy table, unique in that it was chronologically arranged from birth to death of Jesus. By definition, an appendix would not claim to be mainstream Christianity or consider whatever the offense to one reader might be. Parts of the table have stood the test of wikitime (18 months) unbowed, not to say it can not be questioned in a lively fashion. I have made 90% of the entries on the main page because of general lack of interest or timidity. Christianity is worthy of a book, but I never claimed to be perfect, of course, there is a little bias in this army of one. I was proposing a vote on each prophecy on the [[Talk:Christianity|discussion]] page if necessary. So, there may be only 55 prophecies, one [http://biblia.com/jesusbible/zechariah1b.htm website] has 21 in the Book of Zechariah alone. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
:Boldness certainly isnt the same thing as recklessness. [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] does state that compromise must be worked toward in a situation where there are differing opinions. If this user is ignoring your comments, and changing edits without allowing discussion (or even deleting relevant disucssion), that's not acceptable. Also, blanking or causing disruptive edits on another person's user pages is generally not accepted. I'll send this user a message, and try to work towards a conclusion. Please try to refrain from further arguments until we make some headway in this. Thank you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== [[Cookbook]] ==

I've added the Cookbook to the sidebar.  This was done without consultation so if someone has a problem with this change then please revert it.  I was just trying to be bold but I understand if someone has an issue with this.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 01:21, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:Personally, I have no problem with it for now. I would like to put a marker down that if we get to a situation where we have a number of really large books all vying for a place on the sidebar, that I would argue that the new link should be replaced by a link to a page detailing all large books. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

I like the idea of having the Cookbook on the sidebar, although I have a idea. If we had the situation where a lot of books want to be put on the sidebar, we could create another box for them. We could also adopt a voting system to vote for what books go in the box. Just a suggestion. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 17:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
:I like having the cookbook there, because the cookbook is so large and it attracts so many contributors. I don't think, however, that any other books should be listed in the side bar by name. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== Indexing spider activity on Wikibooks ==

I put in a link to a counter page on an independent ISP.  The link was in an inoccuous piece of text in the main page of the conscious studies text book and displayed as a full stop.  This link was hit 27 times in four days (7 times a day).  This probably represents background indexing activity on the site. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:Good to know, it can be so hard to get a good read of spiders and bots that come here. 27 times in 4 days (less then 8 times per day) really isn't that much, I wonder if there is more we could do to increase our presence on search sites? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:03, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== Creating new CSS class for text boxes ==

I'm in the process of appending the CSS identifier &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;PrettyTextBox&quot;&lt;/code&gt; into a number of text templates, such as &amp;#123;{[[Template:TextBox|TextBox]]}}, &amp;#123;{[[Template:SideBox|SideBox]]}}, and &amp;#123;{[[Template:LeftBox|LeftBox]]}}. In this way, people can use custom CSS from their personal monobook.css or common.css pages to manipulate these templates. I am going to add some defaults concerning this class (black text, light grey background, light grey border, etc) to the global monobook.css, but not to any of the other skins, because i'm not familiar with any of those skins. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== United Nations &quot;donation&quot; to Wikibooks ==

I'm surprised that this didn't merit any attention on the Staff Lounge, nor have I seen any discussion about this on Textbook-l either, but this is something newsworthy of at least some minor discussion here on Wikibooks.

See http://www.apdip.net/news/wikibooks for some further details.

I know there is some effort to try and do some other clean-up type efforts here on Wikibooks, but this is not a trivial effort and the advertising about Wikibooks alone from an external website is significant enough that perhaps some additional attention should be made to this effort.

More to the point, what do we accomplish with this content now, and do we give it any prominance on the front page?  Make this whole &quot;project&quot; of converting the PDF files something of a collaboration of the month project?

Certainly these books deserve to be noticed and placed in the &quot;completed books&quot; rotation that appears on the main page.  It is also a legitimate debate to determin if these belong here on Wikibooks or if they ought to be placed in Wikisource.  From my understanding, the reason why they are here is because further updating and editing is encouraged, although I would be curious who would be working on it at the moment.  Certainly a VfD would bring upon us the strong antagonistic attention of the WMF board of trustees, but I digress at this point.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:It did warrant posts on both the textbook-l and foundation-l mailing lists, although the initial posts garnered no replies. You are right on a number of points, a partnership with the UN certainly should be utilized to bring some additional interest/prestige to our humble little project, but so far nobody has dont anything about it. As much as I would love for this to be a stepping stone for us, I guess nobody here really knows how to capitalize on it. 
:What gets done with this content now is anybody's guess. I doubt pretty highly that anybody around here is an expert in any of these fields to the point that they could improve these books (other then basic changes in wording, aesthetics, etc). It always feels to me like there are so many loose ends to tie up around here before we go out to invite the public eye to scrutinize us. Of course, with thinking like that we will never put out a public invitation, because we will always have loose ends to tie down. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:10, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::I noticed that you put some effort into the organizational (and wikification, apparently) aspects of some of these book.  Thanks for that effort.  I just felt that it needs wider recognition.  As for Textbook-l, it seems to be a pretty good conduit of information between the board of trustees and ''very'' active (or older aka on this project longer) Wikibooks users, but it doesn't really get out nearly as far to the rank and file Wikibooks users as is necessary for a general announcement.
::I'm curious, however.  Did these individuals contact Brad and the WMF first before they did their announcement, or was this simply something that merely &quot;happened&quot;?  The lack of attention by &quot;ordinary&quot; Wikibooks users seems rather surprising on the whole here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Announcements of the donation on the WP Village Pump and the WV Colloquium might garner interest (or might not). &quot;Ordinary Wikibookians&quot; tend to be involved writing in their fields of interest, so it's not surprising (to me at least) that there's been little activity on this... you two (Robert Horning and Whiteknight) are our resident specialists in transcribing these sorts of things. I wonder though if we couldn't find or make a &quot;pdf transcribing bot&quot; to lighten the load? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:37, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:::I wish we could get more people subscribed and active on the textbook-l, but I dont think it's going to happen. The IRC chatroom has recently experianced a bit of a revitalization, and combined with the new newsletter initiative we have been working on, I think we are keeping more people in the loop about these sorts of things.
:::As to your other question, the UN people left a message here on wikibooks (I can't remember where it was added, i think it was on the staff lounge) about wanting to donate the books. I responded to the message, uploaded the first few books, welcomed and &quot;trained&quot; the first few UN workers, and they took it from there. I don't think the WMF was aware of the project at all, until Eric Moeller found the UN announcement webpage, and posted a question about it on the textbook-l. I sent him some more information about the project, and he then posted a mention of it on foundation-l (a post that was largely ignored). 
:::What our project needs is more publicity, but it seems people only care about promoting wikipedia, and not any of the other projects. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: I understand your sentiments about the mailing list, Whiteknight, and I have tried reading through the archives in preparation to jump right in to the lists. I am put off by the heated debates I have read through and the (encouraged) lack of anonymity (and whether or not I should worry). I want to join, but I have these and other trivial qualms. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 08:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiprojects ==

I would like to start creating a more formal set of &quot;Wikiprojects&quot; around here. These wikiprojects would be meta-pages to coordinate groups of people to perform particular tasks. We already have a few wikiprojects (the image tagging project, for instance), but we could use more, and we could use more structure and definition to the whole &quot;wikiproject&quot; idea. I would like to propose a few things:
#We either expand [[Wikibooks:WikiProject]] to be more informative, or create a new (better named) [[Wikibooks:Wikiprojects]].
#Make the above page (whichever is decided upon) become a central hub for all wikiprojects, with links to the projects, short descriptions of existing projects, and discussion/voting to create new projects.
#Add a link to the wikiprojects hub page to the sidebar (we can do this latter, when this picks up some steam).
#Create a &quot;Wikiproject membership&quot; or &quot;wikiproject community&quot;, something like esperanza is at wikipedia (we could give it our own fancy name). that would oversee welcoming new users, and writing/distributing the new wikibooks newsletter.
#Create wikiprojects for each bookshelf. Link prominently to the wikiproject from the bookshelf (and vice-versa).
People do tend to be involved with their own books, and I think part of the reason for that is that books are the only well-defined projects that are worth working on around here. If we establish other projects, and get people collaborating, people will feel more involved around here. Also, we could delegate out some common bookkeeping and cleanup tasks to the various wikiprojects, which would help to take some strain off the admins/staff. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

: How do you think a graphics lab Wikiproject should be co-ordinated, as it may bridge relationships between Wikibooks and the Commons thought it could also be an unnecessary complication. The Wikiproject could help with the creation of images for books, I have recently been asking help from the user, [[Commons:User:LadyofHats]] who has been very co-operative. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 00:39, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

: I agree that editors working within specific bookshelves should work together to collaborate and should agree upon a consistent style of formatting. Because it would be inappropriate to use the bookshelf talk page for that, I understand and fully agree that a separate page for centralised coordination and discussion should be created for each bookshelf. I disagree, however, that these should be called &quot;wikiprojects.&quot; As has been fleshed out so much lately (and with varying degrees of success), semantics is the issue. Certainly they are ''projects'' associated with ''bookshelves'', but what on Earth is a ''wikiproject''? &quot;Well,&quot; any metapedian or wikipedian would say, &quot;they are over there [at Wikipedia]! We should just emulate everything they do and we'll be fine.&quot; I disagree. I think that we can come up with a more novel, descriptive, and less semantically unclear and muddled name.

: I also question the need for an Esperanza-esque project. Have you been at Wikipedia lately? Have you seen all of the havoc surrounding Esperanza? I consider it a terrible idea. It distracts editors from doing what their name says they do &amp;mdash; editing. It also attracts people who are not there to edit, but to socialise. I think if a few editors want to write the newsletter/gazette, then they should just collaborate on the talk page and do it; don't create any hierarchical &quot;wikiproject&quot; that separates the process from the product.

: And that is my main issue with hierarchy and wikiprojects being introduced on Wikibooks; that the process is separated from the product. That is, the process and stylisation of creating textbooks is moved from the relevant talk pages to a foreign page; a ''Wikibooks:WikiProject X'' page. Why? What is the need? Do you think that anonymous contributors are going to be able to find this or wade through the loose and redundant prose, style guidelines, and then say, &quot;Why, I'm going to do all that!&quot; I don't think so. I think the average anonymous contributor, which we rely so much upon to keep contributing and to hopefully end up joining the project, will want to contribute, not pay heed to hierarchy and foreign-named ''wikiprojects'' that are at least two degrees away from the actual ''content'' and ''product''. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 09:11, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

==name change==
I created much of a textbook under my current username - exmoron - but am now finding that people don't like the name.  I'm wondering if an admin can help me change those edits to a new username.  Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated. --[[User:Exmoron|Exmoron]] 18:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:''Done''. Your username is now something else, all mention of the username &quot;exmoron&quot; in the page histories has been replaced. Use your new username to login to wikibooks from now on. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] and [[Wikibooks:Decision making/Unstable]] ==

Both of these proposals are mature, and I would like to move to make them official. The first, a rewrite of [[WB:WIW]] is both more clear and more succinct then the previous version. The second, a rewrite of [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] has added sections derived from [[WB:OWN]], which is information that is sorely needed. Also, I have moved to make the decision-making proposal into a &amp;#123;{[[Template:policy|policy]]}}, instead of a guideline as it is currently. All comments are appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:There has been a lot of comment on WB:WIW recently, all of which has been constructive. I'm also eager to see a new improved version of WB:WIW. Do, however, allow the current discussions to run their proper course. To my mind, there are a number of amendments to be made before it is ready.

== Wikibooks Logo ==

Now that the discussion on Meta has gone through the roller mill and a semi-decision has been made on a new logo for Wikibooks, the question I now pose to the Wikibooks community is this:

Do we even want to accept the thing?

We do have the option of simply saying '''''&quot;NO&quot;''''' as a community, even if that would seem a little spiteful.  Certainly it is very surprising that over 100 people voted for approval of this logo, yet we are told that we can't get people with checkuser privileges because we don't have enough participants.  (the current two we have was with a bit of &quot;ballot stuffing&quot; and letting the vote run much longer than normal for other votes for admins and such)

Even after all of that effort, apparently the color selection (which was done to provide a unifying theme with the Wikimedia Foundation) is apparently &quot;outlawed&quot; for some bizzare reason.  There was a major discussion about that, but you know, the whole discussion regarding the Incubator logo is irrelevant in this case.  We are pretty much free to do whatever we want here even to keep the current WMF-related color scheme if we wish.  If the WMF doesn't want the trademark to the logo I'll set up an independent foundation to trademark it instead... or simply leave it open source.  The legal arguments are actually quite weak here to change it.

I will note that [[:fi:Etusivu|The Finnish Wikibooks]] has already adopted the new logo, so in a sense we as en.wikibooks are going to be left behind if we don't lead on this issue.  Since they use the WMF-related color scheme, I would also argue that we might as well use this as preceedent.  Of course this is going to have to be done by &quot;community concensus&quot; of some sort.

If there is a final &quot;vote&quot; for approval, it needs to be done here on Wikibooks, with perhaps some announcement on the banner that is currently being used for fundraising.  Certainly the selection of the color scheme ought to be done by Wikibookians rather than a bunch of people on meta that have nothing to do with Wikibooks.  Of course that is just my $0.02.  I could have the logo changed today if necessary, but I'm willing to stop and see what other people think first before anything is done.

And if this seems to be a bit contrarian to some of those who set up the logo policies as listed on Meta, yeah, I'm in a bit of a grumpy mood over this.  Certainly the vote on Meta can't be considered &quot;binding&quot; or even gaining a concensus among Wikibooks regulars.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:10, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:I've not been aware of all these discussions. I've had a look at what the Finns have done. It does seem more modern than the logo we use here. It's probably better than what we've got now, but I couldn't say I was over the moon about it. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikibooks/logo The logo vote page...] Go make your own iteration, vote, talk about it, or publicize it. Personally, I feel that the current logo detracts from Wikibooks presentation by a large factor. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 23:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

::Interesting.  I'd seen it on Meta and assumed we would get it anyway.  That we have some choice is good news (although I'd not a fan of the current one really).  I'd floated the thought that it could be used on the next Wikibooks Gazette [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks Gazette]] - maybe it could be used with a view to seeking a vote? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:I'm conflicted over this new logo. On one hand, the logo we have currently (while familiar) is low quality and dated. On the other hand, the new logo was essentially designed and voted upon without properly informing or incorporating actual wikibookians (with a few exceptions). I would have never found out about the new logos at all, if i wasnt subscribed to Wikizine, and I dont think many other people here would have ever heard of it if the occasional wikibookian didnt leave a note about it here in the staff lounge. I was under the impression, however, that we didnt have any kind of control over the logo here. How can we make the change ourselves? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:45, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
::We are in complete control, as in those who are regular contributors to Wikibooks and we can set up any (reasonable) policy or vote to try and come up with an approval of this.  One thing to keep in mind is that some stake holders do include Wikibooks users on projects other than en.wikibooks, and some of them (not enough IMHO) did participate in the discussions/votes on Meta as well.  The real trick is to come up with a &quot;Wikibooks meta&quot; area that can coordinate all of the Wikibooks languages, but at the same time make it so those who only have a casual interest in Wikibooks aren't necessarily going to influence too strongly the decision here.
::Simply put, we need to come to a concensus if this is how we want to go or not.  And it is important to recognize that this decision, at least for en.wikibooks, has not been resolved yet.  I would also argue that if en.wikibooks does not accept this logo, that it will have some long-range implications that may create a minor firestorm on the WMF level, but we shouldn't use that necessarily as a threat.  This is something that I think the board of trustees simply aren't even aware of might even be an issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:17, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Ugh. I saw that page a while ago and was rather surprised I had heard nothing previously about it. I, at a visceral level, want to resist because I was not informed. I do agree, however, that the current image is rather outdated. I personally dislike the new logo, though; I think choosing between the two is as choosing between two evils, as the saying goes. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 08:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

: I personally don't &quot;love&quot; the new logo, but I feel it is better than our current one. I do sympathize with Whiteknight in that the logo wasn't very well published around Wikibooks.

:The 'new' logo was decided without the consent of ordinary Wikibooks users.  Therefore I can't support it.

== Wikibooks inhibitor. ==

Over the two months that I have observed Wikibooks I have constantly seen problems that have inhibited its potential growth. The most evident is the lack of appeal of the books. Attention can be aroused if the content is relevant to the audience which most modules here aren’t. This is why I am proposing an effort to cover a generic curriculum of textbooks that can be easily manipulated for individual syllabuses.

I will now state the books for Wikibooks to finish in the coming year at a high quality. These are as follows:
*Write an introduction of the alphabet (use natural examples to prepare an understanding of science).
*Write a book explaining the atlas of the world.
*Write an introduction of numbers.
*Write a guide of handwriting for children, using the technique of Victorian Modern Cursive.
*Write a book of basic arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division mentally and using the written method, decimals, fractions, graphs and also a chapter dedicated to memorising the multiplication series to the number twelve and an independent question book.
*Write books about grammar, punctuation and writing styles. A series of four containing many questions.
*Write a beginner book about the sciences, biology, chemistry and physics.
*Write a book about how to touch type.
*Write a book teaching the basics of instrumental music, piano, violin, viola, cello, etc and of music sheet structure.
*Write a book about sports, the rules and equipment, football (soccer), rugby, American football, cricket, baseball, etc.
*Write a book about intermediate mathematics, algebra, indices, etc.
*Write an intermediate book about describe, argue, explain techniques, media layout and how to compare stories, articles and poems.
*Write intermediate books about biology, chemistry and physics.
*Write a book about how computers work without requiring advanced electronics and computer skills.
*Write a book about how to program using an interpreted programming language.
*Write an advanced mathematics book. Refer to A-Level mathematics for information.
*Write a further advanced mathematics book. Refer to early university material and A-Level further mathematics.
*Write advanced science books.
*Write an advanced English book.

I appreciate constructive criticism.

:Wikibooks has only volunteer contributors, who, naturally enough, write on subjects they enjoy writing about. These don't necessarily correspond to the books on your list. It would be great to have many of the subjects you outline above covered in proper detail here. My question though is, who is going to write them? Maybe we should advertise for new contributors somewhere. But where? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

::Creative use of the Import tool and templates like [[w:Template:Howtobook]] might help some of these along... certainly the sports books, atlas, and science books. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:I will say that there is a pressing need for a substantially complete book that actually meets with some sort of formal curriculum standard.  There have been some abortive attempts at doing this in the past.
:On the whole, I think most of these book suggestions are very good.  I would also like to point out that several of them have been already written on Wikibooks, but trying to find them can be a bit of a struggle.  That certainly needs to be something &quot;cleaned up&quot; here on Wikibooks in the near future.
:Any help that you can provide in writing books of this nature is certainly appreciated.  Unfortunately, most Wikibooks tend to be something that one person writes because they have some sort of personal motivation to get it put together and finished.  Sometimes once something has been substantially written there is a tendancy for somebody to flesh out a minor detail here or there, but that takes time.  Frankly, I don't see Wikibooks becoming significant (as a publisher of e-books) for a couple more years simply because of the substantial effort it takes merely to get a single book put together.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

::I agree, it's going to be a couple years. But better later than never... deadlines aren't necessary IMO. Making wikibooks &quot;searchable&quot; is a different story: using categories to create a base structure and &lt;shudder&gt; maybe some redirect/disambiguation pages would help too. Annotating the bookshelves and putting them in larger fonts would also be a huge plus. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:I'm a graduate student in engineering, so i have plenty of mathematical and scientific background in many of the subjects you listed above. The question then is why don't I work on those books that you've outline above? It's a question of motivation really, and unfortunately, I am unmotivated to work on books like that (or, more precisely, I am more motivated to work on other types of books). Many people have commented in the past that wikibooks is suffering because it lacks a solid base of &quot;fundamental&quot; books. Unfortunately, recognizing the problem and actually solving the problem are two completely different things. Complicating matters most is the fact that books on these subjects really need to be written to fit a specific curriculum, they can't just be freeform. Selecting one curriculum to follow is too narrow, and writing a different book for each different curriculum is too large a task. I am going to be mostly inactive until after the holidays. However, I would like to talk to you more about getting this kind of project started. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:39, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:I am trying to write some books and am starting them myself.  I can see how it would take at least 1-2 years to write curriculum/texts.  Even the big publishing houses take a long time. Here is an article by a textbook editor that brings to light some of the issues: [http://www.edutopia.org/magazine/ed1article.php?id=Art_1195&amp;issue=nov_04][[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 19:10, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

: I agree with your assessment, and I agree with the sentiments of everyone above: it is true that recognizing the problem and solving are in different ballparks. One piece of metadata I consider vital which you missed on some of the texts, however, is scope. For whom are we writing these textbooks? I know that priorities are not shared with all, but I consider this to be essential to developing a quality textbook, and I consider scope to be an imperative concern if we here at Wikibooks are going to be producing ''textbooks'' as opposed to ''wikibooks''. For example, if an editor's intent is to write a math or science textbook, I would approve of and encourage the title not to be X, where X is the name of a field of study like ''Calculus'' or ''Psychology'', but instead to name it ''Calculus for High-school students'' or ''Introduction to Psychology for Undergraduates''. I understand that this encourages forking of textbooks, but I think that this is necessary to provide a clear scope, a writing style, a corpus of assumed knowledge, and a less-than-accurate assessment of the drive of the student.

: What I also notice is that some of the textbook modules do not appear as textbooks in development. If at Wikibooks we are attempting to ''create'' textbooks that can then later be used, I think that we should abandon front pages &amp;mdash; though covers are absolutely necessary for the print and publishable version of the textbooks &amp;mdash; for a consolidated table of contents, to-do list, and general development platform; and also that we should write textbooks more as textbooks than as reference texts. I do not think that we should get rid of reference texts; it can be very useful to create a centralised reference module for, say, integration tables, as has been done at ''[[Engineering Tables]]'', or of false friends/false cognates as has been done at ''[[False Friends of the Slavist]]''. These are very useful and could be immensely helpful when included with print or publishable version of the textbooks. But they are not textbooks themselves; they are reference texts which would be suitable as appendices in textbooks. Similarly, I feel that some wikibooks, including many on the [[wikibooks:languages bookshelf|languages bookshelf]], are reference texts, not textbooks, though they are masquerading as textbooks. Specifically, what use as ''textbook material'' are tables of IPA pronounciations, declensions, verb conjugations, and lists upon lists of vocabulary? I argue that they are of no use as ''textbooks'', though they are as ''reference texts''. And they are necessary to include with textbooks, and should be developed and stay on Wikibooks. A textbook would present material in an accessible manner without inundating the individual with information to the point of incomprehensibility.

: In summary, I think that on en.wikibooks.org, we should develop textbooks with a clearly definable scope and audience; I think that we should focus on developing textbooks to be beautifully presented not in their modules, but instead in their printable or publishable versions; I think that we should clearly distinguish between reference texts and textbooks and focus on the latter; and I think we should create textbooks that are accessible to their intended audience.

::Well, I'm a bit more optimistic... a lot of our books have a lot of potential, but we need more illustration, examples, excersizes, etc. Honestly I think part of the problem is that we '''don't''' print them out often enough, to see how they look on paper (and perhaps even compare them to printed textbooks). Commons went over the million file mark a few weeks ago, but that's not nearly enough, and often they're not the ones we want. A botany textbook might have 2-3 images per page, and 400 pages... that's a thousand just for one book! A complete annotation of Leonardo DaVinci would have how many images? Density is definitely a problem, I agree. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: Iamunknown, I agree that we should define who the textbooks are for - hadn't thought of that.  I wonder, however, if some teachers might use texts straight off their laptops/computers to avoid issues with printing. [[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 16:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

== creation of a new book question ==

I'm a graduate student studying for my comprehensive exams, and I'd like to use a wiki to go through problems and solutions with a couple other people in the program.  I think creating wikibooks for the subjects of the exam would be a good way to do this.  My questions are:

*Is this an appropriate project for wikibooks (working out problems from old comps and discussing the answes - this could be expanded into an appropriate book, I'm sure)?
:*Would this be better for Wikiversity?  It feels like the material would form a series of stand-alone modules or chapters, so I think either format would work.
*Should I title the books, &quot;Graduate ''X''&quot; or add the information to the &quot;Intermediate ''X''&quot; or even &quot;''X''&quot; book?
[[User:Smmurphy|Smmurphy]] 15:42, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

: It sounds more like a textbook than a Wikiversity project, but it's hard to say. For some subjects it might even be good to use both Wikibooks ''and'' Wikiversity, depending on how the subject relates to its source materials, etc.
: As for the title, a specific title that describes the subject is best, &quot;Intermediate&quot; is better than &quot;Graduate&quot;, &quot;Aspect of Topic&quot; even better. What is the topic, by the way? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:52, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

: I'll probably go with &quot;Advanced Macroeconomic Theory&quot; and &quot;Advanced Microeconomic Theory&quot; then.  With macro, especially, there are so many different approaches that it is a bit awkward to write something and call it a book (which seems definitive), but it won't be hard to make it clear what (and whose) approach I am using, and to leave things open for someone else to add material from a different approach at a later date.  Do these titles sound right?  As for using both, it just sounds inelegant, as collaboration becomes difficult if everyone has to check two pages for updates. [[User:Smmurphy|Smmurphy]] 17:30, 22 December 2006 (UTC)


:: I'm typically against the use of qualifiers in book titles. Keep in mind that whatever title you give to your book is the precise string that people are going to need to type into the search box in order to go to your book (without having to look through search results). A book called &quot;Macroeconomic Theory&quot; would do better then &quot;Advanced Macroeconomic Theory&quot;. If you want to create one book for both disciplines, you could have, simply, &quot;Economic Theory&quot;, or &quot;Economic Analysis&quot;. shorter is always better, i think, and you should look for the shortest title that explains your book and isn't already takne. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:31, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

::: [[Macroeconomics]] and [[microeconomics]] would be the lest ornate titles, but I'd like to make sure that an undergraduate not look at the material and feel overwhelmed while attracting someone interested in it at a higher level.  For instance, micro is listed as &quot;high school reading level.&quot;  Also, both of those projects haven't been edited recently, and I'm nervous jumping into an established book like that, adding a bunch of higher level (and confusing to me at least) material.  Would it be better to start a new book, which could be merged with earlier or other projects if they ever intend on becoming &quot;The Great Tome of (Micro/Macro)Economics.&quot;  I'll go with &quot;Microeconomic Theory&quot; and &quot;Macroeconomic Theory.&quot;  Does this logic make sense?

I would, however, encourage you to consider, if appropriate, Johnny's suggestion of ''&quot;Aspect of Topic&quot;''. If it is inappropriate, and a qualifier more specific than ''Advanced'' is also inappropriate, then I would encourage to you stay with ''Advanced''. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:18, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

== Ready to Publish -- Chess ==

The [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/fb/Chess_printable_version.pdf Print version] of chess is clearly nearly ready to publish. I say nearly ready because it doesn't have a cover yet, but that could be rectified pretty easily :-p. (also, a couple of minor issues. See below)

This book has taken a step that few other books have taken. It has a ready-to-print PDF avaliable. Compare this to other complete books like [[Ada]]. Ada is a very mature and complete book, but without a good PDF (indeed, its [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/8/8d/Ada_Programming.pdf PDF] looks like it is straight out of a firefox print operation), it is not ready to publish. Also compare it to [[Lucid Dreaming]]. Lucid Dreaming is a clearly mature book, with a reasonable PDF file, but the lack of pictures makes it uninviting to readers. Aka, Lucid Dreaming is a work in progress.

To point out why the Chess PDF is ready, it has consistant formatting. Chapters have a distinct nameplate, a complete table-of-contents with page numbers is at the beginning, etc. etc. There are enough images to get every point across. Of course, there are some flaws in the formatting. Take page 76. Full Justified text isn't a good thing here. Nonetheless, this book is a step above the rest. It needs to be recognized, and other books need to strive to be more like it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:24, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

: I agree, the PDF looks really good. I like the way information on book, its authors and copyrights was presented. I only think that in books which are using images on different licenses (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, GPL) you should not only give authors but also which licenses apply to which images.

: Can you tell us how to create such professional PDF? Perhaps you could submit some hints to [[Help:Print versions#PDF versions]]? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:38, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I think an excellent way to create a publishable document would to be to use Adobe InDesign or a free and similar program (if one exists). When I used it in my multimedia class, it was absolutely amazing. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Scribus is striving to be the open source version of InDesign. But it holds no candle to InDesign yet, and is Linux-Only (I think). I personally don't know InDesign very well, but I _do_ know that O'Reilly uses DocBook + custom stylesheet for publishing their books. LaTeX is also popular here and there, and GNU uses texinfo to typeset theirs. So GUI is not the only way here, but probably is the one with the lowest learning curve. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:30, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: Look at [[w:Scribus]]. It has native version on Unix, Windows, and Ubunto/Debian linux builds. What I like about it is that it has scripting in Python. That'd be great for me, since that is the one language I can use. Scribus actually looks pretty good. Maybe we at Wikibooks should try it out for our next typesetting task. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:34, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: I've always liked how LaTeX automatically handles the tedious tasks of typesetting, along with its long track record of consistancy, reliability, and... erm... difficulty :-p (it is with the write-&gt;compile-&gt;debug cycle). But now that I know Scribus is also on Windows makes me want to check it out once again. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC) 

::::::I was just reading about LaTeX yesterday. I think it's kinda stupid that there are no decent two-pane editors for it like with HTML editors, but nevertheless, it looks really cool. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 12:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

::::::: To be fair, LaTeX is a turing complete programming language, while HTML only describes stuff like bold, italics, etc. etc. LaTeX may need to run 2, 3, or even 4 times before indicies and references are generated correctly, and each run may takes too long for a real-time editor, especially for the large books. So making a two-pane editor with LaTeX seems difficult to say the least. Its default layout is nice, but it doesn't fit a book IMO. Though, you should look at [http://www.lyx.org/ Lyx], a WYSIWYG editor using LaTeX. I'm not sure how it works with LaTeX, but I've seen it reccomended lots of times. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:02, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I know &quot;how&quot; to make a good book; but I lack the skills to do it (never done it before in my life). I don't have any real advanced desktop-publishing program except Scribus, and don't have many fonts to play with.

Didn't even know it existed. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:38, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I probably should have included what I was going for here :-p I think that there should be 4 levels of featured books. Well-Developed, Completed, Well-Typeset, and Completed Typesetting. Lucid Dreaming and Chess would go into well-typeset, and books with a front and back cover, index and whatever other arbitrary rules we place down would be &quot;Completed Typesetting&quot; :-p Chess is good, but those issues I raised before along with a couple of others (no index... backgrounds of images aren't 100% white, chapter-header kinda runs into the text, a rule or italics would help here, an couple of orphans and windows around (like top of page 15), and whitespace river on page 76). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:: A table that would help clarify:
::* Well Developed -- A book that may not be complete, but is ready to read. Readers will still learn a lot from such books.
::* Completed -- A book that is self-standing and is a complete tutorial on its subject. It starts at a logical beginning, ends at a logical conclusion, and covers everything necessary inbetween. These books may have rudimentary pdfs ready to use.
::* Well-Typeset -- A draft of the book's pdf. It is ready to read and can be printed. The print version may not be perfect, but is is pretty good.
::* Completed Typesetting -- Book is done typesetting and is ready to be printed (or is already being printed)
:: And BTW: [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] [http://www.lulu.com/content/346504 print version] would fall in &quot;completed typesetting&quot; catagory. I knew at least one existed here! --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I like where you are going with this. You seem to be moving towards (tell me off if I'm wrong) open-source textbook ''publishing'', not just ''creation''. Of course, our textbooks never have to be &quot;complete&quot;.

But I like your table. :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:34, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: Exactly. It is kind of that &quot;next big step&quot; here in Wikibooks. And that should start with recognition of the next step, typesetting. Obviously, it is recognized already as the next step (else, Chess wouldn't be in its nice condition) but to formally recognize typesetting as another level of quality should encourage more books to have good typesetting. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC) 

:::: I think we should strongly consider the forming of a typesetting project for talented individuals to collaborate and receive tasks to compile textbooks. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 17:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: I don't. Or more specifically, while I would not agree to creating a centralised page at ''Wikibooks:WikiProject Typesetting'' or something of that sort, I do think that talented users should and would, regardless of a hierarchical project page, collaborate and receive tasks to compile textbooks. I think it would be appropriate to create a ''Wikibooks:'' page detailing the ultimate goal of a Wikibooks textbook; to be published with professional-quality, aesthetically-pleasing typesetting. From that central hub, which would act only as a ''description'' page, as it would not need to be a policy or guideline &amp;mdash; there is nothing to enforce, it is only descriptive &amp;mdash; those talented individuals who were willing to take tasks could post their names therein. Then, naturally, or so I think, contributors would ask them for help, and they would collaborate. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:35, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Recognition is the first step, and we should start with that. We can iron out those issues as they arise. The main thing I'm worried about is that I may not be able to contact Hagindaz; therefore, to fix those errors in the Chess book, I'm going to have to start from &quot;scratch&quot; (at least he has a good design going on here I could copy).

== Where would this go? ==

Would a book on the beatles go on here? If no, where would it go? [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 03:29, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

: If you intend to write a more detailed biography than is at [[w:The Beatles|wikipedia]] (also look at the [[w:Category:The Beatles|eponymous category]]), then you could start it under whatever title you wish. There is only one other biography on Wikibooks that I know of, the ''[[Nikola Tesla]]''. I think that whether or not biographies are appropriate material to include on wikibooks is gray area which has not yet been fleshed out. You're welcome to create it. You would want to consider between contributing to the wikipedia articles more or creating a new wikibook. I would encourage and support a wikibook. It'd be really great! :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:39, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:I for one welcome strongly with open arms any attempt to write a legitimate biography here on Wikibooks.  It is a very legitimate book, and it can be strongly argued that such a book would be used as a &quot;textbook&quot; in an academic setting as well.  It also fits strongly with the idea that Wikibooks can pretty much expand almost any topic on Wikipedia into a full-length textbook.
:All this said, I would also suggest that any biographical information that you want to add that is just adding a little point or two ought to be done on Wikipedia first, although there is an excellent article on Wikipedia under the name [[w:Beatles]].  Certainly there are some resources that you could use for such a book in that article.  It is even reasonable to use that Wikipedia article as the &quot;foundation&quot; for a Wikibook (since the content is available under the GFDL), but it is very important that you should substantially expand any such effort and not make the content merely a fork of the Wikipedia article.
:Other general standards of [[WB:WIW]] also apply here, including NPOV standards and original research exclusions, but I don't think this is going to be that big of a deal with a book about the Beatles.  In other words, yes, please write such a book if you feel inclined but try to keep some high standards when you write something like that.  Also keep in mind that a Wikibook is not intended to be a Wikiproject of random articles of related subjects, but something that has some sort of unifying theme behind it.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:42, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:Would it help unify the book if I created a book on Pink Floyd or the Rolling Stone? They would all be in the same format, and that could spark more and more people writing comprehensive biographies of bands. Is that a good idea? [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 12:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:: First off, I would encourage you to [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold]]. If you think that it is a good idea, then please, by all means, do it. I would also, however, encourage you to consider the that biographies sold in bookstores are generally published as individual books. Furthermore, consider that if a Wikibooks biography is small enough that it could be reasonably merged with a separate Wikibooks biography, that it might be inappropriate for Wikibooks, and may be more appropriate for Wikipedia.
:: While I am not suggesting that my ideas are by any means &quot;hard and fast rules&quot; which everyone will agree with, I encourage you to consider them. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:47, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

== Updating to a new CAPTCHA ==

Seems the current [[w:CAPTCHA]] is a simple arithmetic test displayed in source as plaintext and easily identifiable. We should at the very least introduce some sort of image in it's place. I assume that there are plenty of MediaWiki extensions with various Turing tests. Comments or insights?

Also; does anyone know whom to contatct about actually getting this implemented on the server? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:04, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:It used to be a distorted image CAPTCHA, but last i heard the image server was running slow, and they changed it to the current arithmetic CAPTCHA. You would have to talk to the developers if you want to see it changed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:36, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

== about german book ==

hello,
The german pdf link is not working .... please reupload...
Thanks in advanced
PS: Its downloading with firefox and opera but is 0 MB and not 2.790MB as it should be.

: Yup. I'm getting this as well (by the way, for convenience: [[German]]). No idea what the matter is. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:31, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

: Interesting. I don't have a copy, but [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/archive/2/2d/20060512061958%21German.pdf this] is an older copy of the file. If no one objects, I'll do an ol switch-a-roo on that. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 10:14, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

== Request ==

Why can't you edit the list of completed books? If you can't edit it, I would request that [[SA NC Doing Investigations]] be taken off the list because it has no PDF or print version.[[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 11:36, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

Nevermind, I figured it out.

: PDF/Print Version is not a requirement IIRC for a completed book. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:08, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

== Orphaned redirects? ==

Is there a page where you can see orphaned redirects? I'm sure there's quite a few of them that result from WB:NC pagemoves, and I'm wondering if there's some way we can tell where they are so that we can get rid of them. Do they take up a lot of space? Probably not but every little bit helps, right? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:26, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

: Hmm, I'm fairly new here and still grasping the policies but if it's clearly stated as against Wikibooks policies and guidelines I suggest it be tagged as &quot;speedy&quot;, be assured that it seems to me not a valid text as well as the person not attaining a membership adding to the person's mischievous intentions. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 21:08, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:I removed the protection for the talk page.  This is unreasonable unless somebody is seriously vandalizing the page, as the talk page gives the opportunity to try and explain why the content is being created or to carry on other discussions.  As an administrator, I have often used the talk pages to try and explain why I put in the protection, and these should generally be available even to anon users to want to complain about why admins are going over the top by destroying their stuff.
:I don't mind the protection on the main page, and that seems to be very reasonable at least for the reasons you gave.  Please just remember that we are all new users once ourselves, and to '''Assume Good Faith''' with most people.  We need to try and grow this project, and smashing down on obvious new user experiments doesn't help Wikibooks at all.  While it is now an established tradition that fiction is not permitted on Wikibooks, it may not appear so obvious to somebody new to here, nor was it obvious when Wikibooks started.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Hello. I have used temporary administrator access on the English Wikibooks (as a [[m:stewards|steward]]) to update the [[MediaWiki:Sitenotice|fundraising notice]] promptly when necessary.

Thanks. &lt;small&gt;—[[User talk:Pathoschild/s|Pathoschild]] 01:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

:Thanks for that... I'd been updating taking cues from other projects, but forgot to &quot;enlist&quot; someone while I was on vacation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Spaces in link text==
G'day, I notice that you are replacing spaces in linked names with underscores (e.g. &quot;Miso soup&quot; → &quot;Miso_soup&quot;). Firstly, this is unnecessary because the MediaWiki software automatically handles converting names into URL-friendly strings. Secondly, it might actually be a bad idea, because it could cause some problem later down track - the page names themselves do not have underscores in them (i.e. only the URL-friendly representations of them do). Personally, I'd leave them all as spaces. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

There currently isn't any problem with them; mostly I just wanted to let you know not to bother doing it, because it doesn't have any (positive) impact.

      <comment>[[User:Iamunknown/Staff lounge]] moved to [[User:Iamunknown/Thinktank/Staff lounge]]: move to thinktank central</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Before the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AStaff_lounge&amp;diff=722737&amp;oldid=722545 the most recent archival], the staff lounge was 312 kilobytes and very overwhelming. Currently most issues are hammered out (at least in part) there. I think that something needs to be done. Here I am going to hammer out ideas about what could be done. I invite you to contribute. Please do not remove anything; instead, if for some reason you wish to change something, &lt;s&gt;strike it out&lt;/s&gt;. Discuss on the [[User talk:Iamunknown/Staff lounge|talk page]].

== Brainstorm ==

What is posted at the staff lounge?
* Policy-related text
** Formerly &quot;policy of the week&quot;
** Calls for discussion concerning mature proposals
* General Wikibooks-related questions
* Questions directed from the English Embassy
* Calls for help (clean up, blocking open proxies, etc.)
:This may well be addressed by the postings on the RfA page for and &quot;general&quot; request for help page

What ''should'' be posted in the staff lounge?

== Status quo ==

* Nearly everything is posted at the staff lounge
* NOT desirable IMO (HT)

== How could it change? ==

* Decentralise the staff lounge. A user would go to &amp;#123;[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], see a list of the descriptions of the satellite pages, and then go there.
*: '''Problem:''' then there is no place of maximum visibility
* Have a &amp;#60;input&gt;&lt;/input&gt; box to create a sub-page with the topic title as the sub-page name.
*: '''Problem:''' then users would have to add each sub-page to their watchlist
*: '''Question:''' would it require an extra step to include the sub-page into the staff lounge?

*My big bugbear is navigation - folks just don't know where to look and (by comparison) the Staff Lounge is easy to find (I asked quite a few questions there when I started!).  We really do need to radically improve navigation at the top of SL and then make sure the info gets carried thro to other places where navigation is found including the welcome template.  In passing I feel we should decommission ViP in favour of [[WB:AN]] - nothing like as much of it these days - and try and make more use of the [[WB:AN]] (might be worth placing messages on admin talk pages to make sure they are actually watching it) - scratch that for the new &quot;request for help&quot; page if that gets off the ground!
**&lt;ramble&gt; (A derivative of the 1st one but with max visibility depending on from where) Could we have a page between the staff lounge and the staff lounge for real.  So from some places clicking on the staff lounge would get you a &quot;what do you really want?&quot; page and here is where to go?  Obviously there would be issues about which links got the intervening page but ...&lt;/ramble&gt;
**One possibility: decomission the staff lounge altogether, create a header on top of the main page talk page with the &quot;what do you really want?&quot; navigation which would send you to WB:AN, help request, etc. Or the main page talk page header could just be the staff lounge included as a header.

* Maintain the massive staff lounge but create two templates to wrap around the larger discussion which will minimise them, and then if you want to take part in the discussion, you would just maximise it by clicking an &quot;expand&quot; link
*: '''Problem:''' not scalable. The staff lounge keeps getting bigger, and doing that will only make it ''appear'' to be small.
*: '''Problem:''' does not address the fact that many conversations which are in no way related to each other are being forced into one page.

== Approaching from a different angle ==
What is it that folk are looking for help with (assuming we have a main &quot;help&quot; page)
* &quot;I need help with my layout&quot;
* &quot;I need help with content&quot;
* &quot;I need to know what is acceptable&quot;
* &quot;I need an administrator&quot;
* &quot;I've found a vandal&quot;
* &quot;I need help with repetitive tasks&quot;
* - feel free to add
* Finally if you can't see what you might want above, please ask in the Staff Lounge</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Control Unit provides the Micro-Instructions that are necessary for the execution of a program. The  
micro instruction that should be executed next is decided based on the Current instruction fetched from memory and the bit values off the Various CPU status registers such as Negative, Zero etc. 

Of the two CPU architectures in use the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) and the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) have different philosophies in this regard where the RISC believes in having a larger number of more simple Micro-instructions and the CISC believes in a smaller number of more complex instructions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1.	What is load testing? 

- Load testing is to test that if the application works fine with the loads that result from large number of simultaneous users, transactions and to determine weather it can handle peak usage periods. 

2.	What is Performance testing? 

- Timing for both read and update transactions should be gathered to determine whether system functions are being performed in an acceptable timeframe. This should be done standalone and then in a multi user environment to determine the effect of multiple transactions on the timing of a single transaction. 

3.	Did u use LoadRunner? What version? 

- Yes. Version 7.2. 

4.	Explain the Load testing process?

 -
Step 1: Planning the test. Here, we develop a clearly defined test plan to ensure the test scenarios we develop will accomplish load-testing objectives. Step 2: Creating Vusers. Here, we create Vuser scripts that contain tasks performed by each Vuser, tasks performed by Vusers as a whole, and tasks measured as transactions. Step 3: Creating the scenario. A scenario describes the events that occur during a testing session. It includes a list of machines, scripts, and Vusers that run during the scenario. We create scenarios using LoadRunner Controller. We can create manual scenarios as well as goal-oriented scenarios. In manual scenarios, we define the number of Vusers, the load generator machines, and percentage of Vusers to be assigned to each script. For web tests, we may create a goal-oriented scenario where we define the goal that our test has to achieve. LoadRunner automatically builds a scenario for us. Step 4: Running the scenario.
We emulate load on the server by instructing multiple Vusers to perform tasks simultaneously. Before the testing, we set the scenario configuration and scheduling. We can run the entire scenario, Vuser groups, or individual Vusers. Step 5: Monitoring the scenario.
We monitor scenario execution using the LoadRunner online runtime, transaction, system resource, Web resource, Web server resource, Web application server resource, database server resource, network delay, streaming media resource, firewall server resource, ERP server resource, and Java performance monitors. Step 6: Analyzing test results. During scenario execution, LoadRunner records the performance of the application under different loads. We use LoadRunner’s graphs and reports to analyze the application’s performance. 

5.	When do you do load and performance Testing? 

- We perform load testing once we are done with interface (GUI) testing. Modern system architectures are large and complex. Whereas single user testing primarily on functionality and user interface of a system component, application testing focuses on performance and reliability of an entire system. For example, a typical application-testing scenario might depict 1000 users logging in simultaneously to a system. This gives rise to issues such as what is the response time of the system, does it crash, will it go with different software applications and platforms, can it hold so many hundreds and thousands of users, etc. This is when we set do load and performance testing. 

6.	What are the components of LoadRunner? 

- The components of LoadRunner are The Virtual User Generator, Controller, and the Agent process, LoadRunner Analysis and Monitoring, LoadRunner Books Online. 

7.	What Component of LoadRunner would you use to record a Script? 

- The Virtual User Generator (VuGen) component is used to record a script. It enables you to develop Vuser scripts for a variety of application types and communication protocols. 

8.	What Component of LoadRunner would you use to play Back the script in multi user mode? 

- The Controller component is used to playback the script in multi-user mode. This is done during a scenario run where a vuser script is executed by a number of vusers in a group. 

9.	What is a rendezvous point? 

- You insert rendezvous points into Vuser scripts to emulate heavy user load on the server. Rendezvous points instruct Vusers to wait during test execution for multiple Vusers to arrive at a certain point, in order that they may simultaneously perform a task. For example, to emulate peak load on the bank server, you can insert a rendezvous point instructing 100 Vusers to deposit cash into their accounts at the same time. 

10.	What is a scenario? 

- A scenario defines the events that occur during each testing session. For example, a scenario defines and controls the number of users to emulate, the actions to be performed, and the machines on which the virtual users run their emulations. 

11.	Explain the recording mode for web Vuser script? 

- We use VuGen to develop a Vuser script by recording a user performing typical business processes on a client application. VuGen creates the script by recording the activity between the client and the server. For example, in web based applications, VuGen monitors the client end of the database and traces all the requests sent to, and received from, the database server. We use VuGen to: Monitor the communication between the application and the server; Generate the required function calls; and Insert the generated function calls into a Vuser script. 

12.	Why do you create parameters? 

- Parameters are like script variables. They are used to vary input to the server and to emulate real users. Different sets of data are sent to the server each time the script is run. Better simulate the usage model for more accurate testing from the Controller; one script can emulate many different users on the system. 

13.	What is correlation? Explain the difference between automatic correlation and manual correlation? 

- Correlation is used to obtain data which are unique for each run of the script and which are generated by nested queries. Correlation provides the value to avoid errors arising out of duplicate values and also optimizing the code (to avoid nested queries). Automatic correlation is where we set some rules for correlation. It can be application server specific. Here values are replaced by data which are created by these rules. In manual correlation, the value we want to correlate is scanned and create correlation is used to correlate. 

14.	How do you find out where correlation is required? Give few examples from your projects? 

- Two ways: First we can scan for correlations, and see the list of values which can be correlated. From this we can pick a value to be correlated. Secondly, we can record two scripts and compare them. We can look up the difference file to see for the values which needed to be correlated.  In my project, there was a unique id developed for each customer, it was nothing but Insurance Number, it was generated automatically and it was sequential and this value was unique. I had to correlate this value, in order to avoid errors while running my script. I did using scan for correlation. 

15.	Where do you set automatic correlation options? 

- Automatic correlation from web point of view can be set in recording options and correlation tab. Here we can enable correlation for the entire script and choose either issue online messages or offline actions, where we can define rules for that correlation. Automatic correlation for database can be done using show output window and scan for correlation and picking the correlate query tab and choose which query value we want to correlate. If we know the specific value to be correlated, we just do create correlation for the value and specify how the value to be created. 

16.	What is a function to capture dynamic values in the web Vuser script? 

- Web_reg_save_param function saves dynamic data information to a parameter. 

17.	When do you disable log in Virtual User Generator, When do you choose standard and extended logs? 

- Once we debug our script and verify that it is functional, we can enable logging for errors only. When we add a script to a scenario, logging is automatically disabled. Standard Log Option: When you select
Standard log, it creates a standard log of functions and messages sent during script execution to use for debugging. Disable this option for large load testing scenarios. When you copy a script to a scenario, logging is automatically disabled Extended Log Option: Select
extended log to create an extended log, including warnings and other messages. Disable this option for large load testing scenarios. When you copy a script to a scenario, logging is automatically disabled. We can specify which additional information should be added to the extended log using the Extended log options. 

18.	How do you debug a LoadRunner script? 

- VuGen contains two options to help debug Vuser scripts-the Run Step by Step command and breakpoints. The Debug settings in the Options dialog box allow us to determine the extent of the trace to be performed during scenario execution. The debug information is written to the Output window. We can manually set the message class within your script using the lr_set_debug_message function. This is useful if we want to receive debug information about a small section of the script only. 

19.	How do you write user defined functions in LR? Give me few functions you wrote in your previous project? 

- Before we create the User Defined functions we need to create the external
library (DLL) with the function. We add this library to VuGen bin directory. Once the library is added then we assign user defined function as a parameter. The function should have the following format: __declspec (dllexport) char* &lt;function name&gt;(char*, char*)Examples of user defined functions are as follows:GetVersion, GetCurrentTime, GetPltform are some of the user defined functions used in my earlier project. 

20.	What are the changes you can make in run-time settings?

 - The Run Time Settings that we make are: a) Pacing - It has iteration count. b) Log - Under this we have Disable Logging Standard Log and c) Extended Think Time - In think time we have two options like Ignore think time and Replay think time. d) General - Under general tab we can set the vusers as process or as multithreading and whether each step as a transaction. 

21.	Where do you set Iteration for Vuser testing?

 - We set Iterations in the Run Time Settings of the VuGen. The navigation for this is Run time settings, Pacing tab, set number of iterations. 

22.	How do you perform functional testing under load? 

- Functionality under load can be tested by running several Vusers concurrently. By increasing the amount of Vusers, we can determine how much load the server can sustain. 

23.	What is Ramp up? How do you set this? 

- This option is used to gradually increase the amount of Vusers/load on the server. An initial value is set and a value to wait between intervals can be
specified. To set Ramp Up, go to ‘Scenario Scheduling Options’ 

24.	What is the advantage of running the Vuser as thread? 

- VuGen provides the facility to use multithreading. This enables more Vusers to be run per
generator. If the Vuser is run as a process, the same driver program is loaded into memory for each Vuser, thus taking up a large amount of memory. This limits the number of Vusers that can be run on a single
generator. If the Vuser is run as a thread, only one instance of the driver program is loaded into memory for the given number of
Vusers (say 100). Each thread shares the memory of the parent driver program, thus enabling more Vusers to be run per generator. 

25.	If you want to stop the execution of your script on error, how do you do that? 

- The lr_abort function aborts the execution of a Vuser script. It instructs the Vuser to stop executing the Actions section, execute the vuser_end section and end the execution. This function is useful when you need to manually abort a script execution as a result of a specific error condition. When you end a script using this function, the Vuser is assigned the status &quot;Stopped&quot;. For this to take effect, we have to first uncheck the “Continue on error” option in Run-Time Settings.   

26.	What is the relation between Response Time and Throughput?

 - The Throughput graph shows the amount of data in bytes that the Vusers received from the server in a second. When we compare this with the transaction response time, we will notice that as throughput decreased, the response time also decreased. Similarly, the peak throughput and highest response time would occur approximately at the same time. 

27.	Explain the Configuration of your systems? 

- The configuration of our systems refers to that of the client machines on which we run the Vusers. The configuration of any client machine includes its hardware settings, memory, operating system, software applications, development tools, etc. This system component configuration should match with the overall system configuration that would include the network infrastructure, the web server, the database server, and any other components that go with this larger system so as to achieve the load testing objectives. 

28.	How do you identify the performance bottlenecks? 

- Performance Bottlenecks can be detected by using monitors. These monitors might be application server monitors, web server monitors, database server monitors and network monitors. They help in finding out the troubled area in our scenario which causes increased response time. The measurements made are usually performance response time, throughput, hits/sec, network delay graphs, etc. 

29.	If web server, database and Network are all fine where could be the problem? 

- The problem could be in the system itself or in the application server or in the code written for the application. 

30.	How did you find web server related issues? 

- Using Web resource monitors we can find the performance of web servers. Using these monitors we can analyze throughput on the web server, number of hits per second that
occurred during scenario, the number of http responses per second, the number of downloaded pages per second. 

31.	How did you find database related issues? 

- By running “Database” monitor and help of “Data Resource Graph” we can find database related issues. E.g. You can specify the resource you want to measure on before running the controller and than you can see database related issues 

32.	Explain all the web recording options? 

33.	What is the difference between Overlay graph and Correlate graph?

 - Overlay Graph: It overlay the content of two graphs that shares a common x-axis. Left Y-axis on the merged graph show’s the current graph’s value &amp; Right Y-axis show the value of Y-axis of the graph that was merged. Correlate Graph: Plot the Y-axis of two graphs against each other. The active graph’s Y-axis becomes X-axis of merged graph. Y-axis of the graph that was merged becomes merged graph’s Y-axis. 

34.	How did you plan the Load? What are the Criteria? 

- Load test is planned to decide the number of users, what kind of machines we are going to use and from where they are run. It is based on 2 important documents, Task Distribution Diagram and Transaction profile. Task Distribution Diagram gives us the information on number of users for a particular transaction and the time of the load. The peak usage and off-usage are decided from this Diagram. Transaction profile gives us the information about the transactions name and their priority levels with regard to the scenario we are deciding. 

35.	What does vuser_init action contain? 
- Vuser_init action contains procedures to login to a server. 

36.	What does vuser_end action contain? 
- Vuser_end section contains log off procedures.   

37.	What is think time? How do you change the threshold? 

-   Think time is the time that a real user waits between actions. Example: When a user receives data from a server, the user may wait several seconds to review the data before responding. This delay is known as the think time. Changing the Threshold: Threshold level is the level below which the recorded think time will be ignored. The default value is five (5) seconds. We can change the think time threshold in the Recording options of the Vugen. 

38.	What is the difference between standard log and extended log? 

- The standard log sends a subset of functions and messages sent during script execution to a log. The subset depends on the Vuser type Extended log sends a detailed script execution messages to the output log. This is mainly used during debugging when we want information about: Parameter substitution. Data returned by the server. Advanced trace. 

39.	Explain the following functions: 

- lr_debug_message - The lr_debug_message function sends a debug message to the output log when the specified message class is set. lr_output_message - The lr_output_message function sends notifications to the Controller Output window and the Vuser log file. lr_error_message - The lr_error_message function sends an error message to the LoadRunner Output window. lrd_stmt - The lrd_stmt function associates a character string (usually a SQL statement) with a cursor. This function sets a SQL statement to be processed. lrd_fetch - The lrd_fetch function fetches the next row from the result set. 

40.	Throughput -  If the throughput scales upward as time progresses and the number of Vusers increase, this indicates that the bandwidth is sufficient. If the graph were to remain relatively flat as the number of Vusers increased, it would
be reasonable to conclude that the bandwidth is constraining the volume of
data delivered.  

41.	Types of Goals in Goal-Oriented Scenario -  Load Runner provides you with five different types of goals in a goal oriented scenario: 
o	The number of concurrent Vusers 
o	The number of hits per second 
o	The number of transactions per second 
o	The number of pages per minute 
o	The transaction response time that you want your scenario

42.	Analysis Scenario (Bottlenecks): In Running Vuser graph correlated with the response time graph you can see that as 
the number of Vusers increases, the average response time of the check itinerary transaction very gradually increases. In other words, the average response time steadily increases as the load
increases. At 56 Vusers, there is a sudden, sharp increase in the average response
time. We say that the test broke the server. That is the mean time before failure (MTBF). The response time clearly began to degrade when there were more than 56 Vusers running simultaneously. 

43.	What is correlation? Explain the difference between automatic correlation and manual correlation? 

- Correlation is used to obtain data which are unique for each run of the script and which are generated by nested queries. Correlation provides the value to avoid errors arising out of duplicate values and also optimizing the code (to avoid nested queries). Automatic correlation is where we set some rules for correlation. It can be application server specific. Here values are replaced by data which are created by these rules. In manual correlation, the value we want to correlate is scanned and create correlation is used to correlate. 

44.	Where do you set automatic correlation options? 

- Automatic correlation from web point of view, can be set in recording options and correlation tab. Here we can enable correlation for the entire script and choose either issue online messages or offline actions, where we can define rules for that correlation.  Automatic correlation for database, can be done using show output window and scan for correlation and picking the correlate query tab and choose which query value we want to correlate. If we know the specific value to be correlated, we just do create correlation for the value and specify how the value to be created. 

45.	What is a function to capture dynamic values in the web vuser script? 

- Web_reg_save_param function saves dynamic data information to a parameter.</text>

{{recipesummary|Cheese recipes|1|10 minutes|2|}}

Chupaquesos (&quot;suck cheese&quot;) is a cheesy dish.  The basic idea is to fry cheese until it reaches a rubbery consistency, then cover that rubbery layer with cheese and toppings, then fold it into a tube.  


==Ingredients==
*About 3oz (85g) of &quot;shell&quot; cheese, shredded
*About 1oz (28g) of &quot;filler&quot; cheese, optionally a different kind of cheese, shredded
*Toppings:
**Chopped cold cuts
**Sandwich toppings - banana peppers, [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]], marinated [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], etc
**Marinara sauce

==Procedure==
#In a medium-large non-stick (or cast-iron if you know how to use one) pan, sprinkle the &quot;shell&quot; cheese evenly.  It will melt and bubble, and eventually form a layer of cheese.  
#Once the underside is orange or brown colored, flip it over.
#Sprinkle the filler cheese down the middle, and put whatever toppings you want down the middle.  It's advisable to get the toppings ready in advance - it's a time-critical procedure once it's flipped.
#Fold the shell over, and let it cook long enough to melt the filler cheese if desired.  Serve and eat right away - do dishes later.

Serves one.  Prep time about two minutes, cook time about two minutes.

==MMM pages &amp; naming==

Hi - I notice that you have created some new pages for MMM which look interesting.  I actually don't know the answer to this myself but the pages ''might'' be named Movie Making Manual/DV/Contents rather than the way you have it. I don't see it as a real issue but worth a thought now rather than later (BTW nothing need be lost - pages can be &quot;moved&quot; to the new name).  Let me know if I can help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:12, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Convention ==

I had thought of making it a separate book, but I think it would be best to include it in the MMM umbrella.  To that end, I was just trying to maintain the naming convention as it appeared to be used in MMM thus far.  I have no vested interest in either naming convention as long as it's consistent.  I am wading my way through these thick waters so I'll leave the decision to people who know more about how the mechanics of this site work.  What do you think should be done?

--[[User:Film8ker|Film8ker]] 19:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
:Hi Chris - that is a pity - I was hoping you would have a clear view &lt;g&gt;.  I'll give it some thought and maybe ask around myself - as I say, nothing will be lost if a &quot;move&quot; is better in the end (even to  a separate book.  I'll get back to you if/when I have a bright idea - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)


I'm starting another book about roulette, and according to the naming convention page (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Naming_policy) we should be using the slashes.  I say we should migrate the whole MMM to the slash system if that's the convention.

--[[User:Film8ker|Film8ker]] 19:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

:-I'll take a look but I think almost all MMM is changed to the / system (I know I did some myself).  What is the next book on?  BTW can you sign you posts (on talk pages, or where others do) use &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (its on the toolbar of the editor if you have .js on).  Offline now for a few hours - Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

::-Server has been down I think so little time at pres. With some thought now - how about MMM-DV/ as a naming policy?  It connects it with MMM while leaving some separation (as there should be looking at the pages concerned.  If you need a hand let me know (or want to talk it thro)  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:40, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== New Book Help ==

I'm creating a new book on [[Roulette]].  The guide is a little ambiguous as to how to add the bood to the bookshelf and how to use the new wikibook template.  All I was able to figure out how to do was add a suggestion to the bookshelf.  Have I done everything I need to?

{{Closed|1=&lt;span style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot;&gt;Closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''transwiki'''. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:09, 13 January 2007 (UTC)}}

Marked for speedy as a GFDL copyvio of a wikipedia article, which it is, but appears to have had at least some work done to it since. Apparently a copy of an article that was deleted then reposted on wikipedia, see [[w:List of Trinidadian English terms]]. I recommend adding a query on the article's talk page before deleting. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

*Comment: It ''is'' valid, I randomly googled about 20 of the words and they all came up as being Trinidadian English. This isn't a book, but could it be? --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 00:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
*:Well, it was marked for speedy as a GFDL copyvio, not because of the content. It was copied before the days of import, and apparently we're missing the early edits. (By that measure the current wikipedia article is '''also''' copyvio). We could try to get an admin to undelete the early stuff and import it now, if there were substantial revisions before the one that was copied. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:07, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
*I recuse myself from the discussion as I originally tagged the article as a candidate for speedy deletion. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:32, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
:: What if I rewrote the whole thing? --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 21:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
::: Sure, you could give that a shot. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Transwiki to Wiktionary''' - this is just a syllabary and nothing more, and in fact a violation of [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a dictionary]].  Wiktionary does allow (I've worked on some stuff moved there from Wikibooks like this) some &quot;categories&quot; and other project pages to keep a link like this, and add some of these works into that project.  It would certainly take a slightly different form that current exists here, but it is something that would be interesting to add to the depth that already exists on that sister project. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Transwiki''', as per Rob Horning, unless this gets properly rewritten as a wikibook. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Transwiki''' as with the above comments.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
*Though I recused myself from the discussion, I would like to point out the reason I originally tagged this page for speedy deletion. ''It is in violation of the GFDL.'' It specifically was a copy-and-paste version, with minor edits, of either the 2006-08-05 or 2006-08-09 revision of [[w:List of Trinidadian English terms]], probably as fork in case the content got deleted at [[w:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Trinidadian English terms (second nomination)]]. It was copied without the edit history as required to be legal under the Wikip&amp;aelig;dia's GDFL license. Just food for thought &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 13:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
**Well, we can always import &quot;after the fact&quot; and restore to reflect the modifications here. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
***Up to which revision would you import? From my own analysis, it could have been either the 2006-08-10 or the 2006-08-05 revision that [[User:Grika]] copied from. The only difference between the two is that [[w:User:Mailer Diablo]] removed the afd header as he closed the afd discussion. I know this is incredibly nit-picky, but I want the GFDL copyright issues to be infallible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is plenty of talk now about consolidating the various &quot;get help&quot; pages (VIP, AN, etc) into a single centralized help page. If we do this, it would be an excellent first-step in sorting out the staff-lounge discussion. Essentially, we could use the staff-lounge as a high-visibility disambiguation page, and we could splinter off into topic-specific rooms (although I would favor a minimum number of such rooms). For instance, we could have:

:Welcome to the staff lounge!
:If you would like to request help from a staff member or administrator, see &quot;Get Help Page&quot;.
:If you would like to discuss site-wide issues please see &quot;Staff Lounge/Wikibooks&quot;.
:If you would like to share news with the community, see &quot;Bulletin Board&quot;.
:For general chat, see &quot;Staff Lounge/Chat&quot;.
:To post a complaint, an insult, or other negative message, press Ctrl+F5 and type your message into the box.

(The last part is a little joke, we probably won't include it). Either way, we would essentially break the staff lounge into 4 new destinations (which is better then 1, but not too many), two of which are likely to be on everybody's watchlists already. What do you think about this? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:09, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

:One thing that we need to remember is that most of the posts on staff lounge aren't from newbies looking for help (although we do get those kinds of posts too). What the staff lounge is most used for is a discussion area for seasoned members to discuss changes and post news. We use it as a place to announce other discussions in other places (RfA, important VfD, policies, etc). We could likely keep the main staff lounge page reserved for such announcements (&quot;a new discussion is happening at...&quot;), and use other pages for the actual discussions. That should help the process of keeping all the information centralized, but not overloading staff-lounge with all the actual discussion text. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Time for discussion ==

One of the key things about the process on Wikibooks, and something I hope we don't lose, is that we tend to take a bit more time to discuss issue in comparison to say Wikipedia.  I hope that this is something that continues.

The proposal to try and split up the Staff Lounge into seperate areas, such as &quot;Policy&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Inter-project cooperation&quot;, and &quot;Book development&quot; might be a good idea for this reason alone.  Certainly the Staff Lounge has become quite active and it is becoming increasingly important to try and clear out old discussions just so you aren't overwhelmed when you turn there.

Another alternative that could be done for especially larger discussions is to have that entire discussion moved to a sub-page for itself, with a link prominent on the &quot;top&quot; of the main Staff Lounge page.  This would be done (for now) on an ad-hoc basis, and mainly for the more controversial topics, especially those that seem to be a recurring theme of discussion.

At this point what really needs to happen is for somebody to simply '''be bold''' and make the changes to the Staff Lounge.  I don't see any major opposition to trying to do some reform, and discussion have been held in the past for trying to come up with some sort of archiving policy/procedure to help clean out some of the cruft.  I don't think we are quite at the stage, however, of using a 'bot for doing the cleaning.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Another direction ==

Look at what I've outlined here [User:Iamunknown/Staff_lounge#Approaching_from_a_different_angle] and try and match it to what we already have - AN, SL, Study Help desk and I would like to get in aspects of RFC.  Any good? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:12, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Libraries Reference}}

Haskell'98 supports just one array constructor type, namely [http://haskell.org/onlinereport/array.html Array], which gives you immutable
boxed arrays. &quot;Immutable&quot; means that these arrays, like any other pure
functional data structure, have contents fixed at construction time.
You can't modify them, only query. There are &quot;modification&quot; operations,
but they just return new arrays and don't modify the original one. This
makes it possible to use Arrays in pure functional code along with lists.
&quot;Boxed&quot; means that array elements are just ordinary Haskell (lazy)
values, which are evaluated on demand, and can even contain bottom
(undefined) value. You can learn how to use these arrays at
http://haskell.org/tutorial/arrays.html and I'd recommend that you read
this before proceeding to the rest of this page.

Nowadays the main Haskell compilers, GHC and Hugs, ship with
the same set of [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html Hierarchical Libraries],
and these libraries contain a new implementation of arrays which is
backward compatible with the Haskell'98 one, but which has far more features.
Suffice it to say that these libraries support 9 types of array
constructors: Array, UArray, IOArray, IOUArray, STArray, STUArray,
DiffArray, DiffUArray and StorableArray. It is no wonder that the
array libraries are a source of so much confusion for new Haskellers. However, they are actually very simple - each provides just one of two interfaces, and one of these you already know.

== Quick reference ==

! IO monad&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;instance MArray a e IO&lt;/code&gt;

|-

| &lt;code&gt;IOUArray&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;StorableArray&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;STUArray&lt;/code&gt;
|}

== Immutable arrays ==

The first interface provided by the new array library, is defined
by the typeclass IArray (which stands for &quot;immutable array&quot; and defined
in the module {{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|IArray}})
and defines the same operations that were defined for Array in
Haskell '98. Here's a simple example of its use that prints &lt;code&gt;(37,64)&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
import Data.Array
buildPair :: (Int, Int)
buildPair = let arr  = listArray (1,10) (repeat 37) :: Array Int Int
                arr' = arr // [(1, 64)]
            in (arr ! 1, arr' ! 1)

main = print buildPair
&lt;/pre&gt;

The big difference is that it is now a typeclass and there are 4
array type constructors, each of which implements this interface: Array,
UArray, DiffArray, and DiffUArray. We will later describe the differences
between them and the cases when these other types are preferable to use instead
of the good old Array. Also note that to use Array type constructor
together with other new array types, you need to import
Data.Array.IArray module instead of Data.Array.

== Mutable IO arrays ==

The second interface is defined by the type class MArray (which stands for
&quot;mutable array&quot; and is defined in the module {{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|MArray}})
and contains operations to update array elements in-place. Mutable
arrays are very similar to IORefs, only they contain multiple values. Type
constructors for mutable arrays are IOArray and IOUArray (in {{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|IO}}) and
operations which create, update and query these arrays all belong to the
IO monad:

&lt;pre&gt;
import Data.Array.IO
main = do arr &lt;- newArray (1,10) 37 :: IO (IOArray Int Int)
          a &lt;- readArray arr 1
          writeArray arr 1 64
          b &lt;- readArray arr 1 
          print (a,b)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This program creates an array of 10 elements with all values initially set to 37. Then it reads 
the first element of the array. After that, the
program modifies the first element of the array and then reads it
again. The type declaration in the second line is necessary because our little
program doesn't provide enough context to allow the compiler to determine the concrete type of &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt;.

== Mutable arrays in ST monad ==

In the same way that IORef has its more general cousin STRef, IOArray has a more
general version STArray (and similarly, IOUArray is parodied by STUArray; both defined in {{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|ST}}). These
array types allow one to work with mutable arrays in the ST monad:

&lt;pre&gt;
import Control.Monad.ST
import Data.Array.ST

buildPair = do arr &lt;- newArray (1,10) 37 :: ST s (STArray s Int Int)
               a &lt;- readArray arr 1
               writeArray arr 1 64
               b &lt;- readArray arr 1
               return (a,b)

main = print $ runST buildPair
&lt;/pre&gt;

Believe it or not, now you know all that is needed to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; any
array type. Unless you are interested in speed issues, just use Array,
IOArray and STArray where appropriate. The following topics are almost
exclusively about selecting the proper array type to make programs run
faster.

== Freezing and thawing ==
Haskell allows conversion between immutable and mutable arrays with the freeze and thaw functions:
&lt;pre&gt;
freeze :: (Ix i, MArray a e m, IArray b e) =&gt; a i e -&gt; m (b i e)
thaw   :: (Ix i, IArray a e, MArray b e m) =&gt; a i e -&gt; m (b i e)
&lt;/pre&gt;

For instance, the following converts an Array into an STArray, alters it, and then converts it back:
&lt;pre&gt;
import Data.Array
import Control.Monad.ST
import Data.Array.ST

buildPair :: (Int, Int)
buildPair = let arr  = listArray (1,10) (repeat 37) :: Array Int Int
                arr' = modifyAsST arr
            in (arr ! 1, arr' ! 1)

modifyAsST :: Array Int Int -&gt; Array Int Int
modifyAsST arr = runST $ do starr &lt;- thaw arr
                            compute starr
                            newarr &lt;- freeze starr
                            return newarr

compute :: STArray s Int Int -&gt; ST s ()
compute arr = do writeArray arr 1 64

main = print buildPair
&lt;/pre&gt;

Freezing and thawing both copy the entire array. If you want to use the same memory locations before and after freezing or thawing but
can allow some access restrictions, see the section [[#Unsafe operations and running over array elements|Unsafe operations and running over array elements]].

== DiffArray ==

As we already stated, the update operation on immutable arrays (IArray)
just creates a new copy of the array, which is very inefficient, but it is a
pure operation which can be used in pure functions. On the other hand,
updates on mutable arrays (MArray) are efficient but can be done only
in monadic code. DiffArray (defined in {{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|Diff}}) combines the best of both worlds - it
supports the IArray interface and therefore can be used in a purely
functional way, but internally it uses the efficient update of MArrays.

How does this trick work? DiffArray has a pure external interface, but
internally it is represented as a reference to an IOArray.

When the '//' operator is applied to a diff array, its contents
are physically updated in place. The old array silently changes
its representation without changing the visible behavior:      
it stores a link to the new current array along with the       
difference to be applied to get the old contents.              
                                                               
So if a diff array is used in a single-threaded style,         
that is, after '//' application the old version is no longer used, 
then &lt;code&gt;a ! i&lt;/code&gt; takes O(1) time and &lt;code&gt;a // d&lt;/code&gt; takes
O(n) time. Accessing elements of older versions gradually becomes slower. 
                                                               
Updating an array which is not current makes a physical copy.  
The resulting array is unlinked from the old family. So you    
can obtain a version which is guaranteed to be current and     
thus has fast element access by performing the &quot;identity update&quot;,
&lt;code&gt;old // []&lt;/code&gt;.                  

The library provides two &quot;differential&quot; array constructors - DiffArray,
made internally from IOArray, and DiffUArray, based on IOUArray. If you
really need to, you can construct new &quot;differential&quot; array types from any
'MArray' types living in the 'IO' monad. See the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Array-Diff.html module documentation] for further details.

Usage of DiffArray doesn't differ from that of Array, the only difference is memory consumption and speed:

&lt;pre&gt;
import Data.Array.Diff

main = do
       let arr = listArray (1,1000) [1..1000] :: DiffArray Int Int
           a = arr ! 1
           arr2 = arr // [(1,37)]
           b = arr2 ! 1
       print (a,b)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use 'seq' to force evaluation of array elements prior to updating an array:
       
&lt;pre&gt;
import Data.Array.Diff

main = do
       let arr = listArray (1,1000) [1..1000] :: DiffArray Int Int
           a = arr ! 1
           b = arr ! 2
           arr2 = a `seq` b `seq` (arr // [(1,37),(2,64)])
           c = arr2 ! 1
       print (a,b,c)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Unboxed arrays ==

In most implementations of lazy evaluation, values are represented at runtime as pointers to either their value, or code for computing their value. This extra level of indirection, together with any extra tags needed by the runtime, is known as a box. The default &quot;boxed&quot; arrays consist of many of these boxes, each of which may compute its value separately. This allows for many neat tricks, like recursively defining an array's elements in terms of one another, or only computing the specific elements of the array which are ever needed. However, for large arrays, it costs a lot in terms of overhead, and if the entire array is always needed, it can be a waste.

Unboxed arrays (defined in {{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|Unboxed}}) are more like arrays in C - they contain just the plain
values without this extra level of indirection, so that, for example,
an array of 1024 values of type Int32 will use only 4 kb of memory. 
Moreover, indexing of such arrays can be significantly faster.

Of course, unboxed arrays have their own disadvantages. First, unboxed
arrays can be made only of plain values having a fixed size -- Int, Word,
Char, Bool, Ptr, Double and others (listed in the 
[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/array/Data-Array-Unboxed.html#t%3AUArray UArray class definition]).
You can even implement unboxed arrays yourself for other
simple types, including enumerations. But Integer, String and any
other types defined with variable size cannot be elements of unboxed arrays.
Second, without that extra level of indirection, all of the elements in an unboxed array must be evaluated when the array is evaluated, so you lose the benefits of lazy evaluation. Indexing the array to read just one element will construct the entire array. This is not much of a loss if you will eventually need the whole array, but it does prevent recursively defining the array elements in terms of each other, and may be too expensive if you only ever need specific values. Nevertheless, unboxed arrays are a very useful optimization
instrument, and I recommend using them as much as possible.

All main array types in the library have unboxed counterparts:

 Array - UArray          (module Data.Array.Unboxed)
 IOArray - IOUArray      (module Data.Array.IO)
 STArray - STUArray      (module Data.Array.ST)
 DiffArray - DiffUArray  (module Data.Array.Diff)

So, basically replacing boxed arrays in your program with unboxed ones
is very simple - just add 'U' to the type signatures, and you are done! Of course, if you change Array to UArray, you also need to add &quot;Data.Array.Unboxed&quot;
to your imports list.

== StorableArray ==

A storable array ({{Haskell lib|p=array|v=latest|Data|Array|Storable}}) is an IO-mutable array which stores its
contents in a contiguous memory block living in the C
heap. Elements are stored according to the class 'Storable'.
You can obtain the pointer to the array contents to manipulate
elements from languages like C.

It is similar to 'IOUArray' (in particular, it implements the same
MArray interface) but slower. The advantage is that it's compatible
with C through the foreign function interface. The memory addresses of
storable arrays are fixed, so you can pass them to C routines.

The pointer to the array contents is obtained by 'withStorableArray'.
The idea is similar to 'ForeignPtr' (used internally here).
The pointer should be used only during execution of the 'IO' action
returned by the function passed as argument to 'withStorableArray'.

 {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fglasgow-exts #-}
 import Data.Array.Storable
 import Foreign.Ptr
 import Foreign.C.Types
 
 main = do arr &lt;- newArray (1,10) 37 :: IO (StorableArray Int Int)
           a &lt;- readArray arr 1
           withStorableArray arr 
               (\ptr -&gt; memset ptr 0 40)
           b &lt;- readArray arr 1
           print (a,b)
 
 foreign import ccall unsafe &quot;string.h&quot; 
     memset  :: Ptr a -&gt; CInt -&gt; CSize -&gt; IO ()

If you want to use this pointer afterwards, ensure that you call
'touchStorableArray' AFTER the last use of the pointer,
so that the array will be not freed too early.


Additional comments: GHC 6.6 should make access to a 'StorableArray' as fast as to any other unboxed array. The only difference between 'StorableArray' and 'UArray' will be that UArray lies in relocatable part of GHC heap while 'StorableArray' lies in non-relocatable part and therefore keep the fixed address, what allow to pass this address to the C routines and save it in the C data structures.

GHC 6.6 also adds 'unsafeForeignPtrToStorableArray' operation that allows
to use any Ptr as address of 'StorableArray' and in particular work with
arrays returned by C routines. Example of using this operation:

 import Data.Array.Storable
 import Foreign.Marshal.Alloc
 import Foreign.Marshal.Array
 import Foreign.ForeignPtr
 
 main = do ptr &lt;- mallocArray 10
           fptr &lt;- newForeignPtr_ ptr
           arr &lt;- unsafeForeignPtrToStorableArray (1,10) fptr :: IO (StorableArray Int Int)
           writeArray arr 1 64
           a &lt;- readArray arr 1
           print a
           free ptr

This example allocs memory for 10 Ints (which emulates array returned by some C function),
then converts returned 'Ptr Int' to 'ForeignPtr Int' and 'ForeignPtr Int' to
'StorableArray Int Int'. It then writes and reads first element of array. At the end,
memory used by array is deallocated by 'free' which again emulates deallocation
by C routines. We can also enable automatic freeing of allocated block by replacing
&quot;newForeignPtr_ ptr&quot; with &quot;newForeignPtr finalizerFree ptr&quot;. In this case memory will be 
automatically freed after last array usage, as for any other Haskell objects.

== The Haskell Array Preprocessor (STPP) ==

Using mutable arrays in Haskell (IO and ST ones) is not very handy.
But there is one tool which adds syntax sugar and makes using of such
arrays very close to that in imperative languages. It is written by
Hal Daume III and you can get it as
http://hal3.name/STPP/stpp.tar.gz 

Using this tool, you can index array elements in arbitrary complex
expressions with just &quot;arr[|i|]&quot; notation and this preprocessor will
automatically convert such syntax forms to appropriate calls to
'readArray' and 'writeArray'. Multi-dimensional arrays are also
supported, with indexing in the form &quot;arr[|i|][|j|]&quot;. See further
descriptions at http://hal3.name/STPP/


== ArrayRef library ==

The [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Library/ArrayRef#Reimplemented_Arrays_library ArrayRef library] reimplements array libraries with the following extensions:

* dynamic (resizable) arrays
* polymorphic unboxed arrays

It also adds [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Library/ArrayRef#Syntax_sugar_for_mutable_types syntax sugar]
what simplifies arrays usage. Although not
so elegant as with STPP, it's on other hand implemented entirely
inside Haskell language, without any preprocessors.


== Unsafe operations and running over array elements ==
As mentioned above, there are operations that converts between mutable and immutable arrays of the same type, namely 'freeze' (mutable → immutable) and 'thaw' (immutable → mutable). These copy the entire array. If you are sure that a mutable array will not be modified or that an immutable array
will not be used after the conversion, you can use unsafeFreeze/unsafeThaw
instead - these operations convert array in-place if input and resulting
arrays have the same memory representation (i.e. the same type and
boxing). Please note that &quot;unsafe*&quot; operations modifies memory - they
sets/clears flag in array header which tells about array mutability.
So these operations can't be used together with multi-threaded access
to array (using threads or some form of coroutines).

There are also operations that converts unboxed arrays to another
element type, namely castIOUArray and castSTUArray. These operations
rely on actual type representation in memory and therefore there is no
any guarantees on their results. In particular, these operations can
be used to convert any unboxable value to the sequence of bytes and
vice versa, f.e. it's used in AltBinary library to serialize
floating-point values. Please note that these operations don't
recompute array bounds according to changed size of elements. You
should do it yourself using 'sizeOf' operation!

While arrays can have any type of indexes, internally any index after
bounds checking is converted to plain Int value (position) and then one of
low-level operations, unsafeAt, unsafeRead, unsafeWrite, is used. You
can use these operations yourself in order to outpass bounds checking
and make your program faster. These operations are especially useful
if you need to walk through entire array:

&lt;pre&gt;
-- | Returns a list of all the elements of an array, in the same order
-- as their indices.
elems arr = [ unsafeAt arr i | i &lt;- [0 .. rangeSize (bounds arr)-1] ]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&quot;unsafe*&quot; operations in such loops are really safe because 'i' loops
only through positions of existing array elements.

== GHC-specific topics ==
=== Parallel arrays (module GHC.PArr) ===

As we already mentioned, array library supports two array varieties -
lazy boxed arrays and strict unboxed ones. Parallel array implements
something intervening - it's a strict boxed immutable array. This
keeps flexibility of using any data type as array element while makes
both creation and access to such arrays much faster. Array creation
implemented as one imperative loop that fills all array elements,
while access to array elements don't need to check &quot;box&quot;. It should be
obvious that parallel arrays are not efficient in cases where
calculation of array elements are rather complex and you will not use
most of array elements. One more drawback of practical usage is that
parallel arrays don't support IArray interface which means that you
can't write generic algorithms which work both with Array and parallel
array constructor.

Like many GHC extensions, this is described in a paper: [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CK03.html An Approach to Fast Arrays in Haskell], by Manuel M. T. Chakravarty and Gabriele Keller.

You can also look at sources of [http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/base/GHC/PArr.hs GHC.PArr] module, which contains a lot of comments.

Special syntax for parallel arrays is enabled by &quot;ghc -fparr&quot; or &quot;ghci -fparr&quot; which is undocumented in user manual of GHC 6.4.1.


=== Welcome to the machine ===

'''Array#, MutableArray#, ByteArray#, MutableByteArray#, pinned and moveable byte arrays'''

GHC heap contains two kinds of objects - some are just byte sequences,
other contains pointers to other objects (so called &quot;boxes&quot;). These
segregation allows to find chains of references when performing
garbage collection and update these pointers when memory used by heap
is compacted and objects are moved to new places. Internal (raw) GHC's
type Array# represents a sequence of object pointers (boxes). There is
low-level operation in ST monad which allocates array of specified size in heap,
its type is something like (Int -&gt; ST s Array#). The Array# type is used
inside Array type which represents boxed immutable arrays.

There is a different type for '''mutable''' boxed arrays
(IOArray/STArray), namely MutableArray#. Separate type for mutable
arrays required because of 2-stage garbage collection mechanism.
Internal representation of Array# and MutableArray# are the same
excluding for some flags in header and this make possible to on-place
convert MutableArray# to Array# and vice versa (this is that
unsafeFreeze and unsafeThaw operations do).

Unboxed arrays are represented by the ByteArray# type. It's just a plain
memory area in the heap, like the C's array. There are two primitive operations
that creates a ByteArray# of specified size - one allocates memory in
normal heap and so this byte array can be moved each time when
garbage collection occurs. This prevents converting of ByteArray#
to plain memory pointer that can be used in C procedures (although
it's still possible to pass current ByteArray# pointer to &quot;unsafe
foreign&quot; procedure if it don't try to store this pointer somewhere).
The second primitive allocates ByteArray# of specified size in
&quot;pinned&quot; heap area, which contains objects with fixed place. Such byte
array will never be moved by GC so it's address can be used as plain
Ptr and shared with C world. First way to create ByteArray# used
inside implementation of all UArray types, second way used in
StorableArray (although StorableArray can also point to data,
allocated by C malloc).

There is also MutableByteArray# type what don't had much difference
with ByteArray#, but GHC's primitives support only monadic read/write
operations for MutableByteArray#, and only pure reads for ByteArray#,
plus unsafeFreeze/unsafeThaw operations that changes appropriate
fields in headers of this arrays. This differentiation don't make much
sense except for additional safety checks.

So, pinned MutableByteArray# or C malloced memory used inside
StorableArray, unpinned MutableByteArray# used inside IOUArray and
STUArray, and unpinned ByteArray# are used inside UArray.

Both boxed and unboxed arrays API are almost the same:

 marr &lt;- alloc n            - allocates mutable array with given size
 arr  &lt;- unsafeFreeze marr  - converts mutable array to immutable one
 marr &lt;- unsafeThaw arr     - converts immutable array to mutable one
 x    &lt;- unsafeRead marr i  - monadic reading of value with given index from mutable array
 unsafeWrite marr i x       - monadic writing of value with given index from mutable array
 let x = unsafeAt arr i     - pure reading of value with given index from immutable array
 (all indexes are counted from 0)

Based on these primitive operations, the arrays library implements
indexing with any type and with any lower bound, bounds checking and
all other high-level operations. Operations that creates/updates
immutable arrays just creates them as mutable arrays in ST monad, make
all required updates on this array and then use unsafeFreeze before
returning array from runST. Operations on IO arrays are implemented
via operations on ST arrays using stToIO operation.

=== Mutable arrays and GC ===

GHC implements 2-stage GC which is very fast - minor GC occurs after
each 256 kb allocated and scans only this area (plus recent stack
frames) when searching for a &quot;live&quot; data. This solution uses the fact
that usual Haskell data are immutable and therefore any data
structures that was created before previous minor GC can't point to
the data structures created after this GC (due to immutability data
can contain only &quot;backward&quot; references).

But this simplicity breaks when we add to the language mutable
boxed references (IORef/STRef) and arrays (IOArray/STArray).
On each GC, including minor ones, each element in
mutable data structures should be scanned because it may be updated
since last GC and now point to the data allocated since last GC.

For programs that contains a lot of data in mutable boxed
arrays/references GC times may easily outweigh useful computation time.
Ironically, one of such programs is GHC itself.
Solution for such programs is to add to cmdline option like &quot;+RTS -A10m&quot;
which increases size of minor GC chunks from 256 kb to 10 mb, i.e.
makes minor GC 40 times less frequent. You can see effect of this
change using &quot;+RTS -sstderr&quot; option - &quot;%GC time&quot; should significantly decrease.

There is a way to include this option into your executable so it will
be used automatically on each execution - you should just add to your
project C source file that contains the following line:

 char *ghc_rts_opts = &quot;-A10m&quot;;

Of course, you can increase or decrease this value according to your needs.

Increasing &quot;-A&quot; value don't comes for free - aside from obvious
increasing of memory usage, execution times (of useful code) will also
grow. Default &quot;-A&quot; value tuned to be close to modern CPU cache sizes
that means that most of memory references are fall inside the cache.
When 10 mb of memory are allocated before doing GC, this data locality
is no more holds. So, increasing &quot;-A&quot; can either increase or decrease
program speed, depending on its nature. Try various settings between
64 kb and 16 mb while running program with &quot;typical&quot; parameters and
try to select a best setting for your concrete program and cpu combination.

There is also another way to avoid increasing GC times - use either
unboxed or immutable arrays. Also note that immutable arrays are build
as mutable ones and then &quot;freezed&quot;, so during the construction time GC
will also scan their contents.

Hopefully, GHC 6.6 fixed the problem - it remembers what
references/arrays was updated since last GC and scans only them. You
can suffer from the old problems only in the case when you use very
large arrays.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Panic ==
I have now given enough information on where I stand and what I defend, on this arbitration and in any of my actions I don't see myself represented in any of the accusations, I don't have any history of &quot;disruptive behavior&quot; even if some users have that idea, it is without basis.

I don't see &quot;reverting&quot; as an aggressive act while it doesn't involve the &quot;destruction&quot; of content (if not spam). I have been reverted many times before and during the arbitration and will probably see my edits reverted in the future, I have no problem with it and if I had I would address the users that did the reversions if I don't see a reason for it.

I have no difficulty and I'm even accustomed to work with others, but I grant you that a few users had a problem with my view for my work here and in all these years of active involvement on Wikibooks you have now a good idea on how many disagreements I had. (2, Paddu and Darklama)

I have been a good contributor to Wikibooks and I object having Darklama's problems in working with me stated as my problems, Darklama's has violated several policies and guidelines and even legal impositions and my civility on dealing and engaging the user in discussion is portrayed as my inability to deal with others, nothing could be more far from the truth as can be attested by the number of contributors to the books I work on clearly demonstrate.

My actions on Wikibooks do speak for themselves if the reader takes the chance to examine them, but I do not agree that any other cause or past event should be used to validate the reasons for the block that brought us to this Arbitration.

I have taken the time to provide the reader some information on the background since the accusation seems to imply that it had a bearing on its actions.

As I stated before the attempt to involve Paddu in this discussion (that has nothing directly related with the C++ Book) was (as I tried to hint in my colorful illustration, the involvement of North Korea on the fight against terrorism) wrong, as the subjects and events of my divergence with Paddu don't have any bearing or prove any of the points the accusation tries to validate, they were of importance and significance but the Wikibooks community failed to provide a viable solution at the time, I found one and took the chance to make use of it and so ended that dispute, as Paddu can and will confirm if asked, he was not actively contributing to the book in question (there were contributions made by him but he had stopped contributing content long before I started), I even recognize the right of precedence to Paddu, since he was there before I came (this isn't generally recognized in Wikibooks or at least they recently aren't), Paddu's divergence with me was on the format and scope of the book (even the actual forking proposal does state that they can be a base for a fork), I was adding content that Paddu thought shouldn't be on the book and I was using a format he didn't like (I was using a monolithic approach much like Darklama merge of several pages on a single one), this facilitated me to provide the book a better flow and order, since I started working on it, Paddu did not add any content and was only defending his vision for the work, even after the fork the original work stalled (I and a few others were the only ones contributing actively to it), at that time and after a few structural changes to the original book (some of the content I added and changes were approved by Paddu, he stopped using Wikibooks).

Paddu was also involved at the time in other Wikibooks discussions, policy and general improvements and in helping new users, I don't see as the fork was the bases for Paddu to quit Wikibooks but I can understand as it being a factor on his decision(you have to ask him that), I never tried to engage Paddu since he had stated he did not had the time or disposition to add content to any of the books. (and the &quot;fork&quot; solution was only taken because we were actively reverting each others changes, I take the  blame for the &quot;fork&quot; as that was the only solution viable at the time, and it worked, all this can be gathered form the history files or by directly asking any me or Paddu about it)

The resulting work or &quot;the forked&quot; (Programming:C -/- -/-) continued it's evolution on his own namespace with several users participating actively on it up to the forced merge, the general community (or some admins if you prefer) at the time took into themselves to force the merge, even against what I consider a proper approval of the decision to force a merge, I took the time to fight the merge (I was the only of both books communities, if you like) even taking care to defend Paddu's view points and different intentions for the original book since he wasn't present at the time (can't remember if I did send him a email or not, I think I did). (I also take this time to correct the stated page history problem, there isn't one, a fork is an independent version of a work the history logs don't need to be merged, the only need is to give credit to the original work and authors, it was and it is still maintained after the merge, some credits are given to the &quot;forked&quot; version since the result of the merge substituted the original work and the &quot;fork&quot; was deleted)

More, Paddu's involvement was clearly an attempt to provide more fodder and bases to validate wrongful actions, this is simply too clear as the only persons contacted by the other party were the ones they saw has having a problem with me, in this case they were wrong my problem with Paddu ended after the fork, I did not engage the user or performed any action on the &quot;original&quot; work after it, I and Paddu didn't like the solution but it did solve our problems, at the time as I wasn't interested in debating simple change as was happening, I was more interested in adding content to the books, I see the creation of disputes as the primary factor to reduce my creative contribution to the projects I'm involved and a major reason of frustration to any user, that is why I can comprehend Darklama's stance on the problem and it was that point that did get me a bit angry in seeing the other user getting pulled into our divergence, since the &quot;forced&quot; merge I have taken the time to become more involved with the community to try to address some of it's structural problems and so I have carefully addressed Darklama's actions and proposals in a very civil and contained way.

If Paddu has some points that he thinks should be addressed he is free to propose/request any change and if there is a need to restore any pages histories please don't blame me or any of my actions, check how the merge was performed, 90% is a simple move of my &quot;forked&quot; version, I did not initiate the merge (I did help with the moving of some pages as requested, but not the main talk or other primary sections of the work), I never stopped working on it since I've started, I did at least one edit a week.

So it seems to me clear that the if the accusation didn't already know this facts, it didn't spend any time finding about them, it is also clear on the last statement by SB_Johnny, he doesn't have a good understanding on what did happen at that time (the fork), and on the evolution/history of the book or even a unbiased understanding on Darklama's actions, even so, he claims to be acting on his interpretations those events, events that don't have nothing to do with the actual problem(s) he indicated as being addressing and are stated on the block logs and seem to be now the base of the accusation.

== Blocks ==
The accusation bases all the blocks in my inability to be civil even if the [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] has a very high degree of interpretations, I have so far proven that I never violated the core premise of the policy, that is to respect my neighbors and keep being civil and the accusation fails to prove that point.

All the blocks were made without properly addressing the [[Wikibooks:Blocking Policy]], I'm not a vandal, I did not engage in actively reverting pages, I did not break any policy (even if I did the policy clearly states ''&quot;Admins should only do this as a last resort - efforts to educate must be made first, followed by warnings.&quot;'' this was not followed and blocks were done on the spot) and finally I'm not a troublemaker and I'm contributing to Wikibooks goals that is a particular factor for me being still here defending what I think should be corrected and avoided in the future. Even the timeout of the block is a clear abuse of the policy as an active vandal is given only a 24h block, more, the policy clearly states that ''&quot;Use of blocks to gain advantage in a content dispute is prohibited.&quot;'' (I have demonstrated that there is a clear convergence or cooperation with the users SBJohnny and Darklama)

I have provided extensive information on the several blocks events, as the accusation sees them as a chain of events that lead to its final action and the one that resulted in this arbitration, I think it is now obvious that the action was (failing other description) &quot;abusive&quot;.

Since the accusation fails to correct any of his assertions, I must again clearly state that user James Dennet was not a new user, he is only an unexperienced user to Wikibooks, he has been collaborating here almost as long as I.

== The charges ==
:''&quot; If repeated often enough, a lie will become the new truth. &quot;''
:Paul Joseph Goebbles, Minister of Propaganda,  Nazi Germany

All these lies may now be considered facts, but factual truths can prove all to be myths. I think I have already provided enough proof to refute any of the facts taken as justification for the charges made against me. On the other hand no proof was presented so far that would validate any of the charges, or to change my mind on my request for the removal of the block, the arbitration even provided some actions and facts that I now seen in a new and darker light.

== SB_Johnny &amp; Darklama ==
It is now clear that there is convergence, cooperation and coordination between the users SBJohnny and Darklama, I made some assumptions and since no rebuttal addressed those interpretations or the facts I brought so far to the reader attention, it is still one of the points that must be granted greater attention.

All that I have to say to the accusation I have already stated and the accusation did not provide any new evidence or information that I need to address. There was a small shift on the accusation to the Paddu event I think I have now cleared up. They are in complete agreement as was expected and the actions indicate, it's with some dismay that I can't understand why SBJohnny took this path as even if he was misinformed he should have taken the time to get a better understanding of the problem or just excused himself from taking action on this way, after the second block I made clear to SBJohnny that I had the right to and would address any action I took as unfair.

== Closing Words ==
A Wikibookian few &quot;possessions&quot; or traits include his reputation, his contributions log and other permanent logs of his activities, that includes the users block log, this is the yard stick by one is judged and recognized by his pears.

Reputation is very volatile thing and is built on how others perceive events or take the time to check the facts it is the most easy way to cause damage to another user and the most hard to correct and only time and or the ever changing community can restore, permanent logs are forever, not even time will fix them , that is why so much trouble was taken in making clear to administrators to use the block function with especial attention and that it should only be used in extreme situations as is clearly stated in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:MediaWiki_Administrator's_Handbook/User_Block MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook/User Block], so, since I consider that the blocking action that generated this arbitration was not fair and even broke the [[Wikibooks:Assume_good_faith]] in regards to my actions among other considerations that I have by now demonstrated.

My participation on the moderation isn't only based on my wish to have the block removed it is also as a demonstration that users in general can be easy prey from abuse, even more if they don't participate on the community, most users are anonymous contributors that came here to participate temporarily on one or two projects, they wish not to be involved on the bigger scope of the Wikibooks project or take an active participation in the community, I doubt that an unknown user to the community would  have been given the chance or would be willing to get himself involved in this sort of discussions/debates/proceedings, this only demonstrates that such actions do really deserve extra care and should not be executed in the way it was implemented in this case as I think I have demonstrated.

All the blocks had they even had a valid motive as stated by the accusation could and should be addressed first by discussion and only acted upon as stated on the block policy after a clear warning to comply or correct the users actions in accord to active policies (not guidelines, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines since guidelines are not enforcible]) failed, it is now demonstrated that not even this steps were taken.

And so, sadly, this is why we are here. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:23, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Hello and Thanks==
Hello MrJoe,

Thanks for your work on the Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book.  I am always pleased, gratified, and excited to see when someone comes along and makes a positive contribution to this work.  If you have any questions, drop me a note on [[User_Talk:Jomegat|my talk page]].  Also, if you don't mind, I'd like to add you to the list of authors in our [[Infobox/Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|Infobox]].  I would rather have a real name instead of a username, but if you'd rather remain anonymous, that's fine too.

Thanks again for your help!

[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 19:07, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Thanks Joe.  It's very ''very'' nice to know that people are using this. I do have fun writing, editing, and compiling answers, but it's even better knowing when it actually helps people.  I'll put you on the list!

Nice job!  Did I understand correctly that you were the one who authored and submitted the honor?  If so, congrats on having it accepted, and thanks for adding it to the Wikibook. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:01, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

== Model Hot Air Balloons ==

Hi MrJoe,

I'm thinking about getting rid of some of the Wikipedia links in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Model Hot Air Balloons|Model Hot Air Balloons]].  Instead, I would simply import the articles from Wikipedia and paste them right in.  Importing is something that has to be done by an admin (and I am one, so I can do that), and it preserves the edit history of the Wikipedia article.  In effect, it makes it look like our honor was edited by whomever contributed to the imported article.

The main reason I would want to remove the links is because they are completely suppressed in the print version (they used to get converted to URLs, but that had a very cluttered look).  There are a few wiki-to-pdf generators out there however, that DO still convert the links to urls.  

Also, I like to have all the info in an honor contained in the module without having to chase links to get the answers.
--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:15, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
: My thought was to add short summary type information to each of the answers, in addition to the links. If the links are there, then the more in depth information is readily available for those who want it. I only put the links in this afternoon, because I didn't have time to add actual text. However, I was looking up the info so I could teach the honor this evening and putting in the links was a quick way to make at least some of the info easily available.--[[User:MrJoe|MrJoe]] ([[User talk:MrJoe|talk]]) 04:55, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
:: I think that's a pretty good approach.  I'll start importing articles this evening.  We can trim out the cruft and move the links to a place where they won't become an eyesore in the print version.  Actually, maybe I should wait on the imports if you're going to be using this tonight.  History merges are messy and complicated procedures that involve replacing a page with the imported material, deleting it, undeleting everything again, and then restoring to the pre-import version.  That would not be good if I were doing that while you were referencing it! I hope it goes well for you tonight.  It really looks like a fascinating honor.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:29, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
::: Having printed out the various Wikipedia articles I added links for, and seeing how long they are. I think that it would probably be easier to just write up some basic answers than to import the articles and then delete the 90%+ of the text that is unneeded. We started the honor last night and we don't have a regular meeting next week so we won't be using the article in the immediate future. So if you want to import stuff go ahead, I will try to keep an eye on the honor  over the next several days and work on it if I get a chance, but I don't know how much time I'll have. I just moved and am in the middle of a seemingly endless series of DIY projects which eat almost all of my free time. --[[User:MrJoe|MrJoe]] ([[User talk:MrJoe|talk]]) 16:41, 16 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{A Beginner's Guide to D}}

==Introduction==
This is meant to be a very fast-paced tutorial to D for experienced programmers. Instead of spending a long time explaining D, this text will demonstrate various D features and let them speak for themselves. If you are debating whether D is the language for you, you have two general approaches:

*Read a bunch of languages comparisons, articles, and flamewars about D.
*See how it works.

If you'd like to take the former, [http://www.google.com Google] is your friend. You might also want to start off at [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/ Digital Mars's D Homepage].

If the latter is your cup of tea, you're in the right place. We'll start off small and progressively show more advanced features until we've covered all the major points of the language. Additionally, if you'd like more examples of any specific topic, [http://www.dsource.org/projects/tutorials/ the DSource Tutorials Project] is the right place for you.

==What We'll Cover==
For now, we will only cover core language features and the bare minimum library calls required to utilize them. One of the first things you should realize about D, as opposed to C++ and Java, is that it includes in the language many features relegated to libraries in its predecessors. So while a Java tutorial would be remiss in not mentioning java.util.ArrayList, in D we get by with int[]. (More on this later.)

==Style of This Guide==
Each section will have a code snippet and a description of how D differs from its predecessors. Usually, that will be sufficient; occasionally, there will also be an explanation of a feature which is vastly different (read: revolutionary versus evolutionary).

==The Guide==
===Hello World===

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;import std.stdio;

void main() {
        writeln(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

*As you can see, D is more Java-like in that it uses import statements instead of #include. In fact, D has no preprocessor at all. Don't worry; you'll see how to do almost all your preprocessor tricks with D itself.
*main can return void.
*std.stdio and writefln are part of the library, so we won't really discuss them here. Sufficed to say, writef follows the printf family of functions and writef'''ln''' adds the Java-like &quot;ln&quot; suffix to denote newline.

===Arrays (and more)===

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;

void main() {
        int[] ages; //1
        ages = [15, 23, 14, 29]; //2
        int sum; //3
        double average = void; //4

        writefln(&quot;%d %f&quot;, sum, average); //5
        writefln(&quot;We have %d ages&quot;, ages.length); //6

        for(int i = 0; i &lt; ages.length; ++i) //7
                sum += ages[i];
 	
        average = (cast(double)sum) / ages.length; //8

        writefln(&quot;Average age: %.2f&quot;, average);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

#We use int[], as opposed to int ages[] or int* ages or int *ages. Arrays are proper types in D, not just aliases for  pointers. Those familiar with scripting languages like Perl and Python should find this much more comfortable. For the rest of you, wait a few minutes and then you'll appreciate it.
#Constant array.
#Notice that I didn't set it to 0. Shouldn't I be worried about some arbitrary data? Nah, D sets all variables to a default value.
#Well, unless I specify otherwise by setting it to void.
#We use writefln to print formatted lines, much like printf in C. It prints 0 and then some arbitrary junk.
#What is this? Arrays have properties attached to them, like length. It can be very convenient, especially when dealing with dynamic arrays (later).
#The for loop is totally unchanged. But we really shouldn't use a for loop here. You'll learn about foreach later on.
#Casts are all explicitly specified with the cast keyword.

===Strings===

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;

void main() {
        string firstname, lastname, fullname; //1
        firstname = &quot;Walter&quot;; //2
        lastname = &quot;Bright&quot;;
        fullname = firstname ~ &quot; &quot; ~ lastname; //3
        writefln(&quot;Congratulations on making a great language &quot; ~ fullname); //4

        char[] a = firstname.dup;//5
        char[] b = a;
        a[0] = 'H'; //6
        writefln(b); //prints &quot;Halter&quot;
        firstname = &quot;Jacob&quot;;//7
        writefln(&quot;Your name is still %s, right?&quot;, fullname); //8, prints Walter Bright
}
&lt;/source&gt;

#Strings are character arrays which cannot be modified on a per element basis. You'll see more about arrays later. Another major note is that D strings ''are not null terminated''. Arrays simply keep track of their length.
#firstname is assigned to &quot;Walter&quot;.
#~ is the concatenation operator. There is no ambiguity between + and ~ for strings.
#One way of outputting, although number 8 is better
#To modify a string, we get a duplicate (a copy) of the string. .dup returns a mutable copy of an array.
#Since b is really a pointer to a, b actually gets modified on this line. firstname remains unchanged.
#Although we cannot change string on an per element basis, we can re-assign them.
#Since fullname was created through concatenation, it also remains unchanged.

===Dynamic Arrays and Foreach===

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;

// this is a rather contrived example, please forgive me
void main() {
 	int[] squares; //1

 	for(int i = 0; i*i &lt; 273; ++i) { // just some random range
 		squares.length = i+1; //2
 		squares[i] = i*i;
 	}

 	foreach(inout square; squares) //3, 4
 		square %= 10; // again, something arbitrary

 	squares.sort; //5
 	writefln(&quot;Total of %d squares&quot;, squares.length);
 	foreach(index, square; squares) //6
 		writefln(&quot;%d: %d&quot;, index+1, square);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

#Defining a dynamic array is very intuitive; simply omit the length.
#Extending a dynamic array is simply done by resizing it.
#foreach is awesome. Here's the simple case: the part before the semicolon is the variable from the array, and the one afterwards is the array. And yes, foreach can work with much more than just arrays.
#inout simply means pass by reference. Without this, the original array would be unaffected.
#Built-in sort. If I'm not mistaken, both implementations use a quicksort, which- as its name implies- is pretty good.
#And now another form of foreach. The left-side of the semicolon can specify two variables, separated by a comma. In this case, the first is the index (think of &quot;i&quot; in your typical for loop) and the second is the value.

If you feel like there's something missing in the above code, you're right: I didn't put the data type on the variables in the foreach loop. D actually supplies an &quot;auto&quot; keyword which means &quot;automatically figure out what type I want,&quot; and it is implicitly understood in the foreach loop if a type is missing.

I know I lumped many important things together in this example. The rest of the guide should elucidate all these topics to a greater extent, but you can always read up the official language specs or look at the dsource tutorials if you like.

===Associative Arrays===

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;

void main(char[][] args) { //1
	int[char] charCount; //2
	foreach(arg; args[1..$]) //3
		foreach(c; arg)
			++charCount[c]; //4
	foreach(c; charCount.keys.sort) //5
		writeln(charCount[c], &quot; copies of character '&quot;, c, &quot;'&quot;); //6
}
&lt;/source&gt;

#In order to pass in arguments, we simple have main receive an array of strings. Unlike C/C++, we needn't worry about &quot;int argc&quot; since arrays know their own length.
#To define an associative array, you simple put a value type inside the square brackets; otherwise it's like a normal array. You can put any type in there (classes, arrays, etc.). However, if you use objects as keys, keep in mind that you'll have to do some fancy stuff with hash functions and opCmp (which is beyond the scope of this document, but described fully in [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/arrays.html#associative D Programming Language- Arrays].
#This &quot;1..$&quot; construct is a slice of an array; it means &quot;return an array which includes the element at index 1 all the way to the end ($)&quot;. There are other ways of doing this, such as &quot;1..length&quot;, but this one can be very nifty. If you're wondering why we would ignore the first element, it's because, like in C/C++, the first element is the name of the program.
#In order to access elements of an associative array, you simply give an index of the key type for it.
#All associative arrays have a property called &quot;keys&quot; (along with others like values and length) which returns an array of all the keys. Like any other array, you can then call the property sort on that.
#This is just an alternative way to print lines, each argument is simply converted and printed sequentially.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Roulette history is hard to come by because the origin of roulette is lost, and there was likely some form of a wheel based game going back almost as far as the origin of the wheel itself. There are stories that the game was invented in China and brought to Europe by traders who were trading with the Chinese. 

&quot;Several early versions of a wheel and spinning ball were invented in the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe. The first games that we would recognize as modern roulette were introduced in Paris casinos around the end of the 18th century. This game contained all of the features that we have today with the one exception, the single zero was colored red while the double zero was colored black. This led to some confusion for players and the color green was introduced for the zero and double zero to alleviate the confusion. 

&quot;In the mid 19th century the single zero game was invented in France, this reduced the casino's edge thereby increasing the odds of the player. When gambling was outlawed in Germany the inventor of the single zero machine (Louis Blanc) accepted an invitation to go to Monaco to establish and operate a casino. The casino set the standards for roulette in Europe, and roulette remained exclusive to Monte Carlo until 1933. This led to the gambling and resort industry in Monaco as many of Europe's rich were attracted to the luxurious Monte Carlo casino. 

&quot;The use of the double zero roulette wheels survived in the United States and is sometimes called the American Wheel. The introduction of the single zero wheel (with better odds for the player) resulted in the demise of the double zero wheels in Europe and has become known as the French Wheel in roulette history. 

&quot;In Europe (also Atlantic City in the U.S.) the Casino's offered another refinement to the game that increased the odds yet again for the player, the option of 'En Prison' was offered. With the en prison option if the player has bet an even money bet (Even-Odd, Red-Black, 1-18 or 19-36) and zero or double zero is the next outcome the player has two options: 

*1. The player can 'imprison' the bet. This means the bet stays where it is and the next spin determines if the bet is lost or returned to the player.
*2. The player may surrender half of the bet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roulette-gambling.com/roulette_history.html|title=Roulette history at roulette-gambling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.).  Interactive design requires that you re-assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear ways.  Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.

Things are developing so rapid that it is necessary to have a positive attitude and involve yourself with the tools and techniques that will be used while learning interactive design. There are, however, vital interactive concepts important to know about. You'll learn about the tools necessary to make interactive projects come to life.

The creation of interactive projects requires competency in many tools, so it's necessary for students to learn from each other.  You can prove your knowledge through quizzes, exams and hands-on tests.

Research and on-line content created in this wiki can be used to learn advanced interactive media in a variety of settings, including classrooms, on-the-job training and in one's own spare time.  Interactive learners should be required to use on-line social interaction tools such as wiki technology &amp; blogs.  

;During your study of interactive media, you can expect to:
# Use more software tools than normally required for broadcast-type media.
# Be amazed and sometimes overwhelmed by what you can do with interactive media.
# Learn in a way you’ve never experienced before:
# Work with a team to create complex products; 

;During a study of interactive media, you can not expect to:
# Work at a relaxed, normal pace.
# Learn the way you have in past situations.
# Master all of the software products you use.
# Create an entire project alone.

===== concat =====

''Array.concat( &lt;array1&gt;, &lt;array2&gt; );''

The method “concat” combines arrays with each other. For example this code combines two arrays.

 1.   var array1 = new Array(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;);
 2.   var array2 = new Array(&quot;d&quot;, 5, &quot;f&quot;);
 3.   var array3 = new Array;
 4.   
 5.   array3 = array1.concat(array2);
 6.   trace(array3);

The result will be:

 a,b,c,d,5,f

===== join =====

''Array.join( &lt;separator&gt; );''

The method join is used to tell the program to return the array values separating them with current separator. For example this code declares an array variable “array1” with 3

 1.   var array1 = new Array(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;);
 2.   
 3.   trace(array1.join(&quot; ; &quot;));
 4.   trace(array1.join(&quot; + &quot;));
 5.   trace(array1.join(&quot; zz &quot;));
 6.   trace(array1.join());

elements: “a”, “b”, “c” and then trace the array values by using the current separator. In line 3 we use “ ; ” separator. This means that the return value will be “a ; b ; c”. In line 4 we use “ + “ separator. So the return value will be “a + b + c”. In line 5 we use “ zz “ separator. Return value will be “a zz b zz c”. If you don’t use any separator, then the default separator (“,”) is used. So the traced value in line 6 will be “a,b,c”.

===== pop =====

''Array.pop( );''

This method removes the last element from the array and then returns the name of the element. This example will show how “pop” method works.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
 2.   var popped;
 3.   
 4.   popped = myarray.pop();
 5.   trace(popped);
 6.   trace(myarray);

Line 1 declares “myarray” array with 4 elements: 1, 2, 3, 4. Line 2 declares “popped” variable without assigning any data type. In line 4 we pop “myarray” and write the last element, which is popped to the “popped” variable. In line 5 we trace variable “popped” to see the name of the element which was popped, and in line 6 we trace “myarray”. The Output window must trace the following:

 4
 1,2,3

===== push =====

''Array.push( &lt;element1&gt;, &lt;element2&gt; );''

This method adds one or more elements to the end of the array and then returns the length of the new array.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(1, 2);
 2.   var newlength;
 3.   
 4.   newlength = myarray.push(3, 4);&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
 5.   trace(newlength);
 6.   trace(myarray);
 

The first line declare “myarray” array with two elements: 1, 2. The second line declares “newlength” variable in which we will keep the new length of the array. In line 4 we add two elements 3 and 4 to the end of “myarray” using “push” method and then write the new length of the array in “newlength”. The following must be traced in Output window:

 4
 1,2,3,4

===== reverse =====

''Array.reverse( );''

“reverse” method reverses the array.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 2.   
 3.   trace(myarray);
 4.   myarray.reverse();
 5.   trace(myarray);

The first line creates an array with 5 elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Line 3 traces “myarray”, then line 4 reverses the array and line 5 again traces our array. The output must be:

 1,2,3,4,5
 5,4,3,2,1

===== shift =====

''Array.shift( &lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt; );''

This method is similar to method “pop” but removes not the last, but the first element and then returns the value of it.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
 2.   var shifted;
 3.   
 4.   shifted = myarray.shift();
 5.   trace(shifted);
 6.   trace(myarray);

Line 1 declares “myarray” array with 4 elements: 1, 2, 3, 4. Line 2 declares “shifted” variable without assigning any data type. In line 4 we shift “myarray” and write the value of the first element in “shifted” variable. In line 5 we trace variable “shifted” to see the name of the element which was shifted, and in line 6 we trace “myarray”. The output must be:

 1
 2,3,4

===== slice =====

''Array.slice( &lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt; );''

The method “slice” copies the elements of one array and then returns them as an array. To use this method you must give it the start and the last indexes of the elements.

 1.   var array1 = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 2.   var array2 = new Array();
 3.   
 4.   array2 = array1.slice(1, 4);
 5.   trace(array2);

For example the following example copies the second, third and forth elements and returns them to “array2”. The second parameter ( “end” ) which you give to “slice” method is not sliced. In the previous example we set the first parameter to 1 and the second to 4. If you test the movie the output will be “2,3,4”. As the first element of the array is 0, so the value of array1[1] is 2. The value of array1[4] is 5. But it is not sliced.

===== sort =====

''Array.sort( );''

The method “sort” sorts the array.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(&quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;e&quot;);
 2.   
 3.   trace(myarray);
 4.   myarray.sort();
 5.   trace(myarray);

The following example creates an array, trace it then sort it and trace the sorted array. The output must be

 c,a,d,b,e
 a,b,c,d,e

===== sortOn =====

''Array.sortOn( &lt;fieldname&gt; );''

The method “sortOn” is similar to sort, because it sorts too. But to understand what the difference is lets test the following example:

 1.   var users = new Array( { name: &quot;U2&quot;, phone: &quot;P3&quot;, address: &quot;A2&quot;},
 2.                          { name: &quot;U3&quot;, phone: &quot;P2&quot;, address: &quot;A1&quot;},
 3.                          { name: &quot;U1&quot;, phone: &quot;P1&quot;, address: &quot;A3&quot;} );
 4.   trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[0][&quot;name&quot;]);
 5.   trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[0][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 6.   trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[0][&quot;address&quot;]);
 7.   trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[1][&quot;name&quot;]);
 8.   trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[1][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 9.   trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[1][&quot;address&quot;]);
 10.  trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[2][&quot;name&quot;]);
 11.  trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[2][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 12.  trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[2][&quot;address&quot;]);
 13.  
 14.  users.sortOn(“name”);
 15.  
 16.  trace(“------------------------------------“);
 17.  trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[0][&quot;name&quot;]);
 18.  trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[0][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 19.  trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[0][&quot;address&quot;]);
 20.  trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[1][&quot;name&quot;]);
 21.  trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[1][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 22.  trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[1][&quot;address&quot;]);
 23.  trace(&quot;Name: &quot; + users[2][&quot;name&quot;]);
 24.  trace(&quot;Phone: &quot; + users[2][&quot;phone&quot;]);
 25.  trace(&quot;Address: &quot; + users[2][&quot;address&quot;]);

You will notice that the array is ordered by “name” field, not “phone” or “address”.

===== splice =====

''Array.splice( &lt;start&gt;, &lt;delete count&gt;, &lt;value0&gt;, &lt;value1&gt;, &lt;…&gt; );''

This is almost the most powerful method of array. It does two functions: it can delete the elements of the array specified by you or it can add elements from the location also specified by you. The example below demonstrates “splice” method.

 1.   var myarray = new Array( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;);
 2.   
 3.   trace(&quot;--------MYARRAY--------&quot;);
 4.   trace(myarray);
 5.   trace(&quot;--------Adding 'c' and 'd' from location 2--------&quot;);
 6.   myarray.splice(2,0,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;);
 7.   trace(myarray);
 8.   trace(&quot;--------Removing two elements from location 3 --------&quot;);
 9.   myarray.splice(3,2);
 10.  trace(myarray);
 11.  trace(&quot;--------Removing all elements from location 1--------&quot;);
 12.  myarray.splice(1);
 13.  trace(myarray);

Line 1 creates an array with 4 elements: “a”, “b”, “c”, “d”. In lines 3, 5, 8 and 11 we trace information about process. In line 4 we trace our array. In line 6 we add two elements from third element. This is the use of splice if you want to add elements: 

 Array.splice( &lt;start&gt;, 0, &lt;value0&gt;, &lt;value1&gt;, &lt;value2&gt; );

As we don’t want to delete anything this is why the second parameter is set to 0. In line 9 we delete two elements from the forth element. This is the use of splice if you want to delete elements from specified locations:

 Array.splice( &lt;start&gt;, &lt;delete count&gt;);

In line 12 we delete all elements beginning from the second element. This is the use of deleting all elements after specified location:

 Array.splice( &lt;start&gt; );

The output of our example must be:

 --------MYARRAY--------
 a,b,e,f
 --------Adding 'c' and 'd' from location 2--------
 a,b,c,d,e,f
 --------Removing two elements from location 3--------
 a,b,c,f
 --------Removing all elements from location 1--------
 a

===== toString =====

''Array.toString( );''

The method “toString” converts the array to a string.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 2.   
 3.   trace(myarray.toString());

The output is:

 1,2,3,4,5

===== unshift =====

''Array.unshift( &lt;value0&gt;, &lt;value1&gt;, &lt;…&gt;  );''

The method “unshift” is similar to method “push”. The only difference is that “push” adds new elements to the end of the array when “unshift” adds the elements to the beginning of the array.

 1.   var myarray = new Array(3, 4);
 2.   var newlength;
 3.   
 4.   newlength = myarray.unshift(1, 2);
 5.   trace(newlength);
 6.   trace(myarray);

The output is:

 4
 1,2,3,4

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Data types ==

=== String.split (method) ===

''String.split( &lt;separator&gt;, [limit] );''

This function splits the specified String into substrings by breaking it wherever the specified &lt;separator&gt; parameter occurs, and returns the substrings in an array. For example you have a string of values separated with commas. By using this method you can separate this values and import them into an array. This example illustrates how to do that:

 1.   var tmpString = new String(&quot;Mario,Henry,George,Amy,Kate&quot;);
 2.   var tmpValues = new Array();
 3.   tmpValues = tmpString.split(&quot;,&quot;);
 4.   trace(tmpValues[0]);
 5.   trace(tmpValues[1]);
 6.   trace(tmpValues[2]);
 7.   trace(tmpValues[3]);
 8.   trace(tmpValues[4]);

By specifying [limit] parameter you can limit the number of values. For example if we set the parameter [limit] in the previous example to 2 then the length of the array will be 2 and only first two values: “Mario” and “Henry” will be traced.

=== Objects ===

Nearly everything in Macromedia Flash is an object. For example all data types are objects. Now lets see what we can do with objects. First of all by declaring an object variable we can then assign to it any other data type. Example:

 1.   var obj = new Object();
 2.   var num1 = new Number(20);
 3.   var num2 = new Number(30);
 4.   var str1 = new String(&quot;50&quot;);
 5.   var str2 = new String(&quot;70&quot;);
 6.   trace(&quot;str1 + str2 = &quot; + (str1 + str2));
 7.   trace(&quot;num1 + num2 = &quot; + (num1 + num2));
 8.   obj = num1; //Now obj is number
 9.   obj += num2;
 10.  trace(&quot;obj = &quot; + obj);
 11.  obj = str1; //Now obj is string
 12.  obj += str2;
 13.  trace(&quot;obj = &quot; + obj);

In line 1 we declare an object variable named “obj”. In lines 2-3 we declare a number variables “num1” and “num2” and correspondingly assign them values 20 and 30.
 
   
 //output  
 // strTemp = [&quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, &quot;test&quot;]  
   
 private function stringToArray($string:String):Array  
 {  
     var a = $string.split(&quot; &quot;);  
     var temp = [];  
     for (var x = 0; x &lt; a.length; x++) {  
         temp.push(a[x]);  
     }  
     return temp;  
 }

== Scopes of variables ==

In this chapter you learned how to declare, initialize and use variables, but we didn’t talk about the variables limitations. There are three groups of variables: global variables, timeline variables and local variables. The global variables are accessible everywhere in the movie, the timeline variables are accessible from any timeline, and the local variables can be only accessed from the functions they are declared in (functions are like events, you will learn about them later). Now lets understand each of this groups in more details.

== Global variables ==

First of all lets understand what means the phrase “the global variables are accessible everywhere in the movie”. As you know the flash document contain scenes and may contain other objects like movie clips, buttons, pictures, etc. By declaring a global variable it can be used everywhere listed above or in short everywhere in the movie (flash document). For the demonstration lets do the following: create a new “movie clip” (for doing it just draw something in the scene, select it and press “F8”. When “Convert to Symbol” dialog appear type the name of the “movie clip”, select “Movie Clip” as behavior and press “OK”) and make sure it is added to the scene (if it isn’t press F11 to see the “library” window and drag your “movie clip” to the scene. Then open the actions of the first frame of the scene and write the following code:

 var MyVar = new String(&quot;Hello!!!&quot;);

Now double click the “movie clip” you have created for navigating to it and open its first frame’s actions and write the following:

 trace(MyVar);

Now play the movie. The output will be:

[[Image:Mfas_image018.jpg]]

This example demonstrated that the variable which was declared in the timeline cannot be accessed from other objects like “movie clip”. To avoid this we can declare our variable as global. Declaring global variables are like declaring a usual variables except two things: 1) do no write “var” at the beginning of the declaration and 2) append “_global” text at the beginning of the variable’s name. Example:

 _global.MyVar = new String(&quot;Hello!!!&quot;);

Now if you test the following example once more, but this time declare “MyVar” variable as global it will work great.

== Timeline variables ==

This group of variables are accessible everywhere in the timeline. This means that if you declare a variable in frame 1, it can be accessed from all other frames and scenes, in short from everywhere in the timeline. Declaring timeline variables are like declaring a usual variables except writing the keyword “var” at the beginning of the declaration. Example:

 MyVar = new String(&quot;Hello!!!&quot;);

== Local variables ==

This group of variables are only accessible from the functions (or block of code) they are declared in. You already know declaring a local variables. Example: 

 var MyVar = new String(&quot;Hello!!!&quot;);

For understanding what “block of code” is lets do the following: create a new flash document, open the first frame’s actions and write the following:

 var MyVar = new String(&quot;Hello!!!&quot;);

Then create a button (for doing it just draw your button, select it, press F8, and when “Convert to Symbol” dialog appear enter the button’s name, select “Button” as a behavior and press “OK”), open its actions and write the following:

 on (release) {
    trace(MyVar);
 }

Now test the movie (tip: just press “Ctrl+Enter” for doing that). If you now press the button the output will be: “Hello!!!”. What has happened? Isn’t “MyVar” a local variable? The answer is yes, it is local variable. The cause that it is accessible from the button is that it is declared in the frame. By writing anything in frame’s actions it is made a part of “_root” object and as all frames are part of “_root” object they “see” each other. This means that if you declare a local variable in any frame, then it is made a local variable of “_root” object, so it can be accessed from any frame and especially button, located on that frame (all object located on timeline are members of “_root” object). So all this means that a local variable, declare in timeline, is the same as a timeline variable.

All roulette tables deal with only four elements:
*1. [[../Wheel|The roulette wheel.]]
*2. [[../Table|The roulette table (aka layout).]]
*3. The ball.  These days the ball is most likely high impact plastic, but originally it was made of ivory.  Modern casinos maintain the integrity of their roulette balls with regular magnetic and x-ray exams.
*4. The chips.  Some casinos allow the player to use generic casino chips at the roulette tables, but most require the player to buy in at the table.  The croupier has stacks of various colored chips.  Usually each player gets a different color to help avoid confusion of bets, and the player can designate the value of the chip.  This is particularly interesting because if one does not specify the chips are usually valued at either $1 or the table minimum, however if they player wished for the chips to be worth $0.25, s/he may do so as long as the ‘’’total’’’ wager meets the table minimums for their respective sectors.  So even if the table minimum is $1, one could place four $0.25 bets and still be a legal.


All roulette tables operated by a casino have the same basic mechanics:
*There is a balanced mechanical wheel with colored pockets separated by identical vanes and the wheel which spins freely on a supporting post.
*The wheel is held within a wooden frame which contains a track around the upper outer edge and blocks of a variety of designs placed approximately halfway down the face of the frame.
*A plastic or ivory ball is spun in the track in the frame that holds the wheel.  As the ball looses momentum the centrifugal force is no longer sufficient to hold the ball in the groove and it falls down the face of the frame.  As the ball hits a block it’s trajectory is randomly altered on all 3 planes (X, Y, and Z) causing the ball to bounce and skip.
*The ball falls onto the spinning wheel and eventually lands into one of the pockets.
*The number of the pocket the ball falls into determines how the bets placed on the layout table are treated.


After this the specifics of individual tables can vary greatly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the purposes of this book, an “enterprise” is a group of people organized for some long-term purpose.  A business is an enterprise.  So is a non-profit charity.  An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) package is a computer software package that integrates all departments and functions within an enterprise into a single, integrated system that maintains a single, integrated set of data. Any transaction entered in one area causes an immediate update in related areas.  An ERP enables departments to share information and communicate with each other much better and more quickly using one consistent set of numbers available to all users.

This book is written for people who want to understand the internal operations of ERP packages.  It describes a generic ERP rather than any actual package.  It is written in simple, everyday language and assumes only a little business knowledge.  Consult the accompanying [[/Glossary | Glossary]] for a definition of any terms you are unfamiliar with.  Although it is written for programmers and analysts, our goal is that you do not need to be a programmer, analyst, or even a business person to understand it.

'''ERP Internals is a work in progress.''' It is incomplete and should only be used as part of your own research. We encourage you to contribute to make it better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conditions/Loops (part 1) ==

Conditions and loops are one of the most important things not only in ActionScript but also in all programming languages, because they are used everywhere. For understanding these conditions lets discuss each of them one by one.

=== If, else if, else ===

“if” is used to compare two or more expressions. For example you have an “Input Text” and a button. You want to check if the value of “Input Text” equals “hello”. To do that you must use “if”. The use of “if” is the following:

 if ( &lt;condition&gt; ) {
    //here goes your code
 }

The code in “if” will be executed when the condition which you write is true. But for example you wrote a condition which was false, and you want to know about it. In this case you can use “else”.

 if ( &lt;condition&gt; ) {
    //here goes your code
 } else {
    //here goes your code
 }

But before using any condition you must know comparison and logical operators.
|}

== Operators (part 2) ==

'''Comparison operators'''

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Operator||Description
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;!=&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||
This operator returns true if two expressions are the same, and false if they aren’t. If their data types are different, then they are converted. For example “5” != 5 returns false thou “5” is a string and 5 is a number.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;!==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||	This operator is the same as “!=” the only difference is that data types are not converted.
|-
|
&lt;
||Compares two expressions and determines whether expression1 is less than expression2. If so, the operator returns true
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||Compares two expressions and determines whether expression1 is less than or equal to expression2 ; if it is, the operator returns true
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;	
||This operator checks whether expression1 equals expression2, returns true if so and if data types are not the same, then they are converted.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||This operator is the same as “==” but in “===” data types are not converted.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||Compares two expressions and determines whether expression1 is greater than expression2 and returns true if so.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||Compares two expressions and determines whether expression1 is greater than or equal to expression2 and if so it returns true.
|}

'''Logical operators'''

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Operator||Description
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||Inverts the Boolean value of a variable or expression.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||The operator “&amp;&amp;” means “and”. For example you can join two conditions with it.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||The operator “&lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;” means “or”. It can be used for joining two conditions.
|}

'''Miscellaneous operators'''

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Operator||Description
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;--&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||This operator subtracts 1 from the expression. For example you have “a” variable and want to decrease its’ value by one. Instead of writing “a-=1” or “a=a-1” you can write “a--“.
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;?:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||This operator is the same as “if” condition. The following example will demonstrate how it works:

&lt;code&gt;
 var x = new Number(5);
 var y = new Number(10);
 var z = new Number();
 
 z = (x &lt; y) ? x: y;
 
 The last line means that if “x&lt;y” then “z=x” else “z=y”. You can write the same using “if”.
 
 if (x &lt; y) {
 	z = x;
 } else {
 	z = y;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|
&lt;nowiki&gt;++&lt;/nowiki&gt;
||This operator adds 1 to the expression. For example you have “a” variable and want to increase its’ value by one. Instead of writing “a+=1” or “a=a+1” you can write “a++“.
|-
|
instanceof
||Discussed later
|-
|
typeof
||The “typeof” operator evaluates expression; the result is a string specifying whether the expression is a string, movie clip, object, or function. For example you have a button named “mybutton”. If you write this code:

 trace(typeof(mybutton));

then the traced value will be “button”. If the object is Movie Clip then the return value is “movieclip”, if it is a string the return value is “string”.
|-
|
void
||Discussed later
|}

Now when you know these operators we can continue learning conditions and writing new programs.

== Conditions/Loops (part 2) ==

Lets write a program which will check if the values of two Input Texts are the same. First of all create two Input Text and set first ones var to “input1” and the second ones to “input2”. Then add a button and set its name to “button”. Add the following lines to the actions of “button1”:

 1.   on (release) {
 2.      if (input1 == input2) {
 3.         trace(“YES”);
 4.      } else {
 5.         trace(“NO”);
 6.      }
 7.   }

In line 2 we check if input1 equals input2 using “if” and operator “==” (Note: don’t confuse “=” with “==” because they are different operators. “=” assigns value to the variable, but “==” only checks two expressions. For example if you have “if” and you want to check if any variable “a” equals “hello” then you must write “ a==”hello” ” in the condition. If you write “ a=”hello” “ then a will become “hello”.) and if so then we trace “YES” else we trace “NO”.
But now imagine another situation. You have an Input Text and a button and when the user type his/her name in the Input Text and clicks the button you want to trace different values. To solve this you must add the following code to the button:

 1.   on (release) {
 2.      if (input1 == “Jane”) {
 3.         trace(“Hello Jane!!!”);
 4.      } else if (input1 == “Ben”) {
 5.         trace(“Hello Ben!!!”);
 6.      } else if (input1 == “John”) {
 7.         trace(“Hello John!!!”);
 8.      } else {
 9.         trace(“Hello unknown!!!”);
 10.     }
 11.  }

If you want you can write a simple program just for you. You can create two Input Texts one button, a Dynamic Text (that will show the status) and write a code to determine if the user who want enter your program is member or not. This little program will be your security, keeping other people away. Below is shown a little fragment of the button’s actions:

 1.   on (release) {
 2.      if (UserName == “user1” &amp;&amp; Password == “password1”) {
 3.         //here goes your code
 4.      } else if (UserName == “user2” &amp;&amp; Password == “password2”) {
 5.         //here goes your code
 6.      } else {
 7.         Status = “Invalid Details!”;
 8.      }
 9.   }

UserName is the “var” property of the first Input Text
Password is the “var” property of the second Input Text
Status is the “var” property of the Dynamic Text

=== For ===

“For” is used to repeat the code for several times. Below is shown the use of “For”:

 for ( &lt;init&gt;; &lt;condition&gt;; &lt;next&gt; ) {
    //here goes your code
 }

Now I will bring you example where you need to use “For”. For example you want to add all numbers from 1 to 10 (1+2+3+4+…+10). For doing it you have to write the following code:

 1.   var i = new Number();
 2.   i += 1;
 3.   i += 2;
 4.   i += 3;
 5.   i += 4;
 6.   i += 5;
 7.   i += 6;
 8.   i += 7;
 9.   i += 8;
 10.  i += 9;
 11.  i += 10;

(or if you are too smart)

 1.   var i = new Number();
 2.   i = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10;

But, anyway, it’s boring to write such a code. Instead you can use “For” and repeat the code for 10 times:

 1.   var i = new Number();
 2.   for ( e = 1; e &lt;= 10; e++) {
 3.      i += e;
 4.   }

In the first line we declare “i” number variable. In line 2 we begin our “For”. “e = 1” is the &lt;init&gt; part. In the init part you assign value to the variable. In our case we assign “1” to variable “e”. Now you must ask why I use the word “variable” with “e”. Because when you init the value Flash automatically makes “e” a number variable. If you declare “e” as a number variable in the beginning of the code there will be no problem. You can write the following example like this:

 1.   var i = new Number();
 2.   var e = new Number();
 3.   for ( e = 1; e &lt;= 10; e++) {
 4.      i += e;
 5.   }

The second part of “For” &lt;condition&gt; tells Flash how much to repeat the action. In our case we wrote to repeat the action while e is less than or equal to 10. So when “e” becomes 11 it will stop repeating the action. In the third part of “For” is &lt;next&gt; you must tell Flash how to change the value of the variable each time it repeats the action. In our case we wrote “e++”. This means that each time Flash repeats the action it will increment e by one. In the actions of “For” (line 4) we wrote “i += e;”. This means that we will add “e” to “i” each time the action repeats. So this small code will give the sum of numbers from 1 to 10. You can trace the value of “i” at the end of the code to see its value. It must be “55”.

 1.   var i = new Number();
 2.   var e = new Number();
 3.   for ( e = 1; e &lt;= 10; e+=2) {
 4.      i += e;
 5.   }

This example does the same as the previous one, but this time we increment the value of “e” by 2, not by one, as in the previous example. So our example will count the sum of the following numbers: “1, 3, 5, 7, 9”.

=== For .. In ===

“For .. In” is used to loop through the properties or objects of the object you specify. The following is the structure of the statement:

 for ( &lt;variableIterant&gt; in &lt;object&gt; ) {
    //here goes your code
 }

Now lets understand what, where and how can this statement be used. For example, if you want to get the list of objects in “_root” object you must write the following:

 1.   var e = new String(“Hello!!!”);
 2.   for (obj in _root) {
 3.      trace(obj);
 4.   }

If you write this code in the actions of the frame and run it, the output value will be:

[[Image:Mfas_image020.jpg]]

The first line of the code declares a new string variable named “e”. Then the program loops though each element in “_root” object and traces its name. You already know that each local variable declared in timeline is an element of “_root” object like “e”, but what is “$version”? “$version” is a built-in string variable which keeps the name and the version of the operating system the movie is run at.

== Arbitration ==

I like the general text of this policy, but I am not sure that I like the idea of having anything about arbitration included here. If we talk about arbitration in this page, and it becomes an official policy (or guideline), then we have essentially created the need for an official arbitration process by accident (or &quot;side effect&quot;, if it is not totally unintentional). I think that we as a community need to seriously consider whether we want to have arbitration at all, and if we do have it, we should start to lay down some guidelines about how it should be done. If we say here that arbitration is the final step in the dispute process, that implies that we have an arbitration system available to handle such disuptes, and at the moment we do not have such a system.

The current arbitration process created by [[User:Robert Horning]] is an interesting one, but many users have expressed problems with the particular methodology, the terminology, etc. That we have this process occuring already doesn't mean that the community wants arbitration, or that we want it in this particular way. My point is, we really need to answer alot of questions on this topic before we start writing references to it into our policy documents. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

:My take on the matter was that we would in fact have an arbitration process now, even if it is totally different from the current one going on. We would define the procedural rules on this page. This process is the last of four steps, and quite a bit of work must go into the previous three before arbitration is needed. Those who try to jump steps will be denied. To discuss the need for arbitration, I suggest we discuss that at the arbitration page. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

::There is a need for a clear procedure, at least in terms of who should be involved.  

::Do you feel that editorial and behaviour disputes should be handled in a different fashion?  

::- If someone continually reverts text or violates [[Wikibooks:no personal attacks|no personal attacks]] then there is a behavioural dispute - disciplinary procedure should be used.  

::- If two editors vehemently disagree about content the solution might be to offer some sort of ad hoc editorial board to resolve the issue or, if this is refused, enforce a discussion period mediated by an admin and, if this doesnt work, include both views in the book. Both views would only be included in a final, published edition of the book if permitted by the editorial board that reviews that edition.

::-If two editors vehemently disagree about presentation an ad hoc editorial board should give binding arbitration (you cant really have 2 presentations). [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:::My only point with my above comment was that wikibooks never has had an arbitration &quot;step&quot; in the dispute resolution process (to be fair, it hasn't had a &quot;dispute resolution process&quot; for very long either). Adding such a thing is more important then asking ''how'' to do it, but we need to as ourselves ''if'' we need to have it. I'm not going to advocate either option (at least not here), i just want people to consider that it's new territory for us. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:04, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

== Move to enforce ==

This policy, or some kind of rules concerning the handling of disputes is a necessary feature at wikibooks. Given some of the recent events, I think it is all the more pertinent for us to try and put something on the books that can help to govern such disputes. I am recommending that this proposal, in whole or in part, be moved to {{tl|policy}} as soon as can reasonably happen.

One caveat, of course, is that the final section of this policy refers to both the [[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee]] and the [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]], neither of which are {{tl|policy}} yet. If we can confirm the first 3 steps of the proposal now, we can confirm the fourth section later, if we want. As an alternative, we could enforce the entire document now, with a note perhaps that the specific workings of the editorial board and the arbitration committee are not set in stone yet. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

:I disagree that this should be made an enforced policy. I don't like the idea of an arbitration committee. Reading other comments on this page, I like the idea of differentiating between editorial problems and behavioral problems.
:I think editorial problems should almost always being handled using the decision making process by those working on the book or wishing to be involved in the book. Much in the same spirit that deleting a single page of a book is encouraged to be discussed by those involved in the book rather then voted on in VfD and if agreed to speedily deleted instead. Meditation should only come into play if requested for this type of issue.
:I think behavioral problems should be addressed by the Wikibooks community, discussed and voted on in a similar format as VfD is done and with similar rules. Quality over quanity, no sockpuppets, etc. The decision should be to either uphold a previous decision or provide an alternative solution and should be binding. If the decision is to uphold a previous decision, the person who made the original decision should not be punished and should be free make similar decisions in the future on similar cases.
:In both cases I think perhaps that once a decision has been made that unless either new quality reasons or quality information is presented or there is a clear presents of the community that no longer agrees with the decision, the issue should not be allowed to be reopened. Similar to how books that have been previous voted on for deletion should not be brought up again for deletion if the decision was to keep, unless new reasons are provided. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

:::See also [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes/Experimental branch‎|a less formalized version of this policy]]... needs cleanup but it's more reasonable I think, since it allows for quick and simple resolutions rather than the drama of formal arbitration.

::2 months ago I would have agreed with you, and said that this proposal was completely unnecessary and that we didnt need any kind of formalized arbitration method. My opinions on this matter have been changed by recent events, and I strongly believe that the community needs ''something'' definative in dealing with behavioral problems. How do we handle cases where discussion and progress have broken down completely? We need to have an arbitration committee, and i will cite the following reasons:
::#We need a last resort for disputes that are out of hand and cannot be solved in the usual methods.
::#We need a standard so that nobody tries to throw together a home-brewed arbitration in the future. 
::#We need something formal and final so that people don't take appeals to meta or the stewards or the WMF when arguments here get out of hand. 
::#Not all disputes are book-content related. There are behavioral problems, there are policy violations, and there are abuses. A policy that only talks about content disputes is short-sighted and incomplete.
::The recent events have heavily shaped my thinking on this matter, and I'm not really receptive at this point to something that's &quot;less formal&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:27, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

::: I consider behavioral problems, policy violations and abuses to be one sort of dispute and content dispute to be another. Content disputes should be encouraged to be resolved through discussion and consensus as is already done, so no change there. I have no issue with having a standard method for resolving the other form of disputes. I'm not saying this policy is unnecessary, I'm saying I don't agree that arbitration should be that standard method and I don't think we need to have a committee to handle it. I'm saying that part of the policy should be changed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

::::I really like the two separate areas of dispute resolution and think formal committees are the ideal solution.

RFC can surely be an intermediate step, but we need formal, ending solutions for disputes so that they don't linger forever. It would be great if someone could take the initiative and draw a map of the processes and where each page here lies, because it's becoming a bit of a blur (for one, is [[Wikibooks:Arbitration]] dead now in favor of [[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee]]?). -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

'''tab reset'''

To clarify I believe the problems with the arbitration process as has been generally acknowledged that was tried out and disagreed with by the community, is a very good reason to frown on encouraging further movement in that direction. I am not suggesting we have a blur or vage policy to decide what to do for a final decision rather I am suggesting an alternative to an arbitration committee and arbitration. My suggestion is that the community discusses and decides through consensus how best to handle the situation and that decision be made final and binding in this proposed policy and enforced through whatever actions may need to be taken by admins. For example that part of the policy should define the rules that are used by the community in carrying out such a discussion and what sort of decisions can be made and the fact the decision is final.

However I believe recent events have demonstrated that abuse, behavioral problems and policy violations aren't as obvious as seems to be suggested. I believe before we should even attempt to have any form of process like this, we as a community need to clarify better what is considered abuse, a behavioral problem and a policy violation, so we're not working in the dark, have a means for admins to judge the quality of any arguments rather then the quantity of the arguments and other issues. What exactly was abusive, a behavioral problem or a policy violation with regard to Panic should make for good starting place to clarify these issues. For example by clarifying [[WB:CIVIL]].

I hope this clarifies any misunderstandings about my objections. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Need to protect &quot;ordinary Wikibooks users&quot; ==

I could speak volumes about some abuses to the arbitration situation that happened with Panic, but I do want to address a basic principle here to this process.

Regardless of what is happening, we need to keep foremost the idea that ordinary Wikibooks users can be &quot;bullied&quot; by admins and bureaucrats.  Particularly because admin options like performing a user block and locking (protecting) pages from editing can be abused, even if it is unintentional or even a mistake on the part of the admin.

One of the things I was trying to also work up to in the situation with Panic was to get an arbitration &quot;board&quot; put together that would avoid putting the arbitrators into the mud fest.  As I tried to mention as for the justification for the process I created here (but didn't get completed in the manner that I had hoped), it seemed as though every admin that tried to get involved simply became covered in the issue and became a party to the dispute rather than a neutral observer who tried to get everybody to calm down.  I had hoped that I would be able to get ahold of a couple more admins that would be neutral on the issue to help join with me in a common resolution.

It is very critical in situations like this that we remember that the whole process is supposed to be one of telling everybody, including passionate admins and others, to back off and cool down.  Change directions and try to do something else positive instead of trying to pump up your egos to explosive sizes.

Under no cirsumstance should the opinions or attitudes of an admin be weighted more than those of any other user or editor.  Even &quot;Jimbo says&quot; should be taken with a grain of salt (or at least Jimbo has suggested as much in the past).  And there needs to be some sort of aveune for ordinary Wikibooks users to be able to fight against &quot;the establishment&quot; if they are feeling picked upon.

I also must say that the whole process of arbitration must be open, and a matter of &quot;public record&quot; or the equivalent.  One of the problems I saw with the whole Panic arbitration issue was that much of the disuccsion was happening on IRC, with the &quot;trial&quot; or &quot;arbitration&quot; happening in abstentia and a bunch of people deciding upon the ultimate outcome.  Or talk on various user pages.  This is not a reasonable way to carry on these discussion.  Perhaps an arbitration committee wants to discuss some of the issues &quot;in chamber&quot; or privately among themselves in e-mails.  Outside parties trying to capture the process and force a conclusion is merely going to derail the whole process.

I also need to be very blunt about arbitrations here and the arbitrators.  One of the things I am most disappointed about was the pressing need to get the situation resolved quickly.  OK, I admit that it needed to be resolved, but it already had taken some time.  This is something that had been going on for months.  Could waiting a week or two for some resolution be really a huge problem?  If there is a problem where a user is going amok and causing huge problems (such as spamming, moving pages, or cause other vandalism), there are already existing policies in place to deal with that.  When instead there are editorial disputes (and I still fail to see how the situation with Panic was anything more than that), it is more of trying to find what is going on and how to resolve this issue.

This also takes something that is nebulous called &quot;leadership&quot;.  This is not somebody who has been been given infinite abitrary &quot;power&quot; to do all kinds of god-like things, but rather somebody who has been able to persuade people to act in a responsible manner that will help the community.  That often these &quot;leaders&quot; are also given prominence of &quot;titles&quot; or &quot;authority&quot;, but that is a by-product to what they have accomplished.  Instead, this is the ability to come to a solution that is acceptable to nearly everybody.  That this isn't easy is demonstrated by the fact that few people are recognized as a community leader independent of titles.

Finally, one of the objections of the final &quot;solution&quot; to the situation with Panic was the very arbitrary user block that happened.  I don't think it was necessary at all, nor especially for six months.  Leaving the discussion aside in this particular case, I believe that you can find a resolution to situations like this that would avoid having to perform a user block, particularly for somebody who has been generally supportive of this project.  A user block is really to stop a vandal or somebody who is causing immediate harm to the project and won't stop.  Instead, by blocking a user you have created an enemy, which ultimately could prove far more disasterous.  Unnoticed by just about everybody critical to my actions with Panic, I was trying hard to keep Panic to make positive contributions to this project and to be able to use his help to further all of our common goals.

One other huge thing that was missing from all of this is that we are unpaid volunteers in a strictly unpaid volunteer organization.  The way that you work with volunteers in this situation is very different than you would in a typical corporate environment.  Most of all, you absolutely must treasure and value each person who makes any sort of positive contribution.  That discliplinary actions may have to take place from time to time, the overall goal should be one of reformation rather than removal.  In a corporate environment, you may have the luxury of being able to &quot;fire&quot; somebody who is &quot;difficult&quot; to work with.  In a volunteer environment like we have on Wikibooks, that is not a luxury we can enjoy.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:This page should not contain a discussion of Panic's arbitration. Surely we need to establish some dispute resolution process which we are doing right now, not creating a process on the fly and trying to use it well before it's ready and has gained community approval. I don't think admin abuse is a big issue here at all since we have a tight community and watch what each other are doing. I don't want recent events to be some excuse to go after admins that were trying to defend the true goals and spirit of the community here. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:55, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== New Suggested Arbitration Procedures ==
I think the proposed procedure is overly legalistic and I don't like it. It is too cumbersome and will take too long to work through. I suggest something more like the following: 

:#'''[Initiation Stage]''' An arbitration page will be created. This page will include the scope of the arbitration, involved parties, questions to be decided, agreements to arbitration and expected time frames for completion. Individual dispute pages will be created for each party. 
:#'''[Personal Statements Stage]''' All interested parties will state their position on their individual dispute pages. Their stance on the dispute, additional points of contention, accusations of wrongdoing, and supporting evidence should all be included. Direct responses to accusations from other parties should be saved for later. 
:#'''[Rebuttal and Remedies Phase]''' All parties are given a chance to respond to all accusations and offer a rebuttal on their individual pages. Specific potential remedies should also be suggested. During this phase, arbiters will also ask direct questions of parties on their dispute pages for the purpose of clarification.  
:#'''[Decision Phase]''' The arbitrators will offer their opinions on the questions to be decided and any additional accusations of wrongdoing. The arbitration committee will deliver a final verdict and action.

:Each party will have their own individual dispute page and only they and arbiters will make content edits on that page. The arbitration committee has the right to suspend proceedings or issue a final decision summarily at any time should they decide it necessary. All decisions by the committee will be considered final. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 15:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I disagree with an arbitration committee. My suggestion is more simplistic:
::#'''[Initiation Stage]''' A page thats defined by this policy is created for resolving disputes. A new section heading is created for a new dispute with a summary by the initiator(s) who have a problem that couldn't be resolved using decision making and mediation.
::#'''[Discussion/Suggested Solution Stage]''' Anyone who has something to say, for or against the problem can make comments perhaps marked with either '''Comment''' or '''Agree'''/'''Disagree'''. Suggestions for possible solutions marked with '''Suggestion''', with people who agree with the solution marked their response with '''Support''' and those people who disagree mark their response with '''Opposed'''. This phase being similar to how things are done with VfD.
::#'''[Decision Stage]''' Once a few days have passed without any further comments, the dispute is brought to a close and an admin using their best judgment and any rules defined in this policy, balanced with what the general community consensus is, carries out the final decision. This being similar to how a vote for deletion is brought to a close. Additionally if someone makes an initial dispute and nobody responds to it in a few days, I think it should be brought to a close as failed.
:: This would all happen on one page, the section name being similar to how sections for VfD are named perhaps. Such as named after the book or user the dispute is over. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I do not think such a process would have worked well in the case of Panic v SB Johnny, but I concede that it would have been a lot better than what finally ended up happening. There is a real danger here that a particular clique will stomp on an individual user regardless of the correctness of their position. That is why I feel that mob rule is unacceptable in a situation that has progressed to this stage. Remember, this is a process of last resort, after mediation (presumably involving an administrator) has already failed. 

:::I believe that the procedure needs to spell out steps in an orderly fashion, set a timeline and allow users to state their opinions outside of the context of a point-counterpoint argument, respecting the rights of all parties to be heard. The process also desperately needs to focus the discussion on those points that are actually cogent and significant within the context of the dispute. 

:::I do not think that turning such a situation into a popularity contest by opening the matter up to a 'vote' by the entire community is right or fair or in any way in the long-term best interests of wikibooks. This simply serves to drag users who have neither the time or inclination to fully research the situation into the fray. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: I don't think it matters how correct someone feels their position is if the community disagrees with them. The community makes the policies that decides what is and isn't allowed. Any arbitration simply won't hold if the community disagrees with its progress and its outcome. This has already been demonstrated. I don't think it makes sense to force a decision to be made in a fixed amount of time. I believe so long as people are making progress twards a solution that hasn't stagnated into repeating the same arguments/info over and over again, it should be allowed to continue. As soon as there is no new points or new comments that address the points brought up and a few days have passed it should come to an end. The few days delay is to give people who may be busy a chance to respond.
:::: I don't believe anyone should have to fully research the situation. Anyone who brings up points should be required to provides links as references in order establish their points or risk having them ignored. We're all volunteers after all, who choose to contribute to this project when we have free time. I also don't believe it drags users into having to discuss it. Only people who have a reason to get involved will do so, regardless of what method is used.
:::: I don't see how community consensus suddenly turns into mob rule with this particular situation. It almost seems as if some people have lost faith in the community to do the right thing and wish to prevent the community from having any say. Wikibooks has a mission and the community decides how best the work to achieve that mission. I don't want to see decisions being limited to a select few, especially when the decision is suppose to be final without any appeal. What the community wants has always been the final word when it comes to policy here, so I feel it makes sense for the final word on what to do about problems that fail to be resolved through discussion to be up to the community. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:51, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
::::: Yes, the action in the Panic case has caused me to loose faith in the admin clique that governs Wikibooks (what you call 'the community'). No question about that. To my mind the 'community' clearly did '''not''' do the right or fair thing in that case. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::: No I do not call admins the community. The community consists of every registered and participating user who comes here with the desire to create collaborative textbooks as is the mission of Wikibooks. As it stands this proposed policy wants to make an arbitration committee that can only consist of admins. I disagree with arbitration committee and believe it makes no sense. I disagree that the decision should be left up to only a select few, be that admins, some committee of admins or a committee of any sort. The discussion and decision should be open to every user who wishes to participate in the discussion and decision making process to resolve the dispute. The admins interaction in the process should be only to state their own views and to carry out the decision if it requires admin action to do so. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:53, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

::::::: Well it's going to be hard to get consensus on this I can see. I am completely opposed to making the arbitration process similar to the VfD process. Consensus based processes are good at maintaining the status quo. Something that maintains the status quo most of the time is not what we are going for here. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 00:10, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

Here is a modified arbitration proposal that includes a forum for community input. 
:#'''[Initiation Stage]''' An arbitration page will be created. This page will include the scope of the arbitration, involved parties, named arbiters, questions to be decided, agreements to arbitration and expected time frames for completion. Individual dispute pages will be created for each party. 
:#'''[Personal Statements Stage]''' All involved parties will state their position on their individual personal statements pages. Their stance on the dispute, additional points of contention, accusations of wrongdoing, and supporting evidence should all be included. Direct responses to accusations from other parties should be saved for later. 
:#'''[Rebuttal and Remedies Phase]''' All parties are given a chance to respond to all accusations and offer a rebuttal on their individual pages. Specific potential remedies should also be suggested. During this phase, arbiters will also ask direct questions of parties on their dispute pages for the purpose of clarification. Additionally, during this phase a community page will be created where the community can voice its opinion. Anyone who has something to say related to the dispute can make comments. Comments would be marked with '''comment'''. Suggestions for possible solutions would be marked with '''Suggestion'''. People who agree with the solution mark their response with '''Support''' and those people who disagree mark their response with '''Opposed'''. Parties to the dispute would specifically be precluded from posting on this page.
:#'''[Decision Phase]''' The arbitrators will offer their opinions on the questions to be decided and any additional accusations of wrongdoing (findings of fact). The arbiters will take into account all of the information presented including the opinions of the community. The arbiters will deliver a final verdict and action. 

:Each party will have their own individual dispute page and only they and arbiters will make content edits on that page. Efforts should be made to resolve disputes quickly, however time extensions may be granted depending on circumstances. The arbitration committee has the right to suspend proceedings or issue a final decision summarily at any time should they decide it necessary. All decisions by the committee will be considered final. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 16:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I believe the entire process needs to be on one page to make it easier to keep track of. I don't believe we need a fixed order in which discussion takes place. I believe we should only be concerned with minimizing the need for the parties to repeat themselves. Ideally discussions are well organized from the beginning so that nobody needs to repeat themselves for mediation and for this stage if it becomes necessary. Because requiring the entire thing to be gone over and discussed again from the beginning will more than likely increase the tension of the situation rather than defusing it. I rather by the time a mediator is requested, the mediator can simply look at the discussion and be able to understand everyone's position with the minimal of questions and be able to offer suggestions. By the time this stage is necessary there really should be no more need for discussion by the parties involved accept for clarifying any questions that may need to be asked. Otherwise I see any use of this process ending badly with most people unsatisfied and unhappy, and everyone losing. I'm starting to believe whichever module the discussion took place is where the meditation and this stage of the process should happen to minimize the repeating of discussion and turning it into a mess thats across many different pages and that the RFC should be used to request and keep track of current disputes that need resolving along with where the discussion is taking place. Maybe even for a time what the decision for a resolved dispute. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:25, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Are you talking about mediation or arbitration? to my mind I see them as two different steps, the first informal, the second very formal. In an actual real-world arbitration, the parties are frequently forbidden from talking to each other at all. There's a very good reason for this. In my experience, point-counterpoint arguments harden disagreements, and encourage them to continue. Not everyone feels comfortable in an argument free-for-all like you and I do. Wikibooks is not paper. There is no need to conserve bits by limiting the number of pages. I do agree that the individual summary statements should be kept short and concise. In a formal debate each side is given a particular time to state their position and then specific time is given for responses. This is a time-tested formula for dealing with disagreement fairly, if we do not include some mechanism for individuals to make their case without being subjected to continual interruption and counterpoint, the process cannot be fair. I am very worried about the tyranny of the majority here at Wikibooks, there is much groupthink here and little room for iconoclasts. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:21, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: I'm mostly talking about some other process (we'll call it RFC) other then arbitration and briefly how mediation fits into the process just before it. You've misunderstood me it seems, from your reference to Wikibooks not being paper. This has nothing to do with size and how much space it takes up. Before the mediation stage even has begun the parties involved have already made their cases, and shouldn't need to repeat them. The more time a person needs to spend trying to find links in the history and spend writing up their positions and points again the more time people have to get angrier over it. As happened with Robert's attempt which did not defused the situation, but made it more heated and intense. Not everyone feels comfortable having to repeat what a disagreement is over again and thinking about everything that lead to the situation or pressured to respond within a fixed time frame and rather just leave the project than get involved in that. The discussion I had in mind was between the rest of the community at the point of the RFC rather than the involved parties. I think by the time of the RFC, the parties know each other's positions and just need others to resolve it and so should not be involved in the process except where there positions may need to be clarified for anyone who wasn't involved who may have misunderstood or when asked a question. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

::::: I agree with most of that. I would support that the mediation/rfc process be fairly informal and done in whatever way makes sense at the time. My proposal was always intended to be a court of last resort thing to be used only in extreme circumstances of intractable disagreement --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 01:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::: RFC is meant as an alternative to the arbitration process rather then as part of the meditation process. First discussion, then mediation and finally RFC. RFC is just to give it a name and is probably not the same as SB_Johnny is proposing. My intension is for the arbitration process to be replaced with RFC as a last resort. Consisting of discussion by the community and a decision made without the parties being involved except in the two cases I mentioned, because by the time RFC is needed it should be clear that one or more parties has refused to find common ground and work together. I also feel its been made clear that any decision won't stick without the decision being made by the community, since otherwise it will only cause the community to become divided and create distrust as seems to have already happened, which I believe to not be good for the community. What did you not like about the arbitration that Robert tried to setup or how it was done? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:03, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

::::::: In fact, I was one of the few people who objected to specific aspects of the process early on. I still object to those three things. I don't think anyone wants me to list all the ways in which I believe that process was unfair and abusive from beginning to end. The list would be thirty or forty points long. However, instead of raining fire and brimstone and raising hell on meta, I've decided to work here systematically to prevent a repeat in the future. By comparing my proposal to Rob's system you can see the myriad and fundamental ways in which I found his process lacking. Four key ones being that his process defined no scope, was not time-bound, used a single arbiter, and provided no opportunity for community input. -- [[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:46, 5 February 2007 (UTC) 

::: I have worked up a couple of [[User:Xixtas/Arbitration_page_template|templates]] to go with the arbitration process I describe above. Hopefully this will help others visualize what I have in mind. Some of the features I think this idea has going for it are: a set timeline, a prescribed place for community input, and a specific scope of questions to be resolved. --23:36, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

== Let's not begin with arbitration... ==

I seem to be a bit slow on the uptake here :P. 

First a quick note on step 2: I'm not sure how realistic that is, because in my experience most Wikibookians come to Wikibooks to write something in particular, not just because they feel like writing books and any topic will do. We should assume that people who come here are driven by an urge to create something worthwhile, and if they're having a hard time getting along with someone (or a group of someones), they should get support if they ask for it (IOW: I don't think it would be a great thing if someone asked for help and recieved the blunt reply of &quot;you didn't follow step two, come back later&quot;). If someone ran straight to RfC without first trying to talk to the other contributor(s), we should by all means suggest that they do so, but telling them to sit on their hands and cool off isn't likely to be productive.

I think the step 3 (&quot;mediation&quot;) should be the important one, since that's worked very well for our sister project, Wikipedia. The [[WB:RFC]] process some of us are interested in developing here is modeled after theirs, and while the wikipedia version is quite formalized, we perhaps don't need to go there yet. The RfC is also designed in the hopes of using it for just getting some constructive criticism even without dispute, or at least ''getting outside support and opinions '''before''' things get heated''. If possible we should try to get some way of keeping the dialog as friendly as possible: not &quot;he's wrong, I'm right&quot;, but more along the lines of &quot;we're having a hard time agreeing on a path forward, and need some advice.&quot; 

The &quot;local projects&quot; stuff I mentioned on the Staff lounge is the other side of this that can in some ways be used as a way for authors to communicate what the creative approach has been over the history of the book, ''and why they think that approach is appropriate.'' That way if a new contributor comes along and wants to change things, they'll be less likely to re-make mistakes that previous contributors might already have made (and I speak as one who's made some mistakes, and spent as much time fixing them as making them). 

I guess what I'm saying with all this is that the arbitration sort of approach should really be a last resort, and that we should focus this policy towards trying to resolve things well before that happens. Step one is really just a statement of the obvious (which is appropriate because sometimes the obvious needs to be stated). Step two, as I said above, is a good idea in some cases and for some people, but should definitely not be required by policy... we should not be in the business of assigning arbitrary wikibreaks. Step three needs to be approached with care, in a definitively constructive manner. 

As for step four, hopefully we won't find ourselves there very often. If and when we do, and however it's structured, the decision should be quick and sure. By the time the other options have been exhausted, those involved in the disputes are likely to be at wit's end: only angry words are going to come out of it, and the longer it goes on the more the wounds will fester. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

: I've made some changes to step one and step two based on your comments and my own thoughts on the subject. In both cases I'm trying to higlight and focus on the positive. -[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 16:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks, but I decided to try being bold and made some more radical changes by just getting rid of the second step altogether, since like the first one this was more good advice than policy. 
::Just a compositional note: the arbitration section stands alone as having subsections. Perhaps more for aesthetic reasons than anything rational, I wonder if the Arbitration policy should just be a separate page altogether, so that this page can just mention it briefly with the implication that we don't want to go there? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

== Change/Remove step 4 ==

Judging from some early results in a straw poll from the staff lounge, and some other comments that were made around the project (and unfortunately many of these comments are highly distributed), I would like to suggest the following changes to this proposal:
*Removal of step 4 entirely, for reasons I will enumerate below
*Making &quot;mediation&quot; the final step in the process
*Higher emphasis on community involvement and the use of concensus to make decisions.
I think that step 4 should be removed for the following reasons:
*Disputes over content are already covered by the text of [[Wikibooks:Decision making]], and there is no need to have an editorial board to step in on such situations. However, I don't rule out the possibility that such an entity could act as a mediator if desired. I have addressed some of these points in the current text of [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]].
*Out of 5 votes cast currently, 4 have been in favor of the use of some brand of arbitration. However, the specifics of how the arbitration should be handled is a matter with far less agreement. 
**3 out of 5 votes claim that arbitration is not an acceptable way to end disputes concerning book content (hence a revitalized focus on [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]). 
**3 out of 5 votes (with one neutral vote) are against the establishment of a standing arbitration committee. Concerns cited are the consolidation and abuse of administrative power, the inability to maintain neutrality on a small project, and the community's lack of experience with this type of dispute. 
**2 out of 4 votes (with one neutral vote) are against the use of ad hoc or informal arbitration. 
Given the sheer amount of indecision on this matter, I think it would be a bad idea for us to specify that arbitration is the &quot;last step&quot;, when we don't have an arbitration process to employ for these situations. I recommend therefore that we remove the entire fourth section of the proposal, until such time as we have an acceptable arbitration process. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:You mean the third section :). I wouldn't want to rule out the possibility of creating an arbitration system at a later date, but what I'm leaning more towards now is a more &quot;wiki-ish&quot; system of a binding contract for one or both parties to agree to, with community support and input. 
:In any case, making an arbitration panel, especially a ''standing'' panel is not a good idea at this point. The ARBCOM at wikipedia ''is'' a standing cabal, and I think one of the things that's been made quite clear by the community now is that there should be no formalised cabals. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:43, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

::My problem here is that we don't have an arbitration &quot;situation&quot;, and we dont know even how we want to go about making one. Making this policy dependant on arbitration seems short-sighted to me, because we may never have a standardized form of arbitration to use! I think that it's important that we have a dispute resolution policy on the books soon so that we don't run into any further problems by not having one, and I also think that we can update it later when/if we decide to implement arbitration. I don't see any reason to put all our eggs in one basket, and say &quot;we can solve all our problems using arbitration&quot;, and &quot;we don't have arbitration, some of us dont really want it, and nobody can agree how to do it&quot;. The result of those two conflicting statements is &quot;we can't solve our own problems&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Right... I guess I was saying that we don't want to say there will never be such a thing, but for this and other reasons, an arbitration policy should be a separate one anyway, linked to from this policy if it ever came about. For now, I agree... just remove those sections. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: The real danger is in doing nothing. Any arbitration policy would be better than what we have now. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 22:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Every enterprise purchases goods, services, assets, or office supplies from its suppliers (also known as vendors).  Accounts Payable pays these suppliers on time (taking advantage of payment discounts if possible) while avoiding duplicate payments and bank over-drafts.   Accounts Payable is the last step in the supply chain where Purchasing is the first.  Accounts Payable accepts invoices, selects invoices to be paid, generates checks and forecasts future cash requirements based on due dates.  Some AP checks are issued to people or organizations that are not worth putting on file since they are likely to receive only one check.  Some enterprises prepay part of the invoice amount because the supplier requires a deposit.  Every ERP has an Accounts Payable module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Self-service ==
Suppliers can see their invoices and checks and basic information via the web and update some portions of it (name, address, and contact information for example).

== Tables ==
There are several major groups of tables in Accounts Payable.

*'''Supplier''' information is the master data used by Accounts Payable. It contains information about the enterprise's suppliers and other creditors. Information about the supplier, its locations, contacts etc. These tables are also used by Purchasing.
*'''Bank''' information is also master data. It contains information about the enterprise's banks and bank accounts.
*'''Invoices''' are documents issued by suppliers giving notice of what is owed them. Examples are standard invoices, credit memos, debit memos, interest memos. These transaction tables typically contains the invoice header, lines and payment schedules. 
*'''Payments''' or checks are transaction data reflect payments done to suppliers.
*'''Accounting Entries''' are transaction data with the accounting generated by invoice and payment transactions.

==Data Exchange==
Accounts Payable sends pricing data to Inventory, assets to Fixed Assets and accounting journal entries to General Ledger. Accounts Payable receives purchase orders and receipts from Purchasing in order to match invoices.

==Transactions==
The first transaction records a supplier invoice.  This can be verified against the related purchase order if there is one and the receiving report that lists what goods were actually received.  Not every enterprise uses the last two options.

The second transaction pays supplier invoice(s).  Each check can pay one or more supplier invoices.  Invoices must be approved for payment before they can be paid.

The vast majority of the module's transactions consist of the above two.  The third fundamental transaction is that of adjustment when things go wrong.  We will document this later.

'''CHAPTER I	PARTS OF A PARAGRAPH'''

A paragraph is a group of closely related sentences developing one topic.  Good writers always express themselves in a clear and orderly manner.  They have learned to make every paragraph tell about one topic only.
'''
Topic Sentence or Beginning Sentence'''

'''What is the topic sentence?''' 


The topic sentence, which attracts attention, is the first sentence in a paragraph. It lays out the story.

''What does it do?'' 

It introduces the main idea of the paragraph. It gives an idea of what is to follow.

''How do I write one?'' 

Summarize the main idea of your paragraph. Indicate to the reader what your paragraph will be about. 

Example: 

There are three reasons why Canada is a great country. First Canada has an excellent health care system. Every Canadian can receive medical service for very low price. Second , Canada has a very low standard of poor people. Everyone there, work very hard and they are fairly paid in their jobs. Finally, Canada has an elevated system of education. Children study very hard there and also are motivated to go continue studying at university. As a result, Canada is a desirable place to live.

EXERCISE I.1   Write a good beginning or topic sentence for each of the following titles:

#My High School Life
#My Favorite Teacher
#The Community's Outstanding Leader
#My Most Unforgettable Experience
#The City Park

'''Supporting Details or Middle Sentences'''

''What are supporting sentences?'' 

They come after the topic sentence, making up the body of a paragraph. 

''What do they do?'' 

They give details to develop and support the main idea of the paragraph. 

''How do I write them?'' 

You should give supporting facts, details, and examples. 

Example: 

There are three reasons why Canada is a great country. First Canada has an excellent health care system. Every Canadian can receive medical service for very low price. Second , Canada has a very low standard of poor people. Everyone there, work very hard and they are fairly paid in their jobs. Finally, Canada has an elevated system of education. Children study very hard there and also are motivated to go continue studying at university. As a result, Canada is a desirable place to live.

EXERCISE I.2  Given below are topic sentences.  Develop the middle sentences:

#Our school, which is located in the heart of a busy city, presents an attractive appearance to the pupils who daily approach its entrance.
#Mr. And Mrs. Robin worked hard to prepare a home for their little ones.
#My mother's face is the sweetest picture in my mental album.

'''Closing or Ending Sentence'''

''What is the closing sentence?'' 

The closing sentence is the last sentence in a paragraph. 

''What does it do?'' 

It restates the main idea of your paragraph. 

''How do I write one?'' 

Restate the main idea of the paragraph using different words. 

Example: 

There are three reasons why Canada is a great country. First Canada has an excellent health care system. Every Canadian can receive medical service for very low price. Second , Canada has a very low standard of poor people. Everyone there, work very hard and they are fairly paid in their jobs. Finally, Canada has an elevated system of education. Children study very hard there and also are motivated to go continue studying at university. As a result, Canada is a desirable place to live.

EXERCISE I.3  Examine the ending sentences in the following paragraphs and tell why they are good:

1.	A HAPPY COUNTENANCE

Jean can be recognized immediately by her healthy, beaming countenance. Two bright eyes sparkle merrily from under her well-shaped blond brows.  Her nose, though long and thin, is usually wrinkled with laughter.  Clean, shining teeth, which can be seen between her half-parted lips, indicate careful and regular brushing.  Sincere, earnest, and cheerful, Jean’s entire expression radiates happiness.

2.	CIRCUS TIME

Maytime is circus time in our time.  Each year about this time an old weed-choked field not far from our home becomes a miniature village of enchantment.  Billboards everywhere about town feature graceful jugglers, docile jungle animals, or daring exploits of skill and strength.  Newspapers parade dancing elephants, trained seals, and bicycle-riding monkeys.  Excitement reigns high as crowds of people, young and old, jam streetcars and busses that speed toward the wonders of Circusland.  How eagerly we anticipate this annual festival.

In mathematics, '''Clifford algebras''' are a type of associative algebra. They can be thought of as one of the possible generalizations of the complex numbers and quaternions. The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations. Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry and theoretical physics. They are named for the English geometer William Clifford.

:''Some familiarity with the basics of multilinear algebra will be useful in reading this section.''

==Introduction and basic properties==
Specifically, a Clifford algebra is a unital associative algebra which contains and is generated by a vector space ''V'' equipped with a quadratic form ''Q''. The Clifford algebra ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is the &quot;freest&quot; algebra generated by ''V'' subject to the condition&lt;sup&gt;[[#note1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v^2 = Q(v)\ \mbox{ for all } v\in V.&lt;/math&gt;
If the characteristic of the ground field ''K'' is not 2, then one can rewrite this fundamental identity in the form

:&lt;math&gt;uv + vu = \lang u, v\rang \mbox{ for all }u,v \in V,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;''u'',&amp;nbsp;''v''&gt; = ''Q''(''u''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''v'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''Q''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''Q''(''v'') is the symmetric bilinear form associated to Q. This idea of &quot;freest&quot; or &quot;most general&quot; algebra subject to this identity can be formally expressed through the notion of a universal property (see below).

Clifford algebras are closely related to exterior algebras. In fact, if ''Q'' = 0 then the Clifford algebra ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is just the exterior algebra Λ(''V''). For nonzero ''Q'' there exists a canonical ''linear'' isomorphism between Λ(''V'') and ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'')
whenever the ground field ''K'' does not have characteristic two. That is, they are naturally isomorphic as vector spaces, but with different multiplications (in the case of characteristic two, they are still isomorphic as vector spaces, just not naturally). Clifford multiplication is strictly richer than the exterior product since it makes use of the extra information provided by ''Q''.  More precisely, they may be thought
of as quantizations of the exterior algebra, in the same way that the Weyl algebra is a quantization of the symmetric algebra.

Quadratic forms and Clifford algebras in characteristic 2 form an exceptional case. In particular, if char ''K'' = 2 it is not true that a quadratic form is determined by its symmetric bilinear form, or that every quadratic form admits an orthogonal basis. Many of the statements in this article include the condition that the characteristic is not 2, and are false if this condition is removed.

== Universal property and construction ==

Let ''V'' be a vector space over a field ''K'', and let ''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K'' be a quadratic form on ''V''. 
In most cases of interest the field ''K'' is either '''R''' or '''C''' (which have characteristic 0) or a finite field.

A Clifford algebra ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is a unital associative algebra over ''K'' together with a linear map ''i'' : ''V'' → ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') defined by the following universal property: Given any associative algebra ''A'' over ''K'' and any linear map ''j'' : ''V'' →  ''A'' such that

:''j''(''v'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''Q''(''v'')1 for all ''v'' &amp;isin; ''V''

(where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity of ''A''), there is a unique algebra homomorphism ''f'' : ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') → ''A''
such that the following diagram commutes (i.e. such that ''f'' o ''i'' = ''j''):

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:CliffordAlgebra-01.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

Working with a symmetric bilinear form &lt;·,·&gt; instead of ''Q'' (in characteristic not 2), the requirement on ''j'' is

:''j''(''v'')''j''(''w'') + ''j''(''w'')''j''(''v'')'' = &lt;''v'',&amp;nbsp;''w''&gt; for all ''v'',&amp;nbsp;''w'' &amp;isin; ''V''.

A Clifford algebra as described above always exists and can be constructed as follows: start with the most general algebra that contains ''V'', namely the tensor algebra ''T''(''V''), and then enforce the fundamental identity by taking a suitable quotient. In our case we want to take the two-sided ideal ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''T''(''V'') generated by all elements of the form

:&lt;math&gt;v\otimes v - Q(v)1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;

and define ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') as the quotient

:''C''&amp;#x2113;(''V'',''Q'') = T(''V'')/''I''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''.&lt;/sub&gt;

It is then straightforward to show that ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') contains ''V'' and satisfies the above universal property, so that ''C''ℓ is unique up to isomorphism; thus one speaks of &quot;the&quot; Clifford algebra ''C''ℓ(''V'', ''Q''). It also follows from this construction that ''i'' is injective. One usually drops the ''i'' and considers ''V'' as a linear subspace of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'').

The universal characterization of the Clifford algebra shows that the construction of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is ''functorial'' in nature. Namely, ''C''ℓ can be considered as a functor from the category of vector spaces with quadratic forms (whose morphisms are linear maps preserving the quadratic form) to the category of associative algebras. The universal property guarantees that linear maps between vector spaces (preserving the quadratic form) extend uniquely to algebra homomorphisms between the associated Clifford algebras.

==Basis and dimension==

If the dimension of ''V'' is ''n'' and {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a basis of ''V'', then the set

:&lt;math&gt;\{e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k} \mid 1\le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \le n\mbox{ and } 0\le k\le n\}&lt;/math&gt;

is a basis for ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''). The empty product (''k'' = 0) is defined as the multiplicative identity element. For each value of ''k'' there are ''n'' choose ''k'' basis elements, so the total dimension of the Clifford algebra is

:&lt;math&gt;\dim C\ell(V,Q) = \sum_{k=0}^n\begin{pmatrix}n\\ k\end{pmatrix} = 2^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''V'' comes equipped with a quadratic form, there is a set of privileged bases for ''V'': the orthogonal ones. An orthogonal basis in one such that

:&lt;math&gt;\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = 0 \qquad i\neq j. \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;·,·&gt; is the symmetric bilinear form associated to ''Q''. The fundamental Clifford identity implies that for an orthogonal basis

:&lt;math&gt;e_ie_j = -e_je_i \qquad i\neq j. \,&lt;/math&gt;

This makes manipulation of orthogonal basis vectors quite simple. Given a product &lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; of ''distinct'' orthogonal basis vectors, one can put them into standard order by including an overall sign corresponding to the number of flips needed to correctly order them (i.e. the signature of the ordering permutation).

If the characteristic is not 2 then an orthogonal basis for ''V'' exists, and one can easily extend the quadratic form on ''V'' to a quadratic form on all of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') by requiring that distinct elements &lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal to one another whenever the {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}'s are orthogonal. Additionally, one sets
:&lt;math&gt;Q(e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k}) = Q(e_{i_1})Q(e_{i_2})\cdots Q(e_{i_k})&lt;/math&gt;.
The quadratic form on a scalar is just ''Q''(λ) = λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, orthogonal bases for ''V'' extend to orthogonal bases for ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''). The quadratic form defined in this way is actually independent of the orthogonal basis chosen (a basis-independent formulation will be given later).

== Examples: Real and complex Clifford algebras ==

The most important Clifford algebras are those over real and complex vector spaces equipped with nondegenerate quadratic forms.

Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a finite-dimensional real vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form:
:&lt;math&gt;Q(v) = v_1^2 + \cdots + v_p^2 - v_{p+1}^2 - \cdots - v_{p+q}^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' = ''p'' + ''q'' is the dimension of the vector space. The pair of integers (''p'', ''q'') is called the signature of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sup&gt;. The Clifford algebra on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sup&gt; is denoted ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). 
The symbol 
''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') 
means either
''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n'',0&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')
or
''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')
depending on whether the author prefers positive definite or negative definite spaces.

A standard orthonormal basis {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of ''n'' = ''p'' + ''q'' mutually orthogonal vectors, ''p'' of which have norm +1 and ''q'' of which have norm &amp;minus;1. The algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') will therefore have ''p'' vectors which square to +1 and ''q'' vectors which square to &amp;minus;1.

Note that ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,0&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') is naturally isomorphic to '''R''' since there are no nonzero vectors. ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') is a two-dimensional algebra generated by a single vector ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which squares to &amp;minus;1, and therefore is isomorphic to '''C''', the field of [[complex number]]s. The algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') is a four-dimensional algebra spanned by {1, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}. The latter three elements square to &amp;minus;1 and all anticommute, and so the algebra is isomorphic to the [[quaternion]]s '''H'''. The next algebra in the sequence is ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') is an 8-dimensional algebra isomorphic to the direct sum '''H''' ⊕ '''H''' called Clifford biquaternions.

One can also study Clifford algebras on complex vector spaces. Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a complex vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form
:&lt;math&gt;Q(z) = z_1^2 + z_2^2 + \cdots + z_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' = dim ''V'', so there is essentially only one Clifford algebra in each dimension. We will denote the Clifford algebra on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the standard quadratic form by ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C'''). One can show that the algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') may be obtained as the [[complexification]] of the algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') where ''n'' = ''p'' + ''q'':
:&lt;math&gt;C\ell_n(\mathbb{C}) \cong C\ell_{p,q}(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C} \cong C\ell(\mathbb{C}^{p+q},Q\otimes\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;.
Here ''Q'' is the real quadratic form of signature (''p'',''q''). Note that the complexification does not depend on the signature. The first few cases are not hard to compute. One finds that
:''C''&amp;#x2113;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') = '''C'''
:''C''&amp;#x2113;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') = '''C''' &amp;oplus; '''C'''
:''C''&amp;#x2113;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') = ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''')
where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') denotes the algebra of 2&amp;times;2 matrices over '''C'''.

It turns out that every one of the algebras ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') and ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') is isomorphic to a [[matrix algebra]] over '''R''', '''C''', or '''H''' or to a direct sum of two such algebras. For a complete classification of these algebras see [[classification of Clifford algebras]].

==Properties==
===Relation to the exterior algebra===

Given a vector space ''V'' one can construct the [[exterior algebra]] Λ(''V''), whose definition is independent of any quadratic form on ''V''. It turns out that if ''F'' does not have characteristic 2 then there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between Λ(''V'') and ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') considered as vector spaces (and there exists an isomorphism in characteristic two, which may not be natural). This is an algebra isomorphism if and only if ''Q'' = 0. One can thus consider the Clifford algebra ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') as an enrichment (or more precisely, a quantization, cf. the Introduction) of the exterior algebra on ''V'' with a multiplication that depends on ''Q'' (one can still define the exterior product independent of ''Q'').

The easiest way to establish the isomorphism is to choose an ''orthogonal'' basis {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} for ''V'' and extend it to an orthogonal basis for ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') as described above. The map ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') → Λ(''V'') is determined by
:&lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k} \mapsto e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this only works if the basis {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is orthogonal. One can show that this map is independent of the choice of orthogonal basis and so gives a natural isomorphism.

If the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' is 0, one can also establish the isomorphism by antisymmetrizing. Define functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''V'' &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''V'' → ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') by
:&lt;math&gt;f_k(v_1, \cdots, v_k) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k}{\rm sgn}(\sigma)\, v_{\sigma(1)}\cdots v_{\sigma(k)}&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is taken over the [[symmetric group]] on ''k'' elements. Since ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[alternating form|alternating]] it induces a unique linear map Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') → ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''). The [[direct sum]] of these maps gives a linear map between Λ(''V'') and ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''). This map can be shown to be a linear isomorphism, and it is natural.

A more sophisticated way to view the relationship is to construct a [[filtration (abstract algebra)|filtration]] on ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''). Recall that the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') has a natural filtration: ''F''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ … where ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; contains sums of tensors with rank ≤ ''k''. Projecting this down to the Clifford algebra gives a filtration on ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''). The associated [[graded algebra]]
:&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_k F^k/F^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is naturally isomorphic to the exterior algebra Λ(''V'').  Since the associated graded algebra of a filtered algebra is always isomorphic to the filtered
algebra as filtered vector spaces (by choosing complements of ''F''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; in ''F''&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''k''), this provides an isomorphism (although not a natural one) in any characteristic, even two.

===Grading===

The linear map on ''V'' defined by &lt;math&gt;v \mapsto -v&lt;/math&gt; preserves the quadratic form ''Q'' and so by the universal property of Clifford algebras extends to an algebra [[automorphism]]
:&amp;alpha; : ''C''&amp;#x2113;(''V'',''Q'') &amp;rarr; ''C''&amp;#x2113;(''V'',''Q'').
Since α is an [[involution]] (i.e. it squares to the [[identity map|identity]]) one can decompose ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') into positive and negative eigenspaces
:&lt;math&gt;C\ell(V,Q) = C\ell^0(V,Q) \oplus C\ell^1(V,Q)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') = {''x'' ∈ ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') | α(''x'') = (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''}. Since α is an automorphism it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;C\ell^{\,i}(V,Q)C\ell^{\,j}(V,Q) = C\ell^{\,i+j}(V,Q)&lt;/math&gt;
where the superscripts are read modulo 2. This means that ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[graded algebra]] (also known as a [[superalgebra]]). Note that ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') forms a [[subalgebra]] of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q''), called the '''even subalgebra'''. The piece ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') is called the '''odd part''' of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') (it is not a subalgebra).  This '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading plays an important role in the analysis and application of Clifford algebras. The automorphism α is called the '''main involution''' or '''grade involution'''.

''Remark''. In characteristic not 2 the algebra ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') inherits a '''Z'''-grading from the canonical isomorphism with the exterior algebra Λ(''V''). It is important to note, however, that this is a ''vector space grading only''. That is, Clifford multiplication does not respect the '''Z'''-grading only the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading. Happily, the gradings are related in the natural way: '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''Z'''/2'''Z'''. The ''degree'' of a Clifford number usually refers to the degree in the '''Z'''-grading. Elements which are pure in the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading are simply said to be even or odd.

If the characteristic of ''F'' is not 2 then the even subalgebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') of a Clifford algebra is itself a Clifford algebra. 
If ''V'' is the orthogonal direct sum of a vector ''a'' of norm ''Q''(''a'') and a subspace ''U'', 
then ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') is isomorphic to ''C''ℓ(''U'',&amp;minus;''Q''(''a'')''Q''),
where &amp;minus;''Q''(''a'')''Q'' is the form ''Q'' restricted to ''U'' and multiplied by &amp;minus;''Q''(''a'').
In particular over the reals this implies that
:&lt;math&gt;C\ell_{p,q}^0(\mathbb{R}) \cong C\ell_{p,q-1}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; for ''q'' &amp;gt; 0, and
:&lt;math&gt;C\ell_{p,q}^0(\mathbb{R}) \cong C\ell_{q,p-1}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;for ''p'' &amp;gt; 0.
In the negative-definite case this gives an inclusion ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') ⊂ ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0, ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') which extends the sequence
:'''R''' &amp;sub; '''C''' &amp;sub; '''H''' &amp;sub; '''H'''&amp;oplus;'''H''' &amp;sub; &amp;hellip;
Likewise, in the complex case, one can show that the even subalgebra of ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') is isomorphic to ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''').

===Antiautomorphisms===

In addition to the automorphism α, there are two [[antiautomorphism]]s which play an important role in the analysis of Clifford algebras. Recall that the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') comes with an antiautomorphism that reverses the order in all products:
:&lt;math&gt;v_1\otimes v_2\otimes \cdots \otimes v_k \mapsto v_k\otimes \cdots \otimes v_2\otimes v_1&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the ideal ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt; is invariant under this reversal, this operation descends to an antiautomorphism of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') called the '''transpose''' or '''reversal''' operation, denoted by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;. The transpose is an antiautomorphism: &lt;math&gt;(xy)^t = y^t x^t&lt;/math&gt;. The transpose operation makes no use of the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading so we define a second antiautomorphism by composing α and the transpose. We call this operation '''Clifford conjugation''' denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x = \alpha(x^t) = \alpha(x)^t.&lt;/math&gt;
Of the two antiautomorphisms, the transpose is the more fundamental.&lt;sup&gt;[[#note3|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Note that all of these operations are [[involution]]s. One can show that they act as ±1 on elements which are pure in the '''Z'''-grading. In fact, all three operations depend only on the degree modulo 4. That is, if ''x'' is pure with degree ''k'' then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(x) = \pm x \qquad x^t = \pm x \qquad \bar x = \pm x&lt;/math&gt;
where the signs are given by the following table:
{| border=1 style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; text-align: center;&quot; cellpadding=4
! ''k'' mod 4 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 ||
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; || + || &amp;minus; || + || &amp;minus;
| (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;x^t\,&lt;/math&gt; || + || + || &amp;minus; || &amp;minus;
| (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''(''k''&amp;minus;1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; || + || &amp;minus; || &amp;minus; || +
| (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''(''k''+1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

===The Clifford scalar product===

When the characteristic is not 2 
the quadratic form ''Q'' on ''V'' can be extended to a quadratic form on all of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') as explained earlier (which we also denoted by ''Q''). A basis independent definition is
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = \lang x^t x\rang&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;''a''&gt; denotes the scalar part of ''a'' (the grade 0 part in the '''Z'''-grading). One can show that
:&lt;math&gt;Q(v_1v_2\cdots v_k) = Q(v_1)Q(v_2)\cdots Q(v_k)&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''V'' &amp;mdash; this identity is ''not'' true for arbitrary elements of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'').

The associated symmetric bilinear form on ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\lang x, y\rang = \lang x^t y\rang.&lt;/math&gt;
One can check that this reduces to the original bilinear form when restricted to ''V''. The bilinear form on all of ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is [[nondegenerate]] if and only it is  nondegenerate on ''V''.

It is not hard to verify that the transpose is the [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]] of left/right Clifford multiplication with respect to this inner product. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\lang ax, y\rang = \lang x, a^t y\rang,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\lang xa, y\rang = \lang x, y a^t\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

==Structure of Clifford algebras==

In this section we assume that the vector space ''V'' is finite dimensional and 
that the bilinear form of ''Q'' is non-singular. A [[central simple algebra]] over ''K''
is a matrix algebra over a (finite dimensional) division algebra with center ''K''. For example, the central simple algebras over the reals are matrix algebras over either the reals or the quaternions. 

*If ''V'' has even dimension then ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is a central simple algebra over ''K''. 
*If ''V'' has even dimension then ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') is a central simple algebra over a quadratic extension of ''K'' or a sum of two isomorphic central simple algebras over ''K''. 
*If ''V'' has odd dimension then ''C''ℓ(''V'',''Q'') is a central simple algebra over a quadratic extension of ''K'' or a sum of two isomorphic central simple algebras over ''K''. 
*If ''V'' has odd dimension then ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'',''Q'') is a central simple algebra over ''K''. 

The structure of Clifford algebras can be worked out explicitly using the following result. Suppose that ''U'' has even dimension and a non-singular bilinear form with [[discriminant]] ''d'', and suppose that ''V'' is another vector space with a quadratic form. The Clifford algebra of ''U''+''V'' is isomorphic to 
the tensor product of the Clifford algebras of ''U'' and (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;dim(''U'')/2&lt;/sup&gt;''dV'', which is the space ''V'' with its quadratic form multiplied by (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;dim(''U'')/2&lt;/sup&gt;''d''.
Over the reals, this implies in particular that 
:&lt;math&gt; Cl_{p+2,q}(\mathbb{R}) = M_2(\mathbb{R})\otimes Cl_{q,p}(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Cl_{p+1,q+1}(\mathbb{R}) = M_2(\mathbb{R})\otimes Cl_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Cl_{p,q+2}(\mathbb{R}) = \mathbb{H}\otimes Cl_{q,p}(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt;
These formulas can be used to find the structure of all real Clifford algebras;  see the [[classification of Clifford algebras]].

==The Clifford group &amp;Gamma;==

In this section we assume that ''V'' is finite dimensional and the bilinear form of ''Q'' is non-singular. 

The Clifford group Γ is defined to be the set of invertible elements ''x'' of the Clifford algebra such that
:&lt;math&gt;x v \alpha(x)^{-1}\in V&lt;/math&gt;
for all  ''v'' in ''V''. 
This formula also defines an action of the Clifford group on the vector space ''V'' that preserves the norm ''Q'', and so gives a homomorphism from the Clifford group to the orthogonal group.  The Clifford group contains all elements ''r'' of ''V'' of nonzero norm, and these act on ''V'' by the corresponding reflections that take ''v'' to ''v'' &amp;minus; &lt;''v'',''r''&gt;''r''/''Q''(''r'')  (In characteristic 2 these are called orthogonal transvections rather than reflections.)

Many authors define the Clifford group slightly differently, by replacing 
the action ''xv''α(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; by ''xvx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This produces the same Clifford group, but the action of the Clifford group on ''V'' is changed slightly: the action of the odd elements Γ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of the Clifford group is multiplied by an extra factor of &amp;minus;1. This action used here has several minor advantages: it is consistent with the usual superalgebra sign conventions, elements of ''V'' correspond to reflections, and in odd dimensions the map from the Clifford group to the orthogonal group is onto, and the kernel is no larger than ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Using the action α(''x'')''vx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; instead of ''xv''α(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; makes no difference: it produces the same Clifford group with the same action on ''V''.

The Clifford group Γ is the disjoint union of two subsets Γ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Γ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, where Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;
is the subset of elements of degree ''i''. The subset Γ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
is a subgroup of index 2 in Γ. 

If ''V'' is finite dimensional with nondegenerate bilinear form then the Clifford group maps onto the orthogonal group of ''V'' and the kernel consists of the nonzero elements of the field ''K''. This leads to exact sequences
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \rightarrow K^* \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow O_V(K) \rightarrow 1,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \rightarrow K^* \rightarrow \Gamma^0 \rightarrow SO_V(K) \rightarrow 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

In arbitrary characteristic, the '''spinor norm''' ''Q'' is defined on the Clifford group by
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = x^tx\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Note that (-1)^D(x) is the same as \alpha(x), so this expression is the same
as \alpha(x)^t x (-1)^D(x). --&gt;
It is a homomorphism from the Clifford group to the group 
''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of non-zero elements of ''K''. It coincides with the quadratic form ''Q'' of ''V'' when ''V'' is identified with a subspace of the Clifford algebra.
Several authors define the spinor norm slightly differently, so that it differs from the one here by a factor of &amp;minus;1, 2, or &amp;minus;2 on Γ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The difference is not very important.

The nonzero elements of ''K'' have spinor norm in the group ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt; of squares of nonzero elements of the field ''K''. So when ''V'' is finite dimensional and non-singular we get an induced map from the orthogonal group of ''V'' to the group ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K''&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt;, also called the spinor norm. The spinor norm of the reflection of a vector
''r'' has image ''Q''(''r'') in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K''&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt;, and this property uniquely defines it on the orthogonal group. This gives exact sequences:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 \rightarrow \{\pm 1\} \rightarrow Pin_V(K) \rightarrow O_V(K) \rightarrow K^*/K^{*2},\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \rightarrow \{\pm 1\} \rightarrow Spin_V(K) \rightarrow SO_V(K) \rightarrow K^*/K^{*2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in characteristic 2 the group {±1} has just one element.

== Spin and Pin groups ==

In this section we assume that ''V'' is finite dimensional and its bilinear form is non-singular. (If ''K'' has characteristic 2 this implies that the dimension of ''V'' is even.)

The '''Pin group''' ''Pin''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') is the subgroup of the 
Clifford group Γ of elements of spinor norm 1, and similarly the 
'''Spin group''' ''Spin''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'') is the subgroup of elements of [[Dickson invariant]] 0 in ''Pin''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''). When the characteristic is not 2, these are the elements of determinant 1. The Spin group usually has index 2 in the Pin group. 

Recall from the previous section that there is a homomorphism from the Clifford group onto the orthogonal group. We define the [[special orthogonal group]] to be the image of Γ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''K'' does not have characteristic 2 this is just the group of elements of the orthogonal group of determinant 1. If ''K'' does have characteristic 2, then all elements of the orthogonal group have determinant 1, and the special orthogonal group is the set of elements of Dickson invariant 0. 

There is a homomorphism from the Pin group to the orthogonal group. The image consists of the elements of spinor norm  1 ∈ ''K''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K''&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The kernel consists of the elements +1 and &amp;minus;1, and has order 2
unless ''K'' has characteristic 2. Similarly there is a homomorphism from the Spin group to the special orthogonal group of ''V''.

In the common case when ''V'' is a positive or negative definite space over the reals, the spin group maps onto the special orthogonal group, and is simply connected when ''V'' has dimension at least 3. '''Warning:''' This is not true in general: if ''V'' is ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''p'' and ''q'' both at least 2 then the spin group is not simply connected and does not map onto the special orthogonal group.  
In this case the algebraic group ''Spin''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is simply connected as an algebraic group, even though its group of real valued points ''Spin''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is not simply connected.
This is a rather subtle point, which completely confused the authors of at least one standard book about spin groups.

==Spinors==

Suppose that ''p+q=2n'' is even. Then the Clifford algebra ''Cℓ''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') is a matrix algebra, and so has a complex 
representation of dimension 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. By restricting to the group ''Pin''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') we get a complex representation of the Pin group 
of the same dimension, called the '''spinor representation'''. If we restrict this to the spin group ''Spin''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') then it splits as the sum of two '''half spin representations''' (or '''Weyl representations''') of dimension 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

If ''p+q=2n+1'' is odd then the Clifford algebra ''Cℓ''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') is a sum of two matrix algebras, each of which has a representation of dimension 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, and these are also both representations of the Pin group ''Pin''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). On restriction to the spin group ''Spin''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') these become isomorphic, so the spin group has a complex '''spinor representation''' of dimension 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

More generally, spinor groups and pin groups over any field have similar
representations whose exact structure depends on the [[classification of Clifford algebras|structure of the corresponding Clifford algebras]]: whenever a Clifford algebra has a factor that
is a matrix algebra over some division algebra, we get a corresponding representation of the pin and spin groups over that division algebra.
For examples over the reals see the article on [[spinor]]s.

==Applications==
===Differential geometry===

One of the principal applications of the exterior algebra is in [[differential geometry]] where it is used to define the [[fiber bundle|bundle]] of [[differential form]]s on a [[smooth manifold]]. In the case of a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]], the [[tangent space]]s come equipped with a natural quadratic form induced by the [[metric tensor|metric]]. Thus, one can define a Clifford bundle in analogy with the exterior bundle. This has a number of important applications in [[Riemannian geometry]].

===Physics===

Clifford algebras have numerous important applications in physics. Physicists usually consider a Clifford algebra to be an algebra spanned by matrices γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; called [[Dirac matrices]] which have the property that

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_i\gamma_j + \gamma_j\gamma_i = 2\eta_{ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where η is the matrix of a quadratic form of signature (''p'',''q'') &amp;mdash; typically (1,3) when working in [[Minkowski space]]. These are exactly the defining relations for the Clifford algebra ''Cl''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') (up to an unimportant factor of 2),
which by the [[classification of Clifford algebras]] is isomorphic to 
the algebra of 4 by 4 complex matrices. 

The Dirac matrices were first written down by [[Paul Dirac]] when he was trying to write a relativistic first-order wave equation for the [[electron]], and give an explicit isomorphism from the Clifford algebra to the algebra of complex matrices. The result was used to define the [[Dirac equation]]. The entire Clifford algebra shows up in [[quantum field theory]] in the form of [[Dirac field bilinear]]s.

==Footnotes==

#&lt;div id=&quot;note1&quot;&gt;Mathematicians who work with real Clifford algebras and prefer positive definite quadratic forms (especially those working in index theory) sometimes use a different [[sign convention|choice of sign]] in the fundamental Clifford identity. That is, they take ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;''Q''(''v''). One must replace ''Q'' with &amp;minus;''Q'' in going from one convention to the other.&lt;/div&gt;
#&lt;div id=&quot;note3&quot;&gt;The opposite is true when uses the alternate (&amp;minus;) sign convention for Clifford algebras: it is the conjugate which is more important. In general, the meanings of conjugation and transpose are interchanged when passing from one sign convention to the other. For example, in the convention used here the inverse of a vector is given by &lt;math&gt;v^{-1} =   v^t/Q(v)&lt;/math&gt; while in the (&amp;minus;) convention it is given by &lt;math&gt;v^{-1} = \bar{v}/Q(v)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Eiffel Unfeatures &amp;mdash; What you Won't See in the Language==

===   Goto, break or the equivalent ===
Ever since the advent of structure programming the goto has been considered evil, yet many programming languages support it. Eiffel does not. The language is designed to uphold the principle of Single Entry/Single Exit.

Some people consider this a gross inefficiency and will labor endlessly to demonstrate arcane algorithms that are allegedly faster with a well-placed goto, or it requires fewer variables, or fewer lines of code. Others consider is a serious crimp to their writing style. 

Yet there are two serious advantages to the principle of Single Entry/Single Exit. First, it encourages the programmer to think clearly about the implementation. In other languages, if you find yourself in getting into trouble deep inside a multiply nested loop, you bail out with a goto. In Eiffel, you have to rethink the structure of the code, often to the benefit of the final program.

Second, source code is read much more often than it is written. The absence of a goto statement makes it easier to grasp the implementation. There are no subtle tricks buried in the inner loop that can skip to some arbitrary location.

===   Globals ===
     State shared via the once statement
        Allows precise control over sharing data
===   CamelCase ===
&lt;br/&gt;Underscore_notation_is_preferred_for_better_readability&lt;br/&gt;Vs.&lt;br/&gt;CamelCaseNotationWhichCanBeVeryDifficultToRead&lt;br/&gt;

===   Case sensitivity ===
     True = true = TRUE

=== Overloaded Names ===

Overloaded names, also known as operator overloading, introduces ambiguity for the human programmer and reader of soruce code, and in some cases, for the compiler as well. Eiffel avoids this source of errors by not implementing it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

&lt;big&gt;'''Article wishes &amp; feedback'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Longing for a text about that particular interest of yours? Seen something on TV that you'd now like to read about in German? Got a soft spot for some local German speciality? Then this wishing well is for you. Click on the &quot;+&quot; button on the navigation bar on top of this page, drop in your thoughts and we'll see what we can do.

This is also the place to give general feedback about what you like and dislike about this project. As all wikibooks, ''Freistil'' is a &quot;living&quot; project and you as a reader can directly influence its development. Since we're not getting any feedback from sales figures, as do authors and publishing houses, we're glad about any comment that shows us this book is actually being read.

__TOC__

== German dialects ==
For me, it's interesting that German has so many different dialects, even in one country. I know it's a very broad scope, so perhaps there may be a series of articles, each one about one region (not neccessarily for every land, but for regions which have their own dialect). I imagine these articles could give some of most interesting expressions in local dialect compared with High German equivalents, together with some historical background. If a text gets too long, there could be one day break after it (so that the author won't have to write too much and readers have time to read the whole ;-). I would like to see Lower German, Saksisch and Berlin dialect plus Austria and Switzerland (when I learned German in school noone told me that they don't use sharp &quot;s&quot; in Switzerland). Oh, when it comes to writing - I have heard something about a special way German people were once taught to write by hand and you can recognise native German speaker by the way he or she writes &quot;z&quot; letter (with horizontal line like &lt;s&gt;z&lt;/s&gt;).

Plus perhaps small languages like Romansh, Frisian, Luxembourgish. I'm also interested in Sorbs in Germany. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

I have contacted Wikipedian groups about the dialect issue. As I live in Heidelberg, I can only provide correct information about my home dialect ''Kurpfälzisch''. There are indeed several differences when it comes to writing: the &quot;z&quot; always with horizontal bar, the &quot;1&quot; always with diagonal upper end, varying quotation marks „ and “ instead of &quot; and ', different lengths of dashes – — and usage of blanks before and after them and last but not least the additional letters ä, ö, ü and ß. Over the years, script was subject to various reforms. Today, young people learn a ''simplified basic script'' and can barely read their grandfathers' ''Sütterlin''-cursive. We will certainly have a set of texts about local German differences in language. I am not familiar with Sorbs though, and will look out for someone else who could do that. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 16:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== Look ==

I think that marking words having translation with blue colour is a bit embarrasing, as usually hyperlinks look like this. I find italic text or light gray underline a better solution. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

On [[Talk:Freistil/Participate]] there has already been a discussion on this topic:

I would like to suggest some other visual identifier (probably color) in addition to (or possibly instead of) italics that would encourage people to mouseover the words while they read. This would aid in learning how to use the book without having to read the &quot;how to use this book&quot; page (which I suspect would often be skipped). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

I don't stick to italics, only the markup must not distract the reader. I could imagine either a dark colour similar to that of links, i. e. dark blue or dark purple, or some sort of underlining, both of which could encourage people to hover their cursor. Maybe some changing visual key like the regular link markup would do as well. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 20:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

I have tried underline and dark blue color, and I think color markup works better. Let me know about your thoughts. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 20:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

In the German mirror project, the item lately has been addressed, too, with no conclusion up till now. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 08:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

: See [[Talk:Freistil/Participate]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:33, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

==Advertising==
If you know any internet portals for learning German, you can try to add link to Freistil there. You can also add it to some web directories. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Article  ==

I don't see any sense in giving license of image used in article. It only produces information noise and distracts readers from what is really important. You can find all neccessary details about a photo by entering its description page. I also don't see much sense in informing what license Wikinews is using. People who are curious about it can follow a link to the original text. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:23, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

The licence information is intended to be on the safe side with the licenses' requirements, not to help the reader access any data. Both Creative Commons licenses require the instance reusing a piece of work to name the licence itself. I am not an expert in copyright law, so I decided to rather give too much information than to risk a legal row. If you find that piece of text too disturbing, we can either change the layout or try and see someone at Wikibooks or Wikipedia who is more proficient in legal issues. In my eyes, the surplus rather makes the text more trustworthy, as it shows that someone actually spared a thought on the copyright issue. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 16:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
: But it's completely absolete to provide license for images if it can be checked by clicking on the image. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:33, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;span id=&quot;{{{2}}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt; {{#if: {{{2}}} | ({{{2}}})|}}&lt;/div&gt;{{{1|equation}}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px; padding:10px; border:1px solid silver;&quot;&gt;
This template displays a centered equation and, optionally, an equation label or equation number.  This equation label is also used as a tag name and thus can be a link target, so that a reader can click on a reference to an equation and the browser will jump to that equation. (The equation label does not have to be a number, and text labels might be more useful in a collaboratively edited environment, unless an automatic renumbering system existed that could also update all references to a link target when it's name changed.)

Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px; padding:10px; border:1px solid silver;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Plasma_g/Eq|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Eq-Euler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

or if this is moved to Wikipedia's global templates library, the template name would simplify to just &quot;Eq&quot;:

&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Eq|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Eq-Euler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Euler's Equation is one of the most beautiful and elegant of all equations, because it shows a special relation between 5 of the most important numbers in mathematics, as shown in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#Eq-Euler|Eq-Euler]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

generates:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px; padding:10px; border:1px solid silver;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;{{{Eq-Euler}}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;(Eq-Euler)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Euler's Equation is one of the most beautiful and elegant of all equations, because it shows a special relation between 5 of the most important numbers in mathematics, as shown in [[#Eq-Euler|Eq-Euler]].

&lt;/div&gt;

Caveats:  

(1)  It appears that apostrophes aren't allowed in link names, so in this example I used &quot;Eq-Euler&quot; as the label, instead of &quot;Euler's Equation&quot;, which might have been more natural.  

(2)  One could imagine a somewhat more modular template that could be called after an equation is formatted (instead of taking the equation as an argument to the template).  This template would just generate a right-aligned label, and an associated tag that could be a link target.  But I haven't yet figured out how to get this label on the same line as the equation.

Could this be made more accessible to people who are intrested but who are not such low level coders.

What OS and version's do each variant work on, presumably each relise of a service pach 'fixes' most of thease.

Is there any self replicating code that mutates sightly at random on making a copy? is this possible?

[[User:Alan2here|Alan2here]] 16:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

: This is possible. I'm not at home, but if I was I'd find the name of the experiment, but in short, years ago someone did an experiment with assembly in which every 'critter' started off with the same code that copied itself and also mutated itself randomly for the next iteration. Improper programs were killed outright, and the ones that perpetuated had interesting properties. The experiment was done in such a way that the shorter the program was, the quicker it would spawn, so that parasites developed that used code other than it's own. [[User:albinofrenchy]]</text>

      <comment>/* Convert to RTF */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Strictly speaking, LaTeX source can be used to directly generate two formats:
* DVI using &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt;, the first one to be supported;
* PDF using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=pdflatex&lt;!----&gt;}}, more recent.
Using other software freely available on Internet, you can easily convert DVI and PDF to other document formats. In particular, you can obtain the PostScript version using software which is included in your LaTeX distribution. Some LaTeX IDE will give you the possibility to generate the PostScript version directly (even if it uses internally a DVI mid-step, e.g. LaTeX → DVI → PS). It is also possible to create PDF from DVI and vice versa. It doesn't seem logical to create a file with two steps when you can create it straight away, but some users might need it because, as you remember from the first chapters, the format you can generate depends upon the formats of the images you want to include (EPS for DVI, PNG and JPG for PDF). Here you will find sections about different formats with description about how to get it.

Other formats can be produced, such as RTF (which can be used in Microsoft Word) and HTML. However, these documents are produced from software that parses and interprets the LaTeX files, and do not implement all the features available for the primary DVI and PDF outputs. Nonetheless, they do work, and can be crucial tools for collaboration with colleagues who do not edit documents with LaTeX.

==Tools installation==

This chapter features a lot of third-party tools; most of them are installed independently of your TeX distribution.

Some tools are Unix-specific (*BSD, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X), but it may be possible to make them work on Windows. If you have the choice, it is often easier with Unix systems for command line tools.

Some tools may already be installed. For instance, you can check if dvipng is installed and ready to use (Unix only):
 which dvipng
You get a directory if it is OK.
[[w
Most of these tools are installable using your package manager or portage tree (Unix only).

==Preview mode==

This section describes how to generate a screenshot of a LaTeX page or of a specific part of the page using the LaTeX package {{LaTeX/Package|preview}}. Screenshots are useful, for example, if you want to include a LaTeX generated formula on a presentation using you favorite slideware like Powerpoint, Keynote or LibreOffice Impress. First, start by making sure you have {{LaTeX/Package|preview}}. See [[LaTeX/Installing Extra Packages|Installing Extra Packages]].

Say you want to take a screenshot of 
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi = \sqrt{12}\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-3)^{-k}}{2k+1}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Write this formula in the {{LaTeX/Environment|preview}} environment:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[active]{preview}
\begin{document}
\begin{preview}
\[
\pi = \sqrt{12}\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{ (-3)^{-k} }{ 2k+1 }
\]
\end{preview}
\end{document}
}}

Note the {{LaTeX/Parameter|active}} option in the package declaration and the {{LaTeX/Environment|preview}} environment around the equation's code. Without any of these two, you won't get any output.

This package is also very useful to export specific parts to other format, or to produce graphics (''e.g.'' using [[LaTeX/PGF/TikZ|PGF/TikZ]]) and then including them in other documents. You can also automate the previewing of specific environments:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}
\PreviewEnvironment{lstlisting}
\setlength{\PreviewBorder}{10pt}%

% ...

\begin{lstlisting}
int main()
{
        /* ... */
}
\end{lstlisting}
}}

This will produce a PDF containing only the listing content, the ''page'' layout will depend on the shape of the source code.

==Convert to [[w:PDF|PDF]]==
=== Directly ===
 pdflatex my_file

=== DVI to PDF===
&lt;pre&gt;
dvipdfm my_file.dvi
&lt;/pre&gt;
will create &lt;tt&gt;my_file.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;. Another way is to pass through PS generation:
&lt;pre&gt;
dvi2ps myfile.dvi
ps2pdf myfile.ps
&lt;/pre&gt;
you will get also a file called ''my_file.ps'' that you can delete.

===Merging PDF===

If you have created different PDF documents and you want to merge them into one single PDF file you can use the following command-line command. You need to have Ghostscript installed:

====Using Windows====

 gswin32 -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOUTPUTFILE=Merged.pdf -dBATCH 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf

====Using Linux====

 gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOUTPUTFILE=Merged.pdf -dBATCH 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf

Alternatively, [http://pdfshuffler.sourceforge.net/ PDF-Shuffler] is a small python-gtk application, which helps the user to merge or split pdf documents and rotate, crop and rearrange their pages using an interactive and intuitive graphical interface. This program may be avaliable in your Linux distribution's repository.

Another option to check out is [http://www.accesspdf.com/ pdftk] (or PDF toolkit), which is a command-line tool that can manipulate PDFs in many ways. To merge one or more files, use:

 pdftk 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf cat output 123.pdf

====Using pdfLaTeX====

''Note:'' If you are merging external PDF documents into a LaTeX document which is compiled with &lt;code&gt;pdflatex&lt;/code&gt;, a much simpler option is to use the {{LaTeX/Package|pdfpages}} package, ''e.g.'':

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{pdfpages}
...
\includepdf[pages=-]{Document1.pdf}
\includepdf[pages=-]{Document2.pdf}
...
}}

Three simple [[wikipedia:Shell (computing)|shell]] scripts using the {{LaTeX/Package|pdfpages}} package are provided in the [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic/firth/software/pdfjam pdfjam bundle] by D. Firth. They include options to merge several pdf files (pdfjoin), put several pages in one physical sheet (pdfnup) and rotate pages (pdf90).

See also [[LaTeX/Modular Documents#Inserting PDF files|Modular Documents]]

===XeTeX===
You can also use XeTeX (or, more precisely, XeLaTeX), which works in the same way as &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;: it creates a PDF file directly from LaTeX source. One advantage of XeTeX over standard LaTeX is support for Unicode and modern typography. See [[w:XeTeX|its Wikipedia entry]] for more details.

Customization of PDF output in XeTeX (setting document title, author, keywords etc.) is done using the configuration of [[LaTeX/Hyperlinks#Customization|hyperref]] package.

== Convert to [[w:PostScript|PostScript]] ==

;from PDF:
&lt;pre&gt;
pdf2ps my_file.pdf
&lt;/pre&gt;

;from DVI:
&lt;pre&gt;
dvi2ps my_file.dvi
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Convert to [[w:Rich Text Format|RTF]] ==

LaTeX can be converted into an RTF file, which in turn can be opened by a word processor such as [[w:LibreOffice Writer|LibreOffice Writer]] or [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]]. This conversion is done through [http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/ latex2rtf], which can run on any computer platform. The program operates by reading the LaTeX source, and mimicking the behaviour of the LaTeX program. &lt;code&gt;latex2rtf&lt;/code&gt; supports most of the standard implementations of LaTeX, such as standard formatting, some math typesetting, inclusion of EPS, PNG or JPG graphics, and tables. As well, it has some limited support for packages, such as varioref, and natbib. However, many other packages are not supported.

&lt;tt&gt;latex2rtf&lt;/tt&gt; is simple to use. The Windows version has a GUI (&lt;tt&gt;l2rshell.exe&lt;/tt&gt;), which is straightforward to use. The command-line version is offered for all platforms, and can be used on an example &lt;tt&gt;mypaper.tex&lt;/tt&gt; file:

 latex mypaper
 bibtex mypaper # if you use bibtex
 latex2rtf mypaper

Both &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; and (if needed) &lt;code&gt;bibtex&lt;/code&gt; commands need to be run ''before'' &lt;code&gt;latex2rtf&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;tt&gt;.aux&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.bbl&lt;/tt&gt; files are needed to produce the proper output. The result of this conversion will create &lt;tt&gt;myfile.rtf&lt;/tt&gt;, which you may open in many word processors such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice.

== Convert to HTML ==

There are many converters to HTML.
;[http://hevea.inria.fr HEVEA]:
 hevea mylatexfile

;latex2html:
 latex2html -html_version 4.0,latin1,unicode -split 1 -nonavigation -noinfo -title &quot;MyDocument&quot; MyDocument.tex

;TeX4ht
[http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/ TeX4ht] is a very powerful conversion program, but its configuration is not straightforward. Basically a configuration file has to be prepared, and then the program is called.

;bibtex2html:
For BibTeX.
 bibtex2html mybibtexfile

==Convert to image formats==

It is sometimes useful to convert LaTeX output to image formats for use in systems that do not support DVI nor PDF files, such as Wikipedia.

There is two family of graphics:
* Vector graphics can be scaled to any size, thus do not suffer from quality loss. [[w:Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] is a vector format.
* Raster graphics define every pixel explicitly. [[w:PNG|PNG]] is a raster format.

So vector graphics are usually preferred. There is still some cases where raster graphics are used:
* The target system does not handle vector graphics, only raster graphics are supported.
* SVG can not embed fonts. So either the font will be rendered using a local .ttf or .otf font (which will mostly change the output), or  all characters must be turned to vector graphics. This last method makes the SVG big and slow. If the input LaTeX file contains a lot of text which formatting must be preserved, SVG is not that great.

So SVG is great for drawings and a small amount of text.
JPG is a well known raster formats, however it is usually not as good as PNG for text.

In some cases it may be sufficient to simply copy a region of a PDF (or PS) file using the tools available in a PDF viewer (for example using LaTeX to typeset a formula for pasting into a presentation).  This however will not generally have sufficient resolution for whole pages or large areas. 

=== Multiple formats ===

;pdftocairo
There is &lt;tt&gt;pdftocairo&lt;/tt&gt; featured in the poppler toolset.
 pdftocairo -svg latexdoc.pdf output.svg
&lt;tt&gt;pdftocairo&lt;/tt&gt; also supports various raster graphic formats.

=== Vector graphics ===

;pdf2svg
Direct conversion from PDF to SVG can be done using the command line tool [http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/ pdf2svg].
 pdf2svg file.pdf file.svg

;ps2svg
Alternatively DVI or PDF can be converted to PS as described before, then the bash script [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Electronics/Ps2svg.sh ps2svg.sh] can be used (as all the software used by this script is multiplatform, this is also possible in Windows, a step-by-step guide could be written).

;dvisvgm
One can also use [http://dvisvgm.sourceforge.net/ dvisvgm], an open source utility that converts from DVI to SVG.

;Inkscape
Inkscape is able to convert to SVG, PDF, EPS, and other vector graphic formats.
 inkscape --export-area-drawing --export-ps=OUTPUT INPUT
 inkscape --export-area-page --export-plain-svg=OUTPUT INPUT

=== Raster graphics ===

;GIMP
Open your file with [[GIMP]]. It will ask you which page you want to convert, whether you want to use anti-aliasing (choose ''strong'' if you want to get something similar to what you see on the screen). Try different resolutions to fit your needs, but 100 dpi should be enough. Once you have the image within GIMP, you can post-process it as you like and save it to any format supported by GIMP, as PNG for example.

;dvipng
A method for DVI files is [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/ dvipng]. Usage is the same as &lt;tt&gt;dvipdfm&lt;/tt&gt;.

Run &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; as usual to generate the dvi file. Now, we want an X font size formula, where X is measure in pixels. You need to convert this, to dots per inch (dpi). The formula is: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;dpi&gt; = &lt;font_px&gt;*72.27/10&lt;/tt&gt;. If you want, for instance, X = 32, then the size in dpi corresponds to 231.26. This value will be passed to &lt;tt&gt;dvipng&lt;/tt&gt; using the flag &lt;tt&gt;-D&lt;/tt&gt;. To generate the desired png file run the command as follows: 

 dvipng -T tight -D 231.26 -o foo.png foo.dvi

The flag &lt;tt&gt;-T&lt;/tt&gt; sets the size of the image. The option &lt;tt&gt;tight&lt;/tt&gt; will only include all ink put on the page. The option &lt;tt&gt;-o&lt;/tt&gt; sends the output to the file name &lt;tt&gt;foo.png&lt;/tt&gt;.

;ImageMagick
The &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; command from the [http://www.imagemagick.org/ ImageMagick] suite can convert both DVI and PDF files to PNG.
 convert input.pdf output.png

;optipng
You can optimize the resulting image using [http://optipng.sourceforge.net/ optipng] so that it will take up less space.

==Convert to plain text==

If you are thinking of converting to plain text for spell-checking or to count words, there may be an easier way -- read [[LaTeX/Tips and Tricks#Spell-checking and Word Counting|Tips and Tricks]] first.

Most LaTeX distributions come with &lt;tt&gt;detex&lt;/tt&gt; program, which strips LaTeX commands. It can handle multi-file projects, so all you need is to give one command:
 detex yourfile
(note the omission of .tex extension). This will output result to standard output. If you want the plain text go to a file, use
 detex yourfile &gt; yourfile.txt

If the output from &lt;tt&gt;detex&lt;/tt&gt; does not satisfy you, you can try a newer version available on [http://code.google.com/p/opendetex/ Google Code], or use HTML conversion first and then copy text from your browser.

If you want to keep the formating, you can use a ''DVI-to-plain text'' converter, like &lt;tt&gt;catdvi&lt;/tt&gt;. Example:
 catdvi yourfile.dvi | fmt -u
The use of ''fmt -u'' (available on most Unices) will remove the justification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cells are the base units of organisms, some organisms are unicellular (they only consist of one cell), others, like humans, are multicellular (consist of many cells). In humans, similar cells are grouped together into tissues which perform a particular function, different tissues are joined together into organs to complete a more complicated function, and organs are arrangned into interdependant organ systems which together form an organism.

Cells themselves can be divided into two types, prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotes have no nucleus (pro is the ancient Greek for 'before' and karyote for 'nucleus), eukaryotic cells do have a nucleus (eu is ancient Greek for 'true' or 'good'). There are other differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well, such as eukaryotes are much bigger, have membrane bound organelles and linear DNA, prokaryotes are smaller, they don't have membrane bound organelles and their DNA is circular (and not contained in a nucleus). 

Organelles.
Eukaryotic cells contain membrane bound organelles, such and a nucleus and mitochondria 
(singular = mitochondrion. You need to know what some of these organelles look like and what their function is. 

Mitochondria.
These are the energy producers of the cell, they produce ATP, which is used by cells to release energy. They have a double membrane, the one on the insided is folded to provide a large surface area.

* Explain the steps taken in scientific methods. 
* Compare and contrast scientific variables and constants. 
* Explain how a control is used during an experiment. 
* Vocabulary: scientific methods, observation, inference, hypothesis, independent variable, dependent variable, constant, and control.

=Scientific Methods=
Several steps were taken to learn about the pottery found at York Middle School. When the pottery was found, a decision was made to stop construction at the site. One adult guessed that the pottery was old. An expert was called to verify the guess made about the pottery. Based on prior knowledge and further testing, it was concluded that the pottery was from a prehistoric culture. 

Think about the last time you had a problem that took several steps or actions to solve. Step-by-step procedures of scientific problem solving are called '''[[The Scientific Method|scientific methods]]'''. Solving any problem scientifically involves several steps. The steps used can vary from situation to situation and aren’t always done in the same order. But for now, take a look at each step in turn.

=Recognize the Problem=
Ben thought about all the science he had learned over the past few months. He was eager to find out more about the world around him. As he looked around his bedroom, he wondered what he could explore. It was then that Ben noticed that the plant on his windowsill was droopy. He quickly watered the wilting plant. Later in the day, Ben observed that the droopy plant had perked up. He concluded that he should water the plant on a regular basis. Every day after school, he watered the plant in his room. 

After a few weeks, Ben noticed that the leaves on his plant had turned yellow and brown. He knew from science class that plants need water, so why was this plant not doing well. He talked to his teacher about the plant. She suggested that Ben use what he learned in science class to solve his problem. She pointed out that this problem might make a good project for the upcoming science fair. 

Ben already has completed the first step in using a scientific approach to solving a problem - he recognizes a problem. A scientific problem is simply a question you don’t know the answer to. To solve his problem, Ben must do research about his plant. Using sources of information, Ben identified his plant as a fig. In his Science Journal, he drew a picture of the plant and listed some facts about it. 

{{info|Gathering information in the library or on the Internet can make your problem-solving tasks easier.}}

==Observe==
In order for Ben to be able to answer the question about why his plant was not thriving, he needed to plan and carry out an experiment. First, he made and recorded careful observations about his plant. Observations can be bits of information you gather with your senses. Most scientific observations are made with your eyes and ears. You also can observe with your senses of touch, taste, and smell. Ben observed that many of the leaves had fallen off his plant. The stem, in places, was peeling. Ben also noticed that some white, powdery, smelly stuff was covering the soil in the pot. He stuck his finger into the soil. It was wet.

==Infer==
Observations like Ben’s often lead to inferences. An inference is a conclusion about an observation. Ben inferred that perhaps he was watering his plant too often. Can you make any other inferences about why Ben’s plant wasn’t thriving?

=Form a Hypothesis=
After a problem is identified, a scientist might make a hypothesis. A '''hypothesis''' is a statement that can be tested. Hypotheses are based on observations, research, and prior knowledge of a problem. Sometimes more than one hypothesis can be developed. 

Example 1 compares and contrasts hypotheses with two other scientific statements - scientific theories and scientific laws. Ben decided to use his inference about watering too often as his hypothesis. His hypothesis was the following: Fig plants grow best when they are watered only once a week. 

* Example 1
** Hypothesis: A hypothesis is a statement that is tested with experiments. Hypotheses supported by repeated tests are used to form theories. 
** Theory: A theory is an explanation supported by results of many experiments. Theories attempt to explain why something happens.

=Test Your Hypothesis=
To test his hypothesis, Ben will carry out an experiment using three plants. An experimental investigation is a series of carefully planned steps used to test a hypothesis. In any experiment, it’s important to carefully consider what resources you will use and how you can take steps to prevent wasting those resources. It’s also important to keep everything the same except for the item or variable you are testing so that you’ll know which variable caused the results. The one factor that you change in an experiment is called the '''independent variable'''. 

In Ben’s proposed experiment, the independent variable is the number of times he waters each plant in a week. He then will observe how well each plant grows based on the amount of water it receives. The growth of the plants is the dependent variable in Ben’s experiment. A '''dependent variable''' is the factor, or outcome, that will be measured in an experiment. 

{{info|The amount of water added to the plants is the independent variable in this experiment.}}

==Plan the Experiment==
In order to test only one variable at a time, scientists often use constants. '''Constants''' are factors in an experiment that stay the same. In his experiment, Ben will use the same species and size of plants, which will be potted with the same kinds and amounts of soil. His teacher pointed out that Ben also must put his plants into identical containers. Another constant in Ben’s experiment will be the amount of light each plant will get. 

Experimental investigations also have a control. A '''control''' is a standard used for comparison. Ben knows that all plants, even cacti, need water. His control will be that one of the plants receives no water during the experiment.

==Do the Experiment==
Ben gathered all the materials he would need to test his hypothesis. Before he started, Ben knew from Ms. Garcia’s labs that he must write down a plan to follow. In his Science Journal, he wrote that he would use three fig plants. Plant A would not be watered. This would be his control. A second fig plant, Plant B, would get watered every day. The third fig plant, Plant C, would get watered only once each week. His experiment would last one month. 

Ben then made a table in which to record his observations. He listed each plant and the number of times it was to get watered. Ben made room in the table for his measurements. He also made a plan to record his observations, which would include the height of each plant, the color of its leaves, and the number of leaves it dropped, if any.

=Analyze Your Data=
Data are collected during any scientific study. Some data are numeric values such as the length of an object or the temperature of a liquid. Other data you collect may include observations that use adjectives and phrases such as “faster”, “smaller”, “not as well as”, and “greener”. An experimenter must record and study the data collected before he or she can draw conclusions about an experiment. 

{{info|Observations and other data taken during an experiment must be logged carefully so that they are analyzed and interpreted properly later.}}

By the end of the month, Ben observed that the leaves still left on the plant that received no water were brown and shriveled. It had lost most of its leaves. The plant that was watered every day had a few leaves left on its branches, but these leaves didn’t look too healthy. A white, smelly substance covered the soil. Ben noticed that the plant that was watered once each week had grown the tallest. Many healthy green-and-white leaves hung from its branches.

=Draw Conclusions and Communicate=
After studying his data, Ben was ready to draw some conclusions. A conclusion is a statement based on what was observed. Ben concluded that not watering a plant causes the leaves to dry out and die. Watering a plant too much also causes the leaves to die. Watering the plant once a week seems to be the best schedule, of those tested, for a fig plant. 

Ben told his teacher about his results. She reminded him that in order to make sure his conclusions were valid, he should repeat his experiment. Ben agreed and did the same experiment again. Based on the results of his second experiment, Ben was able to conclude confidently that watering a fig plant once a week made it grow well in the conditions he used. His hypothesis was supported. An important step in the scientific process is to communicate the results of an investigation. Ben entered his project in his school’s science fair. He seemed to have won the science fair with his project and his teacher congratulated him and he thanked her for her help.{{info|When results of experiments are communicated, other researchers can determine what to do next to help solve a problem.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
The System Administration module controls data and tables that are used by more than one module.  Typically, this data tailors the ERP to a particular enterprise.  System Administration sets up new companies as well as user names, passwords and access to ERP data and functions.  It starts up and shuts down the ERP, archives old data, backs up and restores data, and monitors performance. An example of multi-module data is the company name and address.  Every ERP has a Systems Administration module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Tables ==
The first group of tables consists of the User table which contains one record for every user and the User Access table which contains one record for every function the user can perform.  There is at least one access record for every user and there can be many.
==Data Exchange==
Systems Administration does not send or receive transactions to/from other modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Every business sells products and/or services to its customers.  Order Entry creates invoices when a customer orders something and Accounts Receivable keeps track of what payments have been made to which invoices.  Commonly, it also prepares a report (&quot;Aged Analysis&quot;) which shows how long each invoice has been outstanding.  Every ERP has an Accounts Receivable module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]
== Collection ==
If Accounts Receivable invoices become overdue, Collection initiates processes to collect the money.  Usually this means a telephone call followed by a series of dunning letters of increasing severity.  If these efforts fail, Legal may become involved or the invoice may be written off, or sold to a collection agency for a fraction of its face value.  As part of CRM, details of each contact with the customer including date, employee, contact person, and activity are stored in Customer.

== Self-service ==
Customers can see their invoices, checks, and basic information via the web and update some portions of it (name, address, and contact information for example).

== Tables ==
There are two major groups of tables in Accounts Receivable.  The first consists of the Customer table which contains one record for every customer and the Customer Contact table which contains one record for every contact at each customer.  There is at least one contact record for every customer and there can be several.  The second group consists of the Invoice table which contains one record for every customer invoice and the Invoice Detail table which contains one record for every line on the customer invoice.  There is at least one detail record for every invoice and there can be many.
==Data Exchange==
Accounts Receivable receives invoices from Order Entry/Invoicing and sends transactions to Bank Reconciliation and General Ledger.

==Transactions==
The first transaction records an invoice.  This is done by Order Entry/Invoicing rather than Accounts Receivable.

The second transaction records a customer payment.  One customer payment can pay one or more invoices.  Payment can be in cash, by debit card, credit card, or check.  Sometimes payments are received without information about what invoices are being paid.

The vast majority of the module's transactions consist of the above two.  The third fundamental transaction is that of adjustment when things go wrong.  We will document this later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Every enterprise has at least one bank account.  Enterprises can have several accounts in different currencies at different banks.  Most enterprises make a daily bank deposit.  This consists of the checks the enterprise has received plus any cash or credit/debit card receipts.  Periodically (depending on the account activity), the enterprise receives a bank statement for each account it has.  Statements can be received electronically or in the mail.  Bank Reconciliation assists the enterprise in reconciling the balance shown on the bank statement with the amount shown in the corresponding General Ledger cash accounts.  This involves flagging Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and Payroll checks as cleared, flagging deposits as recorded, and entering service charges and other miscellaneous debits and credits.  Bank Reconciliation also handles non-AR deposits such as owner investment.  Every ERP has a Bank Reconciliation module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]
== Tables ==
The first table is the Bank Account table which contains one record for every bank account. The second table is the Transaction table which contains one record for every bank transaction (check, deposit, interest, service charge, adjustment).

== Transactions ==
*The first type of transaction is a check drawn on the account.
*The second type of transaction is a deposit made to the account.
*The third type of transaction is a service charge made by the bank.
*The fourth type of transaction is interest paid into the account by the bank.
*The fifth type of transaction is a transfer of funds from one account to another.
*The last transaction records miscellaneous adjustments made to the account.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Cash Management tracks the cash the business will be receiving from customer payments in Accounts Receivable against the cash the business will be spending through Accounts Payable, Purchasing (a promise to spend), Payroll, bond interest, and stock dividends.  It prepares a cash forecast week by week to allow businesses to anticipate cash shortages.  Many low-end ERP packages do not have a Cash Management module.

== Tables ==
Cash Management is unique in that it has no tables of its own.  It uses tables from other modules to create its forecast.

Contacts keeps track of the names and addresses of everyone the enterprise has dealings with who isn't a customer, supplier, or employee.  In addition to the usual information, Contacts often keeps personal information such as birthday on the contact.  Most of these names and addresses are leads or prospects from Sales &amp; Marketing.  Normally, Contacts keeps track of every meeting anyone from the enterprise has with the contact including meetings scheduled for the future.  Every ERP has a Contacts module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A &quot;fixed asset&quot; is something the enterprise has purchased that has a useful life of more than one year.  Fixed Assets keeps track of all these objects and allocates part of their purchase price to each year of their life.  There are a variety of ways in which this allocation can be done.  For some assets, the allocation or &quot;depreciation&quot; is specified by law.  Not all ERP packages have a Fixed Assets module.

== Tables ==
The first table is the Fixed Asset table which contains one record for every fixed asset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
General Ledger produces the enterprise’s financial statements including the Balance Sheet, which shows the enterprise’s assets, liabilities and equity at a point in time, the Income Statement, which shows the enterprise’s income, expenses and net profit over a period of time, the Cash Flow Statement which shows sources and applications of cash, and associated financial reports such as the Trial Balance.  The rest of the reports are there to track the numbers on the financial statements back to individual transactions.  Most businesses prepare monthly statements.  Every ERP package has a General Ledger module.

General Ledger is unusual in that it receives transactions from '''many''' other modules.  There are two ways to accomplish this: Detail and Summarized.  In the detail method, every invoice, check, or other such transaction creates a separate General Ledger transaction.  The advantage of this is that the General Ledger is continuously updated in real time so the entire set of ERP tables is in sync.  The disadvantage is that there are large numbers of transactions.  In the summarized method, transactions are accumulated for some period (typically a day) and posted in summary.  Instead of many small transactions, there is a few big ones.  The advantage is that there are far fewer transactions. The disadvantage is that the General Ledger is out of sync with the rest of the ERP until the data is posted.  This ERP described in this document uses the detailed method.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Tables ==
The first table is the Chart of Accounts table which contains one record for every General Ledger account.  The second table is the Account Balance table which contains the closing balance for every account for one or more accounting periods.  The third table is the Budget table which contains one or more budget amounts for each account for each accounting period.  The fourth table is the Transaction table which contains one record for every transaction (debit, credit).  There is at least one transaction for every account and there can be many.

==Data Exchange==
General Ledger receives transactions from Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Bank Reconciliation, Fixed Assets, Inventory, Job Costing, Order Entry/Invoicing, Payroll, Purchasing (sometimes).

==Transactions==
General Ledger has only one transaction.  It consists of one or more debits and one or more credits where the total of the debits equals the total of the credits.

Human Resources handles all aspects of managing employees except for paying them, which is done by Payroll.  It oversees recruitment and hiring, records attendance, handles training, manages benefits, handles compliance with government regulations and ensures terminations are handled properly.  Like Payroll, Human Resources is often very country-specific.  Only high-end ERP packages have a Human Resources module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Businesses maintain stocks of items for sale to customers or for inclusion (&quot;raw materials&quot;) in the manufacturing of new items (&quot;finished goods&quot;).  Inventory ties up a lot of money in most businesses.  The Inventory module's job is to minimize the amount of money tied up in Inventory without running out and being unable to fill customer orders.  Every ERP package has an Inventory module.

Inventory analysis analyzes inventory items by category, supplier, product ID, date, etc. and combinations thereof.  The Analysis function selects, sorts, and summarizes these transactions and presents them in numeric and graphic forms.  It supports both pre-defined and ad hoc queries.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Tables ==
The first table is the Item table which contains one record for every inventory item. Each Inventory item includes costing, purchasing, and location information (items can be stocked at more than one warehouse and more than one location within a warehouse).  The second table is the Transaction table which contains one record for every transaction (receipt, issue, count, adjustment).  There is at least one transaction for every item and there can be many.

Inventory Analysis has a separate, read-only table that is optimized for quick access.  Each record in the sales analysis table represents an item receipt. The table is updated once a day.

==Data Exchange==
Inventory receives data from Purchasing and Accounts Payable and sends transaction to General Ledger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Sometimes, the item sold requires days or weeks to create.  During the process, job costing  tracks actual costs, compares them to planned costs, and displays the resulting variances in the form of reports and graphs.  Costs are divided into the following categories: Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Sub-contract, and Overhead (or Burden).  This allows management to keep track of costs relative to the percentage the job is complete.  Every ERP package has a Job Costing module.

== Tables ==
The first table is the Job table which contains one record for every job. The second table is the Transaction table which contains one record for every transaction (labor, materials, sub-contract, adjustment).  There is at least one transaction for every job and there can be many
==Data Exchange==
Job Costing sends transactions to General Ledger and Payroll.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some businesses build their products from parts and raw materials.  These products can range from the assembly of a few standard parts to products with thousands of parts requiring weeks of engineering.  Manufacturing (which is actually a group of sub-modules) controls the process by which this is done.  Not every ERP package has a Manufacturing module although all the large ones do.

Manufacturing is divided into discrete and process manufacturing.  Discrete manufacturers make solid items such as flashlights or cars using Bills of Material.  Process manufacturers make liquids or chemicals using formulas or recipes.  Manufacturing can also be divided into Make-To-Stock or Make/Engineer-To-Order.

Manufacturing has a [[/Maintain Module Information | Maintain Module Information]] function that handles the parameters and data tables for the sub-modules.

Here is an incomplete list of the sub-modules in Manufacturing:
*[[/Bill of Materials | Bill of Materials]]
*[[/Master Production Schedule | Master Production Schedule]]
*[[/Advanced Planning and Scheduling | Advanced Planning and Scheduling]]
*[[/Shop Floor Control | Shop Floor Control]]
*[[/Quality | Quality]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Customers place orders for products and/or services with the enterprise.  Orders can be placed in person, via telephone, mail, fax, e-mail or electronically (see below).  If there is a delay between the placing of the order and its fulfillment (for example, if the ordered items have to be picked from Inventory and shipped), Order Entry/Invoicing creates a sales order.  Otherwise, the record of this is an invoice.  Invoices can be given to the customer at the time of purchase, or mailed, faxed, e-mailed or sent electronically after the goods have been picked, packaged and shipped.  Order Entry/Invoicing is usually high-volume and mission-critical in for-profit enterprises.  Every ERP package has an Order Entry/Invoicing module.  Often, this module has custom processing.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== EDI/XML ==
Orders can be received electronically through EDI or XML.  (I will get back to explaining this)
== Web Store ==
Many companies allow customers to order directly from their website.  This creates an invoice automatically.
== Point of Sale (POS) ==
Most retail companies use POS in which a scanner reads a Universal Product Code (UPC) attached to the item to create a line on the order invoice.
== Configuration ==
Some enterprises have products or services that are highly configurable or routinely customized to meet customer needs.  Using user-defined rules, Configurator conducts a dialog with the user and generates literature, drawings, and bills of material.  Order Entry/Invoicing and Quotation/Estimate use Configurator.  Inventory items can be flagged as configurable.  The details of the options selected are recorded in the invoice often for use by manufacturing.
== Tables ==
Order Entry/Invoicing shares the Customer and Invoice groups of tables with Accounts Receivable. It alone controls the Sales Order tables.

==Data Exchange==
Order Entry/Invoicing sends transactions to Inventory, General Ledger and Accounts Receivable.  It can use Quotation/Estimation data to create invoices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A Purchase Order authorizes a supplier to ship products to or perform services for the enterprise and invoice them for it.  In some enterprises, the purchasing cycle starts with a purchase requisition, which is a request to Purchasing to locate a supplier and issue a purchase order.  It is similar to a purchase order except that it does not stipulate a supplier although it can recommend one.  It is Purchasing’s job to find a suitable supplier.  For large enterprises, this is the start of the Procure To Pay process.  Purchasing is the first step in the supply chain, Accounts Payable is the last.

Since a purchase order is a promise to pay, issuing one creates an encumbrance, which becomes a liability when the supplier’s invoice is received.

In manufacturing enterprises, Purchase Orders can be created automatically as part of Advanced Planning and Scheduling.  For new goods or services or in the case of a competitive requote, RFQs or RFPs are sent to potential suppliers.  When the goods are received, they are processed through Receiving which matches them against the original Purchase Order and records missing or partially shipped items.  When the invoice is received, it is matched against the Purchase Order to find any discrepancies in prices.  Purchasing interacts with Inventory (increases on-order quantities), Accounts Payable (verify pricing), Receiving (verify quality and quantity), and Shop Floor Control (create planned Purchase Orders).  

The two main Purchasing objectives are to: 1) obtain the best price from suppliers for goods or services of acceptable quality and 2) expedite the delivery of goods so that shipments to customers are not delayed.

Purchase analysis analyzes purchases of goods and services by category, supplier, product ID, buyer, department, date, etc. and combinations thereof.  The Analysis function selects, sorts, and summarizes these transactions and presents them in numeric and graphic forms.  It supports both pre-defined and ad hoc queries using a separate, read-only database that is optimized for quick access.  Each record in the database represents a line on a purchase order.

There have to be both Purchase Analysis and Inventory Analysis since some enterprises do not maintain inventory and most enterprises buy additional goods or services that do not enter inventory.  Every ERP package has a Purchasing module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== EDI/XML ==
Purchase Orders can be delivered electronically through EDI or XML.  (I will get back to explaining this)
== Tables ==
Purchasing shares the Supplier group of tables with Accounts Payable.  The second group consists of the Purchase Order table which contains one record for every purchase order and the Purchase Order Detail table which contains one record for every line on the purchase order.  There is at least one detail record for every purchase order and there can be many.
==Data Exchange==
Purchasing sends data to Inventory and transactions to General Ledger.
== Transactions ==
Different types of transactions in Purchasing are
1) Purchase order creation and approval
2) Communication of Purchase order to Supplier
3) Changes to Purchase Order
4) Shipping of goods by Supplier
5) Receipt of goods
6) Quality check / Returns to Supplier

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A Quote/Estimate is an offer to provide specified goods and/or services to a potential customer at a specified price.  If the document is an “Estimate”, the enterprise is not bound by the prices.  If the document is a “Quotation”, the enterprise is bound for a user-defined length of time to the prices.  Quote/Estimate is very similar to Order Processing.  The entry screens, tables, and output documents are similar.  It records the details of the quote/estimate in the database and produces a document that is sent to the potential customer.  A Quote/Estimate can have an arbitrary number of documents associated with it.  Such a document is usually referred to as a “proposal”.  Assuming the potential customer eventually accepts the Quotation or Estimate, the ERP uses the information in it to generate the invoice.  Not all ERP packages have a Quotation/Estimation module.

== Overview ==

'''''Dittany''''' is a plant that was spoken of in the reference ''One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi''. In this passage it is said that many believe dittany to have magical powers.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Dittany is first mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], on his Easter holiday, looking it up as part of his studying. No mention of its properties or uses are made at this time.

Not much mention is made of Dittany until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. There, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] curse on Malfoy, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] says that he will use Dittany on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]]'s closed wounds to avoid scarring.

Dittany is used extensively on wounds in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], starting with the occasion when Ron loses a piece of his arm through being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Splinched]].

== Analysis ==

Dittany is a real herb; the name refers to two different species, White Dittany ''Dictamnus albus'' and Dittany of Crete ''Origanum dictamnus''. Both plants have medicinal value against digestive ills, and White Dittany also secretes an oil which has some anti-inflammatory properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Most businesses do repair and maintenance work on the products they sell.  If the work is done under warranty, there is no charge to the customer.  Service Management schedules on-site and depot service, defines product warranties, handles service contracts, and controls whether there are charges.  Contrast this with Preventative Maintenance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page presents a proof that the resistance of a [[Practical_Electronics/Glossary#Series|series]] network, ''R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''n'' resistors is the sum of the resistance of each resistor in the network:

[[Image:Resistors in Series.svg|centre]]

First, consider that a voltage across the whole network must be equal to the sum of the voltages across each resistor ([[Practical_Electronics/Basic Theory/KVL|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]]).

::&lt;math&gt;v_{tot}  = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {v_k },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage across the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor in the network. Now, from [[Practical_Electronics/Basic Theory/Ohm's Law|Ohm's Law]], we can write:

::&lt;math&gt;i_{tot} R_{tot}  = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {i_k R_k },&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''i&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current through the entire network
*''R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the resistance of the entire network
*''i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current in the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor in the network
*''R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the resistance of the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor in the network

Since from [[Practical_Electronics/Basic Theory/KCL|Kirchhoff's Current Law]] we know that the current in each resistor is the same, we can write

::&lt;math&gt;iR_{tot}  = i\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {R_k },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the current through the network. Dividing through by ''i'' gives us our final answer:

::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}  = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {R_k}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a vital result and should be remembered. Notice that the [[Practical_Electronics/Resistors/Parallel Proof|proof for parallel networks]] is essentially the same, but uses KCL first and KVL second.

Other interesting points are that this result describes behaviour of [[Capacitors/Parallel_Proof|parallel capacitive networks]] and [[Inductors/Series_Proof|series inductive networks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page contains a variety of topics that do not easily fit in the other areas of this document.
== Security ==
Users log in to a company using a username and password.  This establishes the data they can see and the functions they can perform.  This authorization step is in addition to any log in required by the operating system.  To improve security, both the username and the password are encrypted when they are stored in the User table.  If the operating system provides file encryption, all data is encrypted.  If it doesn't the ERP does the encryption itself.

== Alerts ==
The ERP users define what is routine.  When this routine is broken or action is required, the ERP notifies designated users via e-mail (or an instant message if they are on-line) so they can take corrective action. This function occurs in virtually all modules so it is documented here rather than repeatedly.

== Design ==
'''Number''' There are fields such as Item Number, Supplier Number, Customer Number, Employee Number, Job Number, etc. that must be unique.  Either the users can assign meaningful alphanumeric identifiers or the ERP can assign unique numbers automatically.  Only Transaction Numbers are restricted to numbers and always assigned by the ERP.

'''Reporting'''  
Reports can be printed, displayed on the screen, faxed or e-mailed to someone, or exported as a spreadsheet.  Some documents such as purchase orders and invoices can also be delivered (and received) electronically.

'''Attachments''' 
Arbitrarily large text notes as well as images, word processing documents, spreadsheets and video files can be attached to every employee, customer, supplier, invoice, order, etc. so that users can store comments and knowledge on-line rather than keeping paper files.  For example, a user can scan a supplier’s invoice and attach it to the Accounts Payable invoice record so that everyone can see a copy of the original invoice.

'''History'''
An ERP allows unlimited history to be kept on-line.  For performance reasons, this is kept in a separate set of tables from ordinary transactions but this is transparent to users.  Periodically (typically once a day), the oldest transactions are transferred to history.  The enterprise decides how much history of each type of data they want to keep on file.  Typically, this is at least the current year and the previous year.

'''Real Time''' 
An ERP accepts a transaction and updates all related modules in near real-time.  (Typically, this means only a few seconds elapses between entry and final updates).

'''Drill Down''' 
Summary reports allow the user to click on a total to reveal the detail transactions that make up the summarized number.

'''System Builder''' 
An ERP allows the enterprise to specify several dozen criteria and generates a working system customized to their requirements.  For example, some enterprises call their customers “clients”, “patients”, “guests”, or “members”, and their suppliers “vendors”.  These criteria do not change any logic but make the system more familiar to their users.  Another example is that not every enterprise uses every module so menus can be customized to remove modules and functions that are not being used.

==Multi-currency ==
This means the ability to handle more than one currency.  Often this is offered as if it is a separate module but it affects any module that includes dollar amounts which is virtually all of them.  The ERP package has a defined set of currencies with conversion rates between them.

== Internationalization ==
This refers to the ability to run in more than one country.  Obviously, this includes multiple languages but it also includes different calendar systems and different ways of displaying dates and numeric amounts.

=== Currency ===
An ERP can accommodate a defined set of currencies, has conversion rates between them, and can recognize gains and losses on exchange.  European nations have special needs because they are required to accept payment in either their national currency or the Euro regardless of what currency the invoice was issued in.  Field sizes can change depending on the currency (for example the Japanese Yen and the Italian lire are tiny and field amounts are corresponding bigger but have no decimal places).

Different currencies require different symbols.  In North America, the currency symbol is displayed immediately to the left of the most significant digit.  In other countries, it is displayed immediately to the ''right'' of the ''least'' significant digit.

=== Digit Separator ===
In many countries, the function of “,” (comma) and “.” (period) are reversed from the North American convention.  In other countries, different characters are used.  For example, Switzerland uses “!” and India used different spacing (three digits for the first thousand and two digits thereafter).  Japan uses a different ideograph between every four digits.

=== Rounding Rules ===
In North America, if the last digit is less than five, we drop it and the rest of the digits.  If it is above five, we add one to the next digit to the left and drop the rest of the digits.  If it is equal to five, 50% of the time, we follow rule one and the rest of the time, we follow rule two.  In other countries, the rounding rules are different.

=== Language ===
An ERP can serve users in their own language simultaneously (user A can be using English, user B Spanish simultaneously).  This can have implications for the size of messages and captions as well as the direction in which they are displayed (English reads top to bottom and left to right, other languages read right to left or top to bottom in columns).  Ideographic languages such as Japanese had tens of thousands of ideographs rather than a couple of dozen letters.

=== Calendar ===
There are several calendars in use in the world in addition to the Gregorian calendar used in North America and Europe.  Islamic countries can use the calendar with 28-day months as prescribed in the Qur’an.  In Japan, dates can be displayed at the year of the current emperor’s reign.  In Israel, the official calendar is the Hebrew one.  In addition, the sequence in which days, months, and years are displayed varies from one locale to another.  In Europe, dates are commonly displayed in the format year/month/day.  In North America, they are normally displayed month/day/year.  Although dates are stored in a standard format, they must be converted to and from the local calendar for data entry and display.  If the enterprise deals with people’s birth dates or projected date of death, dates can occasionally be over 100 years in the past or the future.  Some commercial leases can be up to 99 years long.  If the enterprise deals with artwork or antiquities, dates can be an arbitrary number of years in the past.

== Web-enabled ==
Any function that a user can do at a desktop can be done via a browser.  The same log in is required.

== Multi-company ==
This means the ability to have several different companies with one set of the software, Although the companies may be owned by the same people, they have different sets of tables with different passwords and access codes.

== User Defined Fields (UDF) ==
Most records contain additional fields that the enterprise can use to hold information specific to them.  These fields consists of dates, text and numbers.  In addition to the fields in the records, there is a parameter that holds the name of the UDF.  For purposes of simplicity and clarity, UDFs are omitted from the table definitions.  Typically, the UDFs include a date, an amount, and a text field.

== Comments ==
Master, header and line records allow the addition of comments.  These have the format:
*Date
*Text

For the purposes of simplicity and clarity, these tables are not defined separately.

== Attachments ==
Master, header and line records allow documents and drawings to be attached.  The purpose of this is to allow all information relating to the invoice, etc. on-line.  For purposes of simplicity and clarity, these fields are not defined separately.

== Segmented Keys ==
Keys such as Customer Number, Supplier Number, Item Number, Account Number, and Employee Number are often divided into two or more segments each of which can be of specified length and composition (numeric, alphabetic, etc.).  For example Account Number often has the format xxxx-xx in which the first set of four digits is the major account (such as Rent) and the second set of two digits is the department or branch.

== Batches ==
Some enterprises gather many transactions together and enter them as a batch.  Commonly a unique number is assigned to the batch and a control total of some amount (such as invoice amount) is calculated independently to verify that all the transactions were entered correctly.  Batches are most common in Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and General Ledger.

== Databases ==
Smaller ERPs often restrict themselves to a single database such as Microsoft's SQL Server.  Larger ERPs tend to run on all of the popular databases include SQL Server, Oracle, and IBM's DB/2.

== Platforms ==
Smaller ERPs often restrict themselves to a single operating system such as Microsoft's Windows.  Larger ERPs tend to run on all of the common operating systems.

== Data Import/Cleanup ==
For small amounts of data (hundreds of records), it is simpler to key in the data to the new system.  For larger amounts of data, the data must be imported from the previous system.  This cannot be entirely automated but the skeleton of the programs that import the data are commonly supplied as part of the ERP package.  Commonly companies clean up their data (customers, suppliers, inventory items) before they move it to the new systems

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page presents a proof that the resistance of a [[Practical_Electronics/Glossary#Parallel|parallel]] network, ''R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''n'' resistors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors:

[[Image:Resistors in Parallel.svg|centre]]

First, consider that a current into (and out of) the whole network, ''i&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'', must be equal to the sum of the currents in each resistor ([[Practical_Electronics/Basic Theory/KCL|Kirchhoff's Current Law]]).

::&lt;math&gt;i_{tot}  = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {i_k },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current in the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor in the network. Now, from [[Practical_Electronics/Basic Theory/Ohm's Law|Ohm's Law]], we can write:

::&lt;math&gt;{{v_{tot} } \over {R_{tot} }} = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {{{v_k } \over {R_k }}},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''v&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage across the entire network
*''R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the resistance of the entire network
*''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage across the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor in the network
*''R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the resistance of the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor in the network

Since we know that the voltage across each resistor is the same (a trivial case of [[Practical_Electronics/Basic Theory/KVL|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]]), we can say

::&lt;math&gt;{{v} \over {R_{tot} }} = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {{{v} \over {R_k }}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the voltage across the network. Dividing through by ''v'' gives us our final answer:

::&lt;math&gt;{{1} \over {R_{tot} }} = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {{{1} \over {R_k }}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is also sometimes equivalently written as:

::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}  = {1 \over {\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {{1 \over {R_k }}} }}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a vital result and should be remembered. Notice that the [[Practical_Electronics/Resistors/Series Proof|proof for series networks]] is essentially the same, but uses KCL first and KVL second.

Other interesting points are that this result describes behaviour of [[Capacitors/Series_Proof|series capacitive networks]] and [[Inductors/Parallel_Proof|parallel inductive networks]].

# Place a soup pot or [[Cookbook:Dutch Oven|Dutch Oven]] over medium heat and wait for about a minute. Add olive oil and swirl to coat the pan.
# Add onion and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] over medium heat for about 5 to 8 minutes, or until onion is translucent.
# Add half the garlic plus the potato, carrot, and celery and about ⅛ teaspoon salt, and sauté over medium-low heat for 5 to 8 minutes.
# Add garbanzo purée, plus remaining broth and/or water and garbanzo beans, and the bay leaf, mustard, cumin, and saffron.
# Bring to boil, then lower the heat. 
# Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
# Stir in the remaining garlic, plus the peas, vinegar, and tomato.
# Taste to correct salt.
# Add black pepper and cayenne.
# Simmer for only about 5 minutes longer.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Serve topped with minced fresh basil.
* Serve with a green salad decked out with a mustard-themed dressing, thick slices of pumpernickel bread, and a light Pinot Noir.
* Vegetable broth comes in 1 [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] boxed in most supermarkets. Choose a [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] one if your require, or make your own [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=ASCII|next=Ruby basics}}

Like [[w:Smalltalk|Smalltalk]], Ruby is a pure object-oriented language &amp;mdash; everything is an object. In contrast, languages such as [[w:C++ (programming language)|C++]] and [[w:Java (programming language)|Java]] are hybrid languages that divide the world between objects and [[w:primitive types|primitive types]]. The hybrid approach results in better performance for some applications, but the pure object-oriented approach is more consistent and simpler to use.

== What is an object? ==

Using [[w:Smalltalk|Smalltalk]] terminology, an object can do exactly three things.

# Hold state, including references to other objects.
# Receive a message, from both itself and other objects.
# In the course of processing a message, send messages, both to itself and to other objects.

If you don't come from Smalltalk background, it might make more sense to rephrase these rules as follows:

# An object can contain data, including references to other objects.
# An object can contain methods, which are functions that have special access to the object's data.
# An object's methods can call/run other methods/functions.

== Variables and objects ==

Let's fire up &lt;code&gt;[[../Interactive Ruby/|irb]]&lt;/code&gt; to get a better understanding of objects.

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt; '''comedian = &quot;Stephen Colbert&quot;'''
 =&gt; &quot;Stephen Colbert&quot;

[[Image:Ruby - Introduction to objects - Variable reference.png|none]]

In the first line, we created a String object containing the text &quot;&lt;code&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. We also told Ruby to use the variable &lt;code&gt;comedian&lt;/code&gt; to refer to this object.

Next, we tell Ruby to also use the variable &lt;code&gt;favorite_comedian&lt;/code&gt; to refer to the same String object.

 &gt;&gt; favorite_comedian = comedian
 =&gt; &quot;Stephen Colbert&quot;

[[image:Ruby - Introduction to objects - Two variables.png|none]]

Now, we have two variables that we can use to refer to the same String object &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;comedian&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;favorite_comedian&lt;/code&gt;. Since they both refer to the same object, if the object changes (as we'll see below), the change will show up when using either variable.

== Methods ==

In Ruby, methods that end with an [[w:exclamation mark|exclamation mark]] (also called a &quot;bang&quot;) modify the object. For example, the method &lt;code&gt;upcase!&lt;/code&gt; changes the letters of a String to uppercase.

 &gt;&gt; '''comedian.upcase!'''
 =&gt; &quot;STEPHEN COLBERT&quot;

Since both of the variables &lt;code&gt;comedian&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;favorite_comedian&lt;/code&gt; point to the same String object, we can see the new, uppercase text using either variable.

 &gt;&gt; '''comedian'''
 =&gt; &quot;STEPHEN COLBERT&quot;
 &gt;&gt; '''favorite_comedian'''
 =&gt; &quot;STEPHEN COLBERT&quot;

[[image:Ruby - Introduction to objects - Two variables, modified object.png|none]]

Methods that do not end in an exclamation point return data, but do not modify the object. For example, &lt;code&gt;downcase!&lt;/code&gt; modifies a String object by making all of the letters lowercase. However, &lt;code&gt;downcase&lt;/code&gt; returns a lowercase copy of the String, but the original string remains the same.

 &gt;&gt; '''comedian.downcase'''
 =&gt; &quot;stephen colbert&quot;
 &gt;&gt; comedian
 =&gt; &quot;STEPHEN COLBERT&quot;

Since the original object still contains the text &quot;&lt;code&gt;STEPHEN COLBERT&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, you might wonder where the new String object, with the lowercase text, went to. Well, after &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; printed out its contents, it can no longer be accessed since we did not assign a variable to keep track of it. It's essentially gone, and Ruby will dispose of it.

== Reassigning a variable ==

But what if your favorite comedian is not [[w:Stephen Colbert|Stephen Colbert]]? Let's point &lt;code&gt;favorite_comedian&lt;/code&gt; to a new object.

 &gt;&gt; '''favorite_comedian = &quot;Jon Stewart&quot;'''
 =&gt; &quot;Jon Stewart&quot;

Now, each variable points to a different object.

[[image:Ruby - Introduction to objects - Two variables, two objects.png|none]]

Let's say that we change our mind again. Now, our favorite comedian is [[w:Ellen DeGeneres|Ellen DeGeneres]].

 &gt;&gt; '''favorite_comedian = &quot;Ellen DeGeneres&quot;'''
 =&gt; &quot;Ellen DeGeneres&quot;

Now, no variable points to the &quot;&lt;code&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/code&gt;&quot; String object any longer. Hence, Ruby will dispose of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Animal Behavior== 
'''Animal Behavior''' is the scientific study of the wild and wonderful ways in which animals interact with each other, with other living beings, and with the environment. It explores how animals relate to their physical environment as well as to other organisms, and includes topics such as how animals find and defend resources, avoid predators, choose mates, reproduce, and care for their young. 

Previous lesser definitions of Animal Behavior include: 

*&quot;Behavior is motion&quot;. &quot;Movement, not necessarily movement of the whole animal... muscular contractions&quot; or &quot;The whole function of the nervous system can be summed up in one word, conduction.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Sherrington CS. 1899. On the Spinal Animal (The Marshall Hall Lecture). Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, London 82: 449-477&lt;/ref&gt; - In Sherington's view the basic element of behavior was formed in a reflex-arc, where receptor organs receive sensory stimuli and are conducted to an effector organ. This highly reductionist position has received criticism from many angles, specifically, from arguments that it fails to account for spontaneous behaviors, behaviours that are characterized by a lack of motion, as well as disregarding the complexity of emergent properties in behavior.
*&quot;What a plant or animal does, in the course of an individual's lifetime, in response to some event or change in its environment.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Silvertown J &amp; D Gordon, 1989. A framework for plant behaviour. Annual Review of Ecology &amp; Systematics, 20, 349-366&lt;/ref&gt; - This definition reduces behavior to phenotypic plasticity, and is thus not specific enough.
*&quot;Behavior is all observable or otherwise measurable muscular and secretory responses (or lack thereof) and related phenomena in response to changes in an animal's internal or external environment.” &lt;ref&gt;Grier JW &amp; T Burk, 1992. Biology of Animal Behaviour. Mosby Year Book, St. Louis&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior may include components which do not lend themselves to simple quantification.
*&quot;Behavior is characterized by entropic and energetic transductions by an organism, in which the long-term averages convert high entropic and low energetic sensory inputs into low entropic and high energetic outputs.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hailman JP. 1977. Optical Signals: Animal Communication and Light. Indiana Univ Press, Bloomington&lt;/ref&gt; - This definition is too incomprehensible to be of great use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Aims and Scope of Animal Behavior=

[[Image:Lorenz and Tinbergen1.jpg|right|thumb|The Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen (left) shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Konrad Lorenz (right) and Karl von Frisch for their discoveries of individual and social behaviors in animals.|250px]]The study of the behavior of animals is very fortunate that students, who enter this field with a wish to learn more about its scientific approaches, are already intrigued by their own observations. Invariably, beginning students come in equipped with detailed descriptions of behavioral eccentricities of their own pets, wildlife, or smaller siblings. The main challenge is for us to understand the fundamental nature of the scientific approach that must be used to study behavior more formally. Only a rigorous experimental characterization of behavioral phenomena will yield common generalities on how and why animals do what they do - rather than providing a simple catalog of anecdotes. The study of behavior thus critically depends on our ability to phrase our general inquiry as a series of questions that can be answered with standard scientific approaches, that are amenable to experimental probes, and which lead to an explicit and unambiguous interpretation of its results. 

[[Wikipedia:en:Niko_Tinbergen|Niko Tinbergen]]'s legacy as a exceptionally gifted experimentalist include the phrasing of four different types of questions that can be asked of any animal behavior&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen N. 1963. On the aims and methods of ethology. Z. Tierpsychol. 20: 410-433&lt;/ref&gt;,  now simply referred to as '''Tinbergen's 4 Aims'''. This paper summarizes the multidisciplinary approach that had guided the emergence of the field of Ethology since its early roots at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz KZ. 1937. Biologische Fragestellungen in der Tierpsychologie (in English: Biological Questions in Animal Psychology). Z. Tierpsychol. 1: 24-32&lt;/ref&gt;. They group broadly into questions about proximate and ultimate explanations. Proximate explanations are closest to the event that is to be explained, while higher, ultimate explanations instead focus on the deeper reasons for why something happened.

==Proximate Explanations==
===Neural, Endocrine, and Genetic Mechanisms===
Causes that explain how a behavior is elicited and coordinated. What are the anatomical or physiological mechanisms that underlie the behavior? &lt;i&gt;The behavior is present because the nervous system makes it happen.&lt;/i&gt; It includes a search for the impact of genetic components, physiological mechanisms, environmental conditions needed, and hormones on behavior.

Examples:
:*[[Animal Behavior/Examples/Crayfish_Escape|Neural Machinery for Crayfish Escape Behavior]]

===Ontogeny, Development===
How does the behavior develop and change during the lifespan of a single individual? &lt;i&gt;The behavior is present because the individual developed an ability to do it this way&lt;/i&gt;. 

Examples: 
:*[[Animal Behavior/Examples/Human_LanguageLearning|Human Language Learning]]

==Ultimate Explanations==
===Survival Value===
Explanations are phrased as ultimate causes that explain why a behavior has evolved. Selection ought to favor individuals with behaviors that help it increase its reproductive success. &lt;i&gt;The behavior is present because the individual inherited them from parents who were historically successful with this behavior.&lt;/i&gt;. This includes a search for functional significance or adaptiveness of behavior.

===Phylogeny, Evolution===
What were the macroevolutionary patterns of changes that lead to the behavior today? 

Phylogeny is the study of evolutionary relatedness among groups of organisms as It treats a species as a group of lineage-connected individuals over time. It attempts to historically characterize the branching processes in which breeding populations have changed over time. The ethologist's view holds that behavioral characteristics, which receive at least a partial genetic contribution, and can be viewed in a phylogenetic perspective like any other morphological trait. &lt;i&gt;The behavior is present because the individual is an offspring from ancestors that had the behavior.&lt;/i&gt;

=Example - Territoriality in Red-winged Blackbirds=
[[Image:Agelaius_phoeniceus_0110_taxo.jpg|left|thumb|Red-winged blackbird (''Agelaius phoeniceus'') is a sexually dimorphic, passerine bird that breeds from Alaska and Newfoundland to Central America. The male (pictured) is territorial and all black with distinctive red shoulder patches, or &quot;epaulets&quot;, while the female is a nondescript dark brown. Seeds and insects make up the bulk of the Red-winged Blackbird's diet.{{listen|filename=Agelaius-phoeniceus-001.ogg|title=''Cong-a-lee!'' call.}}|250px]] Male red-winged blackbirds are conspicuous and familiar birds throughout most of North America, where they commonly occupy and defend perches near sources of water. Aggressive while defending a territory, they will attack much larger animals, such as ravens, hawks, or humans who encroach upon their territories&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-rwbbird&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7470871.stm|title=Chicago locals beware the birds|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the northern US, male red-winged blackbirds return from their wintering grounds in early March. In rather stunning '''song-spread display''' they flaunt their prominent red epaulets, they lower and spread their tails, puff out their feathers, issuing their distinctive ''Cong-a-lee! call''. According to Tinbergen's 4 Aims our interests as to &quot;Why&quot; they would show such a distinctive type of territorial advertising can be organized in a number of different ways.

===Aim 1: Proximate Mechanisms===
We may ask questions on the particular mechanics that cause the behavior via its underlying neural, endocrine, and genetic mechanisms - i.e., the behavior's '''proximate causation'''. Our interests would focus on whether the male is responding to a particular stimulus such as the approach of a rival, what neural mechanisms aid in the detection of key stimuli, what neural circuits, hormonal triggers, or gene products are  necessary for the behavior's expression, or how seasonal changes in day length are able to control them?

The vocal organ of birds, the '''syrinx''', is located at the base of the blackbird's trachea. Sound is produced when air flowing through it causes the syringeal walls to vibrate. Muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings&lt;ref&gt;Larsen ON and Goller F, 2002. Direct observation of syringeal muscle function in songbirds and a parrot.  J. Exp. Biol. 205: 25-35&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Centers for song production''' pathways include the High vocal center (HVC); robust nucleus of archistriatum (RA); and the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus (nXIIts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brainard MS and AJ Doupe|year=2000|title=Auditory feedback in learning and maintenance of vocal behavior|journal=Nature Rev. Neurosci.|volume=1|pages=31–40|doi=10.1038/35036205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carew&gt;{{cite book |author=Carew TJ. |title=Behavioral Neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |year=2000 |isbn=978-0878930920}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both pathways show sexual dimorphism, with the male producing song most of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bottjer SW, Halsema EA and AP Arnold|year=1984|title=Forebrain lesions disrupt development but not maintenance of song in passerine birds|journal=Science|volume= 224|pages= 901–903|doi=10.1126/science.6719123|pmid=6719123}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Androgens are believed to play a key role in the expression of male song behaviors as it exhibits a strong correlation with seasonal testosterone profiles&lt;ref&gt;Nottebohm F, Nottebohm ME, Crane LA, Wingfield JC. 1987. Seasonal changes in gonadal hormone levels of adult male canaries and their relation to song. Behav Neural Biol. 47(2):197-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marler P, Peters S &amp; Wingfield JC. 1987. Correlations between song acquisition, song production, and plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol in sparrows. J. Neurobiol. 18, 531−548&lt;/ref&gt;. Song is enhanced with testosterone injections and ceases following adult castration. Injections of testosterone induce growth of the HVC and thereby even produce song in female birds, which otherwise would not sing.

===Aim 2: Development, Learning===
We could also query in what way the territorial display emerges in development. What role does maturation play? To what degree does the behavior depend on learning processes and tutors? What neural substrates are involved in its acquisition?

The song of red-winged blackbird males, like that of many other song birds, is learned. A comparison of hatchlings, which were either deprived of normal song altogether or simply presented with its recording, demonstrated that individuals readily learned their song from conspecifics in the vicinity. Far from a pure cultural transmission of song dialects, however, innate predispositions played an important role. Some individuals were able to learn complex repertoires with minimal stimulation&lt;ref&gt;Peters S, Marler P and Nowicki S. 1992. Song sparrows learn from limited exposure to song models. Condor 94: 1016-1019&lt;/ref&gt; while others were quite reluctant to develop elaborate, species-specific calls. Some remain faithful to their tutors while others improvised readily and invented new versions&lt;ref&gt;Marler P, Mundinger P, Waser MS and Lutjen A. 1972. Effects of acoustical stimulation and deprivation on song development in red-winged blackbirds (''Agelaius phoeniceus''). Animal Behaviour 20: 586-606&lt;/ref&gt;. The neural signals that subserve vocal learning center on the anterior forebrain pathway with magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN), Area X, and the Dorsolateral Medial thalamus (DLM)&lt;ref&gt;Troyer TD and Bottjer SW. 2001. Birdsong: models and mechanisms. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 11: 721-726&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Aim 3: Functional Significance===
Alternatively, we may be interested to know what function this particular territorial display serves. If selection favors individuals with a behavior that is beneficial to the bearer's reproductive success, what are the precise benefits bestowed to that individual and its parents? What defines this behavior as successful in evolutionary terms? What factors are turned up by a search for the functional significance or adaptiveness of this behavior?

When red-winged blackbirds were surgically muted, the loss of song affected their ability to defend the territory&lt;ref&gt;Peeke F and Smith D&lt;/ref&gt;. Males were captured and replaced by an auditory display of the individual's recorded song&lt;ref&gt;Yasukawa K, Bick EI, Wagman DW and Marler P. 1982. Playback and speaker-occupation experiments on song-based neighbor, stranger, and self discrimination in male Red-winged Blackbirds. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 10: 211-215&lt;/ref&gt; to examine whether the broadcasts alone would be sufficient to defend the territories.

===Aim 4: Evolution===
Does the red-winged blackbird perform its territorial display because its ancestors did it in a similar way? Is it the only one within its clade that has this display? What were the precise patterns of change throughout the evolutionary lineage that result in the behavior today? How does the red-winged blackbird's display compare to that of other blackbirds?

Most members of the red-winged blackbird's evolutionary lineage communicate with simple call notes, suggesting that its specific call features may have been inherited from an ancestral taxon&lt;ref&gt;Irwin RE. 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Early Influences==

===Prehistoric Period===
[[Image:Lascaux2.jpg|left|thumb|Cave painting of a horse at Lascaux]]
Our early ancestors critically depended on a detailed understanding of animal behavior. Specifically, knowledge of habitat preference, movement patterns, and sensory biology of prey as well as predators were essential. Rock paintings, figurines, and carvings, depicting scenes from daily life and religious rituals, commonly feature detailed likenesses of many kinds of animals. Early forms of rock art emerged during the Paleolithic (200,000 BCE), however, the advent of modern man brought about extraordinary cave wall paintings (40,000 BCE) of animals, hunting scenes and other graphic illustrations of prehistoric life.

Holes in Neolithic skulls illustrate that patients dating back to such early times have been subjected to head surgery, presumably with the aim of curing headaches or mental disorders. Sumerian descriptions show the use of Opium, derived from poppy plants, to produce euphoriant effects.

===Native American ===
A common theme contends that the world was populated by many peoples who were subsequently transformed into different kinds of animals. Thus all animals and humans share the presence of a soul. The close bond between them is shown in frequent rituals where the behavior of different animals is simulated. Imagery of animals is common. The Great Serpent Mound represents an effigy mound located on a plateau along Ohio Brush Creek in Adams County, Ohio. Conforming to the topography, the snake's head approaches a cliff point, the snake then winds back and forth for more than 200 meters and ends with a triple coiled tail.

===Egyptian Mythology===
[[Image:Horus standing.svg|left|thumb|Horus, an ancient Egyptian falcon headed-deity.]]
Ancient Egyptian societies showed a keen interest in the temperaments and sensory abilities of different animals and ascribed them to individual deities.

Ancient Egyptians had a highly developed view of the afterlife with elaborate rituals for preparing the body and soul for a peaceful existence after death. Beliefs about the soul and its needs led to numerous ceremonies for the preservation of the body. The brain apparently was not considered an essential element for eternity, as it was treated with a distinct lack of dignity. It was often spooned into small pieces and removed through the nose, then unceremoniously discarded.

===Classical Antiquity===

'''[[Wikipedia:en:Plato|Plato]]''' held the notion that the human mind as an entity pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on earth. '''[[Wikipedia:en:Hippocrates|Hippocrates]]''' believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation but was also the seat of intelligence. Like many before and after him, '''[[Wikipedia:en:Aristotle|Aristotle]]''' was intrigued by the natural world around him. He, however, stands out as a seminal thinker on a wide range of subjects as he was able to move beyond his substantial abilities at observation by forwarding daring hypotheses in order to categorize and make sense of what he saw. Aristotle provided the first written records of mutualistic ties between individuals, animal tool use, and brood parasitism. His views on human nature considered our behavior as constituting formed habits and a desire for happiness. With his proposed concept of a ''tabula rasa'' he forwarded the thesis that individuals are born with no innate or built-in mental content, in a word &quot;blank&quot;, and that their entire resource of knowledge is built up gradually from their experiences and sensory perceptions of the outside world. '''[[Wikipedia:en:Herophilus|Herophilus]]''' studied the nervous system and distinguished between sensory nerves and motor nerves. '''[[Wikipedia:en:Erasistratus|Erasistratus]]''' studied the brain and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum.

====Roman Empire====
As a physician in a gladiator school, '''[[Wikipedia:en:Galen|Galen]]''' gained a unique view of the behavioral deficits that resulted from acute head trauma. Not surprisingly he wrote extensively on the connection between paralysis and severance of the spinal cord. His many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgery, were not again used for almost two millennia.

===Middle Ages===
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin. Accepted were Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology. As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots. General levels of literacy further decreased as learning became largely restricted to monastic and cathedral schools that were primarily aimed at training clergy. The Church exerted an overpowering role in philosophical thought and nontheological scholarship was rare. Despite this many influences on the study of behavior in later periods began to emerge&lt;ref&gt;Henley TB and Thorne BM. 2005. The Lost Millennium: Psychology during the Middle Ages. The Psychological Record 55&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Arabists===
Arabian scholars describe cranial and spinal nerves, along with surgical procedures for neurological disorders.

===Renaissance===
The principal features of the Renaissance (14th-16th century) were the revival of learning based on classical sources and the broad advancements of science. It pioneered scientific study through deductive reasoning. '''[[Wikipedia:en:Descartes|René Descartes]]''' supplied a foundation for the pursuit of knowledge. 
*Unity of all sciences through deductive reasoning
*Never accept anything as true that is not known clearly to be such
*Divide problems into as many parts as possible, and proceed from the simplest to the hardest
He argues that he perceives his body through the use of the senses, which often proven unreliable. So he concludes that thinking is his essence as it is the only thing about him that cannot be doubted. Descartes defines &quot;thought&quot; as every activity of which a person is immediately conscious. In his [[Wikipedia:en:Descartes#Dualism|Mind/body dualism]] he viewed the body as a machine that follows the laws of physics. In contrast, he regarded  the mind (or soul) as a nonmaterial entity that is not subject to such physical constraints. The Cartesians (i.e., the followers of Descartes) aimed to explain behavior using simple, natural, and entirely mechanistic principles. In their view only humans were endowed with an ability to reason.

With the advent of the scientific revolution, medieval worldviews steadily gave way to increasingly analytical methodologies and a weakening of '''vitalist''' traditions. Although medical thought continued to be guided by the occult, critical thinking began to chip away at the long-held notions based on Galen. Hippocrates' views are revived and Renaissance artists such as '''[[Wikipedia:en:Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]]''' conducted detailed studies of human anatomy in order to better portray the human form. As '''[[Wikipedia:en:Andreas_Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius]]''' corrects Greek medical errors, he revolutionizes medicine. '''[[Wikipedia:en:William_Harvey|William Harvey]]''' applies scientific methodology to human physiology and solves the human circulatory system.  '''[[Wikipedia:en:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]]''' rejects occultism and pioneers the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine.

===Enlightenment===
Thinkers of the '''Age of Reason''' (18th century) perceive their efforts as bringing to an end previous periods of irrationality, superstition, and tyranny. '''[[Wikipedia:en:John_Locke|John Locke]]''''s philosophy revives Aristiotles theory of a ''tabula rasa'', where the (human) mind is at birth a &quot;blank slate&quot; without rules for processing data, and where data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. The concept of a blank mind at birth emphasized the individual's freedom to author one's own human character. Moreover, as members of ones society will become what society make of them, it becomes essential to assure universal access to learning opportunities, medical care, and possibilities for personal development.

==Evolution==
In the second half of the 19th century the simple taxonomic classification of all life forms was supplanted by a growing focus on parsimonious and scientifically testable (phylegenetic) hypotheses that could explain the relatedness among groups of organisms. Studies of the fossil record, the geographic distribution of faunas, and the characteristics that linked the diversity of live, convinced a growing number of scientists that species indeed changed over time. Evolution became viewed as a branching process, whereby populations are altered over time and may specialize into separate branches, hybridize together, or terminate by extinction. However, the mechanism driving these changes remained unclear until the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', which provided the theory of evolution with the likely mechanism of natural selection.

*'''[[Wikipedia:en:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]]''' (12 February, 1809 – 19 April, 1882) represents arguably among the most significant scientists of all time. He realized and presented compelling evidence for '''natural selection''' as the main mechanism by which all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors. Evolution, as an explanation for the diversity of life, had emerged earlier and was generally accepted by most in his lifetime. His 1859 book ''[[Wikipedia:en:On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]'' established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature and this view emerged as the primary explanation in modern evolutionary theory. He also examined human evolution and sexual selection in ''[[Wikipedia:en:The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'', followed by ''[[Wikipedia:en:The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals|The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''. Darwin suggested that all human characteristics are fundamentally inherited and all have been subject to evolution. Emotions may best be understood as consequences of adaptive reactions.
*'''[[Wikipedia:en:George John Romanes|George John Romanes]]''',  a Canadian-born English evolutionary biologist and physiologist, laid the foundation for comparative psychology, postulating a similarity of cognitive processes and mechanisms between humans and animals.

== Psychophysics==
'''Psychophysicists''', such as '''[[Wikipedia:en:Gustav_Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:en:Wilhelm_Wundt|Wilhelm Wundt]]''', aimed to relate matter to mind via a study of inner experiences or feelings towards defined physical stimuli. Psychophysicists explicitly rejected the concepts of vitalists, i.e. that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces. The main focus lay on the way subjects perceive experimental stimuli that can be objectively measured, such as pure tones varying in intensity, or lights varying in luminance&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass JG. 1975. Psychophysics. In: Experimental Sensory Psychology. B Scharf. (Ed.) pp. 17-67&lt;/ref&gt;. A broad range of senses has been studied, including vision, hearing, touch (including skin and enteric perception), taste, smell, or the sense of time.

*Psychoanalysis is a family of psychological theories and methods based on the pioneering work of '''[[Wikipedia:en:Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]]'''. As a result of talking with his patients, he came to believe that psychopathologies stemmed from culturally unacceptable, thus repressed and unconscious, desires and fantasies of a sexual nature. Moreover he stressed the presumed value of dreams as sources of insight into unconscious desires. The analyst's goal is thus aimed to discover connections among the unconscious components of patients' mental processes. This ought to help liberate the patient from unexamined or unconscious barriers of transference and resistance, that is, past patterns of relating that are no longer serviceable or that inhibit freedom.
*'''[[Wikipedia:en:Carl Jung|Carl G. Jung]]''''s unique and broadly influential approach to psychology emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, world religion and philosophy. Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His ''Collective unconscious'' refers to a human experience reservoir, a kind of knowledge, we are all born with but can never be directly conscious of. His ''Archetypes'' represent generic, idealized models of personalities with unlearned tendencies to experience things in a certain way.

== Comparative Psychology and Behaviorism ==
This school of thought represents a movement in psychology that advocates the use of strict experimental procedures to study observable behaviors (or responses) in relation to environment (or stimuli). Behaviorists regard learning and environmental conditions as dominant over the effects of genetics and heredity. Concepts, such as learning or memory are explored using artificial tasks in strictly controlled environments (e.g., Skinner Box, Morris' water maze, Radial arm maze).

'''Comparative psychology''' viewed science less as a framework for explaining events but rather for predicting and controlling them. Adoption of the observational techniques that had proven useful in the study of the behavior of animals was viewed as the best way to advance the scientific study of human beings. The external environment represented the main determining influence on behavior and its manipulation held the most promise for improving the condition of human beings. The concept of a ''tabula rasa'' was revived.

A common tenet held that the complex phenomena of behavior could be explained by and reduced to clear, distinct, reflexive units of behavior.

'''[[Wikipedia:en:William_ James|William James]]''' described psychology as &quot;the science of mental life.&quot; As a rigid application of the scientific method is only possible for learned behaviors, he felt that our studies should foremost focus on studying those.

'''[[Wikipedia:en:Ivan_Pavlov|Ivan P. Pavlov]]''' realized that behavior changes when an organism comes to associate one stimulus with another. Specifically, a reflexive or automatic response transfers from one stimulus to another - ''Classical Conditioning''.

'''[[Wikipedia:en:Edward_Thorndike|Edward L. Thorndike]]''' Using a ''Puzzle Box'', he demonstrated that behaviors that are followed by a positive outcome are often repeated, while those followed by a negative outcome or none at all are extinguished (i.e., Operant Conditioning). He postulated the ''Law of effect'' where behavior changes when the results of an action proved of consequence (e.g. rewarding, noxious).

'''[[Wikipedia:en:John_B._Watson|John B. Watson]]''' stimulus-response theory of psychology, emotional reactions are learned in much the same way as other skills

'''[[Wikipedia:en:B.F._Skinner|B.F. Skinner]]''' contends that nearly all behavior is shaped by complex patterns of reinforcement in a person's environment. ''Skinner Box'': An animal placed inside the box is rewarded with a small bit of food each time it makes the desired response, such as pressing a lever or pecking a key. A device outside the box records the animal's responses.

==Ethology==
&lt;center&gt;''&quot;When, as by a miracle, the lovely butterfly bursts from the chrysalis full-winged and perfect, ... it has, for the most part, nothing to learn, because its little life flows from its organization like melody from a music box&quot;'' -- Douglas A. Spalding, 1873&lt;/center&gt;

'''Ethology''', the biological study of behavior under naturalistic conditions, emerged out of diverse roots by individuals largely trained in a zoological tradition. It aimed to provide a more comprehensive study of animal behavior than previously available. Where comparative psychology studies the behavior of animals in the context of what is known about human psychology, ethology explores animal behavior in the context of animal anatomy and physiology. Ethologists specifically considered the significance of inherited elements of behavior alongside learned components. Influenced by evolutionary biologists such as '''[[Wikipedia:en:Thomas_Hunt_Morgan|Thomas Hunt Morgan]]''' and others, many aspects of behavior may indeed be accessible to selection. '''[[Wikipedia:en:Charles_Otis_Whitman|Charles Otis Whitman]]''' examined the importance of phylogeny to the origins of behavior. '''[[Wikipedia:en:Oskar_Heinroth|Oskar Heinroth]]''' rather focused on how the adaptive value of behavior may explain behavioral differences among taxa. Experiments, in which he raised young birds separate from other individuals of their own species, demonstrated that many species-specific behaviors were nonetheless present.  Interest in genetically-programmed elements (instincts) were contrasted to those subject to learning (e.g., imprinting). Using a comparative approach ethologists are thus interested to search for the biological basis of behavior (including human behavior) by comparing specific activities to those of close relatives.

'''[[Wikipedia:en:Karl_Von_Frisch|Karl von Frisch]]''' studied the senses of honey bees, identified their mechanisms of communication, and showed their sensitivity to ultraviolet and polarized light. He unlocked the basic secrets of the forager's waggle dance, research which continues to yield new insights to this day&lt;ref&gt;Riley JR, Greggers U, Smith AD, Reynolds DR and Menzel R. 2005. The flight paths of honeybees recruited by the waggle dance. Nature 435: 205-207&lt;/ref&gt;. Techniques developed by behaviorists, such as classical and operant conditioning, have proven valuable to ethologists. Animals trained to respond to a particular stimulus in the appropriate behavioral context can demonstrate their ability to discriminate between different types of stimulus. For example, von Frisch used classical conditioning to show that fish could hear, and bees were able to perceive colors.

&lt;b&gt;Konrad Lorenz'&lt;/b&gt; work included studies of '''imprinting''' (i.e., the capacity to learn specific types of information at certain &lt;b&gt;critical periods&lt;/b&gt; in development) and '''instinct''' (i.e., the capacity of an animal to complete a complex behavior in response to a first-time encounter with a given situation). Filial imprinting refers to the case where young of a species need to acquire the image of what their parents look like (e.g. ducks). Instinctive behavior can usually be elicited by a limited combination of complex environmental cues. Such a '''sign stimulus''' refers to a particular subset of features or qualities of a natural stimulus or from complex environmental cues that is sufficient to elicit a specific behavioral response. They noted that different individuals produce identical behavioral response to specific sign stimuli - Motor patterns (or '''Fixed Action Pattern''', FAP). Once initiated, FAPs continue until completion. A releasing mechanism is a functionally organized, neural circuit that recognizes a specific releaser and produces the appropriate response. Due to their stereotype, behaviors can be cataloged in form of an '''Ethogram''' (i.e., a comprehensive compilation of the behavioral repertory of a species, a catalog of actions as complete and precise as possible). An internal factor that determines how likely an animal is to perform a behavior (i.e., Action-Specific Energy).

The causation of behavior is viewed in the context of a metaphor - the Psychohydraulic model. Action specific energy is akin to a liquid building up in a vessel. A high level of action specific energy results when a behavior has not been performed in some time. Pressure from the water pushes onto a piston which is also pulled by sign stimuli in the environment, represented by weights. As pressure mounts the piston finally opens a valve that allows water to flow out (representing the performance of the behavior) Example: An animal that has had a good meal will have a low drive to eat more (i.e., little water in the apparatus). As it goes for a while without eating, the drive (i.e., hunger) builds up. If food is then encountered, the animal will try to consume it. If no good food is encountered, less preferred items will be accepted. This model has faced much criticism as performance of many behaviors appear to increase the tendency to perform it again (i.e. aggression), rather than bring about a decrease.

Three Ethologists shared the 1973 Nobel Price for Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their work over the previous 30 years as founders of the field of ethology.

'''Behavioral Genetics''' explores the hereditability of behavioral traits. More recently, this has given rise to a largely quantitative emphasis on using molecular genetic techniques in order to isolate individual genes that play a role in behavior, neural and behavioral pathologies, or individual human characteristics.

Each inherited feature of an organism is determined by a section of genetic code - a '''gene''' which represents the smallest hereditary unit. The '''genome''' refers to one individual's entire set of hereditary information and includes genes as well as non-coding sequences of DNA. The genomes for any two individuals, except for those of identical twins or cloned animals, are unique. Such differences (i.e., polymorphism) produce different versions of the same genes, called '''alleles'''. Despite these differences in genetic makeup, we also find major commonalities across much of the code shared by all forms of life. The specific genetic makeup of an individual is called its '''genotype'''. A '''trait''' refers to a specific characteristic or feature of an organism (although in psychology the term may be used to represent a component of personality). The term '''phenotype''' represents the specific manifestation of a trait or its physical appearance and constitution and refers to the actual state of that trait (e.g., the trait eye color has the phenotypes blue, brown and hazel). The individual's '''phenotype''' emerges as interaction of genetic information with environmental conditions.

'''[[Wikipedia:en:Francis_Galton|Sir Francis Galton]]''' (February 16, 1822 – January 17, 1911), a younger relative of Charles Darwin, was an English explorer, geographer, and statistician. Intrigued by Darwin's concept of natural selection and with a keen interest in the breeding of domesticated animals, Galton explored variation in human populations and its implications. He became interested at first in the question of whether human ability was hereditary. He presented evidence for the inheritance of a range of abilities - &quot;a man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Galton F. 1969. ''Hereditary Genius''. MacMillan an Co.&lt;/ref&gt; . He also proposed adoption studies, including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate out the effects of heredity and environment. He was instrumental in the development of quantitative methods to test human intelligence, statistical correlation, fingerprint analysis. self-report questionnaires, and word-association studies. In a darker side, he became a vociferous proponent of '''eugenics''' where he proposed to improve the human race via selective breeding of those individuals who managed to score high marks on intelligence tests.

==Behavioral Ecology==
&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ...&quot;'' -- Theodosius Dobzhansky&lt;/center&gt;

'''Behavioral ecology''' is the study of the ecological and evolutionary basis for animal behavior. Primarily concerned with ultimate (evolutionary) consequences, researchers aim to identify phylogenetic contingencies within behavior (i.e., to what degree behavior is inherited from its ancestors) and to examine its functional significance (i.e., how the behavior impacts the bearers reproductive success). Behavioral ecologists contend that in order to minimize ad-hoc explanations arising from anecdotal observations a rigorous examination of the adaptive consequences of a behavior are essential. Specifically, it explores what a trait is good for in an evolutionary context. 

'''Optimization theory''' is concerned with assessing the success of behavior. It attempts to identify those behavioral strategies that offer the highest return under a given set of conditions using a cost/benefit analysis. In this context success or '''fitness''' is judged by considering the number of offspring that the bearer of the behavior would contribute to the next generation relative to its suboptimal conspecifics. Optimization theory, such as optimal foraging theory, states that individuals ought to adopt strategies that allow it to consume the most energy while expending the least amount of energy. '''Evolutionary game theory''' asserts that the success of strategies should not only consider its inherent benefits, as the actual success depends on what other strategies exist in the population. An '''evolutionarily stable strategy''' is a strategy which when adopted by all members cannot be beaten out by any invading, mutant strategy.

'''Sociobiology''' aims to explain behavior in all species by considering the evolutionary advantages of social behaviours&lt;ref&gt;Wilson EO. 2000, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition, Belknap Press, ISBN 0-674-00089-7&lt;/ref&gt;. Sociobiology is based on the idea that all animals, including humans, will tend to act in ways to improve their own reproductive success, and that this will result in social processes conducive to genetic fitness&lt;ref&gt;Wilson EO. 1979, On Human Nature, Harvard University Press, ISBN 0-674-63441-1, Pulitzer Prize, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, cultural practices and values related to sexuality are viewed as shaped by natural selection (e.g., societal rules for incest avoidance). The concept has been criticized for its reliance on innate predispositions over learning, and by the view that presents situations are not representative of historical conditions.

The '''selfish genes hypothesis''' states that the individual is not as important to the population as its genes. '''Kin selection''' refers to changes in gene frequency across generations when biological relatives influence the reproductive success of each other&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, WD. 1964. The genetical evolution of social behavior I and II. J. Theoretical Biology 7: 1-16 and 17-52&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, a gene that prompts behavior which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behavior, may nonetheless increase in frequency, as relatives often share the same genes. The enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behavior.

In 1791, '''[[Wikipedia:en:Luigi_Galvani|Luigi Galvani]]''' discovered that the muscles of dead frog's legs twitched when struck by an electric spark. According to popular version of the story, Galvani had been conducting experiments with static electricity by rubbing frog skin. Galvani's assistant touched an exposed sciatic nerve of the skinned frog carcass with a metal scalpel that had picked up a charge, they saw sparks and the dead frog's leg kicked as if in life. The observation made Galvani appreciate the relationship between electricity and muscle movement. Galvani's cousin. who engaged in a public demonstration of electrical stimulation of muscles on the body of an executed criminal, reputedly provided the inspiration for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. With stimulation of the body's face, the jaws began to quiver, facial muscles were horribly contorted, an eye opened, the right hand was raised and clenched, and muscles in legs and thighs moved.

The late 19th century witnessed the rise of modern neuroscience. Hypotheses that distinct brain functions were contained within specific regions of the brain emerged with evidence from patients with epileptic seizures, head trauma, and stroke. Extensive characterizations of neurons throughout the brain led '''[[Wikipedia:en:Camillo_Golgi|Camillo Golgi]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:en:Santiago_Ramón_y_Cajal|Santiago Ramón y Cajal]]''' to propose the '''neuron doctrine''', i.e., that the function of the brain is a product of the electrical and chemical activity of individual neurons. Further support came from the discovery that muscles and neurons showed electrical excitability, which could be transferred onto neighboring cells. Electrical properties are assessed either by recording from an electrode placed into the lumen of a cell (intracellular) or from its surrounding vicinity (extracellular). Intracellular recording techniques aim to either measure the current needed to maintain a constant voltage (voltage clamp) or measure the voltage needed to keep the current constant (current clamp) across the cell membrane. Using such techniques, '''[[Wikipedia:en:Alan_Hodgkin|Alan Hodgkin]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:en:Andrew_Huxley|Andrew Huxley]]''' identified the ionic mechanisms that underly the electrical properties of neurons in giant axons of squid. '''[[Wikipedia:en:John_Carew_Eccles|John Carew Eccles]]''' identified synapses as the sites of communication between neurons.

Generations of neuroscientists had perceived the brain as a rather passive, reactive organ whose functional capacities were maintained by a sustained flow of sensory input.

==Neuroethology and Behavioral Neuroscience==
&lt;center&gt;''&quot;It is an urgent task of ethologists and neurophysiologists to join efforts in the training of ‘etho-physiologists'&quot;'' -- Tinbergen, 1951. The Study of Instinct&lt;/center&gt;

'''Neuroethology''' is a synthesis of neuroscience and the study of behavior that explores neural mechanisms of natural behavior&lt;ref&gt;Heiligenberg W. 1991. The neural basis of behavior: A neuroethological view.  Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 14: 247-267&lt;/ref&gt;. This is in contrast to other approaches to neuroscience that study the nervous system in isolation, or in the context of artificial conditions. The neuroethological approach stems from the idea that nervous systems have evolved to address problems of sensing and acting in certain environmental conditions. The functions of nervous systems, therefore, are best understood in the context of the problems they have evolved to solve&lt;ref&gt;Pflueger H-J and Menzel R. 1999. Neuroethology, its roots and future. J Comp Physiol A 185: 389-392 [http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb424/readings/Pfluger_Menzel_1999.jpg.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Using physiological experiments, '''[[Wikipedia:en:Erich_von_Holst|Erich von Holst]]''' showed that behaviors can be elicited experimentally even in the absence of any sensory input. In contrast to Sherington's reflex theory, van Holst postulated that basic central nervous function required permanent production of endogenous inhibitory stimulation. Behavior emerged when inhibitory control was diminished. He also demonstrated that internal, autonomous, rhythmic behavior can be independent of environmental factors. By slicing a worm into separate segments, and attaching each segment to a sensitive voltmeter, he noticed distinct, consecutive deflections on the meter which demonstrated as a wave moving through the severed parts from the front to the end of the entire cut-up specimen at approximately the speed of a contraction wave of a wriggling earthworm.

Sensory receptors and neurons exhibit '''functional tuning''' to a highly specific subset of stimulus conditions. For instance mechanoreceptors with sensory hairs detect air currents in crickets by transducing both direction and velocity of relevant stimulus energies. Directional tuning is determined by the preferred orientation of the hair's socket. Velocity tuning occurs when longer hairs respond to low wind velocities while shorter hairs need higher wind velocity to activate them. Each mechanoreceptor is innervated by a single sensory neuron and its directional tuning curve represents the cell's sensitivity to wind direction. Most substrates for sensory processing show a strict spatial organization - its '''topographic mapping'''. A system for extracting temporal information can be constructed via '''delay lines''', a system which utilizes the fact that electrical conduction in neurons is not instantaneous; it is delayed depending on the length of the axon and other properties of the neuron (e.g. myelination). The resulting delays can be used for time sensitive calculations, such as calculation of inter-aural time differences in sound localization. A '''central pattern generator''' (CPG) is a network of neurons (or even a single neuron) which is able to exhibit rhythmic activity in the absence of sensory input.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Learning and Memory==

===Memory===
'''Memory''', in its broadest sense, refers to an individual's ability to retain learned information. The formation of memory traces is a complex task which all organisms appear to be able to do. Fundamentally, such an ability requires a series of distinct steps: Information must be '''encoded''' as meaningful associations are assessed, the resulting information must be '''recorded''' in some form, and the memory record must be '''retrieved''' when needed.

As humans exhibit little conscious awareness of mental processes, such as memory, these were long considered inaccessible to objective, scientific study. Inferences about the course of encoding, consolidation and storage of memory thus mostly rely on indirect methods such as testing for retrieval abilities. 

Consolidation of memory appears to involve independent paths at different time frames. Such evidence derives from the existence of different critical time frames for its formation, and its susceptibility to disruption with different pharmacological tools.

====Sensory Memory====
Subjects are able to report great detail about a complex stimulus immediately following its presentation. This ability forms within a few tens of milliseconds and decays again rapidly within a few hundred milliseconds. 

====Short-term Memory====
Short-term memory allows the recall of something from several seconds to as long as a minute. Its strength does appear to depend primarily on attention and not rehearsal. It is thus highly vulnerable to disruption when attention shifts elsewhere. The amount of information that can be held is on the order of 4-6 numbers. This amount can be boosted by grouping them into distinct chunks as for telephone numbers (e.g., 202-456-1414).

The ability to recall such information is contingent on transient patterns of neuronal activity in regions of the frontal and the parietal lobe.

====Long-term Memory====
This type of memory, lasting hours to months, critically depends on a transfer of the information from short term memory using repeated rehearsal.

The hippocampus appears to be an essential structure in such routing. Sleep is thought to improve the consolidation of information, possibly by hippocampal replaying of activity from the previous wake period. Electrical activation of hippocampal circuits reportedly are linked to feelings of Deja Vu.

=====Declarative Memory=====
'''Declarative memory''' refers to the ability to become conscious of, or declare, facts and experiences. It is also referred to as '''Explicit memory''', when it involves direct recalling information that had been obtained from the external world. Representing knowledge of standard textbook material or events, it is best formed by actively recalling the material in spaced intervals. Compared to other forms or memory it is more volatile; more easily formed and more easily forgotten. 

The primary neural basis appears to reside in the medial temporal lobe. Bilateral damage to this area results in anterograde amnesia, as in the famous case of the anonymous memory-impaired patient '''HM'''. A surgical procedure for epilepsy left him with damage to his brain in the medial temporal lobe on both sides. the hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gyrus, the entorhinal cortex, and the amygdala. He subsequently suffered from severe anterograde amnesia, where transfer of new events into long-term memory was impaired. He was unable to recall events once his attention had focused elsewhere.

'''Semantic Memory''' is the ability to consciously recall knowledge of facts that are independent of a specific time and place. medial temporal lobe, diencephalon

'''Episodic Memory''' refers to the ability to explicitly recall information about a specific event that has occurred at a specific time and place, medial temporal lobe, diencephalon

=====Nondeclarative Memory=====
Implicit memory, which does not need to involve conscious awareness in the act of recollection

'''Procedural Memory''' regards the learning of motor skills and habits. Formation requires repeated reinforcement, repetition and practice over many trials rather than recollection. Once formed it is less likely to be forgotten. It is also less easily transferred to related tasks than declarative learning

Striatum, basal ganglia, Deficits can be assessed using a serial reaction time (SRT) task, backwards reading, mirror drawing, probabilistic classification, artificial grammar learning, or prototype abstraction.

'''Motor Responses''' with Classical Conditioning, Cerebellum

'''Emotional Responses''' with Fear conditioning involves an organism's ability to acquire fear responses to a previously neutral stimulus. This occurs when it becomes paired with an aversive stimulus, such as a shock or loud noise. James Wattson's '''Little Albert experiment''' illustrated that children learned fear of objects when encounters with them where paired with loud noises.

'''Priming''' refers to a context-dependent activations of clusters of neocortical neurons. As they become more activated, they are more likely to come into consciousness.

Even '''reflex pathways''' are capable of surprising plasticity. For example, circuits that control motor patterns for walking will be subjected to optimization with sensory input.

====Long-lasting Memory====
months to lifetime

====Case Studies====
Patient HM suffered severe memory impairment following bilateral damage to his medial temporal lobes, hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. His short-term memory remained intact, he was able to largely recall past events, and his ability to learn new motor skills was not disrupted. However, he suffered from severe anterograde amnesia, i.e., the ability to commit new events to long-term memory.

===Mechanisms===
Memory mechainsms critically depend on changes in synaptic functioning. '''Hebb Synapses''' and their role in classical conditioning. If a synapse succeeds at driving a postsynaptic neuron above threshold, its subsequent effectiveness is strengthened.

'''Long-term potentiation''' is based on changes in neural signals which will potentiate a neural response for 1-2 weeks. potentiation involves increased release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.

====Molecular changes at the synaptic level====
During '''habituation''', repeated stimulation of a sensory neuron leads to a smaller activation of the postsynaptic motor neuron. The primary cause for this is a progressive reduction of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; inflow into the presynaptic terminal, decreased transmitter release, and a smaller activation of the postsynaptic target. In '''sensitization''' as a result of electrical head shock, release of serotonin activates second messenger systems and phosphorylation of key target molecules. Long-Term Memory depends on new protein synthesis and the formation of new synaptic connections.

&lt;big&gt; A good resource to use for like language learning courses include: [byki.com   phrasebase.com     livemocha.com]




Please, add this useful site to the &quot;Online Courses&quot; section:

( http://learningrussian.net )



I've recently put together a free website to help people learn Russian by listening to Russian speakers. It's probably most appropriate in the 'Phrasebook' section.

It's definitely a work-in-progress but in 6 months or so it should grow into a decent resource.

[[Image:Microwave.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Microwave Oven]]
==Introduction - In process of writing as of 28 October 2012 [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Armchair|contribs]]) 17:20, 28 October 2012 (UTC)==
Many kitchens make use of microwave ovens.   In the view of most, their scope is more limited than ovens that use direct heating; that is, gas and electric ovens.   However, that said, there are many of them in use, and for a restricted set of tasks they are useful, allowing as they do shorter thawing, heating, and cooking times than might otherwise be expected.   These notes will attempt to summarize their obvious uses.

==Technical Notes==
*'''Microwaves (extra high frequency radio waves) are used to heat the food''' in such ovens, and they most often deliver a maximum of between 600 and 1000 watts of energy, with adjustments for time duration and energy output.   The energy is safely contained within the oven by a reflective metal box; that is, the internal panels of the oven.  Because thin metallic films and meshes also reflect microwaves, see-through doors become possible without any danger.

*'''Uncontrolled microwaves could also cause burns to people''', so a high standard of safety is applied, ensuring that there is negligible leakage and that safety interlocks prevent the generation of microwaves whenever the door is opened.   These safety features are tested for all new products, though there are rarely any compulsory tests for ovens after the point of sale.   

*'''Microwaves heat by moving water molecules''', so foods that contain significant water content are obvious choices for their use.   Examples include the heating of milk in baby bottles, the making of sauces, and the heating of certain packaged foods.   Closed foods like eggs in their shells cannot be cooked with microwaves since expansion of the contents might cause the egg to explode.   So also with the baking of potatoes unless their skins are first pierced several times.   Because effective heating takes place only in the first one or two inches (5 cms) of the food; deeper cooking is achieved by the continuous conduction of heat from the areas of absorption and the periodic stirring of the contents by the cook.      

*'''Microwaves alone cannot properly brown food''', so additional items are used to do so.   To make food crisp on its surface, a special plate that is made hot by microwaves is used to hold the food: for example, for bacon, pizza, and to finish 'roast' potatoes.   To attain browning of a more general kind (grilling), say for a gratin, the addition of direct heating elements or hot air jets can be used.   For those foods that need continuous moisture while they cook, plastic steamers are used.

*'''Metals in any amount reflect microwaves''', so the containers used during cooking must be transparent to microwaves; that is they are made of materials free of significant traces of metal.   Many existing glass and china kitchen items work well in microwave ovens, and some of these are marked as ''Microwave safe''.   Heating a cup of water (to avoid overloading) along with a dish that is to be tested for suitability, will result in hot water and a cool dish if the item is useful for the microwave, but the dish will be hot if it is not.   Note that containers for microwaves might still not survive air jets and grills, so care is needed in their use.  A common ''lid'' for dishes is a ''pierced'' plastic film, some brands of which are more suitable for high temperatures than others.

==Types of Oven==
*'''Solo microwave ovens''':   These have a single microwave function and are usually adjustable as to their output and timing.   The most common items have a maximum output of between 600 and 750 watts.   In addition to output the size of the microwave can be quoted as to its cubic capacity;   a fairly large capacity is about 31 litres, but there are many smaller sizes, and a certain amount of the capacity is unavailable for cooking, it being taken up by the rotating turntable.
*'''Combi microwave ovens''':   These combine a grilling or browning feature that can work alone or in combination with the normal microwave function.   The feature can consist of direct heating elements or heated air jets.
*'''Sensor microwave ovens''':   These can be basic or combi, and include automatic weighing of the food contents, so in conjunction with knowledge of the food type, taken from a selector dial, the cooking or thawing time can be worked out automatically.   The sensor technologies are still being developed and new ones appear from time to time.

==Most Common Uses==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cuisine|Gibraltar}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

'''Gibraltarian cuisine''' is the result of 300 years of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British]] rule combined with the coming together of immigrants from a variety of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] countries. It is a combination of [[:Category:English recipes|English]], [[:Category:Scottish recipes|Scottish]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ireland|Irish]] (from the different regiments stationed on the Rock during British rule), [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malta|Maltese]], Genoese (and other [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]]), Menorcan, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Morocco|Moroccan]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] cuisines.

The result is a peculiar cuisine where some dishes are made as in the country of origin, whereas others have been adapted for various reasons. Some dishes were adapted because the ingredients were difficult to obtain during the many sieges the Rock has suffered, whereas others were adapted simply because the cooks were from a different country and were used to other ways of cooking. Whatever the reason, it has resulted in the dishes eaten there today.

It would not be uncommon to go to a Gibraltarian's house and be served pea soup (Irish) followed by a plate of [[Cookbook:Paella|Paella]] (Spanish) with perhaps some 'pinchitos' (Moroccan kebabs) on the side. Notwithstanding, there are also dishes that are now considered purely Gibraltarian and are hardly found anywhere else in the peculiar form eaten there.

Some examples of the cuisine of Gibraltar:

* [[Cookbook:Minestra|Minestra]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Gibraltar|Cuisine of Gibraltar]]

'''Calentita''' &amp;ndash; the quintessential 'Yanito' dish. Every Gibraltarian knows how to cook calentita! Or so they should, it is a matter of national pride.

It is believed this dish is based on the Genoese '[[Cookbook:Socca|farinata]]' which is cooked thinner and often with toppings whereas calentita is cooked in a deeper pan and is never topped with anything but black pepper.

The name 'calentita' has a most interesting history. When Gibraltarian evacuees returned to Gibraltar after World War II many were forced to live in cramped and often inadequate housing. Not all homes had workable ovens and people cooked mainly Spanish style stews (potajes) and similar dishes. However, the local bakeries took advantage of this and would use their ovens in slack periods to make calentita which was sold by street vendors (this had been the fashion before the war when almost no-one had an oven at home). The calentita would be baked in a large low pan (similar to a frying pan of diameter about 90 cm with two small grab handles) with a metal hinged lid. The vendor would then walk along the streets on the Rock shouting out his wares. His shout would be similar to this: 'La llevo caliente, calentita! Calentita, caliente!' A simple translation would be: 'Hot! Come and get it! I still have it hot!'. Caliente means hot and calentita is an endearing version of hot! Everyone would rush to him and buy a portion which was invariably about 8cm by 5cm and cost 6d (about 2 1/2p  of today's money) and was served on a piece of greaseproof paper. The vendor would sprinkle ground pepper on it and off you went!

== Ingredients ==

* 250g [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A bill of materials (BOM) lists the quantity of raw materials and parts that are required to manufacture a product.  Often the BOM includes the quantity of operations (cutting, welding, machining, etc.) that is required as well.  Each line on a BOM can itself be a BOM.

Normally an Engineering Change Order (ECO) is required to change a BOM.  This keeps a complete track of the changes made to the BOM and may come with an effective date.

The BOM sub-module comes with a WHERE-USED functions that lets the user find out when a specific BOM is used in other products and BOMs.

'''Rosto''' is a dish is of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] origin, and provides for two complete courses cooked in one pot without the need for an oven. Originally the pasta was served as a first course with the tomato sauce over it. This was followed by the sliced meat, usually a cheaper cut of pork instead of loin and a small piece at that, with the potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.

It is still extremely popular although many people nowadays also cook it with chicken thighs or even a piece of beef instead of the traditional pork.

== Ingredients ==
 
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] loin
* 2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] cut in quarters
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
* ½ kg penne or macaroni ([[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]])
* ¼ kg [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* ½ kg Fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 tin ‘[[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomate triturado]]’ (tomato paste, or three peeled, de-seeded and puréed tomatoes)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic clove]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (To [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]])
* [[Cookbook:Wine|White wine]]
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Grater|Grated]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (Edam or [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]])

== Procedure ==

# Fry crushed garlic clove and chopped onions till soft. 
# Add tomatoes; fry for five minutes then add pork loin and brown till sealed. 
# Add tin of ‘tomate triturado’ and a dash of white wine. 
# Add potatoes and carrots then cook till meat, potatoes and carrots are done. 
# Add the mushrooms about ten minutes before the end. 
# Add salt, pepper and sugar to taste. 
# Boil the macaroni until ‘al dente’. 
# Remove the meat from the stew and slice.
# Serve meat, potatoes and pasta on same plate pouring sauce over pasta and topping with grated cheese.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
The Master Production Schedule represents the business's high-level decisions about what is to be produced during a given time period.  It states what finished goods are to be produced by date and in what quantity.  It is based on customer orders and forecasted demand over a planning interval (months or even years).  The Master Production Schedule is used to drive the rest of the Manufacturing module.

'''Minestra''' - a typical [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Genoese]] dish not to be confused with the [[Cookbook:Basque cuisine|Basque]] ‘menestra’ which is simply mixed boiled vegetables, or with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] minestrone, a thick vegetable soup.

==Ingredients==
 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Zucchini|courgettes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Eggplant|aubergine]]
* 1 large piece [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Kohlrabi|kohlrabi]] (colinabo)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnips]]
* 1 head of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Pasta|fideua]] (spaghetti)
* [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney beans]] (previously soaked overnight)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 UK pint (600ml) [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]]
 
==Procedure==
# In a large pot or [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]], place the first six ingredients, roughly [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]. Add a pint of vegetable stock and a tablespoon of oil. Bring to pressure and cook for 8 – 10 minutes, or simmer in a large pot for an hour. Cool, then [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] the whole thing. 
# Place a large handful of basil leaves and about 6 cloves of garlic in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar]] and pound until roughly crushed and a gritty paste is achieved. Add to the pot, stir and season to taste.
# Meanwhile, boil the beans separately and, when soft, add to purée mixture. (Dried kidney beans will cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea unless they have been boiled briskly (a slow cooker will not do - it can even make things worse) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the very indigestible [[W:Phytohaemagglutinin|phytohaemagglutinin]] that they contain - they will then need another 60-90 minutes slow simmer to be tender. Tinned kidney beans are quite safe and do not need pre-cooking as their preparation involves sufficient heat to destroy the toxin.)
# Boil the pasta until ''[[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]'' then add to mixture.
# Serve with [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or hard Edam sprinkled over it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Shop Floor Control implements the plan created by APS (Advance Planning and Scheduling).  It issues work orders to individual work centers, requests raw materials from Inventory and, when the finished items are complete, issues stocking requests to Inventory for them.  It records the actual time used to complete the tasks so accurate costing can be done, errors can be corrected and realistic standards maintained.  Shop Floor Control feeds hours of operation for machines to Service Management so that maintenance can be scheduled.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Sales compensation allows management to set sales compensation policies that reflect business objectives, calculate sales compensation based on information from Order Entry/Invoicing, and send it to Payroll for processing.  Sales Compensation allows management to monitor the performance of sales staff and spot problems early.  Commissions are calculated according to user-defined rules.  They can be based on who sold the goods, when they were sold, how many were sold, and what types of goods were sold.  A &quot;draw&quot; is a payment made in advance of an actual sale.  Sales Compensation allows both recoverable and non-recoverable draws.  Not every ERP package has a separate Sales Compensation module although all the large ones do.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Tables ==
Sales people are either employees handled through Payroll or contracters handled through Accounts Payable. Thus Sales Compensation share the Employee table with Payroll and the Supplier group of tables with Accounts Payable.  The first table in Sales Compensation is the Salesperson table which contains one record for every salesperson.  The second table is the Contract table which contains one record for every sales contract.  The third table links Contracts with Inventory Items.
==Data Exchange==
Sales Compensation sends transactions to Payroll or Accounts Payable depending on the type of salesperson.

G'day, and welcome to Wikibooks. I've taken the liberty of moving your Gibraltarian recipes into the Cookbook - go to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Gibraltar]] and notice that the links all now have a ''Cookbook:'' prefix. Also, you might want to take a look at [[Cookbook:Policy]], to get a feel for how we format recipes here. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:09, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
== Another welcome ==
Hi - it's great to have some Gibraltarian recipes - the cuisine sounds like a fascinating blend of many influences. Don't worry too much about getting the formatting right, by the way, there's always someone here who will help out. Enthusiasm is much more important than following policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Every enterprise had dozens of processes by which it fills customer orders, hires, pays, and terminates employees, orders and receives material, locates new business, and pays suppliers.  Some common major processes are Order To Cash and Procure to Pay.  The processes involve both employees and software and normally cross department boundaries.  Workflow automates and regulates these processes via sets of procedural rules using e-mail to notify employees.  With workflow, processes are simple, fast, and uniform as well as easy to change.  Only large ERP packages have a Workflow module.

'''Torta de acelga''' (Chard pie) is believed to be based on a [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] pie eaten in parts of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]] and is also very similar to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] '[[Cookbook:Spanakopita|spanakopita]]'. A very similar pie is eaten in the Ligurian Region during Easter, called Torta Pascualina.  This pie is traditionally eaten on Good Friday in Gibraltar. 

==Ingredients==

* 1 small pkt [[Cookbook:Puff pastry|puff pastry]] (or else make a pastry by mixing one glass each of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and [[Cookbook:Water|water]] then adding [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] until a soft [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] is achieved)
* 6 bunches of [[Cookbook:Chard|acelga]] (chard)
* 6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|Breadcrumbs]]
* [[Cookbook:Grater|Grated]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Season to taste

==Procedure==

# Remove the stems of the acelga (these stems will become useful for another recipe called Potaje de acelga). 
# Wash the leaves very well to remove any grit or soil. Boil the acelga leaves, drain really well and chop them. Fry them for a few minutes in hot olive oil then set aside.
# Roll out the pastry and lay on an oven proof pie dish leaving sufficient pastry to close the pie later. 
# Beat the eggs and add all the ingredients to make a nice filling. 
# Add to the acelga and mix all together. 
# Fill the pie dish with this “relleno” or filling and close the pie with the pastry. 
# Cook in the oven (150°C / 300°F) for about 30 mins or until the pie is nice and golden. 

N.B. I always boil the acelga the night before to save time.

'''Rolitos'''

==Ingredients==

* 8 slices thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
* 4 slices of [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] cut in halves
* 2 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]] cut into quarters
* 8 [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]] (''con morrones'' - stuffed with peppers) cut in halves
* 1 crushed or chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic clove]]
* 1 chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* Gravy powder (as required)

==Procedure==
# Lay out one slice of veal on worktop; place on it half a slice of ham, quarter egg and two olive halves. 
# Carefully roll up the veal to make a package or roll with everything inside. Use two toothpicks to hold the roll together. 
# Place rolls on a plate and store in a cool place or fridge.
# Fry garlic and onions till soft. 
# Add stock and two teaspoons of gravy powder and bring to boil. 
# Carefully place veal rolls into the boiling mixture being careful not to break them up. 
# Lower heat and simmer till done. If sauce is too thin add gravy powder till the right consistency is achieved. 

This meal is traditionally served with mashed potatoes. There is an alternative method made with a tomato sauce instead of brown gravy.

'''Panissa''' &amp;ndash; there is also an original [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] one. What is referred to as Panissa in Italy nowadays is more akin to the Gibraltarian '[[Cookbook:Calentita|Calentita]]'. My grandmother always used to make Panissas on the same day she made [[Cookbook:Minestra|Minestra]] as a light second course.

==Ingredients ==

* 500g [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]]
* 2 litres [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|Lemon juice]]
* [[Cookbook:Mincing|Minced]] [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] (optional) 

==Procedure==

# Stir the chick pea flour into 2 litres of lightly salted water over a moderate flame, and stir the mixture steadily in the same direction with a wooden spoon until you obtain a soft, lump-free paste. 
# When the paste begins to pull away from the sides of the pot, turn it out into oiled wooden moulds, or spread it out about ¼ inch high (½ cm) on your work surface (dust the surface with parsley before you spread if you're including it). 
# Alternatively pour into saucers and cut into wedges when set.
# Once the paste has cooled, cut it into 1 by 3-inch (3x7 cm) rectangles and fry them in hot oil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe the C version of selection sort does not terminate. I checked it by compiling and running the program on an array of length 10 using the gcc compiler. Although this can easily be fixed by modifying the Java version into C code, I think it is still worth pointing out.

The java example here is not selection sort, but non-smart bubble sort.</text>

==Ingredients==

* 2¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (350g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 ⅛ cups [260g] (2 sticks plus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]]) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (see notes, below)
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (220g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|confectioner's sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 egg yolk

==Procedure==

# With an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric stand mixer]] or hand-held mixer, combine flour, butter and sugar until the mixture has the consistency of small peas.
# With the machine on low speed, add eggs and yolk, and mix just until well-incorporated, about 25 seconds.
# Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* European-style butter, which has a higher fat content than American butter, is recommended. Most supermarkets now stock at least one variety of European-style butter, Plugra being one of the most popular brands.

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|375°F]].
# Butter and lightly flour 2 medium loaf pans (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches).
# Using a [[Cookbook:Mixer|stand mixer]] fitted with the paddle attachment, combine eggs, oil, pumpkin and sugar until smooth.
# In a separate bowl, combine the flour, soda, salt, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg.
# With the machine on low speed, add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture in ¼-cup increments.
# Scrape down the side of the bowl and mix for another 30 seconds or so, until all ingredients are well-combined.
# Divide the mixture equally between the 2 loaf pans.
# Sprinkle the top of each loaf with 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds.
# Bake 40 to 45 minutes until a tester inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean.
# Allow loaves to cool in the pans for 5 to 10 minutes before unmolding, then allow loaves to cool on a wire rack to room temperature before cutting or wrapping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Everything in the world is made of atoms. But what are atoms and how were they discovered? Today, special microscopes help scientists see images created by atoms. It is amazing what scientists were able to discover about the makeup of matter before such microscopes were even thought of. In this chapter, you will learn about atoms and some of the people who discovered them. 

==Challenge==
Have you ever had a wrapped birthday present that you couldn’t wait to open? What did you do to try to figure out what was in it? The atom is like that wrapped present. You want to investigate it, but you cannot see it easily.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck!

I noticed on the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes log]] that you uploaded [[:Image:Dependency ratio.jpg]]. Thank you for your contributions! I want to suggest that you consider replacing the image with a textual solution. That way any editor can easily change and modify the text, whereas they would have to reupload the image with your current solution. You might consider either of these three options:
&lt;pre&gt;
{| cellpadding=5
|-
| rowspan=2                             | Dependency ratio =
| style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid #000;&quot; | (% under 15) + (% over 65)
| align=center rowspan=2                | x 100
|-
| align=center                          | % between 15 and 64
|-
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
or
&lt;pre&gt;
{| cellpadding=5
|-
| Dependency ratio =
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{(%\ under\ 15)+(%\ over\ 65)}{%\ between\ 15\ and\ 64}&lt;/math&gt;
| x 100
|-
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
or
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Dependency\ ratio = \frac{(%\ under\ 15)+(%\ over\ 65)}{%\ between\ 15\ and\ 64} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can view them by editing a page, pasting them in, and clicking &quot;preview.&quot; If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on my [[User talk:Iamunknown|talk page]]. Best wishes, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

'''Additional note:''' I noticed that on the three US Government images that you uploaded, you did not provide a source as to where to find these images. In order to verify their copyright status (that they are indeed US Government images and thus in the public domain), you should provide a link to the website where you found them.

== Overview ==

'''''Miss Fawcett''''' is a member of either Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff house, possibly in the same year as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]]. 

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

A very tenuous link leads us to believe that Miss Fawcett was present at Hogwarts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s first year. The book ''Quidditch Through the Ages'', written by the author of the series, has a library card on the fly-leaf, with a list of students who had taken the book out and the due dates. One &quot;S. Fawcett&quot; had borrowed the book, and was to return it on the 16th of September. &quot;H. Granger&quot; and &quot;H. Potter&quot; had borrowed the book after that, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] has the book out of the library during ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Miss Fawcett is mentioned in passing as one of the students that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] helps to her feet after the grand chaos of the Dueling Club. &quot;Careful there, Miss Fawcett...&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

In conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] just before locating the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] to take them to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] mentions the Fawcetts had been unable to get tickets. Given the author's propensity to re-use characters, we can guess that this refers to Miss Fawcett's family, and thus guess that she lives near the Weasley home at Ottery St. Catchpole.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] mentions that Miss Fawcett had tried to place her name in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]], but had been thwarted by the Age Line.

Fawcett is penalized ten points by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] when she is caught hiding in a rose bush with one Mr. Stebbins at the Yule Ball.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Miss Fawcett was caught by Snape kissing Stebbins behind a Rose Bush during the Yule Ball, so it can be assumed she was going out with Stebbins.

== Analysis ==

One thing to be aware of here is that either there is some confusion over whether Miss Fawcett is in Ravenclaw or in Hufflepuff, or else there are two Misses Fawcett, one in each house. As noted above, Professor Dumbledore says &quot;Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw.&quot; At the Yule Ball, however, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] is wandering around the rose garden, blasting apart bushes, he flushes out a snogging couple, Fawcett and Stebbins. Addressing the fleeing girl, Snape says &quot;That's ten points from Hufflepuff, Fawcett!&quot;

Assuming there is only one Miss Fawcett, the fact that she had attempted to enter the Tournament would suggest that she is not quite of age, as Fred and George Weasley are; this puts her firmly either in the Twins' year, or in Harry's, as the Twins are approximately one year older than Harry.

As currently written, this is very US-centric. How can we rewrite it to be more international (i.e. English vs wronglish) without upsetting peoples' sensibilities (as it currently does)?

      <comment>the point is to have the recipe here. WB is not a collection of random links</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Sopas literally means soup but in Filipino cuisine it's a soup made with pasta, meat, vegetables and milk.

== Ingredients ==


* 250 grams chicken meat that are still attached to the bones. Using meat with bones will make the broth tastier without the use of bouillon cubes
* 3-4 cups water
* freshly ground black pepper
* 1 cup pasta (macaroni, gramigna, or any pasta you prefer)
* 1 tsp butter or olive oil if you want it to be healthier and tastier
* 1 bulb of onion , finely chopped
* 3 finely chopped cloves of garlic
* 1 carrot, diced
* half a head of cabbage, shredded
* 375ml or 1 1/2 cup evaporated milk
* salt and freshly ground black pepper. You can use fish sauce instead of salt for added magic

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oil in a pot.
# Sauté garlic and onion. Remember not to burn the garlic and onion. This will give your soup a burnt and bitter taste.
# Add in chicken, salt and pepper.Let it cook but don't let it brown. Browning the meat will give you a dark broth with an unpleasant taste.
# Pour in water. Let it boil.
# As soon as the water boils, the scum from the chicken will surface at the top. That scum actually comes from the blood of the chicken that has been cooked.
# Again, add salt and pepper. That is what is called &quot;layering&quot; in cooking. You have to season everything.
# Add the pasta. cook for 7 minutes or so.
# The pasta would have absorbed most of the salt by now so again you have to season it again with salt or fish sauce.
# dump in the carrots and cabbage. Mix Well
# Add in the milk but don't let it boil. Boiling will make the milk separate and ruin your creamy soup.
# Serve immediately because the pasta will absorb most of the milky broth if you let it stand too long.
# Enjoy!!!

==History of Satanism==
[[File:CompendiumMaleficarumEngraving24.jpg|thumbnail|300px|A wood engraving from the Compendium Maleficarum.]]
It is apparent from a study of history that the earliest forms of Satanism were in fact fabrications by various groups of Christians. Many of the erroneous beliefs about Satanists still believed today can be traced Medieval and Renaissance books such as [[w:Malleus Maleficarum|Malleus Maleficarum]] (''The Witch's Hammer'') (1486) by Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanis5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Church of Satan==
The Church of Satan was founded by [[w:Anton Szandor LaVey|Anton Szandor LaVey]] (1930-1997), author of ''The Satanic Bible'' (1969). In that book, LaVey argued that religions such as Christianity rejected the physical world; he was attempting to create a religion which uplifted it.

Other books written by LaVey on the subject include ''The Compleat Witch'' (1971), ''The Satanic Rituals'' (1972), ''The Devil's Notebook'' (1992),  and ''Satan Speaks!'' (1998). LaVey appointed Blanche Barton command of the church, and she assumed the role when he died in 1997.

==Newtonian Physics==
Isaac Newton formulated the Universal Law of Gravitation, the Laws of Motion, and calculus. The Universal Law of Gravitation is summed up in the formula

&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{GM_1M_2}{D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; are two masses, in kilograms, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant &lt;math&gt;6.67\cdot10^{-11}\frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the centers of the two masses, in meters. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is measured in Newtons.

Work is calculated with the formula

&lt;math&gt;W=FD&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is work (measured in Joules), &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is force (measured in Newtons), and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is distance (in meters).

'''Kinetic energy''' (energy of motion) is calculated by the formula

&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{1}{2}MV^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is mass (in grams), and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is velocity.

Newtonian relativity: A man is walking at 1 km/h, and he throws a ball at 3 km/h. To get the speed of the ball, simply add speeds: &lt;math&gt;1 km/h + 3 km/h&lt;/math&gt;.

The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, only transformed into one of its two forms: energy and matter.

==The Four Forces==
There are four forces in the universe: '''gravity''', which holds together galaxies and other massive structures; the '''electromagnetic''' force, which holds atoms together; the '''nuclear''' force, which holds atomic nuclei together; and the '''weak''' force, which is concerned with the transmutation of elements and radioactive decay. The nuclear force is the strongest, and gravity is the weakest. Without these forces, the universe would disintegrate.

The gravitational force causes mass to attract mass. More massive objects have a stronger gravitational field.

The electromagnetic force can be summed up by the phrase &quot;opposites attract&quot; and allows atoms to bond with each other creating the great variety of compounds that make our experience possible. The nucleus, with its positive charge, attracts negatively charged electrons. The electro- static force is calculated according to Coulomb's Law.

The power of the nuclear force depends on distance. At a distance of between one and 2*10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; meters, the force is attractive. However, if distance is too close (less than 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; meters), the force is repulsive; and at distances greater than 2*10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; meters, the force diminishes to zero.

==Atoms==
The '''atom''' was first postulated by the Greek philosopher Democritus. He believed that matter could not be split indefinitely. He believed that all matter was composed of connected particles which could be split apart, but could not be split themselves. These indestructible pieces are called atoms. The word comes from the Greek ''atomos'', which means &quot;uncuttable&quot;---''a'' (not) + ''tomos'' (to cut). [http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/AtomicStructure/Greeks.html]

The Periodic Table of Elements was created by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 (revised in 1871). The manmade elements are radioactive and have short half-lives.

Nuclear reactions are categorized as critical or supercritical. A critical reaction is one neutron in, one neutron out. A supercritical reaction is one neutron in, three neutrons out---releasing a terrific amount of energy. Supercritical reactions are used in atomic weaponry.

Nuclear fusion is a great source of energy, but requires temperatures of 1,000,000 Kelvins.

==Particles==
All atoms are composed of particles. Particles are characterized by '''mass''', '''charge''', and '''spin'''. A particle's spin is right-handed (counter-clockwise) or left-handed (clockwise).

At the center of the atom is the '''nucleus''', which contains a number of '''protons''' and '''neutrons''' about which the '''Electrons''' orbit. The force that keeps the electrons in orbit is the '''electric force'''; the force that keeps the nucleus together is the '''nuclear force'''.

In a neutral atom, there are equal amounts of protons and electrons. For example, Helium has two protons in its nucleus and two electrons orbiting its nucleus. It also has two neutrons in its nucleus. When there is more electrons than protons, or vice versa, then the atom is called an ion and it is more reactive with other ions and atoms because it has an overall net charge associated with it.

An electron has a negative (-) charge, a proton has a positive (+) charge. Neutrons, '''neutrinos''', and '''photons''' have no charge. The most massive of these is the neutron; it can decay into a proton, electron, and a neutrino. Particles are made up of '''quarks'''. The six types of quarks are up, down, strange, charmed, top, and bottom.

'''Antimatter''' was predicted by Paul Dirac. Every particle has an anti-particle, with the same mass, but an opposite charge and spin. There are anti-electrons/positron, anti-protons, anti-neutrinos, and anti-photons. (The anti-photon has the same spin as the photon.) When a particle meets its anti-particle, the result is mutual annihilation, and the creation of energy. The opposite is also true: when two photons meet, matter is created. This creation of matter is called &quot;pair production&quot;.

If there are antimatter stars; their light would be identical to that of matter stars, because the anti-photon is the same as the photon.

Astronomy studies the ''flow of energy'', and '''forces'''. Energy comes primarily from two sources: gravity from gaseous clouds collapsing to form stars and planets; and nuclear energy. The fusion that makes stars burn is one type of nuclear energy; another is the radioactive decay that heats the cores of planets.

Earth has a magnetic field. The core has a current. This field causes the Aurora Borealis.

The relationship of frequency and wavelength to the speed of light is shown in the formula

&lt;math&gt;f\lambda=C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is frequency, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is wavelength, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light.

A '''photon''' is a discrete packet of light energy. To calculate the energy of a photon, use the formula

&lt;math&gt;E=hf&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Planck's constant: 

&lt;math&gt;6.63\cdot10^{-34}J\cdot sec&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is frequency, which is in units of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{sec}&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein's famous equation, &lt;math&gt;E=MC^2&lt;/math&gt;, demonstrates that mass and energy can be converted into each other. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is ''energy'', &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is ''mass'', and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the ''speed of light'', &lt;math&gt;3\cdot10^8m/s&lt;/math&gt;.

==Spectroscopy==
&quot;The one thing that man will never know is the chemical composition of the stars.&quot; ---Auguste Comte, 19th century philosopher

He was wrong!

Kirchoff &amp; Bunsen discovered that individual elements burn with different colors. Different colors correspond to different wavelengths of light. The colors given off can be recorded on a photographic plate. This is called the elements' emission spectrum and it is unique to each and every known element. Therefore, any known element in the laboratory can be determined by investigation of its &quot;spectra&quot;.

An explanation of why different elements give off different wavelengths of light is needed to explain how the composition of stars can be determined. An individual element has a unique number of protons. If you were to follow the periodic table from left to right, you would find that for the first few lines the atomic number increases by one each time. Hydrogen is the smallest element as it has one proton. Helium is the next smallest, as it has two protons, and so on.
    
Each of these elements therefore has a different amount of electrons and protons. Assuming these elements are all neutral, each successive element consists of one more electron than the previous element. i.e. helium has two electrons, and hydrogen has one.
    
Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom. They can be described as having an energy level associated with them. The electrons in a particular element can only occupy a specific energy level or shell. When elements are heated, there is an input of energy, which is distributed to these electrons and they therefore move to a higher energy level. When this electron falls back to its original energy level, the energy gained by heat must be lost. The electron loses this energy by emitting a photon(a packet of light).
    
This photon will have exactly the right amount of energy needed to enable the electron to fall to its exact original state. This energy can be calculated using E=hf, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the individual photon. While it seems odd that a particle would have a frequency, it does due to wave-particle duality.
   
From above, it can be seen that each element, because each has electrons that only occupy certain energy levels, that the frequency of the photon emitted can only have certain values.
    
From the equation c = f * lambda, where c is the speed of light, which is nearly always the same, f is the frequency and lambda is the wavelength, it can be seen that because c is constant, each element, by only emiting photons with certain frequencies, gives off photons with certain wavelengths and therefore colors.

It is impossible to use the laboratory technique of defining elements by using their emission spectrum because the light that we receive from the stars is a combination of colors. There is however, another way. If we were to view the emission spectra of the sun, for example, there would be no signature &quot;barcodes&quot; of individual elements, rather, there would appear a continuous spectrum, like a rainbow on paper. This &quot;continuous&quot; spectrum will have a few black lines, where the wavelength of light has been absorbed rather than been emitted by the Sun's photosphere. It is from these, that we can deduce a stars chemical composition.

It was discovered that the black lines in the continuous spectrum of a star corresponded exactly to the emission lines of certain elements. Their presence in the star is suggested because those elements emit light of the same wavelength that is absorbed and hence, shows as a telltale black line. It receives this light in a concentrated beam but emits it in all directions. If you imagine the light rays as a 20 pack of javelins hitting an element in a certain place, the element will throw these javelins back out individually, into the surroundings so that the amount of light emitted in the direction of Earth is minute or non-existent, and hence we observe dark lines in the emission spectrum.

==The Quantum Model of the Atom==
'''Quantum physics''' is a relatively new branch of physics that deals with very small objects, such as atoms and quarks. It follows different rules than classical (or &quot;Newtonian&quot;) physics. While Newtonian physics assumes that energy can be continually divided and holds that an object can have an arbitrarily small amount of energy energy, quantum physics deals with objects that emit or absorb discrete packets of energy known as quanta that cannot be further divided. Classical physics assumes a continuum whereas quantum physics assumes the universe is discrete.

Max Planck is considered the &quot;father of Quantum Theory&quot;.

In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr used Ernest Rutherford's research on the atomic nucleus and Max Planck's quantum hypothesis to create a quantum theory of atoms. This theory stated that an atom's electrons move only in definite orbits. When a hydrogen atom emits an Hα photon, the electron drops to a lower orbit. When a hydrogen atom receives a photon, it jumps to a higher orbit.
[[Image:Bohr_Model.svg|right|thumb|200px|Niels Bohr's model of an atom.]]

The '''hydrogen spectrum''' has been studied for ultraviolet (the '''Lyman series''') and visible light ('''Balmer series'''). In the Lyman emission series, the electron drops from a higher orbital to the n=1 orbit. In the Balmer emission series, it drops from a higher orbital to the n=2 orbit. (n=1 is the lowest energy state, or orbit, of an electron, called the '''principal quantum number.''') The energy change produced as an electron moves from n=2 to n=1, results in the emission by the electron of a photon of energy 10.2 eV and appears in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum. The energy change produced as an electron moves from n=3 to n=2, results in the emission (H-alpha) by the electron of a photon of energy 1.89 eV and appears in the red part of the spectrum.

The energy levels in a hydrogen atom, can be calculated by:
&lt;math&gt;E_n = \frac {-13.6eV}{n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the electron's orbit.

In 1929, Prince Louis de Broglie won the Nobel Prize for his theory of matter waves.

== Albert Einstein and the Theory of Relativity ==

Einstein's Principle of Equivalence demonstrated that gravity causes space to curve. He discovered that the curvature of space determines how matter will move. Thus gravity can be thought of as a consequence of the &quot;shape&quot; of the universe rather than a force vector. This is Einstein's Law of Motion. Under the theory of General relativity light should also be affected by gravity. This phenomenon has been observed by studies of gravitational lensing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''solar cycle''' is the repeating rise and fall of &quot;solar activity&quot; (which see). This consists of a roughly 11-year cycle in which the numbers of sunspots rises to a maximum and then falls back to some minimum level. Actually the exact time period has varied, from about 7 to about 13 or 14 years, and the maximum number of sunspots varies as well. Some cycles are more &quot;active&quot; than others. 

Shortly after each maximum, the magnetic polarity of the sunspots reverses and it maintains that polarity until the next maximum, roughly 11 years later. Thus the solar cycle is not just 11 years, but 22 years since after 22 years the magnetic polarity returns to approximately its original configuration.

The cycle is sometimes unpredictable. During the Maunder Minimum, solar activity was drastically reduced for about fifty years. In 2008, the then current sunspot minimum was noted as the &quot;quietest&quot; in 50 years. As of late 2009, solar activity began a slow increase.

While the sunspot cycle is certainly related to other activity on and in the Sun, many attempts have been made to relate it to various cycles on the Earth ranging from the quality of wines to fashion trends and the stock market. No such relation has been proven, and in fact no strong relation between the sunspot cycle and earthly weather patterns has yet been conclusively shown. 

The period of Maunder Minimum, from about the middle of the 17th through the early part of the 18th centuries, was attended by abnormally cool and damp weather worldwide. Attempts have been made to correlate this climatic aberration to the absence of sunspots, but if the relation is real, no causal mechanism has been identified.

In addition, one tentative relation to temperature variation in an upper layer of Earth's atmosphere appears likely, but no other direct and predictable relation has yet been shown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even a small ERP has a hundred data tables.  A large, full-function one has thousands.  The following list covers the major groups of tables. [[/Supporting Tables | Supporting Tables]] covers the minor tables and [[/Parameters | Parameters]] cover the miscellaneous options and values for each module.

Note that the definition of these tables is not complete in that we do not include field length or format (i.e. we define &quot;Customer Number&quot; but we do not say how long it is, whether it is divided into segments, or whether it is numeric or alphanumeric).  For the purposes of this document, that amount of detail is not necessary.

Since many tables are used by more than one module, the tables are listed in alphabetical order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A &quot;module&quot; is a group of related programs performing a major function within an ERP.  Since there is no particular order that makes sense, we have chosen to list the modules in alphabetical order.  Some of the decisions about what constitutes a module are arbitrary.  Since an ERP is designed to accommodate a variety of industries, not every enterprise would use every module.

[[/Layout | Module Documentation Layout]] describes how the information about each module is organized.

An ERP package is composed of the following modules:

Finance and Performance Management
*[[/Accounts Payable | Accounts Payable]]
*[[/Accounts Receivable | Accounts Receivable]]
*[[/Bank Reconciliation | Bank Reconciliation]]
*[[/Cash Management | Cash Management]]

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:17, 15 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Currency defines the valid currencies for the system and keeps tracks of their conversion rates.  This information is used by General Ledger to determine gains and losses on exchange.  Most ERP packages have a Currency module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Tables ==
The group of tables consists of the Currency table which contains one record for every currency used by the ERP and the Currency Rate table which contains one record for every conversion rate for every currency.  There is at least one conversion record for every currency and there can be many.
==Data Exchange==
Currency does not send or receive transactions to/from other modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) package is a computer software package that integrates all departments and functions within an enterprise into a single, integrated system that maintains a single, integrated set of data. Any transaction entered in one area causes an immediate update in related areas.  An ERP enables departments to share information and communicate with each other much better and more quickly using one consistent set of numbers available to all users.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A bill of materials (BOM) lists the quantity of raw materials and parts that are required to manufacture a product.  Often the BOM includes the quantity of operations (cutting, welding, machining, etc.) that is required as well.  Each line on a BOM can itself be a BOM.

      <comment>what about linking a mosimage to another image?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is useful, but what about having the image link to a larger version of itself? This is a very common practice and I think one of the mosimage parameters should be an optional choice of *another* image from the library that it will link to when clicked.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==
This scene follows the advice of [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Modeling Realistically]], which suggests modeling with multiple parts that have been measured carefully, just like they were constructed.

The cans consist of four aluminum parts:

* pull-tab

* rivet

* press-shaped cap

* concave-bottomed cylinder

This simplified the UV-layout work on the can too, since only one part needed any UV coordinates.

The floor consists of many identical copies of the same board, rotated randomly for variation.

The glass is one mesh, with an inside and an outside surface.  This helps the raytracer give realistic curvature effects near the lip of the glass.

This skateboard is modeled using techniques recommended in [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Modeling Realistically]].  The deck, wheels, alloy trucks, nuts, grip area, sidewalk and weeds were all different objects using various materials.  This gives the most flexibility for any changes to be made later.

''This project is in its infancy and all progressive structural amendments are welcomed. To discuss anything related to this series of textbooks, please use the [[User_talk:User:Herraotic/Mathematics in volumes|talk page]]''

== Scope ==
The scope of 'Mathematics in volumes' is to provide a free, in both meanings of the word, textbook series.
The series will cover the introduction to the form of a number and what it represents all the way to hyperbolic functions.

== Intended reading ==
The intended reading order is to initially examine the pupil with a test provided that is referenced to his age. If the pupil receives a score under 80 percent, the student should undertake that corresponding textbook until the pupil scores over 80 percent. If the student fails an initial test, 4a for example, they should do 4b or 4c. If they fail both, they must undergo the initial test again receiving at least 90 percent or over, the cycle reoccurs by increasing by 5 percent, though at a point of failing to receive the required 100 percent the student will be demoted to an easier textbook. The corresponding question textbooks should be used with the general textbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This '''[[Wikijunior|Wikijunior]]''' book is designed to teach you, in less than a year, all of the mathematics you'll need to pass a lower level college.

Not everyone has the good fortune to be taught their numbers and letters before entering kindergarten, but everyone can learn to do math well.

This book begins at the beginning.  It assumes you know how to read, nothing else.  (If you have trouble reading this, you need to learn reading first, but you can work on math, too, if you have someone to read to you.)

The book is organized in a series of short lessons.  Each lesson starts by saying what it is designed to teach.  If you already know what that lesson is designed to teach, skip to the next lesson.  '''Do not skip any lesson you are not absolutely certain you know'''.  Every lesson builds on what has gone before.

If you want more instruction, especially gearing up for college, read [[Wikijunior:More_on_Mathematics|More on Mathematics]]. It was made for the average reader to be able to understand it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This group of tables control who can log on to the company and what functions they can perform.  Each user can be assigned one or more roles (such as Purchasing Agent) which gives them access to a variety of functions.  This allows the Systems Administrator to define a limited set of roles and allocate those roles to a large group of users.  In smaller enterprises, the Systems Administrator would simply assign functions to each user directly.

The contents of these tables are encrypted to increase security.

== User ==
This table contains one record for every user that can log into this company.

Used by: Every function in every module

Key: User Number

Fields:
*User Number (a unique number assigned by the ERP package)
*User Name
*User Password
*Password Expiry Date
*Minimum Password Length
*Inactive (Yes/No)
*Employee Number
*Language
*Notes

== Role ==
This table contains one record for each role.

Used by: Every function in every module

Key: Role Number

Fields:
*Role Number
*Role Description
*Notes

== User Role ==
This table contains one record for each role each user has.

Used by: Every function in every module

Key: User Number, Role Number

Fields:
*User Number
*Role Number

== User Access ==
This table contains one record for every function the user can perform in this company.  Although this is how the data is stored, the ERP uses a more compact format for efficiency reasons.

Used by: Every function in every module

Key: User Number, Function Number

Fields:
*User Number
*Function Number
*Type of Access

== Role Access ==
This table contains one record for every function the role can perform in this company.  Although this is how the data is stored, the ERP uses a more compact format for efficiency reasons.

Used by: Every function in every module

Key: Role Number, Function Number

Fields:

      <text xml:space="preserve">This includes a group of tables.  They are listed below:

*[[/Customer | Customer]]
*[[/Customer Interaction | Customer Interaction]]
*[[/Customer Location | Customer Location]]
*[[/Customer Person | Customer Person]]

In some enterprises customers are individual people.  In others, they are other enterprises with one or more locations and contacts.  Finally, many enterprises have a mixture of both individuals and enterprises.  This group of tables is structured so that each customer can have one or more locations that have one or more contacts to accommodate all three possibilities.

'''Donors''' 
In the case of not-for-profit enterprises &quot;donors&quot; are &quot;customers&quot; (i.e. the source of revenue).  They use fund-raising, grant management, and donor management to raise funds.

Should probably have some sort of disambig for common Australian contraction of ''potato scallop'' to ''scallop''. Such things are discs of mashed potato that have been battered and deep-fried; great if you want your fats, carbs and salt all in one nasty tasting hit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once again the New Year had come and with it a New Valentine is approaching. The big greeting card companies as well as retails are advertising to buy a Diamond for your Sweetheart and make that special one happy with a reservation on such and such big restaurant name and surprise her by sending dozens of roses to her door step. Retails have always have plans for your valets. But do you really know what Valentine is? Let’s shine some lights on this important matter.

     Valentine was a Christian Priest whom lived during Claudius II on the third century A.D. These were thought times for Christians since they were consider traitor. Emperor of Rome was against anyone whom was worshiping some other entity. Many Christians suffered unbearable torture and death. Valentine and his fellow believers met secretly in different places including caves. The legend has it that Valentine sent heart shape cart cut out of parchment to comfort the unfortunate imprisoned Christians.

     Emperor Claudius was a selfish man; he banned marriage among his soldiers. Claudius believed that his soldiers have to have one devotion ant that was only him. Married soldiers will have his devotion reduced because of wife and children. So, Valentine performed the hold marriage vow in secret. When Claudius found out about this great importance became so outraged that he declared Valentine an enemy of state. By the order of empire Valentine was arrested and thrown into the horrible jail for years.

    One day the good priest was dragged before the Roman emperor Claudius. The charge of being good Christian was accepted by the devoted priest. Claudius was very curious by now. So, he asked the priest to speak about his Christian beliefs. The good Priests knowledge won the admiration of Claudius. But Valentine hurried to convert Claudius to Christianity which made the king very furious. Valentine advised Claudius to give up the false goods made of woods and stones and worship the one true God. Everyone at the king’s palace was outraged. The senators condemned Valentine to death. Claudius whom was impressed by Valentine spared his life by turning him over to his trusted lieutenant Asterius. He ordered Asterious to force Valentine renounce his beliefs in true one God, and worships the Roman goods. The lieutenant took Valentine to his home and showered him with kindness. But neither kindness nor harsh treatments changed Valentine’s belief in true God.

    In Asterius household Valentine encountered the young daughter of Asterius whom was blind from both eyes. Astrerius told the good priest of many visits to Apollo temple. All the prayers and all the trips to different shrine were no use. Her eye sight was not restored. Valentine asked Asterius persmission to resotre his daughter’s eye sights. At first Asterius pleaded to Valentine not to expose his daughter to another disappointment. At the end Asterius gave in and with the permission of Asterius the prayer begun.” A light filled the room, and the young lady was given the gift of sight.” 

     The girl’s father was stunned; he was convinced the Valentine’s true God is more powerful and mighty than Roman God. Asterious, his family, as well as his slaves were baptized by St. Valentine. The news of Asterious bet real of Roman god reached Claudius. He sentenced Asterieus and his entire household including St. Valentine to death.

     On February 14TH around the year 270 A.D. St. Valentine was taken outside the city to the Flaminian Gate. There he was beheaded and buried. Ever since then the name of the Gate changed to Valentine’s Gate; an unknown person planted an almond tree, a symbol of love and friendship near Valentines’ grave. The almond tree blooms’ every year on February 14T; to cherish the memory of a great saint lets remember him on Valentines Day.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;With the exception of light, waves are undulations in some material medium.&quot; Don't all fundamental particles exist as waves like light? Even without the quantum phenomena, there are still other electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, that are only different from light due to their wavelength.

For light, read electromagnetic radiation. But that's somewhat complex for this level of student.

Also, gravity waves are not transmitted by a media(?) or am I wrong.</text>

''OK, you've heard of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and you've heard of peanut butter toast. Why not combine them?!''

==Ingredients==

* 1 slice of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 2-4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]], smooth or crunchy, whatever you like.
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] [[Cookbook:Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]]

==Procedure==

# [[cookbook:toast|Toast]] the bread in a [[Cookbook:Oven|toaster oven]], using the broiler, one side, then the other.
# Smear the peanut butter on the bread. ''C'mon, now, this is not rocket science!''
# Sprinkle chocolate chips lightly (or heavily, if you want!) on the peanut butter.
# Put the toast back under the broiler for about 20 seconds.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If you don't like this, there's sompin' wrong wich-ya!
* Some people like to spread the chocolate chips, after softening under the broiler.
* A variation that I like is to spread marshmallow fluff over the peanut butter and replace the chocolate chips with a Nestles' crunch bar, and I use 2 toasts and make it a sandwich.
* Instead of heating the chocolate under the broiler, add cold chocolate chips (from the refrigerator) for a nice temperature contrast.
* According to taste, use milk, dark, semisweet, or white chocolate chips.

==Uses==

* I like it for late breakfast, but there ''NEVER'' has to be a reason for chocolate!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{unstable}}

Not all content is suitable for [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks]], and occasionally some content (including books and individual book pages) need to be deleted. Wikibookians are expected to follow this policy when performing deletion-related activities (including undeletion requests).

== Deletion ==
[[WB:WIW|Wikibooks]] is for the creation of free open-context textbooks. If a book or page does not aid the development of textbooks, violate policy or no longer have a functioning of the project (including, user pages, help pages, policy pages, discussion pages, uploaded files, and any other meta-content pages), can be tagged for deletion, speedily or by way of a [[WB:RFD|Request for Deletion]] (community discussion). During the evaluation discussion toward a local deletion, the content can also be proposed for tranwiki to a more appropriate wiki or a merge merge with another local page. 

New books and pages should be treated with tolerance and understanding. Since they cannot be expected to immediately adhere to every minute detail of Wikibooks policy and inclusion criteria. Meaningful content should not be nominated for transwiki, delete or speedy deletion until at least a month after it has been created and some effort made to improve the content or helping new contributors to understand what needs to be done.

Deletion is not the same as removing all content from a page, which adds an entry to the page's history and anyone can undo. Deletion removes both the content of the page and the entire page history from public view and only [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] can undo it. Keeping track of deletions can be hard if done too casually. Deletion decisions are not to be taken lightly.

Page blanking might be vandalism, an attempt to deal with vandalism, or an attempt to delete a page for whatever reasons.  The first two can be fixed by restoring a revision free of vandalism.  The last may qualify for speedy deletion depending on the situation; if you want a second opinion, you may make a [[#Requests for deletion|request for deletion]].

=== What to keep or delete ===
What is considered ''meaningful content'' is open to some interpretation and differs depending on the namespace. Use your best judgment when deciding to nominate books or pages for transwiki or deletion. Content is generally not considered meaningful if it does not contribute to the project or add value to readers. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

{{columns-list|2|
* '''Keep''' works that could become acceptable if [[:Category:Pages needing attention|improved]]. Even stubs and works that are biased, inaccurate, disorganized or abandoned can be improved. You can either improve works yourself or [[Wikibooks:Templates/Maintenance|identify the problems]] so someone else can.
* '''Keep''' books of any size that are within scope. Books don't need to be a certain size to be useful to readers or educators.
* '''Keep''' material that can be reused as part of another work or could be used to start a new book or page.
* '''Keep''' pages that are within the scope of the book there in, unless nominated for deletion due to a general consensus decision by the book contributors. In this situation, please note the location of the relevant discussion that occurred regarding the deletion.
* '''Delete''' works that are clearly outside [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks' scope]] and has no reasonable chance of every being constructive. This includes works that consist of nonsense, spam, [[WB:ATTACK|personal attacks]], praises, personal information without the person's content, test edits or [[WB:DWV|vandalism]].
* '''Delete''' contents and media confirmed to be copyright violations. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Copyright_infringements|Copyright infringements]] for reporting copyright violations or suspected copyright violations (Read [[m:Wikipedia and copyright issues|Wikipedia and copyright issues]] and [[m:Avoid Copyright Paranoia|Avoid Copyright Paranoia]] for perspective).
* '''Delete''' materials and media that violate any of Wikibooks' official policies or guidelines, unless there is a good reason not to.
* '''Delete''' reposts of works previously deleted where deletion was due to consensus and no consensus to undelete was established on [[WB:RFU|requests for undeletion]].
* '''Delete''' imported works not adopted after 30 days which duplicates work found at another Wikimedia project.
}}

Use common sense and [[WB:FAITH|assume good faith]]. Always check the page's history to make sure bad material didn't replace good material. If this is the case, revert the bad material instead of nominating for deletion.

=== Transwiki ===
To nominate a page or book for transwiki to another wiki, add {{tlx|transwiki|&lt;suggested wiki&gt;}} to the top of the page or the main page of the book. The page or book will then appear in [[:Category:Pages for transwiki]]. Any user can transwiki a page or book out of Wikibooks, so long as they follow the rules and policies of the destination wiki. After being transwikied, if the contents is outside [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks' scope]], the page or book can be speedily deleted, and the page or main page of the book replaced with a temporary link to the new location. Otherwise simply remove the transwiki notice once the transwiki is finished.

Keep in mind that work from Wikibooks cannot legally be transwikied to a place that uses a license different from CC-BY-SA.

=== Speedy deletions ===
To nominate a book or page for speedy deletion, add {{tlx|delete|&lt;your personal justification for a speedy deletion&gt;}} to the top of the page or the main page of the book. The book or page will then appear in [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]] for administrators to address when time is available. Any book or page may not be renominated for speedy deletion if its nomination is removed in [[WB:FAITH|good faith]]. Books or pages may instead be nominated for deletion using requests for deletion as described below.

Some redirect pages can become candidates for speedy deletion as well. Redirects can be considered for deletion if they:

#Are the result of page moves to a better naming convention
#Where created in error or as the result of vandalism
#Are so obscure or poorly named that they are likely never to be found in a search

=== Requests for deletion ===
Books and pages that fit the [[#What to keep or delete|criteria for deletion]] listed above, and are not necessarily speedy deletion candidates, can be listed for discussion at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]], using the book or page's name as a title, so that other [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] can have a chance to argue for or against its removal. RfDs are not intended to determine exceptions to policy but to establish a project failure to comply with them, including cases where the policy text may not be clear by intention or omission. Please include a justification for deletion, and sign/date your justification with four tildes, '''&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', or similar. In addition, add {{tlx|rfd}} to the top of the page or the main page of the book. The book or page will then appear in [[:Category:Requests for deletion]]. At this time, the discussion process begins using the '''high impact''' [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making]] rules. During a RfD, the community should evaluate the work on it's conformance to our [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]], and our other content-related policies. Other metrics may be used as well, but it is important that works not be kept if they are in violation of one or more policies.

Once community consensus has been reached on the matter, the work will either be kept or delete, depending on the outcome of the discussion. The outcome of a RfD decision may be used to update the inclusion criteria. Works that are kept may have {{tlx|rfd-survived}} added to the top of their discussion page. Works that are to be deleted may have {{tlx|Impending Doom}} added to the top of their page, to alert contributors of the community's decision and to give contributors time to find a more suitable home for the works contents.

Administrators are able to delete pages from Wikibooks that manifestly do not belong here, regardless of the outcome of a discussion on RfD. In practice, such actions ''should be extremely rare'', and should never be performed without strong justifications and significant forethought.

Books and pages which have survived a deletion using this process should not be nominated again unless new information comes to light that was not brought up in the previous discussion, or the situation for keeping the work has changed.

=== Requests for undeletion ===

=== Nominations as Vandalism ===
One thing to keep in mind with a deletion and undeletion nominations is that it may be added as an [[WB:DWV|act of vandalism]], or as a part of an edit war between two contributors who may not like each other. In situations like this it would be considered appropriate to remove {{tlx|delete}}, {{tlx|Impending Doom}} and/or {{tlx|rfd}} from the book or page in question, as well as any discussion on the matter from [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] or [[WB:RFU|Wikibooks:Requests for undeletion]], with perhaps a note that the discussion was terminated because it was started as a means of vandalism, even if legitimate arguments for or against keeping were subsequently posted. If afterwards a serious objection is still being raised, the discussion can resume.

== Guidelines for administrators ==
In addition to [[#What to keep or delete|What to keep or delete]], administrators are expected to follow some guidelines when making the decision to delete or not:

# If another solution has been found rather than deletion, leave them listed on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] for a short while, so the original poster can see why it wasn't deleted, and what did happen to it. This will prevent reposting of the same item. Alternately, leave a message on their user page explaining the verdict of the deletion process.
# As a general rule, ''don't'' delete pages you nominate for deletion, let someone else do it.
# When in doubt, don't delete. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion or to turn a speedy delete into a [[WB:RFD|RfD discussion]]. It is better to get community input than indiscriminate deleting on the part of administrators.
# Give contributors time to move meaningful contents outside Wikibooks' scope before deleting or email them a copy of the work.  Once it becomes known that consensus has been reached to delete or that the page meets the [[WB:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]], place {{tlx|Impending Doom}} on the page to warn them.
# Simply deleting a page does ''not'' automatically delete its talk page, any subpages or redirects. Please delete these pages too.
# Books may also have templates and categories that may also need to be deleted. Please delete these too.
# Use common sense, and respect the judgment and feelings of other Wikibookians.

Administrators necessarily must use their best judgment to determine when rough consensus has been reached. Consensus is not defined as being a simple voting majority, nor does it require 100% agreement of all parties. Comments from all parties must be weighed and considered in light of [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks' scope]] and policies. If no consensus is reached, the page will be kept by default, unless deletion is imposed by policy. Wikibookians are obligated to act primarily in accordance with previously community approved policies (for example, on copyright). 

When an administrator deletes a test page or other page with no useful content, it is a good idea to put a note on the author's talk page explaining things, pointing them to the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] in cases of tests. Be friendly! Everyone was new once. In the case of anon IP users this is not as important as they have likely moved on or their IPs changed since that edit.</text>

To simplify things and to make it easier to find the voting area, I've restarted the whole policy vote and will advertise it much better this time.  The policy has been changed slightly as well, so it does need a whole new vote if just for that alone.

For the vote, please go to:

[[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Deletion Policy]]

and cast your opinion on the whole thing.  I find it unlikely that it would not be approved by Wikibookians, but I've been surprised in the past by things like this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== doctor m-pov ==
*''multiple pov''  ;
*There is a very fine line and a very difficult one here involving the subjects which a lot of people would like to consider themselves  experts on but in which in fact they are just hobbyist babblers. I myself sometimes cross that line probably in subjects which i don't have the serious info on. For instance, what i actually know about Rocket science might fit into a shoebox scribbled on cardboard scraps.   What I know about Psychonautics or Psychology is another thing, and the fact that I have serious knowledge on a few topics gives me the perspective to know the difference. Many people don't know the difference, and the anti-intellectualism rampant in our society doesn't serve to let them know.   
*The solution to your problem is to have well developed on site documents generated by the community on the topics which are POV   
problematic. This probably includes '''Sociology, Psychology, Political Science, Religion, Philosophy, Ethics, Morality, and Metaphysics'''.    
I would love to write a book on each of the above, but that is back   
burner stuff compared to THINKSTARSHIP. I could offer to generate   
a start-up of stubs, but honestly, the problem here is that there   
are too few Wikibookians and too many cranks in the world. This place has been swallowed in the mire of the form of groupthink which is just the back up of how long it takes for you guys to find and read and sort what you have. On the other hand, Wikipedia is chok full of people. The solution here is for Jimbo to make a general plea on Wikipedia for people to come over here and help us with the back up. Otherwise, starting 10 books as a way to chill the system is going to backfire, and we will just end up with a lot more crackpottery on top of the stuff we have. Allow me to interpret a bitin my own mind what i think Jimbos smart interests are. This place as just a library of any old material is going to quickly become the kind of crackpottery asylum that the rest of the internet rots inside of. The only rational way to insure the success of this endeavor is to limit the primary scope specifically to factual materials. I am sure that once we have bookshelves full of hardcore and serious information on most subjects, Jimbo will be a lot more likely to okay something a little more adventurous. Coming up with a fact based approach to Religion (As a for instance) is not as easy to do as what you might think considering that it can be expressed in a single sentence. Some moments, I'd like to become a super troll and hit 10000 articles on wikipedia with the simple statement &quot;THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS NEUTRAL POV!&quot; (There isn't. Epistomology tells us that we can approach finer and finer levels of subjectivity towards objectivity, but kind of like time dilation in black holes, you can never reach the goal of being truly objective. Tools for getting us closer to objectivity are great, but we have to admit that even they are subjective applications of subjective principles.) Because I started this with the prfix &quot;doc&quot; I feel I have to leave you with the solution. POV Problematic topics like the ones I listed above should be studied here by specific axiom. That means catching up on the logic textbook. It means an article which is about a single statement, its linkages to assorted paradigms, its truth vale, its linkages in relationship to other axioms, its linkages in terms of syllogisms to other axioms, its history, its politics, and anything else that is relevant. Otherwise, we end up as a noise mirror of Beliefnet.com (Which is a helluva lot of noise and very little content.) If you go look at the aforementioned internet site, one thing that will not be readilly apparent is that there are really only 50 paradigms each juggling only a few hundred primary, and a few thousand auxillary axioms. Me an a good bot programmer could convert all of that noise by re-sorting Beliefnet according to where specific axioms pop up. What the Bot would find is that a specific axiom has been used probably close to a million times on bnet. What this tells us is that noise is easilly covered up quickly by more noise.   
*As far as all of the deleting goes, I think it is great to delete something that you know you have a better treatment of, and a clear sign of a big hole that the next ignorant hobbyist will fill if it   
just vanishes. Rather than madly deleting things, consider putting them in a POV bin, labeling them, disclaimng them, and asking the public to participate in appropriate vivisection, sorting, organization, and research, so that a better thing can be created.

== Stub Deletion Policy ==
I'm trying to think of where the best place to argue this point, but I'm going to request that the policy discussion take place on [[Wikibooks talk:Stub#Stub Deletion Policy]] instead.  This is just a notice that the discussion is taking place there.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

==Video and game walkthroughs==
I propose that all new books that are &quot;video and game walkthroughs&quot; are suitable for speedy deletion (see [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge|Staff Lounge]] for details, but essentially Jimbo is saying that Wikibooks shouldn't be hosting them). Whilst time should be given to remove existing books to a suitable alternative location, it makes sense to nuke new ones at birth. I would suggest that anyone deleting a book under this criterion should leave a message on the author's page explaining why it is being deleted, and offering to keep the page available for a week to allow that author to copy text for his own records, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:09, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
: If deletion of all game walkthroughs is consensus, then I think speedying new ones makes perfect sense. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:32, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

==Further amendments==
I've made a number of further amendments (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ADeletion_policy&amp;diff=462789&amp;oldid=422225 this diff] that I think are needed for this proposal to be ready to be enforced. I'd now be happy to make this switch (though no doubt others may wish to comment before allowing the policy to go final (although it could, of course, still be amended after going final)), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:43, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:I looked at your changes, and I have to admit that I don't like some of them. First off, many VfD discussions are ended by majority vote, and it makes no sense to change that fact, without first defining what &quot;concensus&quot; means in this case. Must we reach 100% agreement before acting at VfD, or should an admin just go with the jist of things? Before stating how VfD should not be resolved, we should start listing the specific ways that it can be resolved. Also, I don't like your wording of the &quot;personal essay&quot; clause, it adds too much ambiguity, and ignores the original purpose of that point: to try and preserve information that was posted in error on wikibooks, and otherwise would be a candidate for speedy deletion. Other then those two points, I agree with all your other changes and wordings. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

:: If VFDs are being decided by a majority vote, then the admins administering the decision are doing it wrong. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:35, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
:::Yes, VfDs should not be closed with a simple majority. Consensus on most Wikimedia projects is defined more as a supermajority (roughly 75%). --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
::::Then somewhere we should specifically define what a supermajority is, precisely what a concensus is, and exactly what the rules are for ending a vote, so that there is no ambiguity. Don't say that one way of doing things is wrong without proposing an alternative. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:06, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

::::: Consensus is not tied to a precise number, though on WP &quot;rough consensus&quot; is usually set at around 80%. The consensus process is illustrated in [[:Image:Consensus2.png]]. Coming to consensus about an issue (deletion, policy, textual changes) involves following this process. The gist of it is: act in good faith, treat dissenters with respect and try to resolve their concerns; if the community is unable to resolve their concerns, it can ignore them, but this should be avoided when possible. This also requires a large majority; the higher the better; the lowest percentage probably being around 75%, depending upon the circumstances.

== Add old redirect pages to speedy deletion ==
According to [[Wikibooks:naming policy|naming policy]] the Book:Chapter naming convention is no longer allowed. Could we add pages that have been moved to a corresponding Book/Chapter page, to the list of parameters needed for speedy deletions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

:Assuming all bad links and redirects are fixed, I think it is safe to say that old redirects, that are unused, may be speedily deleted. If we can get more people to agree on this measure, we can add it to policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
:: One huge problem I've seen with automatically deleting almost all redirects (something [[User:Jguk]] has been doing for quite some time) is that some redirects do have some value.... at least at the book level.  I don't mind that most redirects to individual chapters/sub-modules get deleted routinely as it seems unlikely that most pages would not be referenced after there is a page move.  Still, it is a very good idea to scan the &quot;what links here&quot; to see if any content points to that page first.  For some very popular Wikibooks, it might be useful to see if any external links reference the redirect by doing a google search, but that is something to worry about on a case by case basis.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
::: Oh, yes. Sorry. I should have mentioned the criteria that all links must have been updated.  How is:
::::''A redirect page that does not conform with [[Wikibooks:naming policy]] if all links to it have been updated.''
::: Suggesting that external links be checked is a good idea. Perhaps there could be a section at [[Wikibooks:naming policy|naming policy]] on speedy deletion of the books that confirm with the old convention, that would mention this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:44, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

::::I like the sound of that, and it makes good practical sense. I can forsee some dissenting opinions, from people who think that &quot;less is more&quot;, and that admins should have the freedom to delete a useless page without being instructed to do so. Either way, I'll put a note up at [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], to let people know that we are considering an addition to the policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

::::: Really? I understand &quot;less is more&quot; but their freedom is hardly reduced since the Deletion polciy doesn't ''order'' the deletion. That aside, I personally just wanted it so that petty &quot;ordinary&quot; editors such as I could quickly delete the pages by alerting someone with the proper priveleges. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

::: Sounds reasonable to me. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:20, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

With seemingly a consensus and no comments in the last ten days, I've updated the policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:26, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
:As with the complaints I had when I deleted the Wikimania 2005 proceedings, there is also the issue of external links pointing to Wikibooks from external websites other than Wikibooks.  This should be part of the deletion process, and doesn't necessarily require a full VfD, but does require some care on the part of the admin performing such actions.  At the very least, using the &quot;What links here&quot; should be used, as well as perhaps a google search using the &quot;link:&quot; tool to find what links to the page being deleted (see [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=link%3Aen.wikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FBlender_3D%253A_Noob_to_Pro&amp;btnG=Search this example]).  There are other tools, including the Wikimedia tool server that can help out here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

:: Hate to bring up an old topic, but I would prefer a redirect to a deletion. Deletes don't save any space on the server, while redirects take care of links outside of wikibooks, and bookmarks on forums or other people's computers. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:01, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

::: Feel free. Issues shouldn't be left faulty just because they are old.
::: I understand your argument for redirects, most of the old convention pages probably aren't linked to by anything. Wikibooks isn't all that well known yet and while backwards compatibility is worthwhile, cleaning up unused pages to make tools such as [[Special:Prefixindex]] (and {{tl|autoTOC}}) more useful is a reasonable justification.
::: Actually, on the deletion argument, I'm afraid I'll have to reveal my ignorance: I was under the impression that the software purged deleted pages &amp;mdash; permanently removing them from the db &amp;mdash; after a while or only kept a certain number of the most recent ones. Is this incorrect? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:: In my suggestion for the policy change, &quot;''if all links to it have been updated.''&quot; was meant to also refer to external links. Perhaps this should be made more explicit? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
::: I just noticed that this is mentioned on the policy page. Do you have any suggestions about rewording that, or is it a modification that came after your comment above? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== state where it is more on-topic ==
Rather than arbitrary[1] deletion of things people write that don't quite fit into wikibooks,
it would [[Wikibooks:Be nice|Be nice]] to point out (to those people) some other location(s) where people enjoy that sort of thing.

:[1] decided by a judge or arbiter, rather than by a law or statute. Why isn't this in [[wiktionary:arbitrary]]?

I would like to recommend that when people post a notice on [[WB:VFD]], 
they not only put a notice on the corresponding page telling of its proposed deletions,
but also include a link to one (or more) other wiki where that sort of thing is more on-topic.

Should that link go on the soon-to-be-deleted page, or in WB:VFD ?

By ''more on-topic'', I don't expect a deletionist person to be familiar enough with all 3494 other wiki to know exactly which wiki is dedicated to that particular topic.

I merely expect the deletionist person to be familiar enough with at least 2 other wiki, so you can say &quot;this sort of thing would be more on-topic at ''that'' wiki&quot;.

It doesn't exactly have to be on-topic at that wiki either. The people at that wiki can forward it to some ''other'' wiki where it is &quot;more on-topic than here&quot;.

Hopefully that document (and the people who wrote it) will eventually find some wiki where it actually *is* on-topic.
Hopefully they will find it before going through all 3494 other wiki :-).

There's probably a way to say this in much better, shorter version.

So what's the process for getting this (or a better, shorter version) into the &quot;Deletion policy&quot;?

== Admins should speedy delete when people feel that the specific book will benifit ==
Hello, I was wondering if anyone else agreed with this, and possibly add it in some form to the policy. I think it is a good measure of when to speedy delete. This expands on allowing speedy deletes from the author (because the author obviously feels his book will benefit with the deletion) and may serve as a good benchmark in general. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:55, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

: I agree. Maybe generalize it a bit more? &quot;Admins should speedy delete pages in which there is a general concensus by book contributors or the Wikibook community as a whole.&quot; Seems to be common practise anyways. I also think though there needs to be some excepts made to the wording on deleting redirects either that or as a whole. I don't think redirects should be any more special then any other pages when deciding whether or not to delete them. I think most redirects typically should be temperary to direct users to the current page rather then remaining permenate. At the very least how dated a link is on a website should be taken into account when deleting redirects. My reasons have nothing to do with &quot;saving space&quot; since I know it doesn't, rather how much less cluttered special pages, search results and the like become from removing unused redirected. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 22:14, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

:: To both of you: Why is there a need to speedy delete. If there is a consensus, why not just demonstrate that on the VfD page. Create the discussion, have people comment and then, a week after the last comment, delete. The whole thing could take ase little as ten days. There is hardly a need to delete in less, is there? To shorten the process, you can add a comment after a few &quot;votes&quot;, asking people only to add their comments if it might affect the debate so that the debate can be closed ASAP. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:05, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

::: Say, someone makes a new page for the C++ book called &quot;Maeking Classes&quot;. He then writes up everything, but on the next day, realizes his spelling mistake. He moves the page, and puts up the original page for speedy deletion. Additionally, there are obvious and blatant vandalisms that occur on this site regularly, and it is necessary to get rid of them as soon as possible.

::: Should a non-admin notice a vandalism, or is in the case of the author, he should put it up for speedy deletion. If an admin (or anyone else) has any doubt about that page, we are pretty much instructed to turn it into VfD instead. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

:::: In your &quot;Maeking Classes&quot; example, the page would already qualify under &quot;A page that is nominated for deletion by the original author with no other contributors.&quot; I agree that we could modify the existing criteria to include something like &quot;moved to a better named page, and the page is believed not to have any links from outside Wikibooks&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

::::: We can only speedy delete something if it is blatantly disregarding policy. The tag is there for say, authors and other RC patrolers to put on, so that admins can delete later. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:40, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Not quite. As I mentioned above, if you are the only contributor, you can have the page speedy deleted.
:::::: If the speedy delete criteria doesn't apply, just VfD it, ask that it get fast-tracked if there are no dissenters and the issue will be solved within two weeks. As I see it, SD is largely a tool to coutner the non-meaningful-content testing or vandalism &amp;mdash; things that should disappear off the project as soon as possible. The VfD exists in order to avoid any possible conflict between editors and I think we should be careful with SD if it risks contended stuff being deleted without discussion. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

::: I believe speedy deletion is ment as a tool to alert admins of contents that may violate Wikibooks policy (such as vandalism and copyright violations), new pages created in error that are no longer needed and pages that already have concensus by the book editors for deletion. Things basically, as I understand it, that need no discussion and there is no question as to whether the contents should be deleted or not. VFD is mostly for contents that needs discussion and is questionable as to whether it should be deleted or not, as I understand it. Thats why if something in SD is questionable, it should be changed to a VFD request and discussioned in [[WB:VFD]]. The policy already discusses using ones best judgement when making the decision of whether or not to delete a page. I think the point is to try to clarify a little more what to take into account when making this decision. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

Thinking about this, I'm actually starting to soften up to Dragontamer's idea. Perhaps it isn't so important to have a VfD debate on things that have been discussed within the project, but still I feel that those agreed upon deletions should have a buffer period where dissenters can object.

I suppose my view is tainted by my belief that the SD process is trying to do accomplish two tasks and we are missing a process for something between the VfD debate and the obvious breaches of policy. Perhaps we need a &quot;requested delete&quot; which would bypass the VfD but had a buffer period for objections. Perhaps that isn't necessary? Is this an interesting idea? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 00:20, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
:Sensible for sure.  However can this not be accomplished by the &quot;reason&quot; bit?  I marked one the other day because in the edit summary the editor had requested it (I think being a WP person they placed a non existent template on it). I do think it is important to take some care with the reason (as an RC pat placing them) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:47, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

:: In a way it can. I agree with Darklama's understanding of the SD tool. Perhaps we could make this more clear in the SD description. The two first types of pages he mentions (violations and mistaken creations) can already be deleted without delay. If the third (pages with concensus by the book editors) would point to the discussion where this reaches consensus, this too could be deleted quickly ''as long as'' there is no risk that someone might have missed it.
:: I see a possible scenario where an editor doesn't watch a specific book where the deletion discussion takes place and misses it. A {{tl|vfd}} tag would sit around for a couple of weeks giving him a heads up to the discussion, but if it runs its course and the page is deleted shortly after the {{tl|delete}} tag is posted, the user might get offended.
:: I don't think this is a likely scenario but given the importance of a good community spirit it is my oppinion we should strive to be thorough on this. In general I don't like being strict on rules, but I do think we should be strict on ourselves and not risk ticking anyone off for the sake of our own comfort. Clashes can brew very hostile environments and we should do as much as we can to avoid them.
:: Whether pointing book users to use the VfD, having a buffer period for such SDs, creating a new process for non-speedy deletes or something else, I'd be happy if we implemented a cautionary process here. Am I perhaps just being overly anal on this? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 14:16, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Without real thought (&lt;g&gt;).  I'm probably something of a deletionist but I'm learning a more tolerant attitude here.  I started off with speedies (some of which were taken to VfD by others) but now I tend to put stuff on a seperate watch list if it might grow into something.  I also make far more use of {{tl|qr-em}} tho I think this could be made a little less threantening? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

::: Speedy Deletion is probably a misleading name. There is no guarantees made on how quickly or slowly pages marked for speedy deletion will be taken care of. There is no timeframe requirements for SD and VFD that I know of, so there may be times in which VFD is faster then a SD. If I understand correctly a VFD is generally considered to be closed when the last posting to it is a week or longer. So the only guarantee with VFD is that it may give a week in which people have time to notice. SD I think rearly gets used for books or pages that have concensus for deletion by the book editors, but perhaps it would be a good idea to suggest or require admins should be careful with such SD requests? Perhaps it should also be a requirement that a pointer to where the discussion took place be given in the reason description for such a SD request and admins should then check to make sure all active editors are aware of the discussion, by seeing if they pertisipated in the discussion or not and posting to the talk pages of those editors who did not to see if they are aware of the situation? Then again admins are free to change a SD request into an VFD request too if they have doubts about a SD canidate. I don't think there would be any problem with adding an explict cautionary process here. I believe admins are suppose to be cautious anyway about using any admin tool. I think making things clearer can't hurt and would like to see more information given showing that admins are just users too, with a few more tools ment to help the commmunity, to make the process a little less mysterious, intimidating and threatening. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

::::I keep getting told this - so feet first - change the **** name!

::::: SDs are not supposed to have buffers. That is the very specific purpose that SDs are doing, and they do it quite well actually. There are the {{tl|qr-em}} tags which are used for buffers however. Anyway, now that I think of it, I don't think this should be added to the policy, but used more like a rule of thumb. This is what admins should be thinking as they speedy delete material (that is, forgo the VfD process). If it is obvious that the book or the Wikibooks community will benifit from the deletion, then do it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:43, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

== Lets keep on top of it now! ==
OK - I've been busy with the dustpan and brush both on the VfD page and this talk page. So
# I have marked as closed for deletion on five that seem conclusive to me (The Sims, Nintendo Power Volume 037, Remote_Viewing/Pr02, Cookbook:Banta Diet Cooking &amp; Movie Making Manual-Film_Academy Training) and placed &quot;impending doon&quot; on them. If any passing admin would care to deal with the deletes soon that would be good.
# How about trying to stay on top of it now so that we can see what are actually current discussions needing our attention.

See [[Wikibooks talk:Stub#Stub Deletion Policy]] as pointed out by [[User:Robert Horning]] in 22 March 2006.
*Is there a further need to cover Videogames walkthroughs ? as proposed by [[User:Jguk]] in 22 April 2006.
*Should the policy cover old redirect pages to speedy deletion ? as proposed by [[User:Swift]] in 31 July 2006.
*Should we add information where the content could be moved, on the tag or on the policy itself? as proposed by [[User:DavidCary]] 21 October 2006.

There are still other discussions on [[Wikibooks_talk:Deletion_policy]].

Other pages that may have related information [[Wikibooks talk:Votes for deletion]] and [[Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable]].

Lets also try to simplify and reduce (in size) the policy a bit. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== On CopyVio ==

This was inside the policy commented out... 

#A module that is a blatant copyright infringement and meets these specifications: 
#:Material is unquestionably copied from the website of a commercial content provider (e.g. encyclopedia, news service) and; 
#:The article and its entire history contains only copyright violation material, excluding tags, templates, and minor edits and; 
#:Uploader makes no assertion of permission or fair use, and none seems likely and; 
#:The material is identified within 48 hours of upload and is almost or totally un-wikified (to diminish mirror problem).

... I have simplified that section. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:33, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== Unstable Branch, Initial Thoughts ==

Considering the problems that some of the other policies have been having in writing and enforcing new versions, I think that we should try to improve this policy in babysteps. Here are some of the things that I would like to do  with this policy branch first (assuming other people are okay with this), and we can do things in stages, rather then trying to do everything at once:
#Rewrite existing prose to be easier to read, without necessarily changing the meaning of the policy
#Update the policy to account for current deletion practices (Speedy deletions and VfD votes) that are de-facto rules already, but which are not reflected in this policy yet.
Once we get everything updated and pretty, I think we should move to enforce the unstable branch before we make any other changes (and therefore slow down the process). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
: Here's one de facto rule that I've seen used but isn't official as far as I can tell from reading this policy: speedy deletion of unused fair use images (I'm not sure if this falls under &quot;copyvios&quot; or not but I don't think something is &quot;fair use&quot; to keep on the site if it's not being used for anything).  As far as redirects are concerned, if there is a redirect that isn't linked to and is unlikely to be searched for (for example, a redirect made after a page move, and after all the links to those redirects are removed), I say get rid of it... we can't just get rid of all unlinked redirects of course, because people could search for stuff that is redirected somewhere else (such as what happens when you search for matlab, I'm not sure if anything links to that redirect.) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 23:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
:I would tend to agree with you Matt, that's a good point that we generally like to delete fair use images if we dont absolutely need them. I think that might need to be either added here, or somewhere in the image policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:19, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

:I would firmly disagree. While I think it is unnecessary and overwhelming to indefinitely maintain redirects, I have come across many link even just from Wikipedia that are dead from page moves immediately followed by deletions. The whole ''Fighting Game Moves'' Wikibook, for example, still has links from ''at least'' 40 Wikipedia pages (by Google's count) and had more before I changed a few.
:I would strongly encourage a general trend towards soft redirects to be deleted after a period of time. It should probably be modularised, though, and put into its own &quot;guideline&quot; document, with a mention of when soft redirects should be created and a link to that document. That way, the accepted (though not punishably enforced) guideline would be to create a soft redirect if a user decides to take on the task of moving a Wikibooks's pages to meet the naming convention. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

::I question how much it is our job to account for external websites. I am inclined to say that the links on wikipedia (or any other external site) that point to wikibooks are the responsibility of wikipedians, not wikibookians. Consider the converse, where a link in a wikibook points to a wikipedia article: when the wikipedia article is moved/deleted, do people come here to fix the links on our project? Or, more to the point, when a page is deleted on wikipedia, do they check whether any links on our project become broken? 
::That point aside, books that are deleted are simply deleted, and we shouldnt be replacing the pages with redirects or notices unless specifically requested. Books that are moved, especially to a new naming convention will produce a large number of redirects. While it isn't imperative that these links be deleted immediately, if an admin is so inclined, and if the &quot;what links here&quot; list is empty, I can't see why those redirects should not be removed. We can only worry about our own project, unfortunately. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:15, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I fail to see how a disregard for users who ''are directed to our project'' is anything but irresponsibility on '''our''' part. The point of soft redirects is so that hopefully a user who comes from Wikipedia or another site will notice it and then change the link to go to the hard page (i.e. ''hard page'' vs. ''soft redirect''). If we move books around, then it is our job to direct users to those books. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

::::It's not a disregard for new users (at least not intentionally so), but instead a desire not to be mired indefinately by the potential that other projects might be pointing to a page that has moved or no longer exists. It sounds to me like a packrat mentality to say that &quot;we must keep anything that might be potentially useful to somebody&quot;. What about pages that are deleted? should we not delete books or pages on the basis that wikipedia might host a link to that page? I'm not going to say that we must delete all unused redirects, but at the same time I'm not going to say that an admin who is inclined to delete a redirect shouldnt be allowed to. Useless and obscure redirects clutter searches, they obscure the results at [[Special:Prefixindex]], and they create an insurmountable backlog at [[Special:Lonelypages]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::I neither advocate becoming indefinitely swamped by redirects and/or soft redirects nor adopting the packrat mentality.
:::::''should we not delete books or pages on the basis that wikipedia might host a link to that page?'' Obviously we should delete the pages; to jump from redirect/soft-redirects to that is a fallacious strawman argument. Further, I think pragmaticallly that when deleting an ''entire book'', redirects should not be created, as that could encourage reposting or remaking content.
:::::I refute that redirects are as cluttering as you say they are. Javascript can clear out the Special:Prefixindex results. Redirects can be categorized (thereby un-obscuring Special:Uncategorizedpages) by date and then deleted a while later. I am, however, unfamiliar with Special:Lonelypages. How would redirects create an insurmountable backlog there? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

:While the deletion argument is a bit contrived, it nonetheless demonstrates my point that we can't be making decisions here based on the potential that people might be following links to en.wikibooks from other projects, and that those links might be broken. The deletion of content pages and the deletion of redirects, while they may seem distinct, are very closely related subjects.
:[[Special:Lonelypages]] is an automated list of pages to which no other pages link. Admins in the past have gone on crusade against this list, declaring (with some merit) that these pages are worthless, they are taking up space (although space is certainly not a pressing concern), and that they should be deleted. I personally have never concerned myself with any of these automated lists (lonely pages, uncategorized pages, etc), but my noninvolvement in the issue is not a benchmark concerning it's importance.
:I'm not really prepared to argue this point any further, i see it as a non-issue. Whether we keep or delete redirects should be a matter left up to the judgement of the performing admin. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:56, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I just have one question: does special:Lonelypages include links from other projects (eg wikipedia) or only those which aren't linked to within Wikibooks? Because if it's the former then it really is a non-issue, since we dont need to worry about bad links from wikipedia and so on. If it is the latter, the problem with making other projects fix their own links is that, as far as I know, if you link to a bad page in another project (e.g. [[w:ghgihg]], a page that doesn't really exist), the link will still be blue, so the people won't be able to tell anything's wrong unless they actually follow the link (and then may not know where it's been moved to)... as far as Whiteknight's point that it should be left to admin judgment, I think it would still be helpful to put have some sort of guideline so that for example if two admins disagree, we know what the policy says, and since every other type of suggested deletion is (or should be) defined in policy. Maybe there should be some guidelines for interwiki linking? Or are there? (I haven't seen any) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 04:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

::: As far as i know, [[Special:Lonelypages]] only accounts for local links, not links from other projects such as wikipedia. Also, guidelines are okay, but I think we should avoid scripting what admins &quot;must do&quot; in different situations. As an admin, I like to think of myself as a &quot;voluneer&quot;, and a &quot;helper&quot;, not as a &quot;slave laborer&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:31, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: Yes, we are all volunteers of course, and people will use their own judgment even when policy is in place (since we all have different interpretations of the same policy a lot of the time). I apologize if I implied that implementing a guideline would be an act of forcing the admins to do one thing or another, for that was not my intention (probably was because of my wording), my main intent in suggesting a guideline be put in place was to avoid potential conflicts over whether something could reasonably be deleted  (without a vfd) or not, but maybe that question would be better to handle on a case-by-case basis anyways. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 19:39, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: Sorry if my last comment seemed hostile, it wasn't supposed to be. I think what i'm not understanding is [[User:Iamunknown]]'s use of the term &quot;soft redirect&quot;. is this something different from a regular redirect page? is there are &quot;hard&quot; type of redirect? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

(reset) I think what he meant was redirects created when a page is moved, rather than by the user directly. I'm not sure if there's any way to distinguish them other than looking in the move log though. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 21:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

== Administrator override ==

I added the following note to the text of this policy:
:''According to Jimbo, administrators are able to delete pages from wikibooks that manifestly do not belong here, regardless of the outcome of a discussion on VfD. In practice, such actions should be extremely rare, and should never be performed without strong justifications and significant forethought.''
I added that text in response to a comment made by Jimbo last year on the VFD talk page:
:''I want to encourage admins to feel more bold to go against a vote when the result is clearly wrong. If something is not a textbook, then delete it anyway. A reasonable respect for the voting process makes sense, but doing the right thing is what we should do.''
Jimbo also had this to say on another occasion:
:''Admins remember: we do not vote, we follow policy. If a vote is manifestly wrong, ignore it, and delete the junk anyway. Wikibooks deserves the respect that all projects have for themselves''
I think that this is an important thing that we should have in this policy for these and a number of other reasons. What do other wikibookians think about this? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:29, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I'm just curious as to what the source of those quotes is (I believe you, I just would like to know context and so forth). I think this supports my view (since Jimbo mentioned following policy) that if something is to be deleted, there should be some policy or guideline that the admins can turn to as justification for that action, and if the community does not agree with the decision the debate would then be turned against the policy rather than against the administrator performing it. After all the policy itself (well, most of them) was determined by community consensus in the first place and therefore by extension the admins are following consensus by invoking them in their deletions. 
:: Having said that, I'm not really sure I agree with Jimbo on this, but he knows what he's doing more than I do, and if this were not followed there WOULD be a lot of stuff left on here that shouldn't be. The admins in question just would have to be careful not to let either inclusionist or deletionist tendencies get in the way of making what would be considered &quot;the right choice&quot; in the matter (I would think that this is why we have the votes in the first place, so that all viewpoints are heard and can be weighed accordingly) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 21:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I go a step further and say that without a clear policy (approved and enforcible), giving such decision rights to administrators is plainly wrong at least within the actual way the administrator status is granted. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: I agree with Panic: Administrators should be able to do things like this, but it should definately be part of policy first. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: Maybe we need to have something about how discussion on whether to keep or delete a book needs to be based in part on whether or not the book meets Wikibook criteria rather then just whether the contents is good or not?

:(reset) I think that it is implicit that things on VfD should be discussed concerning whether or not the book needs to be deleted based on whether or not it meets policy. However, implicit is never a good thing for important stuff to be. Let's include a specific mention of that. I'll do it now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:19, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Listing of new books on VfD ==

Hum..... I'm left with a feeling that this part of the policy may well date back a way.  I certainly agree with it fully when a book is being &quot;worked on&quot;.  On RC you see editors working very hard on books but this usually involves quite a number of saves.  However for copy and paste dumps (almost always a single edit or at best edits lasting a day with nothing else done) I am '''much''' less happy.  A VfD just closed even had a &quot;date&quot; on it of 2002 (IIRC).  I do not consider pasting this into a page here means we have to wait a week to list it. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:A copyright violation is a completely different issue, in my opinion, then a newbie book that isn't quite right. There is a difference between protecting this project from copyright violations, and biting newbies who likely don't know any better when they create their first books.
:VfD rules apply to pages that have '''meaningful content''', and things like copy+paste dumps I would deem to be &quot;unmeaningful&quot;. 
:Also, in case their is confusion, the 7-day waiting period is counted from the day the book or page is first created. A book created on 1 January, for instance, can be nominated for deletion on 7 January (assuming it isnt a copyvio, or some other rubbish), even if the book is still under active construction, or subpages to that book have been created on 6 January. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

::I'm not on about copyvios (I agree that these should be deleted as soon as tehy are apparent).  Equally I accept that books under construction can be VfD's after 7 days (I would not be wildly happy about that tho I confess).  However your comment in the recent VfD was that it should not have been brought to VfD as it had not been here 7 days but it was a one off copy &amp; paste (&amp; the comment was made in an earlier one - Futurology maybe, again a large copy &amp; paste)?
::I think the policy should be quite explicit that apparently finish books (or very nearly complete ones) that are copy &amp; pastes '''can''' be VfD's before 7 days? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

I disagree with [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Deletion_policy/Unstable&amp;curid=108583&amp;diff=791541&amp;oldid=789448 this edit made by Panic2k4]. I dont think that we should be talkign here about how to alter the inclusion criteria if we haven't included mention of such changes in [[WB:WIW]] the current WIW policy, or in [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|the new proposed draft]] of it. I think that this change should be reverted until we've discussed the matter first. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

:You may reword it as you like but there is a clear need to state that VfD decisions may be used to extend the inclusion criteria , as they are very specific and would avoid discussing any future policy in full by creating precedents (may not even be WIW as it has now being discussed to make it a guideline and create a what is not policy), I take no offense and thank you for the consideration on not reverting/rewording it on the spot.
:Anyway besides the dependency what do you consider as problematic ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

== New criteria idea ==
&quot;&lt;small&gt;'''Delete''' books/contents that are too narrow in topical choice to ever be much good, i.e., a book on the geological studies of 1883/4 on Krakatau by the Dutch.&lt;/small&gt;&quot;

I just added the one on being too narrow to be of use, thinking of [[Biogeochemical Selectiveness of Cedars Over Metamorphic Rocks of the Escambray Complex, Sancti Spíritus, Cuba|this]], which would fit that criteria. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 02:00, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

:I don't like the idea of limiting (by force of deletion) contributions due to scope or organizational reasons, since the number of users working on complete works is so small.  We should give a higher priority in generating useful content not particularly in a useful structure. We can always reshape content at a later date but for that we must have content first. On the other hand I'm in favor on writing and having some guidelines on how content should be structured (and we have already some, and those can probably be improved) but I don't see that deleting content only based on its presentation/limited scope will be a good thing for Wikibooks. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:34, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

== ATTENTION ==
Call any editors of the unstable branch of the deletion policy to the proposal and discussion occurring on the parent's module talkpage [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy#Edits and fixed version]] that will affect the future of this module. Please post any comments, objections there...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:03, 30 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

|title=Overruling Stoiber's ''problem bear''.
|content=Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister and leader of the political party CSU, has always been good for a laugh. The man who, according to a German comedian, cannot only think different thoughts at the same time, but also utter them simultanesously, is famous for his contorted speeches. Unforgotten his ''Transrapid talk'' in which he presented the advantages of a high-speed train connection between Munich station and airport by claiming you'd board the station itself. Just as well his short talk about his hobbies in that he accidentally declared one of his famous morning activities was killing flowers and he'd instruct the gardener how to do his wife. This year's famous was the ''problem bear''. In May 2006, a brown bear named JJ1 immigrated to Bavaria; though the migration at first was welcome by animal liberationists it soon turned out that the disturbed animal was a threat to people, making him a &quot;problem bear&quot; in Stoiber's eyes. The sentence undoubtedly was amongst last year's favorites.

:I'm not sure, although that does not sound like the reason (the Monad typeclass only wants one parameter).  Maybe you could look into the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/type-extensions.html#instance-decls GHC manual on extensions] to find out, or ask on the Haskell café mailing list.

I have read the module and tried examples, but searchAll5 and searchAll7 (I checked this one with solution) don't work unless StateT is added as instance of MonadPlus. Have I done something wrong, or is there a problem in examples?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;''The view of the brain as a tabula rasa, a blank slate, all too long a basis for the thinking of learning theorists, is patently absurd'' -- Peter Marler, 1996&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''Behavior is too important to be left to psychologists'' -- Donald Griffin&lt;/center&gt;
==Learning and Memory==

===Learning===
Learning is characterized by persistent and measurable changes in behavior which are not associated with fatigue, altered motivation, or maturation. Some information or knowledge is acquired and is then used to alter the individuals actions and responses. Learning as an adaptive behavior allows individuals to adapt to specific environment challenges.

====Non-associative Learning====
=====Habituation and Sensitization=====
'''Habituation''' refers to a gradual decrease in behavioral responses with repeated encounters of a particular stimulus, which proves of no consequence. It depends on a change in the synapse between the sensory and motor neuron. Indepedent of conscious motivation or awareness it aids in distinguishing novel and meaningful information from the general background noise. '''Sensory Adaptation''' refers to a change in the responsiveness of a sensory system when confronted with a constant stimulus.

In contrast, '''sensitization''' refers to an increase in behavioral responses following repeated applications of a particular stimulus. Following sensitization, very little stimulation is then required to produce exceedingly large effects. Initial. light stimulation of peripheral skin receptors may not activate nociceptive (i.e., pain) neurons of the spinal cord. Continued, repeated stimulation of the same pathways will bring about central sensitization suggesting the presence of an irritating or potential more damaging skin issue. Tissue damage or continued inflammation may thereby cause chronic pain conditions. In long-term potentiation (LTP), physiological effects of subsequent synaptic signals are strengthened following initial activation. This process is thought to form an integral component of memory and learning. Repeated stimulation of different neural centers can also stengthen coordinated neuronal firing and thereby lead to seizures.

====Associative Learning====
The ability to learn is a basic foundation of intelligence. Humans are particularly keen observers of the world around them and are thereby able to reliably identify the presence of different regularities and generalizations. Patterns that are of consequence to our daily lives are readily learned, which suggests the presence of powerful biases in their search and representation. We tend to remember information more easily if we have uncovered it ourselves than if they are simply presented to us.

An effort to form mental images out of any material to be learned may often enhance retention. '''Dual Code Theory''' suggests that most information can be committed to memory in either verbal/linguistic code or mental image code. The use of multiple codes for harnessing any material thus may enhance performance by increasing the number of retrieval paths.

=====Classical Conditioning=====
'''Classical conditioning''', a form of associative learning. It requires an unconditional reflex, where an unconditional stimulus (US)brings about an automatic, unlearned (unconditional) response (UR). If a neutral stimulus (NS) tends to precede it, an association is made and the conditional response (CR) becomes transferred onto the (previously neutral) conditional strimulus (CS); a conditional reflex has been learned. For instance, food (US) elicits salivation (UR) in a dog as a natural response. If the sound of a bell (NS) frequently occurs before the food (US) is presented then the mere sound of the bell (CS) will elicit salivation (CR).
A mistranslation of &quot;conditional&quot; as &quot;conditioned&quot; meant that in English the CS and CR were referred to as conditioned stimulus and conditioned response, and the verb &quot;to condition&quot; was derived to refer to the process responsible for the establishment of new CR. (From: The Dictionary of Ethology and Animal Learning Edited by Rom Harre and Roger Lamb, The MIT Press, 1986)  

'''Fear conditioning''' allows organisms to acquire affective responses, such as fear, in situations where a particular context or stimulus is predictably elicits fear via an aversive context (e.g., a shock, loud noise, or unpleasant odor). [[w:Little_albert|Little Albert Experiment]]

'''Conditioned Taste Aversion''' (i.e., Garcia conditioning) occurs when a subject experiences symptoms of a toxic, spoiled, or poisonous substance such as nausea, sickness, or vomiting after consuming unfamiliar food. Learned aversion of such taste is an adaptive trait that trains the body to stay away from items that are likely poisonous (e.g., berries or mushroom). This association sometimes occurs in subjects even when sickness was merely coincidental and not related to the food.

=====Operant Conditioning=====
'''Operant conditioning''', sometimes called instrumental conditioning or instrumental learning, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874-1949). Thorndike's most famous work investigated the behavior of cats trying to escape from various home-made puzzle boxes. When first constrained in the boxes the cats took a long time to escape from each. With experience however, ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more quickly enabling the cats to escape in less and less time over successive trials. 

B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) extended the theories proposed by Thorndike about 40 years after Thorndike published his works. His ideas of animals operating on the environment, lead him to analyze how behavior is changed by its consequences. The contraption that became known has the Skinner box measured if a task was completed and the duration of time it took for the task to be completed. The Skinner box consisted of a bar on the wall that when pressed triggered the release of a food pellet. It was Skinners belief that by rewarding an animal when an appropriate action occurred it would increase the likelihood that the behavior would be repeated.When the rats, placed in the box, accidentally tapped on the bar on the wall a pellet was released and Skinner observed the amount of time it took the rat to find the pellet. As the rat learned that a pellet released each time he happened to step on the bar, the rat learned to press the bar and to immediately find the food. This training is what became known as operant conditioning (Alcock). '''Reinforcement''' always strengthens the behavior that preceded it and may consist of any outcome that the animal considers desirable. Reinforcers can broadly be categorized into '''positive reinforcers''' (i.e., obtaining access to something the animal wants) or '''negative reinforcers''' (i.e., removing something considered unpleasant or painful). '''Punishment''' is always designed to discourage further performance of the behavior it is paired with. '''Positive punishment''' achieves that by inflicting an unwanted outcome such as unpleasant sounds or odors, electric shocks, or pain, while '''negative punishment''' removes access to something the animal wants. Skinners operant conditioning is seen in the learning behavior of many animals as well as humans. Oftentimes it goes completely unnoticed, but it can also be used as a deliberate tool in training. As young children explore their world and learn how to eliminate unpleasant stimuli and satisfy desires through proper behavior they are learning through operant conditioning.

Operant conditioning is used extensively in training animals towards performing quite complex tasks. '''Shaping''' involves the step-wise reinforcement of successive approximations. This training method relies on the animal to exhibit an interest in showing a wide range of behaviors as well as in obtaining rewards. When a desired behavior is performed, the trainer rewards this action. As this method relies on compliance from the animal, most suited to this training are a combination of positive reinforcers (e.g., a small item of food) for behavior compatible with the trainer's expectations, and negative punishment (e.g., withholding that food item) for behavior that is not. Initially rewards are issued for even a crude approximation or a component of the behavior. While these attempts may have earned the animal a reward at the beginning, subsequent rewards are contingent on progressively narrowing the behavior to what the trainer aims for.

=====Imprinting=====

=====Latent learning===== 
Latent learning refers to an individual's ability to learn associations without explicit reinforcement. Exploratory behavior serves to acquire an understanding of the spatial relationships of objects. It includes the formation of “cognitive maps” of the surrounding. Daily success depends on knowldge of spatial relationships. Hummingbirds and bees recall the location and status of harvesting of flower resources, and several species of birds are able to track a large number of seed stores.

=====Observational learning=====
Bandura (1965) illustrated the power of an instructional strategy in which children are allowed to observe behavior of individuals who are significant to them. Subsequently they are likely to imitate their role models especially when such behavior is reinforced. His work illustrates that observers readily adapt their behavior based on what they see around them, even when they received no encouragement or incentives to do so. Integrating a continuous interaction between behaviors, cognitions, and the environment, his social learning theory stresses the importance of observational learning, imitation, and modeling.

=====Language Learning=====
======Human Language======
Humans show exceptional skill to communicate with fellow conspecific using verbal and gestural symbols. Such competence is arguably one of mankind's greatest assets as well as a key to most of our species' achievements. It brings us together with our peers and enriches us through an exchange of experiences, thoughts and value systems. It endows us with the means to acquire skills for situations that we may have never personally encountered before. A staggering range of regionally  distinct languages and dialects, grouped in larger language families, not only serves as a system of communcation but also tags us for membership within a specific group. In addition to bringing us together, it has thereby been at the heart of an ancient source of division. Although few things in biology ever group cleanly into one of the nature vs. nurture extremes, this particular division seems to be purely cultural. Regardless of the specific race, ethnic or regional group that we happen to have joined through birth, we all are able to acquire competence in any human language. In particular, we seem to acquire our '''native language''' without formal education, long before many of our intellectual capabilities have mnatured, and simply by immersion into the particular language environment of parents and relatives during the first few years of our life. The scientific study of the nature and structure of languages is called '''linguistics'''.

'''Universal Grammar'''. BF Skinner (1957) suggested that infants learn language through a process described as operant conditioning, namely, via the monitoring and management of reward contingencies. Skinner's position would be that a four-term contingency analysis comprised of motivating operations, discriminative stimuli, responses and reinforcing stimuli would be the means by which behavior could be explained. In children and infants this process would be expanded by what he called &quot;shaping&quot;, &quot;prompting&quot; and other stimuli modeling, imitation and reinforcing procedures. Language acquisition then is a process that would take thousands of instances of such training, and this appears largely to be what takes place. Critics who do not understand the inductive power of this approach largely assert that this view now &quot;appears quite simplistic.&quot; However, this argument to complexity is not dissimilar to arguments against Darwin's theory of natural selection. How could the amazing complexity of the animal kingdom come about through such a simple means? Surely, we would need something more complex to explain the variety of animals? Darwin's theory of selection is now accepted as such a means, despite it's &quot;apparent simplicity&quot;. Similarly the mechanism of operant conditioning can be seen as sufficient to account for very complex forms of behavior in a wide variety of circumstances without appealing to unproven, non-data driven speculative theoretical approaches like those of Noam Chomsky and others.

Language learning is clearly the most complex task any of us will ever undertake. Yet, the process appears to be considerably less painfull than acquiring an understanding of calculus, or organic chemistry. Noam Chomsky (1975) has long argued that this paradox is best explained by the view that humans, and in particular children, have innate abilities that support the acquisition of a language. It is clear that we seem to be naturally good at it, especially before we reach puberty. Moreover, we appear to have a natural need to fill our world with language; in the absence of formal language tutoring a form of language structure develops anyway. Some say a specialized language faculty seems to aid in this process, one that includes innately specified constraints on what forms are possible. These innate, language-specific, information processing mechanisms may be encapsulated in language module of the brain. However, these innate faculties are inferred, hypothesized explanations with no foundation in fact. No biological location has been found for them, no genetic location, no brain structure. It is all inference.

All human languages, even spontaneous ones, show many common principles of language acquisition as well as rules of grammar. The concept of '''universal grammar''' proposes that this is due to a set of innate rules, which guide how we acquire language and how we construct valid sentences in it. It thus attempts to explain language in general, and not simply describe the construction of any one specific language ''per se''.

There are many alternative theories of human language consistency besides the speculative theory of &quot;universal grammer&quot;. One theory is that human environments possess common structures and human language simply responds to the commonality of the world. Universal grammar is a speculative, unproven hypothesis that is still awaiting confirmation and has no evidence to support it other than &quot;rational argument&quot;.

'''Language Acquisition'''. At very young age, we acquire our native language by listening to, guessing at the meaning of, and imitating the symbols used by tutors around us. Moreover, during these early years we learn to walk and talk without any explicit need for understanding how we are doing what we are doing. In this process we seem to be helped by a set of Inherent learning strategies, the ability for optimized pattern perception of common, ambient symbols. 

Infants are exceptionally broad in their abilities to perceive sound qualities. In fact, as infants we can distinguish many more language sounds than we can as adults. During the first year of life, infant brains are actively engaged in optimizing acoustic perception for the language sounds that surround them. Such early acquisition of information about native language depends on perceptually mapping both the critical aspects of language, and statistical properties of speech.

It is now clear that infants perceive the various phonetic units, track the frequency of different formants, and extract the boundaries of words from running speech. Patricia Kuhl (2000) suggests that language acquisition is based on a combination of factors to provide a powerful discovery procedure for language. Evidence suggests that '''initial perception parses speech in a universal way''' in all human infants. Infants have inherent perceptual biases that segment phonetic units without providing innate descriptions of them. They were able to parse and discriminate a wide range of basic phonetic units. Adults, in contrast, are only able to discriminated phonetic units that occur in their first language, but fail to distinguish those that are not used there. Japanese adults, for example, fail to discriminate phonetic boundaries of ''r'' vs. ''l'', boundaries that do not exist in Japanese. Such discrimination is based on general auditory processing mechanisms, rather than on innate phonetic feature detectors for speech. Language learning requires '''mapping these probabilistic patterns into language strategies'''. As infants detect frequency patterns in language input they identify higher-order units. Infants thus discover the critical parameters and phonetic dimensions of the sounds used in their native language. Sensory processing becomes optimized by experience for enhance perception of the specific language around them. '''Vocal learning unifies language perception and production''' where vocal learning depends on a comparison of one's own vocalizations to those of others. Imitation forms the integral bong between the perception and production of language abilities and together they become optimized for the first language. If a second language is learned lateron, it will carry the accent typical for the speech motor patterns of their primary language, even following long-term instruction. Similarities in infant-directed speaking styles (increased pitch and exaggerated stress) enhances language learning by assisting infants in discriminating phonetic units, as well as by capturing attention.

'''Broca's Area''' underlies the ability to produce speech, but it is not critical for understanding language. Patients with damage will fail to form words properly, and speech is halting and slurred. '''Wermicke's Area''' is essential for the ability to understand language. Patients with damage to this area can speak clearly, but the words make no sense (i.e., word salad). The '''Arcuate Fasciculus''' connects these two areas. Damage to this connection causes conduction aphasia where language is understood, but neither can words be repeated, nor does own speech make any sense. Capabilities for speech are not distributed evenly across the two halfs of the brain. Speech is only disrupted when amobarbital is selectively used to anesthetize only the half of the brain which contains these speech centers. Imaging techniques (e.g. fMRI) have identified that bilingual individuals utilize an overlapping set of neurons in the language areas for these two languages. In contrast, individuals who have acquired a second language later in life will likely rely on separate neuronal areas in these speech centers. Late bilungual speakers are also less likely to show strong lateralization of speech function. This suggests that as two language systems are learned together early-on, they can share the same brain centers without causing catastrophic interference. In adult learning, the best sites of brain real estate have already been taken up by the first language, thus, any new language learning must coopt 'new' territory adjacent to it or on the other half of the brain.

======Bird Song======
Birds communicate information about danger, food, sex, group movements and many other purposes via acoutic signals. A subset of these have been termed '''song''', as they frequently feature with extended, tonal, melodic characteristics. The Zebra Finch's song, for instance, includes several introductory notes followed by a string of syllables within an extended melodious pattern. Sonograms (i.e., a plot of the intensity of pitch against time) are commonly used as a primary tool for studying and comparing bird songs. 

Respiratory muscles force streams of air from large air sacs through the bronchi. Membranes in the syrinx vibrate as air expressed from bronchi passes over them. Syrinx muscles for left and right sound producing structures can act independently, and many birds are able to sing harmonies with themselves.
Song appears to play a role in advertising for sex  and species recognition as song complexity frequently coincides with the presence of ornate plumage. It also stimulates and synchronizes courtship behavior, stimulates reproductive readiness in females, and contributes to pair bond maintenance. Local song dialects exist in many species.

Successful song in most adult male songbirds depends on memorizing the calls of a conspecific tutor during an earlier, sensitive phase in life. The appropriate song repertoire is acquired in a series of distinct stages. Young birds, during an early '''Sensory Phase''', listen to a conspecific tutor and thereby obtain information about the characteristics of its own song. Only a very specific subset of surrounding songs is actually accepted as suitable, suggesting the presence of an in-built song template. Following this sensory phase, young birds actively begin to vocalize themselves. Their '''Subsong''' is an atonal, noisy, meaningless repetition of sounds, which lacks recognizable syllables. Akin to human ''Babbling'' birds practice coordinated movements of the respiratory system, sound producing organs, and related structures (e.g., tongue). During '''Sensory-motor Phase''', young birds spontaneously produce ''Plastic Song'', consisting of vocalizations with distinct syllables and recognizable elements. Such &quot;work in progress&quot; will include elements from the song of tutors and elaborate them into a variety of syllables and phrases that even exceed what eventually will be used in its adult song. The ability to hear its own vocalizations are critical for normal development. In transition to the '''Mature phase''', birds adopt a ''Crystallized Song'' with syllables and syntax structure that is characteristic of its species. Once established, these song patterns remain fixed in many species, are no more disrupted by deafening, and are presented intact during each subsequent breeding season. In contrast open-ended learners (e.g. starlings and canaries) retain the capacity to adjust or alter their song throughout life.

Song production is under the control of multiple hormonal systems from embryonic gonads. Injections of testosterone induce adult males to sing, even out of season, while similar injections in females have no such effect. The presence of estrogen during male development appears to be essential. When estrogen is blocked experimentally in developing males, testosterone injections fail to elicit song. However, when estrogen had been delivered to developing females, injection of testosterone elicited song in them (Konishi).

Several neural centers with a role in song have been identified. The ''Higher Vocal Center'' ('''HVc''') is a group of neurons in the forebrain that is larger in (singing) males than in (non-singing) females. Damage to it blocks song production in adults. The ''nucleus of the archistriatum'' ('''RA''') in males is larger than in females and its neurons increase in size and dendritic arborization during song learning. Damage to this area blocks song production in adults. The ''lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum'' ('''LMAN''') is neither sexually dimorphic nor shows seasonal change in neuron size or number. Its ablation in young birds interferes with song acquisition but its ablation in adults brings about few deficits as long as song had already been been learned prior to damage. Area X of the paraolfactory lobe ('''Area X''') is sexually dimorphic and new neurons are added in song learning. Damage to it interferes with song acquisition in young birds but not in adults.

As in every behavioral system, a series of independent questions can be addressed for song behavior in Zebra finches (''Taeniopygia guttata'').

*'''Proximate Causation''': Zebra finch song production requires the flow of air through semi-independent vibrators in syrinx and vocal tract. The presence of song, and song repertoire size are reflected in sexual dimorphism of its controlling brain areas and nuclei. A ''learning pathway'' esists separate of a ''motor pathway''. Singing, which is largely restricted to males, is under the control of androgens.
*'''Ultimate Causation''': Song in Zebra finches is a learned vocalization used during courtship and defense of a territory. Advertising the individual's presence it serves to elicit mating opportunities from females and to stimulate the partner's reproductive behavior and physiology. Moreover, it functions to claim a territory and to repel competitors from it.
*'''Phylogeny''': Virtually all 9000 species of birds have the ability to vocalize, including crows, turkeys, owls or nightingales. A large subset of them, including the zebra finch, are characterized by complex vocal organs, distinctive brain circuitry for song, and acquisition of species-characteristic vocalizations through learning. Taxonomically these are all restricted to a single order - the Passeriformes.
*'''Ontogeny''': The emergence of adult zebra finch song illustrates the interactions of genetic and environmental factors in behavioral development. After periods of listening to the songs of tutors, starting its own partial vocalizations, rehearsing and adaptating its own song, the species-specific adult version slowly emerges. Song circuits exhibit extensive plasticity even in adults with ongoing neurogenesis and seasonal changes in neuronal morphology.

White-crowned sparrows (''Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli'') males sing a single song that shows considerable geographic variation in the form of '''stable dialects'''. Bilingual and blended strategies exist at the boundaries. The distinctiveness of the song depends on patterns of natal dispersal and the timing of learning. Subject to reinforcement by the song of neighbors, the system is highly dependent on auditory feedback. The work by Peter Marler, Doug Nelson and others for over 30 years illustrates how genetic and environmental factors interact during the development of a complex communication system. Males generally establish territories during late plastic song with a repertoire that consists of ~4 different songs. Improvisations yield individual-specific songs which closely match that of the nearest rival.
	
'''Cross-fostering experiments''' illustrate the role of auditory templates in song learning. Young birds reared in the presence of taped song will learn and present that song, even if the tape came from another species. A Song sparrow raised with a swamp sparrow tape will experience little difficulty to learn the swamp sparrow song. Birds in '''Isolation experiments''' are raised without access to intact adult song (i.e., no template) and will subsequently show deficiencies in their own song upon maturation. The song does nonetheless contain valid elements of intact adult song. Moreover, '''Deafening experiments''', which deafen birds at hatching, results in song that still contains some valid elements but is an even cruder version than those of isolated birds. When '''Song preference experiments''' present young birds with a wide range of conspecific and heterospecific songs, they recognize and preferentially learn the song of its own species. Birds raised in '''Mixed syllables experiments''' in the presence of a mixture of swamp- and song sparrow syllables, will accurately produce these syllables in their song but lack the normal adult syntax.

'''Castration Experiments''' have shed light on the roles of hormones in song learning. Swamp sparrows that are castrated early in development have low testosterone levels compared to their male siblings. They acquire song but progress to plastic phase only. Treating such birds with injections of testosterone ('''Enhanced Testosterone Experiment''') immediately crystallizes the song. Interfering with testosterone function in adult birds ('''Reduced Testosterone Experiment''') degrades previously crystallized song back to plastic.

'''Brown-headed cowbirds''' (''Molothrus ater'') are gregarious birds that follows cattle herds. Brood parasites that are raised by parents of different species, no consistent, conspecific tutor available. So, how do they learn their own conspecific song? One of the strongest stimuli is the bird's own crystallized song and feedback from females is important (i.e., action-based learning). {{Animal Behavior stub}}

======Parallels between Bird Song and Human Speech Learning======
To learn their language, humans and white crowned sparrows follow similar steps, recognition, practice, and clarity. The best time for a human to learn their language is from toddler to twelve years old (Macdonald) and the best time for a white crowned sparrow to learn its song is between 10-50 days from when they were born. Both genes and environment play roles in determining the way each communicate (Alcock 25). 

The first step for humans and white crowned species in learning their language can be considered recognition. White crowned sparrows and humans listen to a tutor before they begin to communicate their language. The tutor teaches the language and the particular dialect, according to the area. Just like humans, the sparrows also have a dialect depending on where they live. A white crowned sparrow has certain genes that only allow them to learn its own species’ songs. Experiments have been performed in which the sparrow was kept in isolation and played tapes of other song sparrows, the white crowned sparrow will not imitate the other species’ song, but will sing an odd song unlike either species’ song (Alcock 24-25). Humans also cannot communicate with each other using a different species’ language. A study was done in Avignon, France that observed children who were brought up by wolves. It was observed that the children spoke no language at all. Before studies of this kind were done it was thought that the children might learn to communicate with the wolves, just like the Tarzan story. This is not true, the children could not speak the human language nor the language of the wolves (Macdonald). It is a combination of environment and genes that tell white crowned sparrows and humans to learn their proper language. Genes tell the species to only learn the language of their own species and environment plays a factor in determining which dialect each will use. 

Once the white crowned sparrow or infant has recognized its species, song, they can begin to practice the language. Infants first communicate by making sounds. The sounds can range from grunts to sounds that mimic their surrounding environments. For example, before babies can say words, they might say moo- moo when looking at a cow. After sounds come words. By the time the infant reaches one year, they should be making sentences out of words (Macdonald). The white crowned sparrow also does not immediately master its song. The sparrow will first sing a short subsong derived from the tutor’s full song. The sparrows keep practicing their subsong just as infants practice their words. After the sparrow has mastered its subsong it can start to form a full song. In both species it is necessary for them to hear themselves in order to vocalize their language correctly (Alcock 26). 

In conclusion, both white crowned sparrows first listen and recognize their particular species’ language. A white crowned sparrow has a tutor to teach the song. Infants usually have parents that teach them their verbal language. Then they must practice the language, starting off slow with sounds and building up. Both species will continue to improve and clarify their language throughout their lives.

===Memory===
'''Memory''', in its broadest sense, refers to an individual's ability to retain learned information. The formation of memory traces is a complex task which all organisms appear to be able to do. Fundamentally, such an ability requires a series of distinct steps: Information must be '''encoded''' as meaningful associations are assessed, the resulting information must be '''recorded''' in some form, and the memory record must be '''retrieved''' when needed.

As humans exhibit little conscious awareness of mental processes, such as memory, these were long considered inaccessible to objective, scientific study. Inferences about the course of encoding, consolidation and storage of memory thus mostly rely on indirect methods such as testing for retrieval abilities. 

Consolidation of memory appears to involve independent paths at different time frames. Such evidence derives from the existence of different critical time frames for its formation, and its susceptibility to disruption with different pharmacological tools.

====Sensory Memory====
Subjects are able to report great detail about a complex stimulus immedeately following its presentation. This ability forms within a few tens of milliseconds and decays again rapidly within a few hundred milliseconds. 

====Short-term Memory====
Short-term memory allows the recall of something from several seconds to as long as a minute. Its strength does appear to depend primarily on attention and not rehearsal. It is thus highly vulnerable to disruption when attention shifts elsewhere. The amount of information that can be held is on the order of 4-6 numbers. This amount can be boosted by grouping them into distinct chunks as for telephone numbers (e.g., 202-456-1414).

The ability to recall such information is contingent on transient patterns of neuronal activity in regions of the frontal and the parietal lobe.

====Long-term Memory====
This type of memory, lasting hours to months, critically depends on a transfer of the information from short term memory using repeated rehearsal.

The hippocampus appears to be an essential structure in such routing. Sleep is thought to improve the consolidation of information, possibly by hippocampal replaying of activity from the previous wake period. Electrical activation of hippocampal circuits reportedly are linked to feelings of Deja Vu.

=====Declarative Memory=====
'''Declarative memory''' refers to the ability to become conscious of, or declare, facts and experiences. It is also referred to as '''Explicit memory''', when it involves direct recalling information that had been obtained from the external world. Representing knowledge of standard textbook material or events, it is best formed by actively recalling the material in spaced intervals. Compared to other forms or memory it is more volative; more easily formed and more easily forgotten. 

The primary neural basis appears to reside in the medial temporal lobe. Bilateral damage to this area results in anterograde amnesia, as in the famous case of the anonymus memory-impaired patient '''HM'''. A surgical procedure for epilepsy left him with damage to his brain in the medial temporal lobe on both sides. the hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gyrus, the entorhinal cortex, and the amygdala. He subsequently suffered from severe anterograde amnesia, where transfer of new events into long-term memory was impaired. He was unable to recall events once his attention had focused elsewhere.

'''Semantic Memory''' is the ability to consciously recall knowledge of facts that are independent of a specific time and place. medial temporal lobe, diencephalon

'''Episodic Memory''' refers to the ability to explicitly recall information about a specific event that has occurred at a specific time and place, medial temporal lobe, diencephalon

=====Nondeclarative Memory=====
Implicit memory, which does not need to involve conscious awareness in the act of recollection

'''Procedural Memory''' regards the learning of motor skills and habits. Formation requires repeated reinforcement, repetition and practice over many trials rather than recollection. Once formed it is less likely to be forgotten. It is also less easily transferred to related tasks than declarative learning

Striatum, basal ganglia, Deficits can be assessed using a serial reaction time (SRT) task, backwards reading, mirror drawing, probabilistic classification, artificial grammar learning, or prototype abstraction.

'''Motor Responses''' with Classical Conditioning, Cerebellum

'''Emotional Responses''' with Fear conditioning involves an organism's ability to acquire fear responses to a previously neutral stimulus. This occurs when it becomes paired with an aversive stimulus, such as a shock or loud noise. James Wattson's '''Little Albert experiment''' illustrated that children learned fear of objects when encounters with them where paired with loud noises.

'''Priming''' refers to a context-dependent activations of clusters of neocortical neurons. As they become more activated, they are more likely to come into consciousness.

Even '''reflex pathways''' are capable of surprising plasticity. For example, circuits that control motor patterns for walking will be subjected to optimization with sensory input.

====Long-lasting Memory====
months to lifetime

====Case Studies====
Patient HM suffered severe memory impairment following bilateral damage to his medial temporal lobes, hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. His short-term memory remained intact, he was able to largely recall past events, and his ability to learn new motor skills was not disrupted. However, he suffered from severe anterograde amnesia, i.e., the ability to commit new events to long-term memory.

===Mechanisms===
Memory mechainsms critically depend on changes in synaptic functioning. '''Hebb Synapses''' and their role in classical conditioning. If a synapse succeeds at driving a postsynaptic neuron above threshold, its subsequent effectiveness is strengthened.

'''Long-term potentiation''' is based on changes in neural signals which will potentiate a neural response for 1-2 weeks. potentiation involves increased release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.

====Molecular changes at the synaptic level====
During '''habituation''', repeated stimulation of a sensory neuron leads to a smaller activation of the postsynaptic motor neuron. The primary cause for this is a progressive reduction of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; inflow into the presynaptic terminal, decreased transmitter release, and a smaller activation of the postsynaptic target. In '''sensitization''' as a result of electrical head shock, release of serotonin activates second messenger systems and phosphorylation of key target molecules. Long-Term Memory depends on new protein synthesis and the formation of new synaptic connections.

===Yes and No===
Welsh doesn't have a single word to use every time for yes and no questions. The word used depends on the form of the question. You must generally answer using the relevant form of the verb used in the question, or in questions where the verb is not the first element you use either 'ie' / 'nage'. &quot;Ie&quot; is often pronounced &quot;ia&quot; in northern dialects of Welsh.

*''Oes'' and ''Nag oes'' are used to answer questions regarding a quantity or existance of an object (i.e. the 3 sg. present indicative of the existential verb).
*''Ydy'' and ''Nag ydy'' are the 3 sg. present indicative of the substantive verb 'to be' used, e.g.,  where the sentence involves a predicate.
*''Ydw'' and ''Nag ydw'' are the 1 sg. present indicative of the substantive verb, used either existentially or in the case of predicates.

*English (language): ''Saesneg'' ''(SAY-sneg / SIS-neg)''
*Good morning!: ''Bore da!'' ''(bo-re da)''
*Good afternoon!: ''P'nawn da!'' ''(p'nown da)''
*Welcome!: ''Croeso!'' ''(KROY-so)''
*Goodbye!: ''Da boch chi!'' ''(da BO-khi)''
*Cheerio!: ''Hwyl fawr!'' ''(hooil vowR)''

*Yes: ''Ie (EE-eh), Do (do:), Oes (oyss / o:s), Ydy (UD-ee) etc. 
There are many different ways of saying “yes” or ''no'', depending on the context

To answer “yes” you must use a response which is in grammatical agreement with the question.

“Oes...?” (Is there...?) is answered with “Oes” (Yes there is).

“Ydy...?” (Is he/she...?) is answered with “Ydy” (Yes he/she is).

“Ydw...?” (Am I...?) would however be answered appropriately with “Ydych” (Yes you are) and vice versa.

“Ie” (Yes) is used when the verb is not the initial element of the question.

“Do” (Yes I did, Yes you did, etc.) is used in reply to questions in the past tense, although in several dialects it is also used in the present tense.
*No: ''Na'' ''(nah) 
To contradict someone or to give a more definite “no” you can however precede the words for “yes” with “na” or “nag”, e.g. “Nag oes!” (No there isn’t!)'' (The opposite of ''Do'' is ''Naddo''.)
*(I’m) sorry!: ''Mae'n flin gen i!'' ''(mai'n vleen Gen ee)''
*Isn’t it? Wouldn’t it? Aren’t they? Won’t we? etc.: ''Ynte?'' ''(un-teh)''
*Cheers! Good health!: ''Iechyd da!'' ''(YEKH-id dah)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Optimal Growth ==
=== Assumptions and Story ===
The topic of Optimal Growth is often introduced with mention of the economy of a single person dealing with a single commodity.  Robinson Crusoe, for instance, might be stuck on an Island with only one commodity, coconuts perhaps, denoted by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.   In this case, just for fun, we may want Crusoe to live forever, but for now we may let him have a finite lifetime.  This assumption changes how we will deal with the problem, with a finite lifetime lending itself to the Calculus of Variations or the Hamiltonian methods of analysis, and an infinite lifetime often requiring recursive methods.  Also our one good is consumed, and is used for &quot;once&quot; production each day.

=== Model ===
In this model, we have on good, &lt;math&gt;c \in C \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Our agent has an increasing (or at least non-decreasing) utility function, &lt;math&gt;u:C\to \mathbb{R_+}&lt;/math&gt;.

The production function in the economy is nondecreasing &lt;math&gt;f:C\to\mathbb{R_+}&lt;/math&gt;.  For some reason we use &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; as the argument in this function.  We'll see the relationship between ''c'' and ''k'' when we talk about our constraint in just one minute.

Crusoe wants to maximize his utility over the period he lives, but perhaps he discounts the future by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so we can write our objective function &lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c_t&lt;/math&gt; the amount consumed at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (for now we are considering a discrete time model).

We want our solution to be ''feasible'', so our sequence &lt;math&gt;\{c_0, c_1, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; must be &quot;possible&quot;.  For this to happen, we need the sequence to satisfy the constraint that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; consumed plus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; used tomorrow in production must be less than or equal to the amount produced.  We will take as given an initial ''endowment'' of coconuts, &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;.  So our problem is:

&lt;math&gt;\max \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t)&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;0 \leq c_t+k_{t+1} \leq f(k_t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Solution for finite ''T'' ===

since our functions ''f'' and ''u'' are nondecreasing, we can rewrite our problem as:


&lt;math&gt;\max \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(f(k_t)-k_{t+1})&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1} \leq f(k_t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve this using Calculus of Variations (''Euler's Equation'') or by first order conditions of the Legrangian with respect to &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;, so we get:

&lt;math&gt;u^\prime \left ( f(k_t) - k_{t+1} \right ) = \beta u^\prime \left ( f(k_{t+1}) - k_{t+2} \right ) f^\prime (k_{t+1})&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1&lt;/math&gt;.

Given &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;, Weierstrass' Theorem guarantees that this problem has a solution since the objective function is continuous and the constraint set is closed and bounded (hence compact).  If ''T'' goes to infinity, however, we cannot guarantee a solution this way.  A discussion of this will come later.


=== Solution for finite ''T'' over continuous time ===

Now instead of a summation, we could use an integral to get a similar problem over continuous time.


&lt;math&gt;\max \int_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(f(k_t)-k_{t+1})&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1} \leq f(k_t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t = 0, 1, \ldots, T-1&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve this using Calculus of Variations (Euler's Equation), or use Hamiltonians if necessary, which we remember is very similar in form to first order conditions of the Legrangian with respect to &lt;math&gt;k_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Using Euler's equation, we get:

      <comment>/* Manufacturing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are millions of enterprises organized into thousands of industries.  When all factors are considered, each enterprise is unique but there is a great deal of overlap (e.g. everyone has a General Ledger and Accounts Payable).  The biggest industry in terms of revenue is manufacturing.  The second biggest is retail.  Although there are thousands of industries, there are only a few dozen intrinsic functions.  An ERP system is designed to accommodate many industries using a common base of functions.

== Manufacturing ==
Manufacturers create their products from raw materials and parts.  This can be as simple as assembling a dozen standard parts to creating products that have thousands of components, hundreds of operations, and require weeks of engineering.  Some manufacturers sell their products directly to the end-users; others sell them to distributors or large retailers.  Some manufacturers produce millions of identical products; others produce custom, one-off products.  The Manufacturing sub-system is key to manufacturers.

== Distribution ==
Distributors buy products from manufacturers in large quantities (truckloads, railcar loads) and sell them in smaller quantities to retailers.  Inventory and Warehousing are important functions for distributors.
== Retail ==
Retail stores sell products in small quantities to businesses or consumers.  A large retailer might buy directly from the manufacturer; others buy from distributors.  Point of Sale (POS) is an important function for retail.
== Construction ==
Construction enterprises build things.  This can vary from a modest house to a multi-million dollar skyscraper or a six-lane freeway.  Job Costing and Project Management are important functions for construction enterprises.
== Professional Services ==
Professional Service enterprises include lawyers, accountants, consultants, architects, and other firms that bill their clients for their services.  Since they live or die on billings to clients, timesheets are an important function for professional service enterprises.
== Not-for-profit ==
For-profit enterprises exist to maximize value for their shareholders.  Not-for-profit enterprises exist to maximize services to their clients given the amount of resources they have.  Not-for-profits use different accounting practices and produce different financial statements than for-profits

==Overview==

In this experiment, corks are launched out of a tube using liquid nitrogen pressure.

==Safety==

===Safety Class===

Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)

===Required Safety Equipment===

*The show performer: Glasses and Cryogenic gloves

==Materials==

*Corks (real ones, not the plastic ones)
*Tube which is closed on one end
*Hammer
*Liquid nitrogen

==Procedure==

Put the liquid nitrogen into the tube. Take a cork and hammer it down the tube. Wait for a while, and the cork will launch itself off.

===Alternative methods===

Some people use a plastic bottle instead of a tube. This is more dangerous, because the plastic bottle is less strong. 

===Dangers===

*Make sure you always hold the tube while the cork is on (to prevent it from falling over)
*Make sure you always hit the cork only once. If you try to hit it a second time, it might launch itself while you are hitting it, hit the hammer, and fly into the audience.

===Other Factors===

This experiment does not work if the tube is too cold. Never do this experiment twice in a row with the same tube.

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

The gas in the tube evaporates, and when the pressure is high enough, the cork is pushed out.

===In the real world===

Cannon work like this, only instead of evaporation they use a chemical reaction to produce gas.

This book is going to serve as a logical extension of the [[Programmable Logic]] book, and will also work as a generalized companion peice to the [[Microprocessor Design]] book. Because of my work in this area, I would like to get an outline together quickly, and I would like to implement this book quickly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:48, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== Preface ==

'''System on a Chip''' (SoC) design is the process of using hardware description languages (such as Verilog and VHDL) to design chips for a particular purpose. SoC chips are typically designed by interconnecting a series of standalone modules or &quot;cores&quot; together to produce the final system. SoC is so called because chips produced from these designs typically contain all the elements, or many of the elements necessary to institute an entire computing system. Instead of having multiple peices of hardware connected together to form a standard computing system, all the different tasks of these hardware peices are included together as separate cores inside a single chip.

Brachial Plexus Palsy, also referred to as [http://www.erbpalsy.org Erb's Palsy], is type of obstetric brachial plexus injury, which is complication during delivery. Symptoms include paralysis of the arm or shoulder, lack of muscle control in the arm, a decrease of sensation in the arm or hand. 

The Brachial Plexus is located on the right and left side of your neck, between the neck and shoulder area. It is a group of nerves that run from the spinal cord through the arm to the wrist and hand.


'''Q. What is a Brachial Plexus Injury?'''

A. A brachial plexus injury is an injury to the nerves that supply the muscles of the arm. Injury to nerves of the brachial plexus can result in complete to partial paralysis to the shoulder, upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, or fingers.


'''Q. Are there various degrees of severity with a Brachial Plexus Injury?'''

A. There are four basic types of nerve injuries. Some people only have one type while others have a combination of two or more types.
� Avulsion- the nerve is detached from the spinal cord.
� Rupture- the nerve is separated from itself, but not at the juncture of the nerve and the spinal cord. There may be one or more ruptures in a single nerve.
� Praxis or Traction- the nerve is typically overstretched and damaged, but not detached from itself or the spinal cord.
� Neuroma- scar tissue has surrounded the injured nerve and excessive pressure is now placed on the nerve. Therefore, the nerve has trouble getting all the signals to the muscle to be able to perform a movement.


'''Q. How do Brachial Plexus Injuries occur?'''

A. Brachial plexus injuries occur when there is excessive stretching, tearing, or other trauma to the brachial plexus network. Injuries can be sustained during delivery of a baby. This is known as Obstetrical Brachial Plexus. Traumatic Brachial Plexus is seen when injuries are sustained secondary to vehicular accidents such as automobiles, motorcycles, or boats, sports injuries particularly football, gunshot wounds, or surgeries. Traumatic BPI's have also been noted with animal bites or puncture wounds.


'''Q. What are some symptoms associated with Brachial Plexus Injuries?'''

A. There are several degrees of symptoms that can be seen with BPI. Here are some of the most typical examples:
� Limited active range of motion of the entire arm or any part of the arm.
� Sensation changes in the involved arm.
� Weakness of specific muscle groups.
� Poor ability to perform typical midline activities.
� Poor ability to weight bear through the arm.
� Neglect of the affected arm.
� Posturing of the arm in atypical positions.
� Developmental Delay
� Torticollis- a shortened muscle of the neck, so the head tilts to one side.


'''Q. How often do obstetrical brachial plexus injuries occur?'''

A. The current research suggests that brachial plexus injuries are seen 1-4 in every 1000 live births.


'''Q. What are the treatments?'''

A. Treatments include but are not limited to the following: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, aquatic therapy, surgical interventions, splinting, casting, electrical stimulation.


'''Q. When should I initiate treatments?'''

A. It is essential that a person suffering from a brachial plexus injury initiate treatments as soon as possible. Typically, a person suffering from an obstetrical brachial plexus injury sees a physical therapist or occupational therapist in the first two weeks of life. The goal of the therapist is to assist the family in Range of motion exercises, assess for muscle contractions even when movement is not seen, address positioning, make adaptive equipment, reduce the infant's tendencies toward neglect, and avoid atypical movement patterns, avoid tightening of muscles, and assist with weight bearing activities even in the newborn stage.

      <comment>moving this chapter's section on Vikings to the previous chapter, and synthesizing them ~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">European contact with the American continent began as a brief exploration by the Vikings.  Knowledge of their new-found land became legend.  European desire for spices and contact with Asia allowed intrepid explorers the opportunity to re-discover the American continent.  Christopher Columbus, incorrectly calculating the size of the earth, undertook a voyage around the world.  His legacy was not to find a new route to Asia, as he hoped, but to find a new continent.  This continent was named America, after another early explorer, Amerigo Vespucci.

Other countries apart from the Spanish began to explore and establish settlements in the New World.  Jacques Cartier undertook a northern voyage for the French. There they began the settlement of New France, developing the fur industry and fostering a more respectful relationship with many of the inhabitants. The Spanish conquistadors invaded the new world looking for riches.  While some Spanish invaders destroyed the powerful Aztec and Inca cultures, others chased legends, such as the fountain of youth and the hidden city of gold.  With the Spanish empire spanning much of the South and New France situated in the North, there was still room for the English to exploit.  As English nationalism rose in the 16th century, The English began to colonize the mid-Atlantic region of the Continent. 

==The Triumph of Christopher Columbus==
By the 15th Century trade in Europe was expanding.  The Roman Empire had broken up into several strong Kingdoms.  Trade for luxuries such as spices and silk had inspired European explorers to seek new routes to Asia.  The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 was a pivotal reason for European exploration.  Trade throughout the Ottoman Empire was difficult and unreliable.  In particular, Portugal  held a lead in exploration and was slowly exploring the shores of the African Continent in search of a better route to the spices and luxuries of the Orient.

It was upon this backdrop that an explorer, Christopher Columbus, submitted his plans for a voyage to Asia by sailing around the world.  By the late 15th century most educated Europeans knew the world was round.  The Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, had accurately deduced that the world was approximately 25,000 miles in diameter.  Based on this figure many of the experts studying Columbus's plans, on behalf of the European monarchies that he approached, correctly felt it was too far for any contemporary sailing ship to go.  Columbus contested the measurements claiming that the world was much smaller than widely believed.  

After several approaches to the Italian, English, and Portuguese monarchies,the Spanish King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella finally decided to give Columbus a chance, despite the advice of their contemporaries. King Ferdinand thought that perhaps Columbus would find something that could give the Spanish an opportunity to compete with their neighboring kingdom of Portugal.  As it turned out, Columbus succeeded and launched Europe towards a new age of discovery. Columbus set out on his voyage on Aug 3, 1492.  Five weeks later, after almost being thrown overboard by his own crew, the long voyage would come to an end when land was sighted. This was an island called Guanahani, which is also known as San Salvador in the present-day Bahamas. During this voyage Columbus also explored the northeast coast of Cuba and the northern coast of Hispaniola. On his return to Spain, his news of the new lands discovered spread throughout Europe. Columbus was to make three more voyages to the New World, between 1492 and 1503, exploring the area of the Caribbean and the mainland of Central and South America. 

Columbus had been granted the authority by the Spanish Monarchy to claim the land for the Spanish, begin a settlement, trade for valuable goods or gold and explore.  He was also made governor of all the lands which he found. Columbus become an increasingly savage and brutal governor, with three subsequent voyages to explore and exploit the riches and resources of the Native Americans.  He enslaved and stole from the natives, at one point threatening to cut off the hands of any native who failed to give him gold.  His brutal reign would foreshadow the arrival of the Spanish warriors called Conquistadors who would plunder and destroy the large, wealthy Aztec, Incan, and Mayan civilizations. 

Christopher Columbus believed for the remainder of his life, that he had reached Asia.  However, it was another Spanish explorer, Amerigo Vespucci who gave his name to the new continent. Amerigo tried to describe the lands around his islands and deduce its proximity to Asia.  From his voyages, Amerigo deduced that Columbus had found a new Continent.  This new continent would be named America.

==French Empire in North America==

Christopher Columbus's voyages inspired other European powers to seek out the new world as well.  Jacques Cartier was a respected mariner in his native France, he proposed a trip to the north to investigate whether Asian lands could be reached from the North.  His trip in 1534 retraced much of the voyages of the vikings and established contacts with natives in modern-day Canada.  He explored some of northern Canada, established friendly relations with the American Indians, and discovered that the St Lawrence river region neither had abundant gold nor a northwest passage to Asia.

During the 16th century, the taming of Siberian wilderness by the Russians had established a thriving fur trade which created a great demand for fur throughout Europe. France was quick to realize that the North held great potential as a provider of fur.  Samuel de Champlain settled the first permanent settlement in present-day Canada and created a thriving trade with the native Americans for beaver pelts and other animal hides.

Meanwhile, in the South, Early French protestants, called Huguenots, had the opportunity to leave hostile European lands while advancing French claims to the new world.  Settlements in present-day Florida and Georgia would create tension with Spanish conquistadors, who after conquering Caribbean lands would begin to expand their search for new lands.

==Spanish Empire in North America==
The Spanish conquistador, Ponce de Leon was an early visitor to the Americas, traveling to the new world on Columbus's second voyage.  He became the first governor of Puerto Rico in 1509.  However, upon the death of Christopher Columbus, the Spanish did not allow Christopher's son (who also had committed atrocities upon the native Americans of the Caribbean) to succeed.  The governors were released and replaced with successors from Spain.  

Ponce De Leon, freed of his governorship, decided to explore areas to the north, where there was rumored to be a fountain of youth that restored the youth of anyone drinking from it.  Ponce de Leon found a peninsula on the coast of North America, called the new land 'Florida' and chartered a colonizing expedition.  Ponce de Leon's presence was brief as he was attacked by native American forces and died in nearby Cuba. 

By the early 16th century, Spanish conquistadors had penetrated deep into the Central and South American continents. Native American cultures had collected large troves of gold and valuables and given them to leaders of these prosperous empires. The conquistadors, believing they held considerable military and technological superiority over these cultures, attacked and destroyed the Aztecs in 1521 and the Incas in 1532.

The wealth seized by the Spanish would lead to piracy and a new wave of settlements as the other colonial powers became increasingly hostile towards Spain.  Many areas and nations that were solely colonized by Spain, were inundated with French and English pirates. 

By 1565, Spanish forces looked to expand their influence (and religion, Catholicism) in the New World by attacking the French settlement of Fort Caroline.  The Spanish navy overwhelmed 200 French Huguenot settlers, slaughtering, even as they surrendered to Spain's superior military might.  Spain formed the settlement of St. Augustine as an outpost to ensure that French Huguenots where no longer welcome in the area.  St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied European-established city in North America.

Catholicism was introduced to the American colonies by the Spanish settlers in what is now present day Florida (1513) &lt;ref&gt;Death in Early America.  Margaret M. Coffin.  1976 &lt;/ref&gt;and the South West United States.  The first Christian worship service was a Catholic mass held in modern day Pensacola Florida in 1559.  Spain established the first permanent European Catholic settlement in St. Augustine, Florida in 1565, to help the settlers complete the &quot;moral imperative&quot; which was to convert all the Native peoples to Christianity, and to also to help support the treasure fleets of Spain. &lt;ref&gt;American Catholics, James Hennesey, S.J.  1981&lt;/ref&gt; During the time period of 1635-1675 Franciscans operated between 40 and 70 mission stations, attempting to convert about 26,000 &quot;Hispanicized&quot; natives who organized themselves into 4 provinces, Timucua, in central Florida, Guale, along the coast of Georgia, Apalachee on the northeastern edge of the Gulf of Mexico, and Apalachicola to the west.

==British Empire in North America==
England funded an initial exploratory trip shortly after Christopher Columbus's first voyage.  John Cabot made the trip for England in 1501.  He explored the North American continent (correctly deducing that the spherical shape of the earth made the north, where the longitudes are much shorter, a quicker route to the New World than a trip to the South islands where Christopher was exploring). Encouraged, he asked the English monarchy for a more substantial expedition to further explore and settle the lands which he found.  The ships departed and were never seen again.

England remained preoccupied with internal affairs for much of the 16th century. But by the beginning of the 17th century, the English empire had consolidated much of the British isles and were becoming a much more formidable foe on the world's stage. The quickly expanding British navy was preparing for a massive strike upon the Spanish armada.

Sir Walter Raleigh gained considerable favor from Queen Elizabeth I by suppressing rebellions in Ireland and sought to establish an empire in the new world.  His Roanoke colony would be relatively isolated from existing settlements in North America.  He privately funded the colony, unlike earlier efforts that were usually funded and sponsored by monarchies.  The colony was thought to be destroyed during a three year period in which English was at war with Spanish and did serious damage to the Spanish navy.  

The war left the English monarchy drained of money and resources such that the English monarchy sold a charter containing lands between present-day South Carolina to the US-Canada border to two competing groups of investors; the Plymouth company and the London company.  The two companies were given the North and South portions of this area, respectively.

The Northern Plymouth settlement in Maine faltered and was abandoned, however the London company established the Jamestown settlement in 1606.  This settlement faltered but steadied by the determination of John Rolfe, the settlement developed tobacco as a cash crop for the colony and served as a beginning for the colonial state of Virginia.

== Virginia and Jamestown ==

Founded in 1607 with a charter from the Virginia Company of London, Jamestown was the first permanent English colony in the Americas. However, the swampy terrain was a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which carried a variety of diseases - dysentery, malaria, smallpox - that the English were unaccustomed to. Many of the settlers fell prey to these infections and died shortly after.

In addition, Virginia's initial government was weak, and its individual members frequently quarreled over policies. The colonists themselves frantically searched for any precious metals (e.g., gold) they could find, ignoring their deteriorating health in the process. Furthermore, &quot;Indian raids&quot; also weakened any hopes of defense and unification, and gradually the population of the colony declined. By the winter of 1609-1610, also known as the Starving Time, only 60 settlers remained from the original 500 passengers.

Despite these shortcomings, it was the work of two men that helped the colony to survive: John Smith and John Rolfe. John Smith, who arrived in Virginia in 1608, introduced an ultimatum - those who did not work would not receive food or pay. His struggle to improve the colony's conditions succeeded - the colonists learned how to raise crops and trade with the nearby Indians, with whom Smith had made peace.

In 1612, John Rolfe, an English businessman, discovered that Virginia had ideal conditions for growing tobacco. This singular discovery led to an explosion of success as the plant became the colony's major cash crop. With English demand for tobacco rising, Virginia had now found a way to support itself economically.

In 1619, Virginia set up the House of Burgesses, the first elected legislative assembly in America. It marked the beginnings of self-government, as to the martial law that was previously imposed on the colonists.

Simultaneously, however, Virginia was declared a &quot;crown colony&quot; meaning that charter was transferred from the Virginia Company to the Crown of England, which meant that Jamestown was now a colony run by the English monarchy. While the House of Burgesses was still allowed to run the government, the king nevertheless appointed a royal governor to settle disputes and enforce certain British policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">I suggest to use the following techinque

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html:div class=&quot;tabs&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:switch&gt;
&lt;xf:case id=&quot;tab_1&quot;&gt;
	&lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;tab&quot; active=&quot;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;xf:label&gt;Tab1&lt;/xf:label&gt;
		&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;tab_1&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;page_1&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/xf:action&gt;
	&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
	&lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;
		&lt;xf:label&gt;Объект&lt;/xf:label&gt;
		&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;tab_2&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;page_2&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/xf:action&gt;
	&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/xf:case&gt;
&lt;xf:case id=&quot;tab_2&quot;&gt;
	&lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;
		&lt;xf:label&gt;Tab1&lt;/xf:label&gt;
		&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;tab_1&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;page_1&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/xf:action&gt;
	&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
	&lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;tab&quot; active=&quot;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;xf:label&gt;Объект&lt;/xf:label&gt;
		&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;tab_2&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;page_2&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/xf:action&gt;
	&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/xf:case&gt;
&lt;/xf:switch&gt;
&lt;/html:div&gt;

&lt;html:div class=&quot;pages&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:switch&gt;
&lt;xf:case id=&quot;page_1&quot;&gt;
	&lt;html:div class=&quot;page page_1&quot;&gt;
1111111111111111111
	&lt;/html:div&gt;
&lt;/xf:case&gt;
&lt;xf:case id=&quot;page_2&quot;&gt;
	&lt;html:div class=&quot;page page_2&quot;&gt;
2222222222222222222
	&lt;/html:div&gt;
&lt;/xf:case&gt;
&lt;/xf:switch&gt;
&lt;/html:div&gt;

and specifying different look in CSS for

xf|trigger.tab { /* vanilla tab */
...
}
xf|trigger.tab[active] { /* current tab */
...
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

That way the first tab and page are selected by default.

== Automatically selecting the first tab. ==

I found this example extremely helpful. To get around the problem of automatically selecting the first tab, I just added the following to my &lt;body&gt; element:

onload=&quot;window.location = '#tab1';&quot;

From a practical standpoint it's a simple workaround until something better comes along.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Maturation==
Individuals, during their progression from infancy to adulthood, experience a variety of changes, including physical, cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial.

===Puberty===
Successfully navigating the transition from juvenile, to meet the demands of adulthood, remains one of the trickiest tasks any individual will likely face. The changes in behavioral repertoire that occur during puberty are reflected in the maturation of endocrine, neural and neurochemical systems. The influence of rising gonadal hormones on male and female reproductive behaviors are well understood. However, corresponding changes also exist in structure and function of neural circuits underlying a much broader range of behavioral and cognitive development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Sounds of Welsh ==

This is enough to get you started. For a fuller guide, please see the reference work at [[Welsh/Pronunciation|Pronunciation of Welsh]].

=== Consonants ===
We will start with learning the consonant sounds of Welsh. We've split them into 4 groups. Consonants in Welsh can only make one unique sound, as opposed to English which can make several sounds per consonant. For example, the '''c''' can make a k sound as in '''cat''' or a s sound as in '''city'''. When you learn the sound a consonant makes in Welsh, it will ''only ever make that sound you learn''.

==== Consonant sounds same in English and Welsh ====
These consonants look the same in English and Welsh, and sound the same. 

*b {{IPA|/b/}} Like '''b''' in boy. Welsh example: '''b'''achgen (English: ''boy'')
*c {{IPA|/k/}} Like '''c''' in cat. Welsh example: '''c'''ath (English ''cat'')
*d {{IPA|/d/}} Like '''d''' in dog. Welsh example: '''d'''rwg (English ''bad'')
*g {{IPA|/g/}} Like '''g''' in gun. Welsh example: '''g'''ardd (English ''garden'')
*h {{IPA|/h/}} Like '''h''' in happy. Welsh example: '''h'''en (English ''old'')
*l {{IPA|/l/}} Like '''l''' in lake. Welsh example: ca'''l'''on (English ''heart'')
*m {{IPA|/m/}} Like '''m''' in mad. Welsh example: '''m'''am (English ''mother'')
*n {{IPA|/n/}} Like '''n''' in none. Welsh example: '''n'''ain (English ''grandmother'')
*ng {{IPA|/ŋ/}} Like the end of the English word si'''ng'''. In Welsh, this letter can come at the front of a word. In Welsh, it is never pronounced with a hard g, as in the English ''finger''. Welsh example: a'''ng'''au (English ''death'')
*p {{IPA|/p/}} Like '''p''' in poker. Welsh example: '''p'''en (English ''head'')
*s {{IPA|/s/}} Like '''s''' in sad. Welsh example: '''s'''ebon (English ''soap'')
*t {{IPA|/t/}} Like '''t''' in tar. Welsh example: '''t'''ŷ (English ''house'')
*th {{IPA|/θ/}} Like '''th''' in think. Welsh example: me'''th'''u (English ''fail'')

==== Consonant sounds in English, Different letter in Welsh ====
These sounds are found in English, but they are assigned to a different letter in Welsh. Train yourself to read them differently now.

*f {{IPA|/v/}} Like '''v''' in '''violin'''. Welsh example: ga'''f'''r (English ''goat'')
*ff {{IPA|/f/}} Like '''f''' in '''friend'''. Welsh example: '''ff'''rind (English ''friend'')
*dd {{IPA|/ð/}} Like '''th''' in '''then'''. Welsh example: har'''dd''' (English ''beautiful'')

==== Consonant sounds in English, Not in Welsh ====
These sounds are in English, but you will not hear them in Welsh.

* The '''c''' in Welsh only makes a hard {{IPA|/k/}} sound. It will never sound like an '''s''', such as in the English ''city''.
* The '''g''' only makes a {{IPA|/g/}} sound. It will never sound like an English '''g''', like in the English ''gender''.
* The '''th''' in Welsh represents the '''th''' in English ''think''. The '''dd''' represents the other '''th''' in English, like the word '''then'''.
* There is no '''z''' sound in Welsh.

==== Consonant sounds only in Welsh ====
These consonant sounds may be new to you.

*ch {{IPA|/x/}} Like the Scottish lo'''ch''' or German composer Ba'''ch'''. Welsh example: '''ch'''we'''ch''' (English ''six'')
*ll {{IPA|/ɬ/}} The '''ll''' is a hard Welsh sound to make. It is best described as putting your tongue in the position of '''l''' and then blowing out air gently. Like saying a '''h''' and '''l''' simultaneously, but with more puff. Welsh example: '''ll'''yn (English ''lake'')
*r {{IPA|/r/}} The Welsh '''r''' should always be trilled. Welsh example: a'''r''' (English ''on'')
*rh {{IPA|/r̥/}} The Welsh '''rh''' should be trilled with aspiration. Like saying a '''h''' and '''r''' simultaneously, but with more puff. Welsh example: '''rh'''an (English ''part'')

=== Vowels ===
There are seven vowels in Welsh. Most vowels can be two different sounds. The '''y''' can take three different sounds. There are clear patterns on when to use which vowel sound, but for the beginning level: learn how to pronounce each word as you go along, and you'll eventually be able to logically deduce which vowel sound to use.

* a
* e
* i
* o
* u
* w
* y

* The names of the letters above are in Southern dialect. In the North, the letters are pronounced differently.
* ''h'' indicates voicelessness in ''mh, nh,'' and ''ngh''.
* ''ph'' occurs occasionally in words derived from Greek (e.g. ''phenol'') but more commonly as a result of aspirate mutation (e.g. ''ei phen-ôl'')
* ''y'' indicates {{IPA|/ə/}} in unstressed monosyllabic words (e.g. ''y'' &quot;the&quot;, ''fy'' &quot;my&quot;) or non-final syllables, but {{IPA|/ɨ̞, ɨː/}} (N) or {{IPA|/ɪ, iː/}} (S) everywhere else.

Welsh, as with all other Celtic languages, often sees changes made to the beginning of words depending on the word that precedes it, or the role it plays in the sentence. These changes are known as &quot;mutations&quot;, of which Welsh has three distinct types. Common situations in which a mutation may occur are when a word follows a preposition, possessive, or number.

The three classes of mutation are soft, nasal, and aspirate. Soft mutations are by far the most common, whereas aspirate mutations are becoming applied less and less in the spoken language. All mutations occur to words commencing with one of nine different consonants (''p,t,c,b,d,g,m,ll,rh''), replacing them with different consonants according to mutation type. There are two important things to note at this point:

*''ll'' and ''rh'' are treated as separate letters in their own right and hence have their own section in the dictionary
*A good knowledge of the possible changes is essential when searching for a word in the dictionary: ''botel'', ''mhotel'', and ''photel'' – for example – are all mutated forms of the &quot;base&quot; word ''potel'' (meaning &quot;bottle&quot;), which will only be listed in this base (or radical) form in the dictionary. Similarly, knowing that the soft mutation of an initial ''g'' causes it to disappear will help to trace an instance of ''orsaf'' back to its radical form ''gorsaf'' (&quot;station&quot;).   

==== Soft mutation ====
Soft mutation occurs in several common situations in the language. Here is a list of those situations.

1. '''Feminine nouns''': Welsh has two genders of noun but the importance of committing these genders to memory is slightly less obvious when teaching oneself then it is in other languages such as French and Spanish. While in French gender dictates a series of changes - which definite article is used (''le/la''), how adjectives agree (''petit/petite'')... - in Welsh the gender of the noun has a more subtle, but important role in constructing grammatically correct sentences.

Inserting the definite article ''y'' (''yr'' before a vowel) causes a feminine noun to undergo a soft mutation.

Example:

*''bachgen'' - boy
*''merch'' - girl

after adding the definite article we have:

*''y bachgen'' - the boy
'''but''':
*''y '''f'''erch'' - the girl (As can be seen from the table above, soft mutation means ''' ''m'' ''' becomes ''' ''f'' ''')

The same occurs when the number ''un'' - one is placed precedes the noun. Hence:

*''un bachgen'' - one boy
*''un ferch'' - one girl.

Note 'a boy' would be put into Welsh as simply ''bachgen'', there is no equivalent for the indefinite article 'a' in Welsh.

2. '''Adjectives following feminine nouns''' Continuing to use the examples above we will see how any adjective following a feminine noun will also undergo soft mutation.

*''y bachgen'' - the boy
*''y ferch'' - the girl

Adding the adjective ''bach'' (Eng. little) gives us:

*''y bachgen bach'' - the little boy
'''but''':
*''y ferch '''f'''ach'' - the little girl ('' '''b''' '' also mutates to '' '''f''' '')

The difference is clear in the following two phrases:

*''Prynhawn da'' - Good afternoon 
*''Noswaith dda'' - Good evening

''Noswaith'' (evening) mutates the adjective ''da'' (good)→''dda'' because it is feminine, while ''prynhawn'' (afternoon) - a masculine noun - does not. 

3. '''After the majority of prepositions.''' Most prepostions, particularly monosyllabic ones, require a soft mutation.

Examples:
*''Croeso i '''G'''ymru'' - Welcome to Wales ('''''C''''' → '''''G''''')
*''O '''F'''angor i '''L'''andudno'' - From Bangor to Llandudno ('''''B''''' → '''''F''''' and '''''Ll''''' → '''''L''''')

List of prepositions triggering a soft mutation - 

''am'' : ''ar'' : ''at'' : ''dan''  : ''dros'' : ''drwy'' : ''gan'' : ''heb'' : ''hyd'' : ''i'' : ''o'' : ''wrth''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;
! Welsh !! English !! base form of mutated word
|-
| '''am f'''lynyddoedd
| for years
| blynyddoedd
|- 
| '''ar d'''aith 
| on a journey
| taith
|-
| '''at g'''ost o £15
| at a cost of £15
| cost
|-
| '''dan r'''eolaeth 
| under control
| rheolaeth
|-
| '''dros dd'''wy awr 
| over two hours
| dwy
|-
| '''drwy dd'''ull electronig
| by electronic means
| dull
|-
| '''gan L'''ywodraeth Cymru
| by the Welsh Government
| llywodraeth
|-
| '''heb r'''ybydd
| without warning
| rhybydd
|-
| '''hyd g'''opa'r bryn
| to the top of the hill
| copa
|-
| '''i b'''lant
| for children
| plant
|-
| '''o''' orsaf yr heddlu
| from the police station
| gorsaf
|-
| '''wrth g'''reu swyddi
| by creating jobs
| creu
|}

4. '''After certain possessives''' The pronouns for the possessives 'your' and 'his' also require soft mutation. Other possessives require nasal and aspirate mutations.

''dy...(di)'' - your (familiar)

''ei...(fe/o)'' - his

Examples:

''tafarn'' - pub

gives:

''dy '''d'''afarn (di)'' - your pub

''llyfr'' - book

gives:

''ei '''l'''yfr (fe/o)'' - his book

The pronoun ''ei'' also mean 'her', as well as his, but in this case it requires an aspirate mutation, as is seen in the section below

====Aspirate Mutation====
This type of mutation is shown in the fourth column of the table.

1. '''After a certain possessive''' The pronoun ''ei'' (this time, meaning ''her'') causes an aspirate mutation. 

''ei...(hi)''' - her

Examples:
*''Carreg'' - Stone
*''Tad'' - Father

After adding ''ei'', we have:

*''Ei '''Ch'''arreg (hi)''  - Her Stone
*''Ei '''Th'''ad (hi)'' - Her Father

2. '''After ''a/ac''''' ''A/ac'' is the word ''and'' (''Ac'' is used before a vowel, hence it cannot cause an aspirate mutation).

...''a''... - ...and...

Examples:
*''Trosedd'' - Crime
*''Cosb'' - Punishment
*''Bara'' - Bread
*''Caws'' - Cheese

If we link two of them together with ''a''...

*''Trosedd a '''ch'''osb'' - Crime and Punishment
*''Bara a '''ch'''aws'' - Bread and cheese

====Nasal Mutation====
Nasal mutation is the third column in our table.

1. '''After the locative''' The locative in Welsh is the word ''yn'' (in). 

* This should not be confused with ''yn'' when it operates as a particle in constructing a [[Welsh/Verbs|verb]]. When used in this grammatical sense it does not require mutation.

''Yn''... - In...

Examples:

*''Porthmadog'' - Porthmadog
*''Tresaeth'' - Tresaeth
*''Caerdydd'' - Cardiff
*''Bangor'' - Bangor
*''Dolgellau'' - Dolgellau
*''Glanllyn'' - Glanllyn

If we add the locative:

*''Y'''m''' '''Mh'''orthmadog'' - In Porthmadog
*''Y'''n''' '''Nh'''resaeth'' - In Tresaeth
*''Y'''ng''' '''Ngh'''aerdydd'' - In Cardiff
*''Y'''m''' '''M'''angor'' - In Bangor
*''Y'''n''' '''N'''olgellau'' - In Dolgellau
*''Y'''ng''' '''Ng'''lanllyn'' - In Glanllyn

You may have noticed that ''yn'' also mutates. This is not a typing error. It mutates before a nasal mutation too:

*''Yn'' - Before a mutated T or D
*''Ym'' - Before a mutated P or B
*''Yng'' - Before a mutated C or G

2. '''After ''fy''.''' The word ''fy'', meaning &quot;my&quot;, causes nasal mutation in the next word:

*''dillad'' - clothes
*''fy nillad'' - my clothes
*''brawd'' - brother
*''fy mrawd'' - my brother
*''tadau'' - fathers
*''fy nhadau'' - my fathers

In the spoken language, because the nasal mutation occurs so rarely, the word ''fy'' can drop out entirely:

*''nillad'' - my clothes
*''mrawd'' - my brother
*''nhadau'' - my fathers

==Plurals==
====-wr and -wyr==== 
If a noun ends with '''-wr''' (meaning &quot;man&quot;), as in &quot;mil'''wr'''&quot; (soldier), change the stem into '''-wyr'''.

'''Examples'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Singular
! Plural
! English
|-
|Mil'''wr'''
|Mil'''wyr'''
|Soldier - Soldiers
|-
|Hel'''wr'''
|Hel'''wyr'''
|Hunter - Hunters
|-
|Saeth'''wr'''
|Saeth'''wyr'''
|Archer - Archers
|}

You can make a ''-wr'' noun feminine by changing it into ''-wraig''. For the plural, change this into ''-wragedd''.

'''Examples'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Singular
! Plural
! English
|-
|Mil'''wraig'''
|Mil'''wragedd'''
|Soldier - Soldiers (f)
|-
|Hel'''wraig'''
|Hel'''wragedd'''
|Hunter - Hunters (f)
|-
|Saeth'''wraig'''
|Saeth'''wragedd'''
|Archer - Archers (f)
|}

== The Genitive ==
====Indefinite====
To turn a word into an indefinite genitive (of a...), simply write:

'''object subject'''

For example, if the object was &quot;milwyr&quot; (soldiers), and the subject was &quot;Cymru&quot; (Wales), the sentence would be &quot;milwyr Cymru&quot; (Soldiers of Wales).

====Definite====
To turn a word into a definite genitive (of the...), simply write

'''object''' ''y/yr'' '''subject'''

For example, if the object was &quot;carreg&quot; (rock), and the subject was &quot;mynydd&quot; (mountain), the sentence would be &quot;carreg y mynydd&quot; (Rock of the mountain).

Note that &quot;y&quot; causes a soft mutation before a feminine noun

For example, if the object was &quot;gwallt&quot; (hair), and the subject was &quot;merch&quot; (girl, feminine noun), the sentence would be &quot;gwallt y '''f'''erch&quot; (Hair of the girl, the girl's hair).

#Finalize a set of grading criteria (or agree on the criteria we already have)
#Create templates to mark books which are &quot;good&quot;.
#Create a process where books can be nominated for this distinction, and where people can vote on them.
Once we have that, I would say that this wikiprojet will be in business. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

: I just have one comment about the current listing; the &quot;other related policies&quot; is really vague and has no link, I think we should especially point to the necessity of following the NPOV and NOR, and the copyright policy (those, IMO, are the most fundamental policies). Other than that I think the current criteria are quite good and I would support them. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

::There is plenty of room for improvement in this area, and any changes that you think should be made, you can feel free to add. I will likely be doing alot of work on this project in the near future myself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Changes are made ==

I must admit, despite [[wikibooks:be Bold]] I still am a little leery of editing policy pages but since it is still in development I guess it makes more sense for me to show directly what I felt was missing.Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 05:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

: Quick question: What will be the biggest difference between this and the Editorial Board? They seem to go hand-in-hand; should we maybe make a step-by-step process? I think maybe that would make sense, where an aspiring book first becomes listed under good books, then once listed can go under editorial review, and then finally to the publishing project... I'd like to propose that we make this an &quot;official&quot; part of the project... what do you think? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::Good question. The editorial board as I envision it is just a group of people who focus on publishing and distributing. The Good books project will be a group of people who find good books here on wikibooks, and maintain the list at [[Wikibooks:Featured books]]. In general, I would say that alot of people should be working hand-in-hand to be authoring and promoting our books, from curriculum planning, book authoring, editing, promoting, publishing, and distributing. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

: Another quick question: Are we basically purging the current list of featured books and starting over? Or are we going to start from that, prune, and expand from there? I would like to avoid nominating books already on the list if it is the latter. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 20:06, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

::I think it's a good idea to start with the existing list, and work from there. Many of the books on that list are acceptable, but should be double-checked anyway. Books can slowly degrade over time, especially as the primary authors lose interest, and other random authors make unwatched changes that are of lower quality then the original text. We might also want to keep an eye on [[Wikibooks:Nearly complete]], as that list will accomplish nearly the same thing (and may even superceed this list). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

== Accuracy and completeness ==

As Whiteknight [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Featured_books/Nominations&amp;diff=1215313&amp;oldid=1215006 pointed out] (among others), and I had been noticing myself, we don't concentrate on these issues when considering books for Featured status. I think we should - these are just as important (if not moreso!) than our current criteria. While I love to see books following the naming policy, being accurate and complete is far more important in my view.

Adding some wording to cover these aspects would raise a few issues. We already know who will be considering these books; it's a rather limited subset of a rather limited subset of the fairly small community. That is, it will not necessarily be the case that any book nominated will cover a subject we have an expert for (barring the author, who wouldn't necessarily be impartial anyways). So if we don't have someone who knows the subject well, can we evaluate whether it is accurate and complete appropriately?

I don't know the answer here - we may end up simply concluding that we can't assess these things reliably, and therefore cannot add them as criteria. I'd be very unhappy with that conclusion, but I'm unsure how we can come to another one. Perhaps the easiest is to add these as criteria, and figure it out later - if we don't come across a book for which we have no (second) expert, great! If we do, then we can deal with it at that point. Possible solutions there include trying to find an external reviewer from Wikipedia, or from academia.

I'd certainly be interested to hear some thinking on these issues, as writing this was the most consideration I had given the topic to date. I look forward to some good old-fashioned collaboration :) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:34, 8 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Forwards==
''Spot'' markets allow the purchase and sale of an asset today. By contrast a ''forward'' contract specifies the price at which an asset can be purchased or sold at some future date. Although a forward contract is classified as a derivative in many markets it is difficult to distinguish between the underlying and the forward contract. Large trading volumes in OTC forwards can in fact make them more significant than spot markets.    

A forward contract does not require ''upfront'' payment. It is simply the purchase or sale of an asset at some future date at a fixed price (the ''forward price''). Therefore the assumption is that the forward price reflects the value of this asset on this date. If this assumption is based on a market view, characterising a forward contract as a derivative is misleading.

The primary reason for the classification of a forward contract as a derivative is that in many cases its price can be derived through a no-arbitrage argument that relates the forward price of an asset to its spot price. For assets like oil this is not possible; given the spot price of a barrel of oil it is not possible to construct an arbitrage argument that relates it to the forward price. In the oil markets forwards or futures are effectively the underlying and cannot be understood as derivatives. In these markets the forward price of oil is similar in nature to the price of a stock: it reflects the current consensus of the market and has nothing to do with risk-neutral valuation.

In financial markets forwards can be determined through a no-arbitrage argument. Consider for example a forward on the USD vs EUR exchange rate. If today one euro can be exchanged for 1.3 dollars (&lt;math&gt; FX_{spot} &lt;/math&gt;) then in order to determine the forward exchange rate one year from now we can look at the following set of trades,
* We buy a one year forward that guarantees an exchange rate of &lt;math&gt; FX_{one year} &lt;/math&gt; dollars per euro. 
* We borrow one dollar today.
* We exchange it for (1/1.3) euros and invest this amount in a deposit account.
* After one year we withdraw the principal and the interest earned and exchange them into dollars at  &lt;math&gt; FX_{one year} &lt;/math&gt;.
The net cashflow of this trade at expiry is,

&lt;math&gt;
-(1+r_{USD}) + \frac{1}{FX_{spot}} (1+r_{EUR}) FX_{one year}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the absence of arbitrage opportunities the net cashflow of this trade should be zero and therefore,

&lt;math&gt;
FX_{one year}=FX_{spot}  \frac{(1+r_{USD})}{(1+r_{EUR})}  
&lt;/math&gt;

Another example is a forward contract on a zero coupon one year bond , one year from now. Given the price of a one year bond &lt;math&gt; P_{1 year} &lt;/math&gt; and a two year bond &lt;math&gt; P_{2 year} &lt;/math&gt; we look at the following set of trades,
* Sell a one year zero coupon bond one year from now at forward price &lt;math&gt; P_{1,1} &lt;/math&gt;.
* Buy a one year zero coupon bond today.
* Sell a two year zero coupon bond today.
Since &lt;math&gt; P_{1 year}&gt;P_{2 year} &lt;/math&gt; we must borrow the difference. After one year we receive $1 from the one year bond and pay interest and principal on the amount borrowed. The two year bond has one year to maturity and we transfer it to the buyer of the forward in return for &lt;math&gt; P_{1,1} &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the net cashflow in one year is,

&lt;math&gt;
-(P_{1 year}-P_{2 year})(1+r_{1 year})+1+ P_{1,1}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the absence of arbitrage opportunities this cashflow must be zero. Since,

&lt;math&gt;
P_{1 year}= \frac{1}{(1+r_{1 year})}
&lt;/math&gt;

we conclude that,

&lt;math&gt;
P_{1,1}=P_{2 year}/P_{1 year}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is interesting to note that the formula,

&lt;math&gt;
P_{1 year}= \frac{1}{(1+r_{1 year})}
&lt;/math&gt;

is based on a &quot;no-arbitrage&quot; argument itself and the one year bond can be viewed as the &quot;forward contract&quot; for one dollar received in one year. Given the value of &lt;math&gt; r_{1 year} &lt;/math&gt;, if the price of the one year bond was different from &lt;math&gt; 1/(1+r_{1 year}) &lt;/math&gt; one could sell a one-year bond at a price &lt;math&gt; P^* &gt; P_{1 year} &lt;/math&gt;. At expiry one dollar would be paid to the buyer of the bond but since the proceeds from the sale would have earned &lt;math&gt; P^* (1+r_{1 year}) &lt;/math&gt; they would cover this payment and leave a clear profit. Only if &lt;math&gt; P^* = 1/(1+r_{1 year}) = P_{1 year} &lt;/math&gt; the condition of no arbitrage holds.

&lt;!-- A forward contract is the primordial form of 'Future contract'. A forward contract is an agreement to trade an asset on a specified date for a specified price. Terms and Conditions pertaining to contract such as the mode of delivery, place of delivery, price and mode of payment etc. are agreed upon bilaterally between the buyer and the seller. Although generally forward contract take place outside the exchanges but lately these contracts have become very standardize. However, futures market is the most sophisticated version of Forwards contracts. In nutshell, a forward contract which is undertaken as per the rules and regulations of a particular exchange becomes a Futures contract. Main problems faced by a Forward contract are 
a)Less Liquidity
b)Counterparty Risk
c)Lack of Regualation

These problems can be overcome by entering into a Futures Contract.
--&gt;

The main features of forward contract are :
 
*It is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asstes at a pre agreed future point in  time.
 
*Buying or selling price of assets is determined in present time.
 
*The transfer or delivery of assets is in future agreed period.
 
*Any terms of contract can be negotiated (not standardized)between the parties invlved in the forward contract
 
*Transaction on forward contract are not transparant.
 
*The different between the spot and the forward price is the forward premium or forward contract.
 
*If the price of stock is increased in future, investor(buyer) will gain and seller will bear loss.

==Futures==
Futures contracts, like forward contracts, specify the delivery of an asset at some future date. Futures contracts, unlike forward contracts,
#  Require the buyer or the seller of the futures contract to ''post margin''.
# Have ''minimum margin'' requirements; these requirements are achieved through a ''margin call''.
# Use the process of ''mark-to-market''.
There three requirements in practice are not unique to futures contracts. The best way to understand them is by looking at a specific futures contract.

The corn futures contract trades at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The specifications of the contract are very strict and require the delivery of &quot;no. 2 yellow&quot; corn; if other grades of corn are delivered instead the price paid is adjusted [http://www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/cont_detail/1,3206,1213+14389,00.html]. The contract size can be in multiples of 5,000 bushels of corn. Futures can be purchased for delivery of corn in months December, March, May, July and September only. Trading this contract ceases on the business day nearest to the 15th calendar date of the delivery month. Delivery takes place two business days after the 15th calendar date of the delivery month.

Assume that one lot (5,000 bushels) of the Jul-07 contract was bought at 418 cents/bushel on 24th January 2007. The exchange would require the buyer to post ''initial margin'' of $900. If the buyer does not post this amount of money in her account with the exchange, her order cannot be executed. For this contract the ''maintenance margin'' is the same; during the life of this futures contract the balance of the account cannot go below this level; if for any reason the balance of the account falls below the maintenance margin, the buyer of this contract will receive a ''margin call''.

On the date on which the trade was executed the mark-to-market of the futures contract is zero. Assume that on the next trading date, the ''settlement price'' of the futures contract is 418 3/4 cents/bushel (settlement price is the price traded for a futures contract at the close of the trading session). The mark-to-market of the Jul-07 corn futures is,

&lt;math&gt;
MtM = 5,000 * (418 3/4 - 418) = $37.50
&lt;/math&gt;

The balance on the buyer's account will now be $937.50. The account is like a normal deposit account and earns interest on its balance.

If the market price of the Jul-07 corn contract drops in the following day, the mark-to-market could drop from $37.50 to $12.50. In this case $25 are withdrawn from the buyer's account and the balance is now $912.50.

If on the last trading date of this contract (13th July 2007) the settlement price is 420 1/4 cents/bushel then the mark-to-market is $112.50. The final balance of the buyer's account is $1012.50 plus interest earned. Since the corn that will be delivered on the 17th July 2007 is worth $21,012.50, the buyer will pay this amount to the ''clearing house''. The clearing house acts as counterparty in the transaction between the corn producer and the buyer and makes sure payments are made and corn is delivered to the warehouse nominated by the buyer.

Since the trader has earned $112.50 (plus interest) in effect the net payment for delivery of corn is $20,900. This is equivalent to paying 418 cents/bushel on the corn delivered. The futures contract has therefore enabled the buyer to purchase corn at the original price of 418 cents/bushel and hedge against price changes. 

In order to compare the price of a forward contract &lt;math&gt; F_0 &lt;/math&gt; and the price of a futures contract &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt; we look at the following set of trades:
* We sell a forward contract to deliver a specific quantity of corn at some future date for price &lt;math&gt; F_0 &lt;/math&gt;.
* For dates &lt;math&gt; i=0,1,2, ... , N-1 &lt;/math&gt; we purchase a quantity &lt;math&gt; q_i &lt;/math&gt; of the futures contract so that the following conditions are satisfied:
** &lt;math&gt; q_0  (1+r_1)^{N-1} =1 &lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt; (q_0+q_1)  (1+r_2)^{N-2}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
** ...
** &lt;math&gt; (q_0+q_1+...+q_{N-1}) (1+r_{N-1})=1 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; r_i &lt;/math&gt; is the daily interest rate applicable for period starting on date &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and ending on date &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. This set of equations can be solved recursively. The value of the margin account on date &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; will be,

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} q_j \right) (1+r_i)^{N-i} [\Phi_i - \Phi_{i-1}]
&lt;/math&gt; 

To undestand the last equation, we know that on date &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; the total quantity of futures purchased is &lt;math&gt;q_0+q_1+...+q_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;. By the end of date &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; the mark-to-market change is equal to  &lt;math&gt;(q_0+q_1+...+q_{i-1})(\Phi_{i}-\Phi_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;. Depending on the direction of the change &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{i}-\Phi_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; this is a gain or a loss and earns or requires the payment of principal plus interest at the expiry date of the contract. 

Given the conditions that give rise to the solutions for &lt;math&gt; q_i &lt;/math&gt;, the last equation is equal to &lt;math&gt; \Phi_N - \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt;. Since at expiry the price of the futures is equal to the spot price of the asset and therefore &lt;math&gt; F_N = \Phi_N &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt; is different from &lt;math&gt; F_0 &lt;/math&gt; a risk-free profit can be generated. Note that there is no cost in entering into the series of futures contracts and depending on the sign of the difference &lt;math&gt; F_0 - \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt; the strategy can be reversed. Therefore the forward price must be equal to the futures price.

The strategy used in this analysis assumes that when we purchase an additional quantity &lt;math&gt; q_i &lt;/math&gt; of the futures contract we know the interest rate for the period &lt;math&gt; i+1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. Since in practise the actual value of the interest rate is not known assume that we can lock in a forward rate. However since we cannot predict the change in the mark-to-market of the futures contract in the period &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; i+1 &lt;/math&gt; we do not know the notional amount we must purchase.

Assume that on date &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; we make the assumption that there will be no change in the mark-to-market of the futures and therefore there is no need to lock in a forward rate for the period &lt;math&gt; i+1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. Since the most likely scenario is that we will be wrong, we will have to borrow or deposit the actual change in the mark-to-market at the spot rate for the period &lt;math&gt; r_{i+1} &lt;/math&gt;. 

As long as the error in our estimate of the mark-to-market change is independent of  the spot rate we can expect that the costs/benefits will balance to zero. But if the mark-to-market change of the futures contract is a function of spot rate the costs/benefits will not balance to zero and the futures strategy described above will not be able to replicate the payoff of the forward. We conclude that when the futures contract is a function of the interest rate ''the futures price will not be equal to the forward price''. 

Another exception occurs when the futures price can change by large amounts from one date to the next. The term &quot;large amounts&quot; here means that a one day move accounts for a large percentage of the difference between &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Phi_N &lt;/math&gt;. In this case on the date when this large price change occurs the error in the notional locked in at the forward rate is large enough to magnify the error in our estimate of the change in the mark-to-market. Furthermore, all subsequent mark-to-market changes are much smaller and cannot balance this cost/benefit. Fortunately, most exchanges limit the maximum change in the futures price that can occur from one date to the next. But if such large price moves are possible then, even if the futures price is not a function of the interest rate, the assumption that it is equal to the forward price is wrong.     

In general, the relation between the futures and the forward price cannot be derived through a static arbitarge strategy unless interest rates have a deterministic term-structure. The derivation of the relation between the futures and the forward price of an asset is one of the first applications of ''dynamic hedging'' [Black 1976].  


&lt;!--Futures are exchange traded contracts to deliver a volume or amount of product to a specific place on a specific date. For example, a natural gas future if taken to delivery, obligates the seller to deliver and the buyer to accept 10,000 MMBtu/day of Natural Gas at Henry Hub, Louisiana for the duration of a specific month.

All Futures contract has an expiration date, however contract could be transfer before expiration date thru futures exchanges to interesting party for a net lost or net gain. --&gt;

The main features of Future contract are:

* It is standardized contract made in terms of quantity, expiration date and settlement procedures etc.
* Transition in a future contract are fully transparant.
* It is traded in organized exchange and is &quot;marked to market&quot; daily.
* Physical delivery of underlying assets is virtually never taken.

==Swaps==
A Swap is an agreement to exchange a sequence of cash flows over a period of time in the future in same or different currencies. Mainly used for hedging various interest rate exposures, they are very popular and highly liquid instruments. Some of the very popular swap types are 

'''Fixed - Float''' ''(Same currency)''
Party P pays/receives fixed interest in currency A to receive/pay floating rate in currency A indexed to X on a notional N for a tenor T years. For example, you pay fixed 5.32% monthly to receive USD 1M Libor monthly on a notional USD 1 mio for 3 years. 
Fixed-Float swaps in same currency are used to convert a fixed/floating rate asset/liability to a floating/fixed rate asset/liability. For example, if a company has a fixed rate USD 10 mio loan at 5.3% paid monthly and a floating rate investment of USD 10 mio that returns USD 1M Libor +25 bps monthly, and wants to lockin the profit as they expect the USD 1M Libor to go down, then they may enter into a Fixed-Floating swap where the company pays floating USD 1M Libor+25 bps and receives 5.5% fixed rate, locking in 20bps profit.

 
'''Fixed - Float''' ''(Different currency)''
Party P pays/receives fixed interest in currency A to receive/pay floating rate in currency B indexed to X on a notional N at an initial exchange rate of FX for a tenor T years. For example, you pay fixed 5.32% on the USD notional 10 mio quarterly to receive JPY 3M Tibor monthly on a JPY notional 1.2 bio (at an initial exchange rate of USDJPY 120) for 3 years.
For Nondeleverable swaps, USD equivalent of JPY interest will be paid/received (as per the Fx rate on the FX fixing date for the interest payment day). Note in this case no initial Exchange of notional takes place unless the Fx fixing date and the swap start date fall in the future.
Fixed-Float swaps in different currency are used to convert a fixed/floating rate asset/liability in one currency to a floating/fixed rate asset/liability in a different currency. For example, if a company has a fixed rate USD 10 mio loan at 5.3% paid monthly and a floating rate investment of JPY 1.2 bio that returns JPY 1M Libor +50 bps monthly, and wants to lockin the profit in USD as they expect the JPY 1M Libor to go down or USDJPY to go up(JPY depreciate against USD), then they may enter into a Fixed-Floating swap in different currency where the company pays floating JPY 1M Libor+50 bps and receives 5.6% fixed rate, locking in 30bps profit against the interest rate and the fx exposure.


'''Float - Float''' ''(Same Currency, different index)''
Party P pays/receives floating interest in currency A Indexed to X to receive/pay floating rate in currency B indexed to Y on a notional N for a tenor T years. For example, you pay JPY 1M Libor monthly to receive JPY 1M Tibor monthly on a notional JPY 1 bio for 3 years.

In this case, company wants to lockin the cost from the spread widening or narrowing. For example, if a company has a floating rate loan at JPY 1M Libor and the company has an investment that returns JPY 1M Tibor+30 bps and currently the JPY 1M Tibor = JPY 1M Libor +10bps. At the moment, this company has a net profir of 40 bps. If the company thinks JPY 1M tibor is going to come down or JPY 1M Libor is going to increase in the future and wants to insulate from this risk, they can enter into a Float float swap in same currency where they pay JPY TIBOR +10 bps and receive JPY LIBOR+35 bps. with this, they have effectively locked in a 35 bps profit instead of running with a current 40 bps gain and index risk. The 5bps difference comes from the swap cost which includes the market expectations of the future rates in these two indices and the bid/offer spread which is the swap commission for the swap dealer.


'''Float - Float''' ''(Different Currency)''
Party P pays/receives floating interest in currency A Indexed to X to receive/pay floating rate in currency A indexed to Y on a notional N at an initial exchange rate of FX for a tenor T years. For example, you pay floating USD 1M libor on the USD notional 10 mio quarterly to receive JPY 3M Tibor monthly on a JPY notional 1.2 bio (at an initial exchange rate of USDJPY 120) for 4 years.

To explain the use of this type of swap, consider a US company operating in Japan. To fund their Japanese growth, they need JPY 10 bio. the easiest option for the company is to issue debt in Japan. As the company might be new in the Japanese market with out a well known reputation among the Japanese investors, this can be an expensive option. Added on top of this, the company might not have appropriate Debt issuance program in Japan and they might lack sophesticated treasury operation in Japan. To overcone the above problems, they can issue USD debt and convert to JPY in the FX market. Although this option solves the first problem, it introduces two new risks to the company. 
1. Fx risk. If this if this USDJPY spot goes up at the maturity of the debt, then when the company converts the JPY to USD to pay back its matured debt, it receives less USD and suffers a loss
2. USD and JPY interest rate risk. If the JPY rates come down, the return on the investment in Japan might go down and this introduces a interest rate risk component.

First exposure in the above can be hedged using long dated FX forward contracts but this introduces a new risk where the implied rate from the Fx Spot and the Fx Frward is a fixed rate but the JPY invest ment returns a floating rate. Although there are several alternatives to hedge both the exposures effectively with out introducing new risks, the easiest and the most cost effective alternative would be to use a Float-Float swap in different currencies. In this, the company raises USD by issuing USD Debt and swaps it to JPY. It receives USD floating rate(so matching the interest payments on the USD Debt) and pays JPY floating rate matching the returns on the JPY investment.


'''Fixed - Fixed''' ''(Different Currency)''
Party P pays/receives fixed interest in currency A to receive/pay fixed rate in currency B for a tenor T years. For example, you pay JPY 1.6% on a JPy notional of 1.2 bio and receive USD 5.36% on the USD equivalent notional of 10 mio at an initial exchange rate of USDJPY 120.

Usage is similar to above but you receive USD fixed rate and pay JPY Fixed rate.

Primarily used as hedging instruments, against varying interest payments.  The base concept is quite easy to follow; you swap a fixed rate for a floating rate or vice-versa.  In the case of companies that offer Variable Rate Bonds, they can enter into a swap agreement with a broker/dealer; where the company pays the broker a fixed rate as per agreement and the broker provides them with the floating rate, which can be used to make periodic coupon payments.  In essence, the company has hedged it's risk against a sudden rate increase, as it is locked in a fixed rate over time.  Swaps may be terminated with one party paying it's counterpart a certain fee, which may have been determined at time of initial agreement or may be based on future payments if interest rates were to remain constant.

==Options==
An option is a financial instrument that gives the holder to purchase or sale the stated number of shares at pre determined price(exercise price) within or on certain future date. It can be defined as a contract between two investors( i.e. call writer and option buyer).

There are two types of stock options:
*Call Option: Call option gives the buyer a right to purchase the given stock at the strike price. Thus Call option is generally bought when the buyer is bullish about the underlying security.The value of call option can be calculated by following equation:


&lt;big&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;= Max.(V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub-&gt;- E,0)&lt;/big&gt;

Where,

V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = value of call option

Max = Maximum 

0 = Zero

V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = Value of stock

E = Exercise price or strike price


''Profit or Loss''

Buyer = V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - Premium

Seller = Premium - V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;


''Break- Even point''

Buyer = Exercise Price + Premium Paid

Seller = Exercise Price + premium Received




*Put Option: Similarly buying a put option gives you the right to sell the underlying stock at the strike price. Put option is bought when the buyer has bearish views about the underlying security.The value of Put option can be calculated by following equation:


&lt;big&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;= Max(E - V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub-&gt;,0)&lt;/big&gt;


Where,

V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = value of Put option

Max = Maximum 

0 = Zero

V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = Value of stock

E = Exercise price or stike price


''Profit or Loss''

Buyer = V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - Premium

Seller = Premium - V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;


''Break- Even point''

Buyer = Exercise Price - Premium Paid

Seller = Exercise Price - premium Received



Each option comes with an &quot;Exercise Date&quot;.  
European options may ''only'' be exercised on the exercise date, whereas 
American options may be exercised at any time up till the exercise date.  

Due to the put-call parity, it is possible to create artificial call or put options if the other is not available.  Put options may also be used as a hedging instrument, against possible decline in value of the underlying stock.

While stocks with high volatility (modified duration) are high risk, options whose underlying stock have high volatility are actually better.  They provide a possibility of a higher payout if the stock goes up in proportion to its volatility and the same amount of loss.

==Options on Forwards==
In this case, the underlying asset on which the option is written is a forward contract. A market exists in which forward contracts are traded. We do not impose the martingale property on the s.d.e. for a forward price. Rather, given the current forward price $F(t,T)$, 

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dF(t,T)}{F(t,T)}=\mu dt + \sigma dW(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

In order to simplify the analysis we assume that &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; are positive constants. The mark-to-market of a forward contract with arbitrary strike &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is,

&lt;math&gt;
V(t,T)=B(t,T) [F(t,T)-K]
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B(t,T)=\exp[-r(T-t)] &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the risk-free rate. An option on a forward gives the buyer of the option the right to purchase a forward contract with strike &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; and expiry &lt;math&gt; T^* &lt;/math&gt; at some future date &lt;math&gt; T &lt; T^*&lt;/math&gt;. Lets price this option blindly the actuarial approach. This approach requires that the price of the option is given by taking the expectation of its payoff under the 'true' distribution of the forward price,

&lt;math&gt;
C(t,T)=B(t,T) \mathbf{E}_t \left\{B(T,T^*) [F(T,T^*)-K]^+ \right\}
&lt;/math&gt; 

where,

&lt;math&gt;
F(T,T^*)=F(t,T^*) \exp\left[ \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) (T-t) + \sigma \sqrt{T-t} U \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; is a standard normal random variable. The expectation has the following simple solution,

&lt;math&gt;
C(t,T^*)=B(t,T^*) [Fexp[\mu(T-t)]N(d_1) - K N(d2)]
&lt;/math&gt;

where,

&lt;math&gt;
d1=\frac{\ln\left(\frac{F}{K}\right)+\left(\mu+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)(T-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T-t}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; N(x)=Prob(U&gt;x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d_2=d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T-t} &lt;/math&gt;. In the same way the price of a put is given by,

&lt;math&gt;
P(t,T^*)=B(t,T^*) [-F\exp[\mu(T-t)]N(-d_1) + K N(-d2)]
&lt;/math&gt;

In the absence of arbitareg put-call parity requires the following equation to hold,

&lt;math&gt;
C(t,T^*)-P(t,T^*)=V(t,T^*)
&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to,

&lt;math&gt;
F\exp[\mu(T-t)]-K=F-K
&lt;/math&gt;

This is only possible if &lt;math&gt; \mu=0 &lt;/math&gt;. This transparent approach, first proposed by Emanuel Derman and Nassim Taleb [http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/qf-Illusions-dynamic.pdf], generates the arbitrage-free option price without the need for unrealistic assumptions about the viability of dynamic hedging. The only assumption we made was regarding the 'true' probability distribution function of the forward price. If we choose a more general approach, where &lt;math&gt; F(T,T^*) &lt;/math&gt; has an arbitrary probability distribution function, then the value of a call option is given by,

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{E}_t \left\{[F(T,T^*)-K]^+ \right\}=
\mathbf{E}_t \left\{F(T,T^*)\right\} \tilde{P}(F(T,T^*)&gt;K)-KP(F(T,T^*)&gt;K)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; P(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the 'true' probability distribution and &lt;math&gt; \tilde{P}(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is a probability distribution with the property,

&lt;math&gt;
d\tilde{P}(F(T,T^*))=\frac{F(T,T^*)}{\mathbf{E}_t \{ F(T,T^*) \}}dP(F(T,T^*))
&lt;/math&gt;

In the same way, the value of a put option is given by,

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{E}_t \left\{[K-F(T,T^*)]^+ \right\}=
-\mathbf{E}_t \left\{F(T,T^*)\right\} \tilde{P}(F(T,T^*)&lt;K)+KP(F(T,T^*)&lt;K)
&lt;/math&gt;

By put-call parity,

&lt;math&gt;
B(t,T^*) [\mathbf{E}_t \left\{F(T,T^*)\right\}-K]=B(t,T^*) [F(t,T)-K]
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{E}_t \left\{F(T,T^*)\right\}=F(t,T)
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. under an arbitrary 'true' distribution the option on the forward is priced by using the martingale property for the forward price.

==Options on the Product of Two Asset Prices==
The growth of the financial sector has resulted in products which are covered
under the broad term &quot;exotic derivatives&quot;. These derivatives are often written
on indices which are derived from traded prices but which themselves are not
traded. Depending on investor preferences an index can be a function of more
than one asset prices and can be determined from the value of these asset
prices from a single or a series of observations. Exotic derivatives can
either be priced using analytic methods or numerical techniques. The framework
used to price all exotic derivatives is based on the Black-Scholes option
pricing theory, in which dynamic hedging is used to obtain an arbitrage-free
equation for the option price. Although we can always obtain a p.d.e. for all
exotic derivatives, an analytic solution cannot always be obtained. However,
there exists a large range of exotics where an analytic solution is possible. An option on the product of two asset prices has an analytic solution. 

Given two traded assets, an index can be created where the value of the index
at some time &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is defined as,

&lt;math&gt;
S(t)=\frac{P_1(t)P_2(t)}{P_1(0)P_2(0)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; t=0 &lt;/math&gt; is the time at which the index is created and &lt;math&gt;
S(0)=1 &lt;/math&gt;. An option can be written on this index with payoff at expiry &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;
C(T)=\max [ S(T) - 1 ,0]
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the option is only a function of &lt;math&gt; P_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; P_2 
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, given the s.d.e.s for the prices of the two assets,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dP_1(t)}{P_1(t)}=m_1 dt + \sigma_1 dW_t^1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dP_2(t)}{P_2(t)}=m_2 dt + \sigma_2 dW_t^2
&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt; dW_t^1 dW_t^2 = \rho dt &lt;/math&gt;) Itô's lemma can be applied the
price of the option to give,

&lt;math&gt;
dC=\left[ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}
+ m_1 P_1(t)\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_1} 
+ m_2 P_2(t)\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_2}  
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_1^2 P_1(t)^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_1^2}
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_2^2 P_2(t)^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_2^2}
+ \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho P_1(t) P_2(t) \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial
P_1\partial P_2}\right] dt 
+ \sigma_1 \frac{\partial C}{\partial P_1} P_1(t) dW_t^1+ \sigma_2
\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_2}P_2(t) dW_t^2
&lt;/math&gt;

A portfolio consisting of $1 of the option, &lt;math&gt; -\partial C / \partial P_1
&lt;/math&gt; of asset 1 and &lt;math&gt; -\partial C / \partial P_2 &lt;/math&gt; of asset 2
must therefore have an s.d.e. given by,

&lt;math&gt;
d\left(  C -  \frac{\partial C}{\partial P_1} P_1(t) - \frac{\partial
C}{\partial P_2} P_2(t)\right)=\left[ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_1^2 P_1(t)^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_1^2}
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_2^2 P_2(t)^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_2^2}
+ \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho P_1(t) P_2(t) \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial
P_1\partial P_2}\right] dt 
&lt;/math&gt;

Since this portfolio has no sources of risk, in the absence of arbitrage it
must have an instantaneous return equal to the risk-free rate &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the last equation gives rise to the following p.d.e.:

&lt;math&gt;
rC= \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}
+ r P_1\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_1} 
+ r P_2\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_2}  
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_1^2 P_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_1^2}
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_2^2 P_2^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_2^2}
+ \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho P_1 P_2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial 
P_1\partial P_2}

&lt;/math&gt;

From the payoff function of this option we can deduce that the pricing equation can be transformed into a two-dimensional one with variables &lt;math&gt; t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P = P_1 P_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Note that,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_1}=P_2\frac{\partial C}{\partial P}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_2}=P_1\frac{\partial C}{\partial P}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_1^2}=P_2^2\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial 
P^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_2^2}=P_1^2\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial 
P^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P_1 \partial P_2}=P_1 P_2\frac{\partial^2
C}{\partial P^2}+\frac{\partial C}{\partial P}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the p.d.e. can be simplified to,

&lt;math&gt;
rC= \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}
+ m P\frac{\partial C}{\partial P} 
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 P^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial P^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where,

&lt;math&gt;
m=2r+\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho
&lt;/math&gt;

and,

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho}
&lt;/math&gt;

and boundary condition &lt;math&gt; C(T) = \max[P(T)/P(0) - 1 ] &lt;/math&gt;. This p.d.e.
is the Black-Scholes p.d.e. for a call option and can be solved to give,

&lt;math&gt;
C(0)= \exp[(m-r)T]N(h_1) - \exp[-rT]N(h_2)
&lt;/math&gt;

where,

&lt;math&gt;
h_1=\frac{\left(m + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \right)\sqrt{T}}{\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
h_2=\frac{\left(m - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \right)\sqrt{T}}{\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

The same result can be obtained by starting with the risk-neutral processes
for the two assets,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dP_1(t)}{P_1(t)}=r dt + \sigma_1 d \tilde{W}_t^1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dP_2(t)}{P_2(t)}=r dt + \sigma_2 d \tilde{W}_t^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Using Itô's lemma, the process for the product of the two prices is,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dP(t)}{P(t)}=m dt + \sigma d W_t
&lt;/math&gt;

and the pricing equation derived using the p.d.e. follows.

==Advanced Structures==
Theoretically, the price of an option (or option premium)consists of two elements: the Intrinsic value and time value of an option. Therefore, Premium=Intrinsic value+Time value.

The price of an option consists of five things: Strike Price, Price of the underlying asset, Time to maturity, Risk-Free interest rate and Volatility. Since the first four can be read from the markets, the only unknown factor in the price of the option is volatility.

==[[Financial Derivatives]]==

Hi - could you elaborate on your comment on this page.  I would like to be quite happy in my mind that there was no possible copyright violation?  An answer here will be fine or added to your comment on the talk page - thanks &amp; regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

The main issue is that the author does not seem to have an adequate grasp of Financial Derivatives theory and relies too much on passages from the classic textbook by J Hull. Therefore the issue is not copyright but whether the author has sufficient grasp of the theory to provide something better or original. Wikibooks can have as good a contribution to this subject as Prentice Hall!--[[User:Tedblack|Tedblack]] 10:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

== Happy new years ==

Hey Herby, happy new years. No problem on the redirects, I do stuff like that when I'm bored (which happens depressingly often, hahaha), though don't they have a bot on Wikipedia to fix them? Maybe we could pilfer the use of that next time. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 21:27, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

== Congradulations (or.... perhaps Run and Hide!) ==

You have just achieved the &quot;minimum&quot; number of votes necessary for having the &quot;Checkuser&quot; privilege granted to your account.  This is a very, very necessary tool for us to use here on Wikibooks, and don't get into the BS that some (*cough*) certain individuals have used that advocate a very minimalist use of chechuser rights.  This is something that I have fought long and hard to &quot;permit&quot; projects like Wikibooks to be able to have users with these user administration tools.

Mind you, I'm not advocating that you publish in a public place everything that you may see, but it isn't really as big of a deal as the Meta page would have you believe.  I strongly believe the standard for having checkuser rights is way too high, but that is an issue best left for other fora besides your talk page.

On the whole, congratulations.  It is &quot;possible&quot; that there may be some other objections, but a 26-1 vote in support for you is pretty good.  That you havn't made too many enemies over the time you have been editing here is also something remarkable as well, and that speaks volumes over your conduct here on Wikibooks.

If somebody else didn't beat me to it, I'll make sure your name goes up on Meta as an elegible account for the stewards to change the checkuser status in the next few days.  We aren't in a particular rush to get this to happen, but it is nice to see that we will have some more users with this authority.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:47, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== RE: Acoustics module ==

The link I took out went to the main page of the book. It had poor naming convention, and so when I fixed the naming convention the link to the main page of the book appeared. I also appreciate your understanding of my edit summary ways. I sometimes forget to do the summary. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 13:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== No Biggie :) ==

I had just put it together with the dispute stuff in the interests of having both good and bad stuff on that page. Do you have your ideas written down somewhere? I'm a bit stuck on where to go twith that part. 

The Dispute Resolution parts are also aimed to keep it simple... mediation when possible, and if mediation is ineffective, it automatically moves up to arbitration. Hopefully this won't need to be used often, which is another reason to have the other stuff linked from the same page (so that we don't only see that page pop up when it's dire circumstances). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:31, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

::I didn't mean to revert you... see my edit comment (so users are supposed to fight it out for a couple '''''months'''''?!?!?) :). I still think arbitration should go below mediation though, preferably at the bottom rather than the top, as I'd like the &quot;positive&quot; elements to take precedence. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:39, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== WMOG stuff ==

&quot;WMOG project&quot; is for meta pages (look in the category and you'll see what I mean). I'm going to move the template and stub categories in there too... just housecleaning.

If you come across subpages that aren't categorized, just put them into the main category ([[:Category:A Wikimanual of Gardening]]). Caught one yesterday that was a bad transwiki, there might be others like that as well. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

OMG!!!! Please stop! I spent hours and hours emptying that main category!!!!!!! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

I did answer you, look above :). Only '''uncategorized''' ones should go there... I've been sorting the others because the main category was too big (I don't like categories over 200 pages, probably stems from my previous life as a wikipedian). Those other categories are subcategories of the main one, so adding the main one is redundant (and looks messy on printouts). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:It took hours because I had to decide category names, substructure, etc. I also edit the pages a bit while I'm doing it... some of the really old stuff still talks about &quot;volumes&quot;, which are all gone now :). 
:The new pages I make are auto-catted when I templatize them. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:50, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

::Yeah, no alphas on many of them as it stands now, but I'm getting there. I'm updating the LMOS now, will let you know when I'm done. Prolly not much need for a bot though, since each page requires a separate decision (though you're more than welcome to add the alphas. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:55, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== Yes I use firefox ==

Hey Herby, yes I use firefox, though if you gave me a script I would have no idea what to do with it (I'm assuming .js is javascript?), if it's something that's easy to do and doesn't require admin priveleges I wouldn't mind taking a hack at it.

:: Hey Herby, haven't really messed around with too much yet. I use AdBlock because flash ads in particular are just damn annoying. Other than that, nothing really, what is NoScript? Maybe I'll look into it. Other than adblock my browser has what came installed with it, I don't like putting too much on it, after all it takes up a large percentage of my CPU as it is! I really messed around with my windows XP settings though because it drove me crazy with some of the stuff it was doing (especially the security center which I finally figured out how to block, I'll manage my own security thank you Microsoft).
:: Popups are pretty cool, is there a way to make it so it waits a little longer before it pops up? If not I'll just adjust to moving my mouse a little to the right after a split second, cuz it covers up the link. Sometimes I accidentally rest my mouse on a link when I'm reading something, and it blocks the view, thats kinda annoying but comes with the territory. I wouldn't want to use popups on wikipedia, it's not so bad here though! Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 21:34, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Hey, I installed Noscript, its pretty cool, doesn't seem too obtrusive, thanks for the heads up.

== BfR ==

Sounds good to me. Were you thinking of incorporating this into the RfC, or have it something separate? I guess I was thinking of the RfC as taking on some of the things currently on SL, which is generally dominated by policy debate and so gets hard to watch (well, hard to watch for other reasons too, I s'pose :P). There was talk many moons ago about possibly splitting SL like the wp VP, this is something a bit short of that. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:48, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== vfd ==

Were you refering to my closing of the &quot;Unsolved Archive&quot; vote or my actual vote for the Imamat page?  I closed &quot;Unsolved Archive&quot; as generally people wanted it deleting (although I voted to keep it).  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:43, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

Regarding the clutter on Staff Lounge.  I'd prefer not to see the creation of yet another page WB:RFC as this would just make the problem worse especially if it's known by its initials which just frightens off many people - we have too many vfds, rfas, rfcs and other strange pages with no central place linking to them all.

== Damn succession ==

Herby, I would ''really'' appreciate your comments on [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Resumed]] when you get up. I'm of for a while tomorrow and would love to finish this off before then. I'll be around on and off today (GMT). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

I'd like to '''strongly''' disagree with your closing of the VfD! The debate should revolve around how the page is now, not what it was then. Changes have been made (not since the hold -- which I don't think is a fruitful practice, by the way). There is only one voice for keep, but it should be the quality of the argument, not the number of voices that should matter. If Xanias objections are weak, then we should wait till they are addressed. If not, we should keep.

Johnny's and Whiteknight's comments were made before SH's changes. I do vote delete, but don't want it deleted as long as someone wants it in on Xanias grounds. Please change this back and wait till my questions to Kellen have been sufficiently countered.

My concerns here are for process. For the sake of the community, we should seek the widest consensus reasonable -- I don't think Xania's objections have been reasonably countered (and think snubbing him/her isn't conductive for harmony). The lesson here is patience and restraint, I believe.

I'm off in a few hours and since I have no attachments to this book, I won't make a case out of it -- but I urge you to reopen the debate to finish the discussion (if Xania wants the book, then the there is only one question: does the book ''currently'' violate policy -- I'd say no and therefore proposed the compromise). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:23, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikijunior Naming Convention ==
What we are using is &quot;Wikijunior %Book Title%&quot; with no slashes or colons. So I think the book is named in accordance with the others. The colon has a special meaning (I think it designates a separate name space?) so I had always assumed that was why all the books weren't named &quot;Wikijunior: %Book Title%&quot; (e.g. Wikijunior: South America) All things being equal, I'd support renaming everything with the Wikijunior: %Book Title% format. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:xixtas|xixtas]] ([[User talk:xixtas|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/xixtas|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

== Checkuser ==

I noticed your request while on Whiteknight's talk page. You need to go to [[meta:requests for permissions]] and request such a thing. However, CheckUser is done in pairs by how I see it so your voting buddy needs to be at 25 Support as well before it can happen. Since we already have two users that might not matter, but it can't hurt to wait I would think. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

Since you're awake at this hour (are you from America, or Europe?) and deleting stuff, I figured I'd tag some orphaned redirects for your deletion pleasure. I still wonder if there's a better way to see them, does the &quot;orphaned pages&quot; page usually include redirects? Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 10:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
:Sorry, one other random question; I can understand why we would want to delete orphaned fair use images (since they're not fair use if they're not being used), but why would we want to delete an orphaned PD image, if it's not doing any harm there?

:: Not sure about watchlists, but I clicked &quot;what links here&quot; and there was nothing at any of them. Maybe I should do a test to see if moving a page moves the watchlist link too or not.

::: OK after a real quick test I found that, indeed, the &quot;what links here&quot; does not include watchlist links. However this is not an issue because the new page is automatically added to peoples' watch lists when the page is moved, so any changes made will still be visible. Hope this helps.

== RFA Graphic ==

I personally don't find that to be much of a bite, and the user is by far no newbie to wiki projects since apparently he/she is a German Wikibooks administrator and has a large number of edits there. That graphic was obviously placed to stand out and had no purpose being there or being that large which I have to assume the user noticed due to their previous wiki experience yet still left which to me counts as being purposefully offensive. I'm also a bit confused why that user showed up here just to blast welcome messages across user pages. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

G'day mate. I took a look at the Cookbook: copyvios, and can't see why you would feel the need to seek a second opinion.

#Delete/archive all the old entries on [[WB:VIP]].
#Draft the new page (we need a name for it), [[Wikibooks:Get Help]], or [[Wikibooks:Help Request]] would be good candidates, or [[Wikibooks:Contact Staff]]. 
#Redirect the old WB:VIP and Administrator's noticeboard pages to the new page.
#Update the text in the deletion policy, and any other policy pages (including the welcome template) to point to the new page in lieu of the old pages
#Get all the admins to put the new page on their watchlists (possibly by including mention of it in the gazette).

It's always funny when I get one of those now. I average over 1000 edits per month at the English Wikipedia, so I really don't consider myself &quot;new&quot; anymore. I've also done a bit of editing here, too (enough to realize the differences).

Generally, I tend to pull the useful info into other places where it is a good fit, and then create a redirect. Of course, so far, I've mostly been editing mixed drinks and cocktails, and since &quot;Wikipedia is not a collection of recipes&quot; and nearly every article I edit contains a recipe, I've been dealing with a lot of deletion on those grounds. :-) I've mellowed a lot since I started, but it was really frustrating when I was starting out. --[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;#C71585&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;'''Willscrlt'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;font color=&quot;#4169E1&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Willscrlt|'''T'''alk]]&amp;middot;[[Special:Contributions/Willscrlt|'''C'''ntrb]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; 16:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

I hope you aren't too stressed out! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:I can certainly understand your sentiment about this, and I had no idea that the VfD issue was one that frustrated you so badly! On issues that I don't have a strong opinion about (such as this VfD issue), I tend to follow the lead of people who do have strong opinions. My reasoning here is that the people who care strongly are more likely to have thought about the issue in more depth then I ever would. My laissez-faire approach to such matters is perhaps not admirable, however.
:There have been mixed feelings about the [[cookbook]] for as long as I can remember, even long before it got it's own namespace. People claiming that it isn't a textbook, or that it violates all sorts of other policies. The creation of the namespace was supposed to aide in organization, but people have been grmbling ever since that it created an unnecessary rift in the community here. Unfortunately, I can't say I have a strong opinion on this issue either, as I have spent no time interacting with the cookbook at all. I do think it is probably too late now to make the cookbook an &quot;ordinary&quot; book.
:Policy matters are always very frustrating, there are certainly alot of people here who refuse to make progress. People who do want to make progress get frustrated and leave. I originally fought so hard for the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] proposal specifically because I didn't want the hard-working movers and shakers to be stymied by the critics and nay-sayers. However, that guideline just doesnt seem to be enough to overcome these problems. 
:On a personal note, I hope that you feel better about this, and that you find a way to enjoy wikibooks again in the way that it should be enjoyed. Nobody comes to this webpage because it's a requirement or a &quot;job&quot;, we are all here because we either believe in the mission, or because we find some enjoyment in it. It is my sincere hope that you can continue to find some small measure of happiness in it still. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Comment ==

[[User:Withinfocus]] has announced his decision to have Panic blocked at the end of the arbitration. He has given Panic about a 24 hour window to post and last rebuttals before the block takes effect. It is for this reason, i think, that panic's posts have become more petulant and less helpful. I do not fault him for this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:16, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

== Good to see you back ==

Hey Herby, its good to see you around now, we all really appreciate the work you've put into the project. I hope that for all of us, politics will not get in the way any longer of the goal of the project, which is (in my opinion) the collaborative production of content. I know you have the best interests of the project in mind, and we respect and appreciate that. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 03:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Puzzled ==

There must be a reason for your moving Sweet Rice, but I'm puzzled: A search on &quot;Sweet rice&quot; no longer locates the recipe. And that recipe is linked to the Amar's Tofu recipe.  Please help me understand the reason for the move and how folks will now find Sweet Rice. Thanks.  [[User:Frankatca|Frankatca]] 00:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

: *pop in* I'll pop in and answer this one. Frank, all the cookbook-related modules need to have the prefix &quot;Cookbook:,&quot; thus, the module on sweet rice should be at ''Cookbook:Sweet rice''. It is unfortunate that when users search, the cookbook is not also searched by default; that can be changed by an administrator, but I'm unsure how. I'm sure that next week when more administrators are online, someone will know how to fix the problem. Thanks for your interest in Wikibooks! *pop out* --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

:: Thanks, a bunch. I've now fixed the link to the sweet rice so it all works. I agree, that when in the Cookbook, adding a page to the cookbook should happen by default. I'm new to Wikibooks, but not the the main Wikipedia where I've been active for some time.  I'll be adding a bunch of recipes to the cookbook over time. thanks for the help.

== Learning kitesurfing - new book ==

Hi.  I just created a user account on Wikibooks and you left a message on my talk page.  I have been working on the Wikipedia article on kitesurfing, which was recently tagged to indicate some of the &quot;how to&quot; content should be shifted to a Wikibook.  Do you think this is a good idea?  Should I create a Wikibook called &quot;Learning kitesurfing&quot;?  [[User:Peter Campbell|Peter Campbell]] 10:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

== New Media Art ==

I consider this work as a typical example of Original Research. The book does not cite any sources and I doubt it could cite any. However, SBJohnny insists it is a legitimate wikibook. I don't have time to carefully read [[New Media Art/Introduction]], but for me the book does not fit here. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
: I'm not sure if threatening an user with block for adding pages incompliant with our policies is a good strategy. Please be more patient and do not bite the newcomers. Sometimes it's better just to repeat a request then to make a threat. If we aren't polite, new authors won't come here. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:52, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Why ==

It was a single instance, 2 hours is likely enough for the vandal to get bored and go on to other things. Anything longer would be pretty pretentious of me, that a vandalism of my user page warrants some kind of quick and decisive action. I didn't check if it was an open proxy or anything either, which I likely should have done. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:25, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

I value the work you have done here. Thanks for all the help you have given me. I look forward to seeing you around when you get back. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 03:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

== Redirect script ==

G'day mate, that script you told me about, that [[w:User:Dschwen/highlightredirects.js|highlights redirects]], has just been updated. It now works properly, and faster. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

==Request for oversight==
While there hasn't been as many people weighing in as I would have liked, I'd like to get things set up for working things out with Panic. I'm not biased either for or against him, I just want to get a permanent resolution to the issue so that it won't keep coming up over and over, and there's some concern that I might not be seen as entirely neutral by some. 

My approach will just be to try to get him to come up with a set of guidelines for himself to follow in order to avoid future conflicts (or at least defusing them before they get over the top). Would you be willing to oversee this process as a neutral party? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:Well, I doubt there will be unanimous support, but hopefully not too many more arrows will fly around. I'll post something in the Staff lounge about it, discussing the block as well. My hope is that the process will be quick and quiet, and that the end result will be satisfactory to everyone, including Panic. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:48, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

::OK, have done [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Proposition_2.0|here]].

:::Herby, are you requiring a second round of &quot;voting&quot; on the SL, or is &quot;no further objection&quot; sufficient? There was fairly solid support for going forward with just me on the case (even Xania, the one objector, made it clear that he was willing to give it a chance since there seems to be a lack of alternatives), so I doubt any further objections will come to light because of your involvement (quite the contrary!). I ask because I'd like to just move forward and get the process moving... both because I want it out of the way and because I want Panic to be unblocked as soon as possible (I had left him a note to this effect on his talk earlier: the time required is up to him, and if he commits to a positive resolution tomorrow, he should be unblocked tomorrow).
:::Also just a technical matter: since we're agreed about switching the block to indefinite, should you make that change, or should I? Likewise when it's time to unblock, though when that time comes I think we should just make sure each of us agrees (but you're the boss... if you decide to unblock before I think it's time, I will not argue (much), but please give me time to comment before acting on that). 
:::BTW, please make sure to add Panic's user talk to your watchlist. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Impartial ==

You and I have had discussions about the process and you've shared your opinion sometimes on the matter at various pages. You are much more impartial than most but I don't want your past, if anything, to affect the proceedings. Bringing in another person that could be accused of bias or some other garbage is what concerns me, so please do not be personally offended. This is not about you but about bringing in another person. My advice would be to &quot;OK it&quot; with the community, that bringing you in to be (yet another) overseer of sorts just to make sure you really have the community behind you. Making sure this process occurs without strong objection is what I'm concerned about. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
:I did indeed notice that you want consensus before proceeding and that's the correct step. Johnny responded in a bit of a &quot;I think we can just do it&quot; way that I wanted to stay away from. I'm sure you've got the right idea and I don't want to interfere or get involved with the process any more than I have, so good luck.

== Re. Your message on my talk page ==

This has nothing whatsoever to do with your involvement.  In fact I posted on someone's talk page (possibly SBJohnny's) only 2 days ago saying that you would be the perfect person to try to sort out this mess.  I realise that some of my comments have been hasty but I still think my unblocking was partially justified but for now I'm trying to stay out of it all.  Good luck.

There's more than enough info to go on... the &quot;topic&quot; of the spambot-generated stuff on wikipedia (from the IP) is ample evidence.

Thanks for the heads up. I won't be needing any further information on the topic I believe.

== Re: Your block ==

This guy has been vandalising Polish Wikimedia projects as well as English &amp; German Wikipedia for a long time. All his contributions in more than half a year were vandalisms (see [http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Specjalna:Rejestr&amp;type=block&amp;page=Wikipedysta:85.14.73.190 block log] on Polish Wikipedia). You can also take a look at results of [[meta:Requests for CheckUser information|my CheckUser request on Meta]]. This is Polish IP so I doubt its owner would make legitimate edits to English Wikibooks and there is a threat that he would vandalise here as well. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:31, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

# Yes, please.
# I blocked it for 2 years, Wikipedia says it's an open proxy. 
# Wikipedia has no mention of this IP being an open proxy, so IMO 2 years is just enough. Owner of this IP may change in this time. I don't like infinite blocks due to this reason, additionally WikiProject on open proxies on Meta also suggests a limited block for open proxies.
# In case of long-term vandalism, without normal edits, but also without evidence of the IP being open proxy, I suggest 3- or 6-month blocks. It's enough in most cases, but here I see a long history of blocks, so I suggest 1 year. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:09, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

= Nimzo-Indian Defence:Classical Variation =
The Classical Variation, 4.Qc2, aims to address two main problems posed by the Nimzo-Indian defence. On c2 the white queen protects the knight on c3, meaning that Black will no longer be able to double White's pawns by exchanging bishop for knight. At the same time, the queen hits the important e4 square.

A note on strategy and rules of thumb: Beginning chess players are often told not to move the queen too early in the opening. While as a general rule this advice is valuable, it is not sacrosanct. The Classical Nimzo provides an excellent opportunity to examine this rule, and its limitations, more closely. The admonition against early queen moves stems partly from the fact that the opposing player may be able to harass the queen simply by making useful developing moves. While one player is struggling to return his queen to safety, the second is gaining a decisive lead in development. In the Classical Variation, however, the queen's deployment to c2 is hardly a brazen sortie into enemy territory. It is unlikely that Black will be able to easily attack the queen anytime soon, so White's move is not considered risky. 

A second reason to delay the queen's development is that the queen does not work well without the assistance of the minor pieces, and it is not clear until the knights and bishops are deployed where the queen will be most useful. With 4.Qc2, it is true that White neglects to develop a kingside piece or even to open lines for development, but it is clear that the queen will perform a useful function on c2. The fight for the e4 square is always a significant theme in Nimzo-Indian games, and the queen contributes to this fight. She also bolsters White's position on the queenside by protecting the pawn structure, and at the same time she takes aim at Black's kingside. White should not have a problem deploying the queen from c2 to whatever theater of battle requires her services.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Wider Theory}}

The '''Curry-Howard isomorphism''' is a striking relationship connecting two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics &amp;mdash; type theory and structural logic.

== Introduction ==
The Curry-Howard isomorphism, hereafter referred to as simply C-H, tells us that in order to prove any mathematical theorem, all we have to do is construct a certain type which reflects the nature of that theorem, then find a value that has that type. This seems extremely weird at first: what do types have to do with theorems? However, as we shall see, the two are very closely related. A quick note before we begin: for these introductory paragraphs, we ignore the existence of expressions like &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; whose [[Haskell/Denotational semantics|denotational semantics]] are ⊥. These have an extremely important role, but we will consider them separately in due time. We also ignore functions that bypass the type system like &lt;code&gt;unsafeCoerce#&lt;/code&gt;.

We can build incredibly complicated types using Haskell's [[Haskell/Higher-order functions and Currying|higher-order functions]] feature. We might want to ask the question: given an arbitrary type, under what conditions does there exist a value with that type (we say the type is ''inhabited'')? A first guess might be 'all the time', but this quickly breaks down under examples. For example, there is no function with type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;, because we have no way of turning something of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; into something of a completely different type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; (unless we know in advance which types &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are, in which case we're talking about a monomorphic function, such as &lt;code&gt;ord :: Char -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;).

Incredibly, it turns out that a type is only inhabited when it corresponds to a true theorem in mathematical logic. But what is the nature of this correspondence? What does a type like &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; mean in the context of logic?

=== A crash course in formal logic ===
We need some background on formal logic before we can begin to explore its relationship to type theory. This is a ''very'' brief introduction; for a wider grounding we recommend you consult an introductory textbook on the subject matter.

In everyday language we use a lot of 'If... then...' sentences. For example, 'If the weather is nice today, then we'll walk into town'. These kinds of statements also crop up in mathematics; we can say things like 'If ''x'' is positive, then it has a (real) square root'. Formal logic is a way of translating these statements from loose, woolly, ambiguous English into precise symbolism. We use the → sign (read as 'implies') to indicate that something is true if something else is true. For example, our earlier statement could be recast as 'The weather is nice today → we'll walk into town', which means that it is true that we'll walk into town if it is true that the weather is nice, which is just the same as the 'If... then...' version we used earlier. We'll often use letters to stand for entire statements, so for example if ''W'' is the statement 'the weather is nice', and ''T'' is the statement 'we'll walk into town', then our example becomes simply ''W'' → ''T''. 

Notice the crafty way we phrased our definition of →. ''P'' → ''Q'' means that ''if'' ''P'' is true, ''then'' ''Q'' is true. But if ''Q'' is some statement that is always true, no matter what the circumstances &amp;mdash; like 'the sun is hot' &amp;mdash; then it doesn't matter what ''P'' is. ''P'' could even be a false statement, ''Q'' would still be true if ''P'' were true, so ''P'' → ''Q'' would still hold. The fact that ''Q'' would be true if ''P'' isn't true is a whole different matter; we're not asking that question when we say ''P'' → ''Q''. So → doesn't really represent any kind of cause-effect relationship; things like 'the sky is pink → the sun is hot' are still valid statements. &lt;ref&gt;Another way of looking at this is that we're trying to ''define'' our logical operator → such that it captures our intuition of the &quot;if... then&quot; construct in natural language. So we want statements like for all all naturals &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is even&quot; → &quot;&lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt; is odd&quot; to be true. I.e. that implication must hold when we substitute &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for any natural including, say, 5. But &quot;5 is even&quot; and &quot;6 is odd&quot; are both false, so we must have that False → False is true. Similarly by considering the statement for all naturals &lt;math&gt;x&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is prime&quot; → &quot;&lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt; is not prime&quot;, we must have that False → True is true. And obviously True → True must be true, and True → False is false. So we have that &lt;math&gt;x\to{}y&lt;/math&gt; unless &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is true and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; false.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other things that crop up lots in both everyday language and mathematics are things called conjunctions and disjunctions. The former represent statements involving an 'and', the latter statements involving an 'or'. We could represent the statement 'I will buy this magazine if it's in stock and I have enough money' by the symbolism &lt;math&gt;(M \wedge S) \to B&lt;/math&gt;, where ''M'' = 'I have enough money', ''S'' = 'The magazine is in stock', ''B'' = 'I will buy the magazine'. Essentially, one can just read the symbol &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; as 'and'. Similarly, one can read the symbol &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; as 'or', so that the statement 'I will either walk or get the train to work' could be represented as &lt;math&gt;W \vee T&lt;/math&gt;, where ''W'' = 'I will walk to work', and ''T'' = 'I will get the train to work'.

Using these symbols, and a few more which will be introduced as we go, we can produce arbitrarily complicated symbol strings. There are two classes of these symbol strings: those that represent true statements, often called the '''theorems'''; and those which represent false statements, called the '''nontheorems'''. Note that whether a symbol string is a theorem or nontheorem depends on what the letters stand for, so &lt;math&gt;P \vee Q&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem if, for example, ''P'' represents the statement 'It is daytime' and ''Q'' represents the statement 'It is night time' (ignoring exceptions like twilight), but it would be a nontheorem if ''P'' were 'Trees are blue' and ''Q'' were 'All birds can fly'. We'll often call a symbol string a '''proposition''' if we don't know whether it's a theorem or not.

There are ''many'' more subtleties to the subject of logic (including the fact that when we say 'If you eat your dinner you'll get dessert' we actually mean 'If and only if you eat your dinner will you get dessert'). If this is a subject that interests you, there are many textbooks around that comprehensively cover the subject.

=== Propositions are types ===
So, given a type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;, what does that mean in terms of symbolistic logic? Handily, it simply means that ''a'' → ''b''. Of course, this only makes sense if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are types which can further be interpreted in our symbolistic logic. This is the essence of C-H. Furthermore, as we mentioned before, ''a'' → ''b'' is a theorem if and only if &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; is an inhabited type.

Let's see this using one of the simplest of Haskell functions. &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. Translated into logic, we have that ''a'' → ''b'' → ''a''. This must be a theorem, as the type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; is inhabited by the value &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;. Now, another way of expressing ''a'' → ''b'' is that 'If we assume ''a'' is true, then ''b'' must be true.' So ''a'' → ''b'' → ''a'' means that if we assume ''a'' is true, then if we further assume that ''b'' is true, then we can conclude ''a''. This is of course a theorem; we assumed ''a'', so ''a'' is true under our assumptions.

=== The problem with ⊥ ===
We've mentioned that a type corresponds to a theorem if that type is inhabited. However, in Haskell, every type is inhabited by the value &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed, more generally, anything with type &lt;code&gt;forall a. a&lt;/code&gt;, a value with denotational semantics of ⊥, is a problem. ⊥ in type theory corresponds to inconsistency in logic; we can prove any theorem using Haskell types because every type is inhabited. Therefore, Haskell's type system actually corresponds to an inconsistent logic system. However, if we work with a limited subset of Haskell's type system, and in particular disallow polymorphic types, we have a consistent logic system we can do some cool stuff in. Hereafter it is assumed we are working in such a type system.

Now that we have the basics of C-H, we can begin to unpack a little more the relationship between types and propositions.

== Logical operations and their equivalents ==
The essence of symbolic logic is a set of propositions, such as ''P'' and ''Q'', and different ways of combining these propositions such as ''Q'' → ''P'' or &lt;math&gt;P \vee Q&lt;/math&gt;. These ways of combining propositions can be thought of as operations on propositions. By C-H, propositions correspond to types, so we should have that the C-H equivalents of these proposition combinators are type operations, more normally known as type constructors. We've already seen an example of this: the implication operator → in logic corresponds to the type constructor &lt;code&gt;(-&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. The rest of this section proceeds to explore the rest of the proposition combinators and explain their correspondence.

=== Conjunction and Disjunction===
In order for &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt; to be a theorem, both ''A'' and ''B'' must be theorems. So a proof for &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt; amounts to proving both ''A'' and ''B''. Remember that to prove a proposition ''A'' we find a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, where ''A'' and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; are C-H correspondents. So in this instance we wish to find a value that contains two sub-values: the first whose type corresponds to ''A'', and the second whose type corresponds to ''B''. This sounds remarkably like a pair. Indeed, we represent the symbol string &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;code&gt;(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to ''A'' and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to ''B''.

Disjunction is opposite to conjunction. In order for &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt; to be a theorem, either ''A'' or ''B'' must be a theorem. Again, we search for a value which contains either a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. This is &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Either A B&lt;/code&gt; is the type which corresponds to the proposition &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Falsity ===
It is occasionally useful to represent a false statement in our logic system. By definition, a false statement is one that can't be proven. So we're looking for a type which isn't inhabited. Although none of these types exist in the default libraries (don't get confused with the &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; type, which has precisely one value), we can define one, if we turn on the &lt;code&gt;-XEmptyDataDecls&lt;/code&gt; flag in GHC:

 data Void

The effect of omitting the constructors means that &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; is an uninhabited type. So the &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; type corresponds to a nontheorem in our logic. There are a few handy corollaries here:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(Void, A)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(A, Void)&lt;/code&gt; are both uninhabited types for any type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, corresponding to the fact that &lt;math&gt;F \wedge A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \wedge F&lt;/math&gt; are both nontheorems if ''F'' is a nontheorem.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Either Void A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Either A Void&lt;/code&gt; are essentially the same as &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; for any type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Technically, the types &lt;code&gt;Either Void A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; are isomorphic. Seeing as you can't have a value of type &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt;, every value in &lt;code&gt;Either Void A&lt;/code&gt; must be a &lt;code&gt;Right&lt;/code&gt;-tagged value, so the transformation just strips the &lt;code&gt;Right&lt;/code&gt; constructors.&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to the fact that &lt;math&gt;F \vee A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \vee F&lt;/math&gt;, where ''F'' is a nontheorem, are theorems only if ''A'' is a theorem.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Any type that corresponds to a nontheorem can be replaced with &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt;. This is because any nontheorem-type must be uninhabited, so replacing it with &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; everywhere doesn't change anything. &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; is really equivalent to any nontheorem type&lt;ref&gt;Again, the technical statement is that &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; is isomorphic to any type which is a nontheorem.&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we remarked in the first section, the implication ''P'' → ''Q'' is true if ''Q'' is true, regardless of the truth value of ''P''. So we should be able to find a term with type &lt;code&gt;Void -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. In fact one does exist, but it's somewhat complicated to explain: the answer is the ''empty function''. We can define a function &lt;code&gt;f :: A -&gt; B&lt;/code&gt; as a (probably infinite) set of pairs whose first element is an element of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; (the ''domain'') and second element is &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;'s output on this term, an element of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; (the ''range''). For example, the successor function on the naturals is represented as &lt;code&gt;{(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), ...}&lt;/code&gt;. Note that in order to be a (total and well-defined) function, we must have precisely one pair &lt;code&gt;(a, f a)&lt;/code&gt; for each term &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; with type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empty function, let's call it &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt; is represented in this way by the empty set. But as we must have a pair for each element of the domain, and there no pairs in our representation, the domain type must be empty, i.e. &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt;. What about the range type? &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt; never produces any output, so there are no restrictions placed on the range type. Thus, it is valid to assume that the range type has any type, so we can say &lt;code&gt;empty :: forall a. Void -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. Unfortunately, it's not possible to write this function in Haskell; we'd ideally like to write something like:&lt;/p&gt;

 empty :: Void -&gt; a

&lt;p&gt;And stop there, but this is illegal Haskell. The closest we can come is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

 empty :: Void -&gt; a
 empty _ = undefined

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively:&lt;/p&gt;

 empty :: Void -&gt; a
 empty = empty

&lt;p&gt;Another reasonable way (also disallowed in Haskell) would be to write:&lt;/p&gt;

 empty x = case x of { }

&lt;p&gt;The case statement is perfectly well formed since it handles every possible value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is perfectly safe, since the right-hand side of this function can never be reached (since we have nothing to pass it). So, the conclusion of all this is that &lt;code&gt;Void -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; is an inhabited type, just as ''P'' → ''Q'' is true if ''P'' is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Negation ===
The ¬ operation in logic turns theorems into nontheorems and vice versa: if ''A'' is a theorem then ''¬A'' is a nontheorem; if ''A'' is a nontheorem then ''¬A'' is a theorem. How can we represent this in Haskell? The answer's a sneaky one. We define a type synonym:

 type Not a = a -&gt; Void

So for a type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Not A&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;A -&gt; Void&lt;/code&gt;. How does this work? Well, if &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; was a theorem-type, then &lt;code&gt;A -&gt; Void&lt;/code&gt; must be uninhabited: there's no way any function could return any value, because the return type, &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; has no values (The function has to provide values for all inhabitants of A)! On the other hand, if &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; was a nontheorem, then &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; can be replaced with &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; as we explored in the last section. Then the function &lt;code&gt;id :: Void -&gt; Void&lt;/code&gt; is an inhabitant of &lt;code&gt;Not A&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;Not A&lt;/code&gt; is a theorem as required (The function doesn't have to provide any values, since there are no inhabitants in its domain. Nevertheless it's a function — with an empty graph).

== Axiomatic logic and the combinatory calculus ==
So far we've only used some very basic features from Haskell's type system. Indeed, most of the features of logic we've mentioned can be explored using a very basic 'programming language', the combinator calculus. To fully appreciate how closely C-H ties together these two areas of mathematics, we need to ''axiomatise'' both our discussion of formal logic and our discussion of programming languages.

=== Axiomatic logic ===
We start with two axioms about how the → operation should behave (from now on, we assume that → is a right-associative function, i.e. ''A'' → ''B'' → ''C'' means ''A'' → (''B'' → ''C'')):

# ''A'' → ''B'' → ''A''
# (''A'' → ''B'' → ''C'') → (''A'' → ''B'') → ''A'' → ''C''

The first axiom says that given any two propositions ''A'' and ''B'', if we assume both ''A'' and ''B'', we know that ''A'' is true. The second says that if ''A'' implies that ''B'' implies ''C'' (or equivalently, if ''C'' is true whenever ''A'' and ''B'' are true), and ''A'' itself implies ''B'', then knowing ''A'' is true would be enough to conclude that ''C'' is true. This may seem complicated, but a bit of thought reveals it to be common sense. Imagine we have a collection of boxes of various colours, some with wheels, some with lids, such that all the red boxes with wheels also have lids, and all the red boxes have wheels. Pick one box. Let ''A'' = 'The box under consideration is red', ''B'' = 'The box under consideration has wheels', ''C'' = 'The box under consideration has a lid'. Then the second law tells us that, as ''A'' → ''B'' → ''C'' (all red boxes with wheels also have lids), and ''A'' → ''B'' (all red boxes have wheels), then if ''A'' (if the box is red), then ''C'' must be true (the box has a lid). 

We also allow one ''inference law'', called ''modus ponens'':

# If ''A'' → ''B'', and ''A'', then ''B''.

This law allows us to create new theorems given old one. It should be fairly obvious; it is essentially the definition of what → means. This small basis provides a simple enough logic system which is expressive enough to cover most of our discussions. Here's a sample proof of the law ''A'' → ''A'' in our system:

Firstly, we know the two axioms to be theorems:
* ''A'' → ''B'' → ''A''
* (''A'' → ''B'' → ''C'') → (''A'' → ''B'') → ''A'' → ''C''
You'll notice that the left-hand side of the second axiom looks a bit like the first axiom. The second axiom guarantees that if we know that ''A'' → ''B'' → ''C'', then we can conclude (''A'' → ''B'') → ''A'' → ''C''. In this case, if we let ''C'' be the same proposition as ''A'', then we have that if ''A'' → ''B'' → ''A'', then (''A'' → ''B'') → ''A'' → ''A''. But we already know ''A'' → ''B'' → ''A'', that was the first axiom. Therefore, we have that (''A'' → ''B'') → ''A'' → ''A'' is a theorem. If we further let ''B'' be the proposition ''C'' → ''A'', for some other proposition ''C'', then we have that if ''A'' → ''C'' → ''A'', then ''A'' → ''A''. But, again, we know that ''A'' → ''C'' → ''A'' (it's the first axiom again), so ''A'' → ''A'', as we wanted.

This example demonstrates that given some simple axioms and a simple way to make new theorems from old, we can derive more complicated theorems. It may take a while to get there &amp;mdash; here we had several lines of reasoning to prove just that the obvious statement ''A'' → ''A'' is a theorem! &amp;mdash; but we get there in the end. This kind of formalisation is attractive because we have essentially defined a very simple system, and it is very easy to study how that system works.

=== Combinator calculus ===
The [[Haskell/Lambda calculus|lambda calculus]] is a way of defining a simple programming language from a very simple basis. If you haven't already read the chapter that was just linked to, we recommend you read at least the introductory sections on the untyped version of the calculus. Here's a refresher in case you're feeling dusty. A lambda term is one of three things:

* A ''value'', ''v''.
* A ''lambda abstraction'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda x. t&lt;/math&gt;, where ''t'' is another lambda term.
* An ''application'' &lt;math&gt;(t_1 t_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; are lambda terms.

There is one reduction law, too, called ''beta-reduction'':

* &lt;math&gt;((\lambda x. t_1) t_2)&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;t_1[x := t_2]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_1[x := t_2]&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; with all the free occurrences of ''x'' replaced with &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;.

As mentioned in the [[Haskell/Lambda calculus|lambda calculus]] article, the difficulty comes when trying to pin down the notion of a free occurrence of an identifier. The combinator calculus was invented by the American mathematician Haskell Curry (after whom a certain programming language is named) because of these difficulties. There are many variants on the basic combinator calculus, but we consider one of the simplest here. We start with two so-called '''combinators''':

* '''K''' takes two values and returns the first. In the lambda calculus, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \lambda xy.\ x&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''S''' takes a binary function, a unary function and a value, and applies that value and the value passed into the unary function to the binary function. again, in the lambda calculus: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \lambda xyz.\ xz(yz)&lt;/math&gt;.

The first function you should recognise as &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;. The second is more complicated, it is the monadic function &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;((-&gt;) e)&lt;/code&gt; monad (which is essentially Reader). These two combinators form a complete basis for the entire lambda calculus. Every lambda calculus program can be written using just these two functions.

== Sample proofs ==

== Intuitionistic vs classical logic ==

So far, all of the results we have proved are theorems of intuitionistic logic. Let's see what happens when we try to prove the basic theorem of classical logic, &lt;code&gt; Not Not A -&gt; A &lt;/code&gt;. Recall that this translates as &lt;code&gt; ((A -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) -&gt; A &lt;/code&gt;. So, given a function of type &lt;code&gt; (A -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void &lt;/code&gt; we need a function of type A. Now a function of type &lt;code&gt; (A -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void &lt;/code&gt; exists precisely if type &lt;code&gt; A -&gt; Void &lt;/code&gt; is uninhabited, or in other words if type A is inhabited. So we need a function which takes any inhabited type, and returns an element of that type. Although it is simple enough to do this on a computer - we need only find the &quot;simplest&quot; or &quot;first&quot; inhabitant of each type - there is no way to do this using standard lambda-calculus or combinator techniques. So we see that this result cannot be proved using these two techniques, and hence that the underlying logic is intuitionistic rather than classical.

Instead, consider a traditional error handling function which calls &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; when an error occurs, transferring computation to &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; function cancels any return value from the original function, so it has type &lt;code&gt;A -&gt; Void&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is the type of its arguments. The &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; function then takes the &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; function as its argument, and, if the &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; triggers (i.e. returns a &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt;) will return the argument of the &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; function. So the type of &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt; ((A -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) -&gt; A &lt;/code&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;This argument is taken from {{cite journal | author = Dan Piponi | title = Adventures in Classical Land | journal = The Monad Reader | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Employee Scheduling handles shift allocations for enterprises that have more than one shift per day or operate more than five days per week.  This involves defining what shifts have to be covered, the type and number of staff required, and the rules (min/max hours, seniority) for allocating employees to the shifts.  Employee Scheduling then produces schedules for a specified number of periods into the future.  Manufacturing and Employee Scheduling may interact.  Many low-end ERP packages do not have an Employee Scheduling module.

The main Internet security concerns are the computer crimes committed through either gaining unauthorized access (hacking, war driving, interception of communication) or through unauthorized use(using the computer for unauthorized activities). 

Some of the measures taken to protect against unauthorized access and use are the use of Access control systems: possessed knowledge access systems (passwords, PINs), possessed object access systems (smart cards, badges, magnetic cards), biometric access systems (using biological characteristics) and controlling access to wireless networks.

On top on these tools, some other measures can be taken to prevent illegal access to a computer such as using firewalls, encryption, VPN’s. 

Another type of crime is the computer sabotage using malware (viruses, worms, Trojan horses, mobile malware), denial of service attacks and Data/Program/site alterations. 
The best methods to protect against computer sabotage is by using security software. 

The third type of crime is online theft/fraud by which data, information and money are being stolen. The most common crime in this category is Identity theft often enabled by phishing and pharming. 
The best measures to protect against theft/fraud are to guard personal info, use credit cards for online purchases, avoid clicking on links in e-mail messages to update personal info. 


==Spam== 
Unsolicited e-mail that an individual does not want and doesn't have the time to read.  It is unavoidable because of online transactions.  Nowadays people are involved in many online activities which helps spam to get into an email address.  It is always in the form of bulk mail.  It can help virus to enter into the computer.  We should never open any unknown email in order to protect our computer from all threats.  There are different forms of spam such as web based spam and email based spam.  E-mail spam enters through email addresses and web based spam can enter in different ways like when we visit some web sites the message box pops up and ask to register for some online activities for free.  It is usually in the form of advertising or chain letters, junk mail, ads, and other un-wanted materials.

Spam filters are available for those who do not want to receive spam.  

It is important to reject or ignore spam by:

*delete immediately without opening it. (No peeking) 
*It is a bad idea to respond to the spam. (It could cause you VIRUSES or steal your money!)
*Opt out! (no means no.  Say no to spam)
*When in doubt always ask for help.  Ask your internet access provider. And get a spam filter (if you know what's good for you)
*Stop the Spam Bully Now! Fight back.  email www.abuse.net  No one needs to get sand (oops I mean spam) kicked in their face.

'''Software Piracy'''

Software piracy is the illegal reproduction or copying of a computer program, typically with the intent of redistributing or selling to other users.  In 2009 a report from the Business Software Alliance (BSA) stated that about 41% of all software in use on personal computers is installed illegally (Deborah Morley, Charles S. Parker. The Understanding Computers Today and Tomorrow 13th Editions. Boston: Course Technology, 2011. Page 603). Software Piracy includes DVD’s, CD’s and programs.  There are also several sites that use Torrent files that can be downloaded and share with other users. 

[[File:The Pirate Bay logo.svg|thumb|Pirate Bay is one of the most popular sites that is used for downloading illegally copied software.]]

'''Torrents'''  

A Torrent file isn’t actually a file itself but is a collection of locations where pieces of the file can be obtained.  This allows a user to download large files at an extremely fast rate by downloading several piece of the file from different sources.  One of the most popular sites that is located in Sweden is called Pirate Bay.  Pirate Bay provides millions of torrents that include operating systems, movies, books, music albums and all types of programs for free.  Pirate Bay is just one of several sites available to access Illegal software and they all reside in countries that do not have anti-piracy laws in place.  Although Majority of ISP providers do log and monitor this illegal activity there are several ways to avoid being caught using these sites to download Torrents (BitTorrent and µTorrent Software Surpass 150 Million User Milestone&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Narrowband==
Narrowband is also known as dial up modem.  It is low speed and inexpensive.  It uses telephone modems to connect computers to the Internet.  Telephone lines are widely available.  Therefore, many home computer users still use this type of Internet connection.

Narrowband is also known as voiceband and used for regular telephone communication, which includes speech, faxes and data.  Dial up modems use the same bandwidth that is used for telephone communications, which is 100 kilobits per second or less.  Bandwidth is used for short distances.

Because narrowband is somewhat slow, fewer people in the world are accessing the Internet using a narrowband connection.  Nielsen/Net Ratings' latest figures show that 77.4m people in the US used a dial-up connection from home in December.  This is down 10 per cent from the previous year.  By comparison, 33.6m - an annual increase of almost 60 per cent - used a broadband connection from home to access the Net.  Broadband connection is characterized by a bandwidth of very high speed. 

&quot;2002 marked an entire year of decline for narrowband usage at home,&quot; said Greg Bloom, senior Internet analyst, Nielsen//NetRatings.  &quot;As the broadband infrastructure continues to expand across the US, we expect to see the mainstream online population convert to higher speeds,&quot; he said.
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/16/narrowband_net_use_declines/

The research also found that broadband users do more online than their narrowband counterparts. Narrowband usage will likely continue to decrease in popularity as speed becomes more important when accessing the internet.

==Broadband==

=== Cable ===
Through the use of an underground coaxial cable, internet connection speeds vary between 12 and 30 Mbps, considerably faster than other broadband connections such as DSL.  Cable although, is only available where there is cable television providing previously dug underground coaxial cables. Despite it being averaged at about $40 to $60 per month, it is the most used broadband connection.

==ISP==

Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that provides Internet access, usually for a fee. This includes conventional and mobile telephone companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint this are just some. There are different classifications of ISPs. ISP servers are continually connected to a larger network, called a regional network.

==NAP==

===Introduction to Network Access Protection===
Network Access Protection (NAP) is a platform that allows to better protect network assets.NAP has an infrastructure and an API set for extending its functionality. Software developers can use the API(Application programming interface), which provides information and services to application programs and users can write their own programs for use with a specific product. ''taken from'' url: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/nap/default.mspx &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''Network Access Protection Platform Architecture'''''
*In other words NAP is a platform to perform computer health policy validation, ensure ongoing compliance with health policies, and does not allow unhealthy computers to access the system, or computers that do not comply with the policies. NAP has a client and a server architecture. ''taken from''url: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/nap/naparch.mspx
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''Internet Protocol Security Enforcement in the Network Access Protection Platform'''''
* Internet Protocol security (IPsec) is a system of rules and standards that protects the Internet traffic. IPsec support in the NAP platform protects the computers in a way that unhealthy computers that do not comply with the regulations can not send information to computers that are healthy and eliminates the possibility of viruses.

==Internet2==
'''The term &quot;Internet&quot; simply refers to a network of computers. The one that most of us use is Internet1, or the &quot;commodity Internet.&quot; ''' 

Internet2 or UCAID (University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development) is a non-profit  cooperative university/business education and research project that enables high-end users to quickly and reliably move huge amounts of data over high-speed networks, both nationally and internationally. Internet2 is a separate network from Internet1. Led by the research and education community since 1996, Internet2 adds &quot;toll lanes&quot; to the older Internet to speed things up.  The purpose is to advance videoconferencing, research, and academic collaborations-to enable a kind of &quot;virtual university.&quot; 

'''What makes Internet2 so different?'''

It has many fewer users and much faster connections. 
Internet2 moves data 100 to 1,000 times faster than the old-fashioned Internet. Internet2 is led by 207 universities [1] in the United States and partners from the networking (Cisco Systems), publishing (Prous Science) and technology industries (such as Comcast, Intel, Sun Microsystems). Some of the technologies it has developed include IPv6, IP multi-casting and quality of service. Internet2 is a registered trademark. Organizations that want to join up must demonstrate a research-related purpose, pay dues, and meet minimum technical requirements so they don't slow down the rest of the Internet2 empire. A typical university would pay about $200,000 a year. Internet2 is also a service engine for 60 companies and a handful of organizations and government agencies. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet2 and taken from page 62 in the text &quot;Using Information Technology&quot; Williams/Sawyer. 

Beyond just providing network capacity, Internet2 actively engages our community in the development of important new technology including middleware, security, network research and performance measurement capabilities which are critical to the progress of the Internet.
http://www.internet2.edu/about/

'''Will Internet2 ever be open to the public?''' 

Probably not. But the technologies developed in Internet2 will gradually be transferred to the original Internet, making it faster and more stable. The goal is to &quot;create the next-generation Internet,&quot; says network director Brian Buege of the University of Missouri-Rolla.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Internet security falls into categories of software that have been developed to ensure that we all enjoy ourselves on the internet.
There are three major areas of concern surrounding internet security: Authentication of the information (the information is authentic), authorization (the user has permission to use it), and confidentiality.
Confidentiality is a area of major concern because many people shop online, bank online etc. We need to know that our information will not be published to the masses when we enter a site. There is an institutes that has complied a database and training program for the internet called CERT.
The security is some times important since it can lead your life in danger, you may create a new email 
but for sure you cannot delete the information which is stolen.

Hacking is the process of breaking into a computer or network usually via the Internet.  In most cases people that hack information are aiming to steal data, ruin a computer system, or execute another illegal act.  Individuals and businesses may not be the only victims of hackers, but it is a threat to the national security of the United States.  Wireless networks are becoming easier to gain access to allowing cyber terrorists to access important information.

===Malware===
Malware is a type of software that intentionally or ‘maliciously’ damages a computer. It can perform its task in a matter of seconds that it was installed. In order for the malware to be installed is fairly easy; a simple action like a key stroke will do the trick. Malware can damage programs, slow the computer, erase files, and delete the whole hard drive and so on. The unfortunate thing about malware is that anyone can post the malware code on the web and no legal actions will take place. Also it is very time consuming to fix the malware. One specific type of malware is called spyware. &lt;ref&gt;Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow, Morley and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist}}


===Spyware===

Spyware is when a software program is installed without the user’s knowledge. This software program secretly gathers information about the user and takes it through his or her internet connection. This program is sometimes used for advertisers to gather information for marketing purposes. For example, what advertisements were selected on a page and how they should be formatted on that page to make it look more interesting. This software is not used for personal identification but can be a threat because people do not know that the software is on their computers. This kind of software is getting worse and harsher. Now stealthware is being used to deliberately change all of the settings and basically hijacking your settings. Criminals can get a hold of your personal information and can do various things with it. So spyware can be very bad for your computer slowing it down and everything making it an inconvenience for you.

====Access Controls Systems====

A way to protect against unauthorized access of a network or an individual web site is to have an Access Control System. The Access Control System works in two ways. One, it can be an identification system which means that it verifies that the person trying to access the site or network is on the authorized list of users. Second, the access control system can be an authentication system where it verifies that the person trying to access the network or web site is actually who they say they are.  A Possessed Knowledge Access System uses passwords and cognitive authorization. With this system an individual needs to provide personal information such as, city of birth to gain access to the site or network. Another access system is the possessed object access this system uses access cards to allow access. The Biometric Access system identifies users by a particular biological characteristic. Biometric systems include iris recognition, face recognition, fingerprint recognition and hand geometry.        

[[File: CryptoCard two factor.jpg|100px|thumb| CryptoCard two-factor authentication]]
To further increase security, you can combine methods to authenticate a user to create a two-factor authentication.  This method would include possessed knowledge along with a possessed object or a biometric feature, this makes it more difficult for hackers since they would have to gain access to both factors.  Two-factor authentication use is growing rapidly in the United States since a 2007 federal guideline went into effect that instructs financial institutions to start using this method in place of single-factor authentication systems.  Some banks are even offering an OTP (one-time password) access card to be used as the second step in your online authentication log-in process.  (Morley, Deborah, and Charles S. Parker. Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow. 13th ed. Boston: Course Technology/Cengage Learning, 2011. Print.)



&lt;B&gt;Computer Security&lt;B&gt; is &lt;u&gt;extremely important&lt;u&gt;! Passwords or pass codes help protect hackers from getting onto your computer and stealing any information that may be saved on the computer. There are two types of passwords. Biometric Characteristics is like using your finger prints in order to access the computer. The other one is just a simple password that locks your desktop until the correct pass code is entered. You can also purchase security software like firewall which will help protect against unauthorized people.

'''Information Privacy'''  
[[File:Firefox Delicacies.png|thumb|Clearing your internet cookies and history can help protect against the breach of your privacy.]]

Privacy is the state of being free from unauthorized intrusion, something that is a main concern when talking about computer security. The most important aspect of security in relation to computers is information privacy. Information privacy refers to the rights of individuals to control how information about them is collected and used. Individuals today are often concerned about the privacy of their web site activity and e-mail. Other privacy concerns are spam, electronic surveillance and electronic monitoring.</text>

==Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)==
[[File:Voip HowItWorks 0203v2.jpg|thumb|left|How VoIP Works]]
VoIP is the process of placing phone calls over the Internet.  One example of this is a computer to computer call via the “Skype” service, which allows you to connect and talk with someone from another computer.  Vonage is a VoIP provider which is a permanent setup designed to take the place of traditional landline phones.  One advantage of this type of service is that it is low cost.  The big disadvantage, is that it cannot function during a power outage, or if your Internet connection goes down.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

[[Image:ALU symbol.svg|right]]

Microprocessors tend to have a single module that performs arithmetic operations on integer values. This is because many of the different arithmetic and logical operations can be performed using similar (if not identical) hardware. The component that performs the arithmetic and logical operations is known as the '''Arithmetic Logic Unit''', or ALU. &lt;ref&gt;
CPU designers have used a variety of names for the arithmetic logic unit,
including &quot;ALU&quot;, &quot;integer execution unit&quot;, and &quot;E-box&quot;.
Paul V. Bolotoff.
[http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/cache_hierarchy.html &quot;Functional Principles of Cache Memory&quot;]
2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALU is one of the most important components in a microprocessor, and is typically the part of the processor that is designed first. Once the ALU is designed, the rest of the microprocessor is implemented to feed operands and control codes to the ALU.

== Tasks of an ALU ==

ALU units typically need to be able to perform the basic logical operations (AND, OR) and the addition operation. The inclusion of inverters on the inputs enables the same ALU hardware to perform the subtraction operation (adding an inverted operand), and the operations NAND and NOR. 

A basic ALU design involves a collection of &quot;ALU Slices&quot;, which each can perform the specified operation on a single bit. There is one ALU slice for every bit in the operand.

== ALU Slice ==

== Example: 2-Bit ALU ==

This is an example of a basic 2-bit ALU. The boxes on the right hand side of the image are multiplexers and are used to select between various operations: OR, AND, XOR, and addition.

[[Image:2-bit ALU.svg|center|500px]]

Notice that all the operations are performed in parallel, and the select signal (&quot;OP&quot;) is used to determine which result to pass on to the rest of the datapath. Notice that the carry signal, which is only used for addition, is generated and passed out of the ALU for every operation, so it is important that if we aren't performing addition that we ignore the carry flag.

== Example: 4-Bit ALU ==

Here is a circuit diagram of a 4 bit ALU.

[[Image:74181aluschematic.png|center|500px]]

== Additional Operations ==

Logic and addition are some of the easiest, but also the most common operations. For this reason, typical ALUs are designed to handle these operations specially, and other operations, such as multiplication and division, are handled in a separate module.

Notice also that the ALU units that we are discussing here are only for integer datatypes, not floating-point data. Luckily, once integer ALU and multiplier units have been designed, those units can be used to create floating-point units (FPU).

== ALU Configurations ==

Once an ALU is designed, we need to define how it interacts with the rest of the processor. We can choose any one of a number of different configurations, all with advantages and disadvantages.
Each category of instruction set architecture (ISA) -- stack, accumulator, register-memory, or register-register-load-store -- requires a different way of connecting the ALU.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tahar/coen6741/notes/Chapter2-4p.pdf &quot;Instruction Set Principles: Basic ISA Classes&quot;]
by Dr. Sofiène Tahar
&lt;/ref&gt;
In all images below, the orange represents memory structures internal to the CPU (registers), and the purple represents external memory (RAM).

=== Accumulator ===

[[Image:Isaccumulator.png|right]]

An accumulator machine has one special register, called the accumulator. The accumulator stores the result of every ALU operation, and is also one of the operands to every instruction. This means that our ISA can be less complicated, because instructions only need to specify one operand, instead of two operands and a destination. Accumulator architectures have simple ISAs and are typically very fast, but additional software needs to be written to load the accumulator with proper values.
Unfortunately, accumulator machines are difficult to pipeline.

One example of a type of computer system that is likely to use an accumulator is a common desk calculator. 

{{-}}

=== Register-to-Register ===

[[Image:Isreg2reg.png|left]]

One of the more common architectures is a Register-to-register architecture, also called a 3 register operand machine. In this configuration, the programmer can specify both source operands, and a destination register. Unfortunately, the ISA needs to be expanded to include fields for both source operands and the destination operands. This requires longer instruction word lengths, and it also requires additional effort (compared to the accumulator) to write results back to the register file after execution. This write-back step can cause synchronization issues in pipelined processors (we will discuss pipelining later).

{{-}}

=== Register Stack ===

[[Image:Is0addr.png|right]]

A register stack is like a combination of the Register-to-Register and the accumulator structures. In a register stack, the ALU reads the operands from the top of the stack, and the result is pushed onto the top of the stack. Complicated mathematical operations require decomposition into Reverse-Polish form, which can be difficult for programmers to use. However, many computer language compilers can produce reverse-polish notation easily because of the use of binary trees to represent instructions internally. Also, hardware needs to be created to implement the register stack, including PUSH and POP operations, in addition to hardware to detect and handle stack errors (pushing on a full stack, or popping an empty stack).

The benefit comes from a highly simplified ISA. These machines are called &quot;0-operand&quot; or &quot;zero address machines&quot; because operands don't need to be specified, because all operations act on specified stack locations.

In the diagram at right, &quot;SP&quot; is the pointer to the top of the stack. This is just one way to implement a stack structure, although it might be one of the easiest.

{{-}}

=== Register-and-Memory ===

[[Image:Isregmem.png|left]]

One complicated structure is a Register-and-Memory structure, like that shown at left. In this structure, one operand comes from a register file, and the other comes from external memory. In this structure, the ISA is complicated because each instruction word needs to be able to store a complete memory address, which can be very long. In practice, this scheme is not used directly, but is typically integrated into another scheme, such as a Register-to-Register scheme, for flexibility.

Some CISC architectures have the option of specifying one of the operands to an instruction as a memory address, although they are typically specified as a register address.
{{-}}

=== Complicated Structures ===

There are a number of other structures available, some of which are novel, and others are combinations of the types listed above. It is up to the designer to decide exactly how to structure the microprocessor, and feed data into the ALU.

=== Example: IA-32 ===

The Intel IA-32 ISA (x86 processors) use a register stack architecture for the floating point unit, but it uses a modified Register-to-Register structure for integer operations. All integer operations can specify a register as the first operand, and a register or memory location as the second operand. The first operand acts as an accumulator, so that the result is stored in the first operand register. The downside to this is that the instruction words are not uniform in length, which means that the instruction fetch and decode modules of the processor need to be very complex.

A typical IA-32 instruction is written as:

 ADD AX, BX

Where '''AX''' and '''BX''' are the names of the registers. The resulting equation produces '''AX''' = '''AX''' + '''BX''', so the result is stored back into '''AX'''.

=== Example: MIPS ===

MIPS uses a Register-to-Register structure. Each operation can specify two register operands, and a third destination register. The downside is that memory reads need to be made in separate operations, and the small format of the instruction words means that space is at a premium, and some tasks are difficult to perform.

An example of a MIPS instruction is:

 ADD R1, R2, R3

Where '''R1''', '''R2''' and '''R3''' are the names of registers. The resulting equation looks like: '''R1''' = '''R2''' + '''R3'''.

== Basic Components ==

There are a number of components in a common microprocessor that designers should be familiar with before attempting a design. For an overview of these components, see [[Digital Circuits]].

== Registers ==

A register is a storage element typically composed of an array of flip-flops. A 1-bit register can store 1 bit, and a 32-bit register can hold 32 bits, etc. Registers can be any length. 

A register has two inputs, a data input and a clock input. The clock input is typically called the &quot;enable&quot;. When the enable signal is high, the register stores the data input. When the clock signal is low, the register value stays the same.

=== Register File ===

A register file is a whole collection of registers, typically all of which are the same length. A register file takes three inputs, an index address value, a data value, and an enable signal. A signal '''decoder''' is used to pass the data value from the register file input to the particular register with the specified address.

== Multiplexers ==

[[Image:Multiplexer 2-to-1.svg|200px|right]]

A multiplexer is an input selector. A multiplexer has 1 output, a control input, and several data inputs. For ease, we number multiplexer inputs from zero, at the top. If the control signal is &quot;0&quot;, the 0th input is moved to the output. If the control signal is &quot;3&quot;, the 3rd input is moved to the output.

A multiplexer with ''N'' control signal bits can support ''2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;'' inputs. For example, a multiplexer with 3 control signals can support ''2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8'' inputs.

Multiplexers are typically abbreviated as &quot;MUX&quot;, and will be abbreviated as such throughout the rest of this book.

'''There can be decoders implemented in the components.'''
 Decoder ( inverse functionality of Encoder) can have multiple inputs and depending upon the inputs one of the output signals can go high.

For a 2 input decoder there will be 4 output signals. 
     
        /|- O0
  i0---| |- O1
  i1---| |- O2
        \|- O3

  suppose input i is having value 00  then output signal O0 will go high and remaining other threee lines O1 to O3 will be low.
   In same fashion if i is having value 2 then output O2 will be high and remaining other three lines will be low.

The '''Program Counter''' (PC) is a register structure that contains the address pointer value of the current instruction. Each cycle, the value at the pointer is read into the instruction decoder and the program counter is updated to point to the next instruction. For RISC computers updating the PC register is as simple as adding the machine word length (in bytes) to the PC. In a CISC machine, however, the length of the current instruction needs to be calculated, and that length value needs to be added to the PC.

== Updating the PC ==

The PC can be updated by making the enable signal high. Each instruction cycle the PC needs to be updated to point to the next instruction in memory. It is important to know how the memory is arranged before constructing your PC update circuit. 

Harvard-based systems tend to store one machine word per memory location. This means that every cycle the PC needs to be incremented by 1. Computers that share data and instruction memory together typically are ''byte addressable'', which is to say that each byte has its own address, as opposed to each machine word having its own address. In these situations, the PC needs to be incremented by the number of bytes in the machine word. 

[[Image:PC Simple.svg|center]]

In this image, the letter ''M'' is being used as the amount by which to update the PC each cycle. This might be a variable in the case of a CISC machine.

{{TextBox|1='''Example: MIPS'''

The MIPS architecture uses a byte-addressable instruction memory unit. MIPS is a RISC computer, and that means that all the instructions are the same length: 32-bits. Every cycle, therefore, the PC needs to be incremented by 4 (32 bits = 4 bytes).}}

{{TextBox|'''Example: Intel IA32'''

The Intel IA32 (better known by some as &quot;x86&quot;) is a CISC architecture, which means that each instruction can be a different length. The Intel memory is byte-addressable. Each cycle the instruction decoder needs to determine the length of the instruction, in bytes, and it needs to output that value to the PC. The PC unit increments itself by the value received from the instruction decoder.}}

== Branching ==

Branching occurs at one of a set of special instructions known collectively as &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;jump&quot; instructions. In a branch or a jump, control is moved to a different instruction at a different location in instruction memory. 

During a branch, a new address for the PC is loaded, typically from the instruction or from a register. This new value is loaded into the PC, and future instructions are loaded from that location.

=== Non-Offset Branching ===

A non-offset branch, frequently referred to as a &quot;jump&quot; is a branch where the previous PC value is discarded and a new PC value is loaded from an external source.

[[Image:PC Branch.svg|center]]

In this image, the PC value is either loaded with an updated version of itself, or else it is loaded with a new ''Branch Address''. For simplification we do not show the control signals to the MUX.

=== Offset Branching ===

An offset branch is a branch where a value is added (or subtracted) to the current PC value to produce the new value. This is typically used in systems where the PC value is larger then a register value or an immediate value, and it is not possible to load a complete value into the PC.  It is also commonly used to support relocatable binaries which may be loaded at an arbitrary base address.

[[Image:PC Offset Branch.svg|center]]

In this image there is a second ALU unit. Notice that we could simplify this circuit and remove the second ALU unit if we use the configuration below:

[[Image:PC Offset Branch 2.svg|center]]

These are just two possible configurations for this circuit.

=== Offset and Non-Offset Branching ===

Many systems have capabilities to use both offset and non-offset branching. Some systems may differentiate between the two as &quot;far jump&quot; and &quot;near jump&quot;, respectively, although this terminology is archaic.

The '''Instruction Decoder''' reads the next instruction in from memory, and sends the component pieces of that instruction to the necessary destinations.

== RISC Instruction Decoder ==

The RISC instruction decoder is typically a very simple device. Because RISC instruction words are a fixed length, the positions of the fields are fixed. We can decode an instruction, therefore, by simply separating the machine word into small parts using wire slices.

== CISC Instruction Decoder ==

Decoding a CISC instruction word is much more difficult than the RISC case, and the increased complexity of the decoder is a common reason that people cite when they choose to use RISC over CISC in their designs. 

A CISC decoder is typically set up as a state machine. The machine reads the opcode field to determine what type of instruction it is, and where the other data values are. The instruction word is read in piece by piece, and decisions are made at each stage as to how the remainder of the instruction word will be read.</text>

RISC units are typically faster and more efficient than CISC units. For this reason, many CISC processors have complicated instruction decoders that actually convert the CISC machine code into a RISC-like set of internal instructions known as '''microcodes'''. These microcodes are then fed into the internal core of the processor, which is based on the RISC design.

(reminiscent of the way instructions fetched from RAM are latched in the instruction register).
The clock signal determining the cycle time of the system primarily clocks the microinstruction register.
The bits stored in the microinstruction register directly control everything that goes on in the CPU.
(In some processors, the microinstruction register is the only thing connected to the clock signal.
Later we will discuss &quot;pipelining&quot;, a technique involving pipeline registers connected to the clock signal).

Some of the bits in the microinstruction register do nothing but drive some of the address bits of the control store.
Those bits -- that sub-field of the pipeline register -- is sometimes called the &quot;microprogram counter&quot;, even though it is merely a latch --  typically the control store is programmed such that those bits increment on every clock cycle, and reset to zero when a new instruction is loaded into the instruction register.
The instruction register directly drives some of the address lines of the control store ROM.
A few more address lines of the control store ROM are driven by status bits such as the Z flag and the C flag.

use &quot;writable microcode&quot; -- rather than storing the microcode in ROM or hard-wired logic, the microcode is stored in a RAM called a Writable Control Store or WCS.

      <comment>/* Floating Point Unit Design */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Similar to the ALU is the '''Floating-Point Unit''', or FPU. The FPU performs arithmetic operations on floating point numbers.

An FPU is complicated to design, although the IEEE 754 standard helps to answer some of the specific questions about implementation. It isn't always necessary to follow the IEEE standard when designing an FPU, but it certainly does help.

== Floating point numbers ==

This section is just going to serve as a brief refresher on floating point numbers. For more information, see the [[Floating Point]] book.

Floating point numbers are specified in two parts: the exponent (''e''), and the mantissa (''m''). The value of a floating point number, ''v'', is generally calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;v = m \times 2^e&lt;/math&gt;

=== IEEE 754 ===

IEEE 754 format numbers are calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;v = (1 + m) \times 2^e&lt;/math&gt;

The mantissa, ''m'', is &quot;normalized&quot; in this standard, so that it falls between the numbers 1.0 and 2.0.

[[Image:General floating point.svg|center]]

=== Floating Point Multiplication ===

Multiplying two floating point numbers is done as such:

:&lt;math&gt;v_1 \times v_2 = (m_1 \times m_2) \times 2^{(e_1 + e_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, division can be performed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{m_1}{m_2} \times 2^{(e_1 - e_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

To perform floating point multiplication then, we can follow these steps:

#Separate out the mantissa from the exponent
#Multiply (or divide) the mantissa parts together
#Add (or subtract) the exponents together
#Combine the two results into the new value
#Normalize the result value (optional).

=== Floating Point Addition === 

Floating point addition&amp;mdash;and by extension, subtraction&amp;mdash; is more difficult than multiplication. The only way that floating point numbers can be added together is if the exponents of both numbers are the same. This means that when we add two numbers together, we need first to scale the numbers so that they have the same exponent. Here is the algorithm:

#Separate the mantissa from the exponent of each number
#Compare the two exponents, and determine the difference between them.
#Add the difference to the smaller exponent, to make both exponents the same.
#Logically right-shift the mantissa of the number with the smaller exponent a number of spaces equal to the difference.
#Add the two mantissas together
#Normalize the result value (optional).

== Floating Point Unit Design ==

As we have seen from the two algorithms above, an FPU needs the following components:

;For addition/Subtraction:
*A comparator (subtractor) to determine the difference between exponents, and to determine the smaller of the two exponents.
*An adder unit to add that difference to the smaller exponent.
*A shift unit, to shift the mantissa the specified number of spaces.
*An adder to add the mantissas together

;For multiplication/division:
*A multiplier (or a divider) for the mantissa part
*An adder for the exponent prts. 

Both operation types require a complex control unit.

Both algorithms require some kind of addition/subtraction unit for the exponent part, so it seems likely that we can use just one component to perform both tasks (since both addition and multiplication won't be happening at the same time in the same unit). Because the exponent is typically a smaller field than the mantissa, we will call this the &quot;Small ALU&quot;. We also need an ALU and a multiplier unit to handle the operations on the mantissa. If we combine the two together, we can call this unit the &quot;Large ALU&quot;. We can also integrate the fast shifter for the mantissa into the large ALU.

Once we have an integer ALU designed, we can copy those components almost directly into our FPU design.

      <comment>/* Register File */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Registers are temporary storage locations inside the CPU that hold data and addresses.

The register file is the component that contains all the general purpose registers of the microprocessor.
A few CPUs also place special registers such as the PC and the status register in the register file.
Other CPUs keep them separate.

When designing a CPU, some people distinguish between &quot;architectural features&quot; and the &quot;implementation details&quot;.
The &quot;architectural features&quot; are the programmer visible parts; if someone makes a new system where any of these parts are different from the old CPU, then suddenly all the old software won't work on the new CPU.
The &quot;implementation details&quot; are the parts that, although we put even more time and effort into getting them to work, one can make a new system that has a different way of implementing them, and still keep software compatibility -- some programs may run a little faster, other programs may run a little slower, but they all produce the same results as on the earlier machine.


The programmer-visible register set has the biggest impact on software compatibility of any other part of the datapath, and perhaps of any other part in the entire computer.
The architectural features of the programmer-visible register set are the number of registers, the number of bits in each register, and the logical organization of the registers.
Assembly language programmers like to have many registers.
Early microprocessors had painfully few registers, limited by the area of the chip.
Today, many chips have room for huge numbers of registers, so the number of programmer-registers is limited by other constraints:
More programmer-visible registers requires bigger operand fields.
More programmer-visible registers requires more time saving and restoring registers on an interrupt or context switch.
Software compatibility requires keeping exactly the same number, size, and organization of programmer-visible registers.
Assembly language programmers like a &quot;flat&quot; address space, where the full address of any location in (virtual) memory fits in a single address register.
And so the amount of (virtual) memory desired by an architect sets a minimum width to each address register.

The idea of &quot;general registers&quot; -- a group of registers, any one of which can, at different times, operate as a stack pointer, index register, accumulator, program counter, etc. was invented around 1971.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;general registers&quot; were invented by C. Gordon Bell and Allen Newell as they were working on their book, ''Computer Structures: Readings and Examples'' (1971).

== Register File ==

A simple register file is a set of registers and a decoder. The register file requires an address and a data input.

[[Image:Register File Simple.svg|center]]

However, this simple register file isn't useful in a modern processor design, because there are some occasions when we don't want to write a new value to a register. Also, we typically want to read two values at once and write one value back in a single cycle. Consider the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C = A + B&lt;/math&gt;

To perform this operation, we want to read two values from the register file, ''A'' and ''B''. We also have one result that we want to write back to the register file when the operation has completed. For cases where we do not want to write any value to the register file, we add a control signal called ''Read/Write''. When the control signal is high, the data is written to a register, and when the control signal is low, no new values are written.

[[Image:Register File Medium.svg|center]]
[[Image:Register File Medium.svg|center]]
In this case, it is likely advantageous for us to specify a third address port for the write address:

[[Image:Register File Large.svg|center]]

== More registers than you can shake a stick at ==

Consider a situation where the machine word is very small, and therefore the available address space for registers is very limited. If we have a machine word that can only accommodate 2 bits of register address, we can only address 4 registers. However, register files are small to implement, so we have enough space for 32 registers.
There are several solutions to this dilemma -- several ways of increasing performance by using many registers, even though we don't quite have enough bits in the instruction word to directly address all of them.

Some of those solutions include:
* special-purpose registers that are always used for some specific instruction, and so that instruction doesn't need any bits to specify that register.
** In almost every CPU, the program counter PC and the status register are treated differently than the other registers, with their own special set of instructions.
* separating registers into two groups, &quot;address registers&quot; and &quot;data registers&quot;, so an instruction that uses an address needs enough bits to select one out of all the address registers, which is 1 less bit than one out of every register.
* register windowing as on SPARC
&lt;ref name=&quot;dumas&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
and
* using a &quot;register bank&quot;.

== Register Bank ==

Consider a situation where the machine word is very small, and therefore the available address space for registers is very limited. If we have a machine word that can only accommodate 2 bits of register address, we can only address 4 registers. However, register files are small to implement, so we have enough space for 32 registers. The solution to this dilemma is to utilize a '''register bank''' which consists of a series of register files combined together.

A '''register bank''' contains a number of register files or ''pages''. Only one page can be active at a time, and there are additional instructions added to the ISA to switch between the available register pages. Data values can only be written to and read from the currently active register page, but instructions can exist to move data from one page to another.

[[Image:Register Bank.svg|center]]

As can be seen in this image, the gray box represents the current page, and the page can be moved up and down on the register bank.

If the register bank has ''N'' registers, and a page can only show ''M'' registers (with ''N'' &amp;gt; ''M''), we can address registers with two values, ''n'' and ''m'' respectively. We can define these values as:

:&lt;math&gt;n = \log_2(N)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m = \log_2(M)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, ''n'' and ''m'' are the number of bits required to address ''N'' and ''M'' registers, respectively. We can break down the address into a single value as such:

[[Image:Register Bank Address.svg|center]]

Where ''p'' is the number of bits reserved to specify the current register page. As we can see from this graphic, the current register address is simply the concatenation of the page address and the register address.

Microprocessors rely on memory for storing the instructions and the data used by software programs. The memory unit is responsible for communicating with the system memory.

== Memory Unit ==

[[Image:Memory Unit.svg|center]]

== Actions of the Memory Unit ==

All von Neumann CPUs store their instructions in memory.

In a Harvard architecture, the data memory unit and the instruction memory unit are two different units. However, in a Princeton architecture the two memory units are combined into a single module. Most modern PC computer systems are Princeton, not Harvard, so the memory unit must handle all instruction and data transactions. This can serve as a bottleneck in the design.

== Timing Issues ==

The memory unit is typically one of the slowest components of a microcontroller, because the external interface with RAM is typically much slower than the speed of the processor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

The control unit reads the opcode and instruction bits from the machine code instruction, and creates a series of control codes to activate and operate the various components to perform the desired task.

== Simple Control Unit ==

In its most simple form, a control unit can take the form of a lookup table. The machine word opcode is used as the index into the table, and the various control signals are output to the respective destinations.

== Complex Control Unit ==

A more complex version of a control unit is implemented as a finite state machine (FSM). Multi-cycle, Pipelined, and other advanced processor designs may require an FSM-based control unit.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Laplacian and Laplace's Equation==

By now, you've most likely grown sick of the one dimensional transient diffusion PDE we've been playing with:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Make no mistake: we're not nearly done with this stupid thing; but for the sake of variety let's introduce a fresh new equation and, even though it's not strictly a separation of variables concept, a really cool quantity called the Laplacian. You'll like this chapter; it has many pretty pictures in it.

[[Image:PDEBook0012.jpg|frame|Graph of &lt;math&gt;u(x) = x^3 - x&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===The Laplacian===

The Laplacian is a linear operator in Euclidean n-space. There are other spaces with properties different from Euclidean space. Note also that operator here has a very specific meaning. As a function is sort of an operator on real numbers, our operator is an operator on functions, not on the real numbers. See [http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~muchomas/8.04/Lecs/lec_ave_oper/node5.html here] for a longer explanation.

We'll start with the 3D Cartesian &quot;version&quot;. Let &lt;math&gt;u = u(x, y, z, t)&lt;/math&gt;. The '''Laplacian''' of the function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is defined and notated as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = \Delta u = \operatorname{div} \ \operatorname{grad} \ u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

So the operator '''is''' taking the sum of the nonmixed second derivatives of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''Cartesian'' space variables &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;. The &quot;del squared&quot; notation is preferred since the capital delta can be confused with increments and differences, and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{div grad }u&lt;/math&gt; is too long and doesn't involve pretty math symbols. The Laplacian is also known as the Laplace operator or Laplace's operator, not to be confused with the Laplace transform. Also, note that if we had only taken the first partial derivatives of the function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and put them into a vector, that would have been the gradient of the function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. The Laplacian takes the second unmixed derivatives and adds them up.

In one dimension, recall that the second derivative measures concavity. Suppose &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;B&gt;if &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is concave up&lt;/B&gt;, and &lt;B&gt;if &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is concave down&lt;/B&gt;, see the graph below with the straight up or down arrows at various points of the curve. The Laplacian may be thought of as a generalization of the concavity concept to multivariate functions.

This idea is demonstrated at the right, in one dimension: &lt;math&gt;u(x) = x^3 - x&lt;/math&gt;. To the left of &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Laplacian (simply the second derivative here) is negative, and the graph is concave down. At &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the curve inflects and the Laplacian is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. To the right of &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Laplacian is positive and the graph is concave up.

Concavity may or may not do it for you. Thankfully, there's another very important view of the Laplacian, with deep implications for any equation it shows itself in: the Laplacian compares the value of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; at some point in space to the average of the values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in the neighborhood of the same point. The three cases are:

:*If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is greater at some point than the average of its neighbors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \nabla^2 u &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
:*If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is at some point equal to the average of its neighbors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \nabla^2 u = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
:*If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is smaller at some point than the average of its neighbors, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \nabla^2 u &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

So the laplacian may be thought of as, at some point &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0, z_0)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u \Big|_{x = x_0, y = y_0, Z = Z_0} \approx \mbox{average of u in the neighborhood of } (x_0, y_0, z_0) \ - \ u(x_0, y_0, z_0, t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:PDEBook0013.png|frame|The neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0, z_0)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The neighborhood of some point is defined as the open set that lies within some Euclidean distance δ (delta) from the point. Referring to the picture at right (a 3D example), the neighborhood of the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0, z_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the shaded region which satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;
(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 &lt; \delta^2 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that our one dimensional transient diffusion equation, our parallel plate flow, involves the Laplacian:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \alpha \nabla^2 u\,
&lt;/math&gt;

With this mentality, let's examine the behavior of this very important PDE. On the left is the time derivative and on the right is the Laplacian. This equation is saying that:

:'''The rate of change of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; at some point is proportional to the difference between the average value of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; around that point and the value of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; at that point.'''

For example, if there's at some position a &quot;hot spot&quot; where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is on average greater then its neighbors, the Laplacian will be negative and thus the time derivative will be negative, this will cause &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to decrease at that position, &quot;cooling&quot; it down. This is illustrated below. The arrows reflect upon the magnitude of the Laplacian and, by grace of the time derivative, the direction the curve will move.

[[Image:PDEBook0014.png|frame|center|Visualization of transient diffusion.]]

It's worth noting that in 3D, this equation fully describes the flow of heat in a homogeneous solid that's not generating it's own heat (like too much electricity through a narrow wire would).

===Laplace's Equation===

Laplace's equation describes a steady state condition, and this is what it looks like:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Solutions of this equation are called ''harmonic functions''. Some things to note:

:*Time is absent. This equation describes a steady state condition.
:*The absence of time implies the absence of an IC, so we'll be dealing with BVPs rather then IBVPs.
:*In one dimension, this is the ODE of a straight line passing through the boundaries at their specified values.
:*All functions that satisfy this equation in some domain are analytic (informally, an analytic function is equal to its Taylor expansion) in that domain.
:*Despite appearances, solutions of Laplace's equation are generally not minimal surfaces.
:*Laplace's equation is linear.

Laplace's equation is separable in the Cartesian (and almost any other) coordinate system. So, we shouldn't have too much problem solving it if the BCs involved aren't too convoluted.

===Laplace's Equation on a Square: Cartesian Coordinates===

[[Image:PDEBook0015.png|frame|Steady state conditions on a square.]]

Imagine a 1 x 1 square plate that's insulated top and bottom and has constant temperatures applied at its uninsulated edges, visualized to the right. Heat is flowing in and out of this thing steadily through the edges only, and since it's &quot;thin&quot; and &quot;insulated&quot;, the temperature may be given as &lt;math&gt;u(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. This is the first time we venture into two spatial coordinates, note the absence of time.

Let's make up a BVP, referring to the picture:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u(0, y) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(Edge D)}\\
u(1, y) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(Edge B)}\\
u(x, 0) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(Edge A)}\\
u(x, 1) = 1 \qquad \mbox{(Edge C)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So we have one nonhomogeneous BC. Assume that &lt;math&gt;u(x, y) = X(x) Y(y)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(X(x) Y(y)) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}(X(x) Y(y)) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
X''(x) = -k^2 X(x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Y''(y) = k^2 Y(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

As with before, calling the separation constant &lt;math&gt;k^2&lt;/math&gt; in favor of just &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (or something) happens to make the problem easier to solve. Note that the negative sign was kept for the &lt;math&gt;X(x)&lt;/math&gt; equation: again, these choices happen to make things simpler. Solving each equation and combining them back into &lt;math&gt;u(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
X(x) = C_1 \cos(k x) + C_2 \sin(k x)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Y(y) = C_3 e^{k y} + C_4 e^{-k y}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = X(x) Y(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = \left(C_1 \cos(k x) + C_2 \sin(k x)\right)\left(C_3 e^{k y} + C_4 e^{-k y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

At edge D:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, y) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(C_1 \cos(k \cdot 0) + C_2 \sin(k \cdot 0)\right)\left(C_3 e^{k y} + C_4 e^{-k y}\right) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
C_1 \left(C_3 e^{k y} + C_4 e^{-k y}\right) = 0 \Rightarrow C_1 = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = C_2 \sin(k x)\left(C_3 e^{k y} + C_4 e^{-k y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the constants can be merged, but we won't do it so that a point can be made in a moment. At edge A:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 0) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
C_2 \sin(k x)\left(C_3 e^{k \cdot 0} + C_4 e^{-k \cdot 0}\right) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; would satisfy this particular BC, however this would yield a plane solution of &lt;math&gt;u(x, y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which can't satisfy the temperature at edge C. This is why the constants weren't merged a few steps ago, to make it obvious that &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; may not be &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. So, we instead take &lt;math&gt;C_3 = -C_4&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy the above, and then combine the three constants into one, call it &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = C_2 \sin(k x)\left(C_3 e^{k y} + C_4 e^{-k y}\right) \qquad ; \ C_3 = -C_4\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = B \sin(k x)\left(e^{k y} - e^{-k y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Now look at edge B:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, y) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B \sin(k)\left(e^{k y} - e^{-k y}\right) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

It should go without saying by now that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; can't be zero, since this would yield &lt;math&gt;u(x, y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; which couldn't satisfy the nonzero BC. Instead, we can take &lt;math&gt;k = n \pi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = B \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi y} - e^{-n \pi y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

As of now, this solution will satisfy 3 of the 4 BCs. All that is left is edge C, the nonhomogeneous BC. 

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 1) = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi y} - e^{-n \pi y}\right) = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Neither &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be contorted to fit this BC.

Since Laplace's equation is linear, a linear combination of solutions to the PDE is also a solution to the PDE. Another thing to note: since the BCs (so far) are homogeneous, we can add the solutions without worrying about nonzero boundaries adding up.

Though &lt;math&gt;u(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; as shown above will not solve this problem, we can try summing (based on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) solutions to form a linear combination which might solve the BVP as a whole:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} u_n(x, y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_n(x, y) = B_n \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi y} - e^{-n \pi y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi y} - e^{-n \pi y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming this form is correct (review [[Partial Differential Equations/Parallel Plate Flow: Realistic IC| Parallel Plate Flow: Realistic IC]] for motivation), let's again try applying the last BC:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, 1) = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi \cdot 1} - e^{-n \pi \cdot 1}\right) = 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

It looks like it needs Fourier series methodology. Finding &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; via orthogonality should solve this problem:

:&lt;math&gt;
2 \sin(m \pi x) \cdot \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi} - e^{-n \pi}\right) =
2 \sin(m \pi x) \cdot 1\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \cdot 2 \sin(m \pi x) \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi} - e^{-n \pi}\right) = 2 \sin(m \pi x) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{0}^{1} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \cdot 2 \sin(m \pi x) \sin(n \pi x)
\left(e^{n \pi} - e^{-n \pi}\right) dx = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi x) dx\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \int_{0}^{1} 2 \sin(m \pi x) \sin(n \pi x) dx
\left(e^{n \pi} - e^{-n \pi}\right) = 2 \frac{1 - \cos(m \pi)}{m \pi}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:PDEBook0016.png|frame|25 term partial sum of the series solution.]]
:&lt;math&gt;
B_m \left(e^{m \pi} - e^{-m \pi}\right) = 2 \frac{1 - \cos(m \pi)}{m \pi}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B_n = 2 \frac{1 - (-1)^n}{n \pi \left(e^{n \pi} - e^{-n \pi}\right)}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; was changed to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the last step. Also, for integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos(n \pi) = (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that a Fourier sine expansion has been done. The solution to the BVP can finally be assembled:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi y} - e^{-n \pi y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2 \frac{1 - (-1)^n}{n \pi \left(e^{n \pi} - e^{-n \pi}\right)} \sin(n \pi x)\left(e^{n \pi y} - e^{-n \pi y}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

That solves it!

It's finally time to mention that the BCs are discontinuous at the points &lt;math&gt;(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the series should converge slowly at those points. This is clear from the plot at right: it's a 25 term partial sum (note that half of the terms are &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), and it looks perfect except at &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;, especially near the discontinuities at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Laplace's Equation on a Circle: Polar Coordinates===

Now, we'll specify the value of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; on a circular boundary. A circle can be represented in Cartesian coordinates without too much trouble; however, it would result in nonlinear BCs which would render the approach useless. Instead, polar coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; should be used, since in such a system the equation of a circle is very simple. In order for this to be realized, a polar representation of the Laplacian is necessary. Without going in to the details just yet, the Laplacian is given in (2D) polar coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This result may be derived using differentials and the chain rule; it's not difficult but it's a little long. In these coordinates Laplace's equation reads:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in going from Cartesian to polar coordinates, a price was paid: though still linear, Laplace's equation now has ''variable coefficients''. This implies that after separation at least one of the ODEs will have variable coefficients as well.

Let's make up the following BVP, letting '''&lt;math&gt;u = u(r, \theta)&lt;/math&gt;''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, \theta) = \phi(\theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) \ \mbox{is bounded inside the unit circle.}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This could represent a physical problem analogous to the previous one: replace the square plate with a disc. Note the apparent absence of sufficient BC to obtain a unique solution. The funny looking statement that u is bounded inside the domain of interest turns out to be the key to getting a unique solution, and it often shows itself in polar coordinates. It &quot;makes up&quot; for the &quot;lack&quot; of BCs. To separate, we as usual incorrectly assume that &lt;math&gt;u(r, \theta) = R(r) \Theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}(R(r)\Theta(\theta)) + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}(R(r)\Theta(\theta)) + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}(R(r)\Theta(\theta)) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
R''(r)\Theta(\theta) + \frac{1}{r} R'(r)\Theta(\theta) + \frac{1}{r^2} R(r)\Theta''(\theta) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) + R(r) \frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{\Theta(\theta)} = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{\Theta(\theta)} = \frac{r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r)}{R(r)} = k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) - k^2 R(r) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Theta''(\theta) + k^2 \Theta(\theta) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, the way the negative sign and the separation constant are arranged makes the solution easier later on. These decisions are made mostly by trial and error.

The &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; equation is probably one you've never seen before, it's a ''special case'' of the '''Euler differential equation''' (not to be confused with the Euler-Lagrange differential equation). There are a couple of ways to solve it, the most general method would be to change the variables so that an equation with constant coefficients is obtained. An easier way would be to note the pattern in the order of the coefficients and the order of the derivatives, and from there guess a power solution. Either way, the general solution to this simple case of Euler's ODE is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
R(r) = C_1 r^k + C_2 r^{-k}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This is a very good example problem since it goes to show that PDE problems very often turn into obscure ODE problems; we got lucky this time since the solution for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; was rather simple though its ODE looked pretty bad at first sight. The solution to the &lt;math&gt;\Theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Theta(\theta) = C_3 \cos(k \theta) + C_4 \sin(k \theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = \left(C_1 r^k + C_2 r^{-k}\right)(C_3 \cos(k \theta) + C_4 \sin(k \theta))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, this is where the English sentence condition stating that u must be bounded in the domain of interest may be invoked. As &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r  \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, the term involving &lt;math&gt;r^{-k}&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded. The '''only''' way to fix this is to take &lt;math&gt;C_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if this problem were solved between two concentric circles, this term would be nonzero and very important. With that term gone, constants can be merged:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = r^k (A \cos(k \theta) + B \sin(k \theta))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Only one condition remains: &lt;math&gt;u = \phi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt;, yet there are 3 constants. Let's say for now that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(\theta) = 2 \cos(4 \theta) + 3 \sin(4 \theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, it's a simple matter of equating coefficients to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = r^4 (2 \cos(4 \theta) + 3 \sin(4 \theta))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let's make the frequencies differ:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(\theta) = 4 \cos(3 \theta) + \sin(10 \theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Equating coefficients won't work. However, if the IC were broken up into individual terms, the sum of the solution to the terms just happens to solve the BVP as a whole:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi_3(\theta) = 4 \cos(3 \theta) \quad , \quad \phi_{10}(\theta) = \sin(10 \theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u_3(r, \theta) = r^3 4 \cos(3 \theta) \quad , \quad u_{10}(r, \theta) = r^{10} \sin(10 \theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = u_3(r, \theta) + u_{10}(r, \theta) = r^3 4 \cos(3 \pi \theta) + r^{10} \sin(10 \theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Verify that the solution above is really equal to the BC at &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, \theta) = 1^3 4 \cos(3 \theta) + 1^{10} \sin(10 \theta)) = 4 \cos(3 \theta) + \sin(10 \theta) = \phi(\theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

And, since Laplace's equation is linear, this must solve the PDE as well. What all of this implies is that, if some generic function &lt;math&gt;\phi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed as a sum of sinusoids with angular frequencies given by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, all that is needed is a linear combination of the appropriate sum. Notated:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} r^{n} (A_n \cos(n \theta) + B_n \sin(n \theta))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

To identify the coefficients, substitute the BC:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, \theta) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} 1^{n} (A_n \cos(n \theta) + B_n \sin(n \theta))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(\theta) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} (A_n \cos(n \theta) + B_n \sin(n  \theta))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; may be determined by a (full) Fourier expansion on &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Note that it's implied that &lt;math&gt;\phi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; ''must'' have period &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt; since we are solving this in a domain (a circle specifically) where &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

You probably don't like infinite series solutions. Well, it happens that through a variety of manipulations it's possible to express the full solution of this particular problem as:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \phi(\psi) \frac{1 - r^2}{1 - 2 r \cos(\theta - \psi) + r^2}\ d\psi\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This is called Poisson's integral formula.

===Derivation of the Laplacian in Polar Coordinates===

Though not necessarily a PDEs concept, it is very important for anyone studying this kind of math to be comfortable with going from one coordinate system to the next. What follows is a long derivation of the Laplacian in 2D polar coordinates using the multivariable chain rule and the concept of differentials. Know, however, that there are really many ways to do this.

Three definitions are all we need to begin:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
x = r \cos(\theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = r \sin(\theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

If it's known that &lt;math&gt;u = u(r, \theta) = u(r(x, y), \theta(x, y))&lt;/math&gt;, then the chain rule may be used to express derivatives in terms of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; alone. Two applications will be necessary to obtain the second derivatives. Manipulating operators as if they meant something on their own:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} 
= \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying this to itself, treating the underlined bit as a unit dependent on &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right) = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(
\underline{
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
}\right)
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(
\underline{\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}}
\right)\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}
+
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(
\underline{\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}}
\right)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} =
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial^2 r}{\partial r \partial x} + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial r \partial x}
\right)\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}
+
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial^2 r}{\partial \theta \partial x} + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial \theta \partial x}
\right)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

The above mess may be quickly simplified a little by manipulating the funny looking derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 r}{\partial r \partial x} = 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial r}(r) = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r)\right) = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(1) = 0
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial \theta \partial x} = 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial \theta}(\theta) = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(\theta)\right) = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(1) = 0
\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} =
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial r \partial x}
\right)\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}
+
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial^2 r}{\partial \theta \partial x} + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\right)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

This may be made slightly easier to work with if a few changes are made to the way some of the derivatives are written. Also, the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; variable follows analogously:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} =
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}\right)
\right)\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}
+
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}\right) + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\right)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} =
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y}\right)
\right)\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}
+
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}\right) + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y}
\right)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now we need to obtain expressions for some of the derivatives appearing above. The most direct path would use the concept of differentials. If:

:&lt;math&gt;
x = r \cos(\theta) \quad , \quad y = r \sin(\theta)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then:

:&lt;math&gt;
dx = dr \cos(\theta) - r \sin(\theta) d\theta \quad , \quad dy = dr \sin(\theta) + r \cos(\theta) d\theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving by substitution for &lt;math&gt;dr&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d \theta&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
dr = \cos(\theta) dx + \sin(\theta) dy \quad , 
\quad d\theta = -\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r} dx + \frac{\cos(\theta)}{r} dy
\,&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;z = z(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''total differential''' is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}dy
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the two previous equations are of this form (recall that &lt;math&gt;r = r(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = \theta(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, just like &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; above), which means that:

:&lt;math&gt;
dr = \frac{\partial r}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial r}{\partial y}dy \quad , 
\quad d\theta = \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y}dy
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Equating coefficients quickly yields a bunch of derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} = \cos(\theta) \quad , \quad
\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} = \sin(\theta) \quad , \quad
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} = -\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r} \quad , \quad
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{r}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

There's an easier but more abstract way to obtain the derivatives above that may be overkill but is worth mentioning anyway. The Jacobian of the functions &lt;math&gt;x(r, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y(r, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (r, \theta)} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cfrac{\partial x}{\partial r} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \\
\cfrac{\partial y}{\partial r} &amp; \cfrac{\partial y}{\partial \theta} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; -r \sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) &amp; r \cos(\theta) \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the Jacobian is a compact representation of the coefficients of the total derivative; using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{z}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; as an example (bold indicating vectors):

:&lt;math&gt;
d\mathbf{z} = \frac{\partial (z_1, z_2, ... \ , z_n)}{\partial (x_1, x_2, ... \ , x_n)} \cdot d\mathbf{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

So, it follows then that the derivatives that we're interested in may be obtained by inverting the Jacobian matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial (r, \theta)}{\partial (x, y)} = \left(\frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (r, \theta)}\right)^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\cfrac{\partial r}{\partial x} &amp; \cfrac{\partial r}{\partial y} \\
\cfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} &amp; \cfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cfrac{\partial x}{\partial r} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \\
\cfrac{\partial y}{\partial r} &amp; \cfrac{\partial y}{\partial \theta} \\
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\cfrac{\partial r}{\partial x} &amp; \cfrac{\partial r}{\partial y} \\
\cfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} &amp; \cfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} \\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; -r \sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) &amp; r \cos(\theta) \\
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\cfrac{\partial r}{\partial x} &amp; \cfrac{\partial r}{\partial y} \\
\cfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} &amp; \cfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \\
-\cfrac{\sin(\theta)}{r} &amp; \cfrac{\cos(\theta)}{r} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Though somewhat obscure, this is very convenient and it's just one of the many utilities of the Jacobian matrix. An interesting bit of insight is gained: coordinate changes are senseless unless the Jacobian is invertible everywhere except at isolated points, stated another way the determinant of the Jacobian matrix must be nonzero, otherwise the coordinate change is not one-to-one (note that the determinant will be zero at &lt;math&gt;r = 0&lt;/math&gt; in this example. An isolated point such as this is not problematic.).

Either path you take, there should now be enough information to evaluate the Cartesian second derivatives. Working on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} =
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\cos(\theta) - 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta}\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r} - 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r}\right)
\right)\cos(\theta)
-
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r}\cos(\theta) + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\cos(\theta)\right) - 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r}
\right)\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} =
\cos(\theta)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} - 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} - 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} =
\cos(\theta)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} - 
\frac{2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Proceeding similarly for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} =
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\sin(\theta) + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta}\frac{\cos(\theta)}{r} + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{\cos(\theta)}{r}\right)
\right)\sin(\theta)
+
\left( 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r}\sin(\theta) + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin(\theta)\right) + 
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\frac{\cos(\theta)}{r}
\right)\frac{\cos(\theta)}{r}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} =
\sin(\theta)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} - 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta \partial r} + 
\frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} =
\sin(\theta)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + 
\frac{2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} - 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + 
\frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, add these tirelessly hand crafted differential operators and watch the result collapse into just 3 nontrigonometric terms:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 = 
\cos(\theta)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} - 
\frac{2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
 + 
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad
\sin(\theta)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + 
\frac{2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} - 
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + 
\frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 = 
(\sin(\theta)^2 + \cos(\theta)^2)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + 
\left(-\frac{2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r} + \frac{2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r}\right)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r \partial \theta} + \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2} - \frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r^2}\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + 
\left(\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r} + \frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r}\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + 
\left(\frac{\sin(\theta)^2}{r^2} + \frac{\cos(\theta)^2}{r^2}\right)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

That was a lot of work. To save trouble, here is the Laplacian in other two other popular coordinate systems:

'''Cylindrical''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Spherical''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) + 
\frac{1}{r^2 \sin(\theta)}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin(\theta) \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta}\right) + 
\frac{1}{r^2 \sin(\theta)^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \phi^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Derivatives have been combined wherever possible (not done previously).

===Concluding Remarks===

This was a long, involved chapter. It should be clear that the solutions derived work only for very simple geometries, other geometries may be worked with by grace of '''conformal mappings'''.

The Laplacian (and variations of it) is a very important quantity and its behaviour is worth knowing like the back of your hand. A sampling of important equations that involve the Laplacian:

:*The Navier Stokes equations.
:*The diffusion equation.
:*Laplace's equation.
:*Poisson's equation.
:*The Helmholtz equation.
:*The Schrödinger equation.
:*The wave equation.

There's a couple of other operators that are similar to (though less important than) the Laplacian, which deserve mention:

* '''Biharmonic operator''', in three Cartesian dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^4 = \frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial x^4} + \frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial y^4} + \frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial z^4} + 2\frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial x^2 \partial y^2} + 2\frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial y^2 \partial z^2} + 2\frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial x^2 \partial z^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

The biharmonic equation is useful in linear elastic theory, for example it can describe &quot;creeping&quot; fluid flow:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^4 \psi  = 0
\,&lt;/math&gt;

* '''d'Alembertian''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Box^2 = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

The wave equation may be expressed using the d'Alembertian:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Box^2 u = 0
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Though expressed with the Laplacian is more popular:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 u = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}
\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Every enterprise has a reserve of funds.  As the enterprise grows larger, the total reserve becomes larger and larger.  Eventually, it is large enough that it is prudent for the enterprise to invest part of it to gain a higher rate of return than would be possible in a checking account.  These investments include GICs, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and other investment options.  Investment Manager keeps track of these investments. Only large ERP packages have an Investment Manager module.

*[[/Functions | Functions]]
*[[/Reports | Reports]]

== Tables ==
The first table is the Investment table which contains one record for every investment and the second table is the Investment Transaction table which contains one record for every investment transaction.  There is at least one transaction record for every investment and there can be many.
==Data Exchange==
Investment Manager sends transactions to General Ledger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Receiving receives the physical goods from suppliers, verifies their quantity and quality and delivers them to their destination within the enterprise.  It interacts with Purchasing by flagging Purchase Order lines as received and, after authorization from Purchasing, with Inventory by reducing on-order and increasing on-hand quantities.  See Purchasing for a description of invoice matching.  Normally, Shipping and Receiving occur in the same physical location.  All ERP packages have a receiving function although it might be included in Inventory rather than made a separate module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Shipping receives orders from Warehouse Manager (picking) if there is no manufacturing involved or from Manufacturing if there is.  It packs the goods, selects transportation to satisfy the customer's due date, and generates shipping documents such as labels, packing slips, and bills of lading.  Customers can be notified electronically when the goods are shipped and Order Entry/Invoicing is notified so the order can be invoiced.  Normally, Shipping and Receiving occur in the same physical location.  Only large ERP packages have a separate Shipping module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ABC has a meaning in Inventory and is also an acronym for Activity-based Costing.

In Inventory, &quot;A&quot; items are high value items that are closely controlled, &quot;B&quot; items are medium value items that have moderate control, and &quot;C&quot; items are low value items that are loosely controlled.  See Cycle Counting.

i am not sure whether i did this right. i have inserted the content of this page into the section structure of the book - the section on [[Animal Behavior/Learning|Learning]]. i then made some major changes to it there but i left this original page as it was. is there a way to copy the original edit history along with the text? thanks, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] 16:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Typically, an enterprise makes a bank deposit once a day. This consists of the checks the enterprise has received plus any cash or credit/debit card receipts.

Alternatively, deposit means a payment made by a customer to an enterprise before work starts on a job or project.  The deposit is typically a percentage of the job price.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../|Back | Other Statistical Systems]]

Mechanical systems are systems which rely on the inherent flaws of a roulette wheel as a mechanical device or contiguous number spans across the [[../Mechanics/Wheel | wheel layout]].  This is a fundamental difference in strategy between the way that a table game and a computer generates random numbers.

The basic principle underlying mechanical betting systems is exploiting the flaw in the way that the machine generates the numbers.  As opposed to an [[../Mechanics/Electronic|electronic random number generator]] where any number is theoretically independent of any other number, a wheel is constructed with numbers situated permanently adjacent to one another.  Therefore the numbers are not completely independent to one another because if the ball is right on the edge of falling from one cup to another, the number those cups represents are fixed.  This can be especially useful when using [[../Cheat|Table clocking]] to determine a biased wheel, but as technology is making finding a biased wheel very difficult, the underlying theory is still interesting to consider.  These systems are generally reserved for the American tables because it’s next to impossible to create contiguous sets on the European layout.  However the casinos have solved this problems and already have special announce bets that can make this process easier.

[[File:American roulette wheel layout.gif|American Wheel]] [[File:American roulette table layout.gif|American Layout]]

If the ball is predestined to fall a certain region of the wheel (the 0 pocket for example), and you cover the four numbers to each side of the 0 {12,35,3,26,0,32,15,19,4}, as the ball jostles and bounces it is more likely to land in the pockets immediately next to the number than the other side of the wheel.  However covering these numbers, with the same relative return, and without dropping a ton of chips is the challenge.  Finding a betting system that most efficiently covers the numbers on the region of the board is the challenge to the mechanical system.

In this author’s opinion, this is the ONLY system worth exploring with real money in a casino – or buy a wheel and try it at home, but as of the time of this writing (2008) good professional 30” wheels cost around $4000, and a 27” around $2000.  When one considers some systems can be explored with a bankroll of less than $100, it may be worth hitting a casino first.  

What makes this most interesting is that mathematically the odds don’t change.  Covering 24 numbers no matter where they are has the same probability as placing a bet which covers the numbers in sequence around the wheel.  Perhaps it’s just a visceral reaction, but there have been many times where the ball seems to land in the pocket for the number which was bet only to have it slide one pocket over.  I don’t know physics well enough to say if there is any reason why covering a region of numbers on a roulette wheel is more advantageous than not, but it just feels right.  Besides the math has proved ineffectual.

There is only one book that I have been able to find which covers this in any great detail; Beating the Casinos at Their Own Game by Peter Svoboda (ISBN 0-7570-0005-3).  I make direct references to this source only because this particular section of this book is available on [http://www.google.com/books?id=Pc7QVsZCnrAC&amp;pg=PP6&amp;dq=0-7570-0005-3&amp;ei=9qQGSIbmA5CSzQTP7dClAQ&amp;sig=CC_eG2bGt2J5hGScXbi35plJQok#PPA147,M1 Google Books].  This book also covers several other games in interesting ways and I highly recommend buying a copy or getting it from the interlibrary loan from your local library.

Mr. Svoboda goes into several systems and makes several interesting points, but one thing which he does not stress is that it is VITAL to find a roulette wheel with the exact same layout order as the one he uses in his book.  It is possible that a wheel could look very similar but have a different order to their numbering which would require the player to analyze that particular arrangement and betting strategy.  For instance I have seen some antique tables which have a reversed layout where the 2 is on the left of the 0 as opposed to the right, however everything else was in the same order so this may be a moot point.

The thing that I really like is that Mr. Svoboda also makes all of his systems mathematically related to winning percentages, and his strategies cover sectors of the wheel rather than sections of the layout.  Additionally they fit within the constraints of the table limits imposed by most US casinos.

I’ll go into this more later.


==Standing Systems==
Standing systems (for lack of a better term) are those where the same bet is played on the same locations irregardless of previous wins or losses.  This is opposed to progressive systems as described in the next section.

===System 1===
On the American layout, the best known contiguous bet combination is based on the center column.  That placement covers the span from 23 to 5 (clockwise) with five gaps {0, 7, 9, 23, and 30}, and it only includes two numbers {8 and 29} which are outside the span.  This covers a span width of 15 numbers which is almost exactly two fifths of the wheel.

This bet can be played two different ways.
*Place 4 chips on the center column and one chip on each of the numbers in set {0, 7, 9, 28, and 30}
**Return: If the numbers {2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35} hit, then the return is: (4*2)-5=3.  If the numbers {0, 7, 9, 28, 30}hit, then the return is: (1*35)-(4+4)=27.  If the numbers {00, 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 31, 33, 34, 36} hit, then the return is -9.

*Place 1 chip each on two street bets {7, 8, 9} and {28, 29, 30}, and one chip on 0, and two chips on the center column.
**Return: If the numbers {2, 5, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 32, 35} hit, then the return is: (2*2)-3=1.  If the number {0} hits, then the return is (1*35)-4=31.  If the numbers {7, 9}or {28, 30} hit, then the return is: (1*11)-4=7.  If the numbers {8 or 29} hit, then the return is ((2*2)+(1*11))-2=13.  If the numbers {00, 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 31, 33, 34, 36} hit, then the return is -5.

===System 2===
This combines two spans to cover 23 of the 38 numbers on the wheel.

*Place 1 chip on each of the 4 street bets {1, 2, 3}, {13, 14, 15}, {22, 23, 24}, and {34, 35, 36}.  This is the first span.  Place 1 chip on each of the two street bets {4, 5, 6} and {31, 32, 33}, and place 1 chip on each of the two splits {16, 19} and {18, 21}.
**Return: If the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36} hit, then the return is: (1*11)-7=4.  If the number {16, 19, 18, 21} hit, then the return is: (1*17)-7=10.  If the numbers {0, 00, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30} hit, the return is -8.

==Progressive Systems==
Progressive systems change depending on the previous win/loss history.  These systems are based upon the mechanical layout as opposed to statistical systems as described in this chapter.

==RT +/- Hyperthermia==
*'''Duke''' (1994-2001)
**Randomized. 109 patients with superficial tumors (&lt;= 3cm depth); breast 65%, H&amp;N 13%, melanoma 10%. Tumors had to be &quot;heatable&quot; on initial HT. Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) RT + HT. Hyperthermia to &gt;43C x1 hour, 2x/week. RT dose 30-60 Gy if previous RT, otherwise 60-70 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx
**'''2005''' PMID 15860867 -- &quot;Randomized trial of hyperthermia and radiation for superficial tumors.&quot; (Jones EL, J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 1;23(13):3079-85.) 
***Outcome: CR RT 42% vs. RT+HT 66% (SS). Patients with prior RT had most benefit (68% vs. 23%, SS)
***Toxicity: Well tolerated, 1 Grade III thermal burn
***Conclusion: Significant local control benefit for HT

*'''International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group''' (1988-1991) -- combined results from 5 PIII trials
**Randomized. ''5 trials merged due to slow accrual, closed early after benefit.'' 306 patients. Advanced primary or recurrent BCA; 50% active disease outside treatment area. Could have had prior RT. Trials: Dutch Hyperthermia Group (DHG), Medical Research Council (MRC BrI and BrR), European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology (ESHO), and Princes Margaret (PMH). Target hyperthermia 43C. RT given in various fractions.
**'''1996''' PMID 8690639 -- &quot;Radiotherapy with or without hyperthermia in the treatment of superficial localized breast cancer: results from five randomized controlled trials. International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group.&quot; (Vernon CC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jul 1;35(4):731-44.)
***Outcome: CR RT 41% vs. RT+HT 59% (SS); greatest effect in recurrent lesions in previous RT, where re-irradiation dose was low. 2-year OS ~40% (NS), 74% patients progressed outside HT area during follow-up
***Conclusion: Combined result demonstrated efficacy of hyperthermia as adjunct to RT for treatment of recurrence

*'''RTOG, 1991''' PMID 1903023 -- &quot;Randomized phase III study comparing irradiation and hyperthermia with irradiation alone in superficial measurable tumors. Final report by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Perez CA, Am J Clin Oncol 1991 Apr;14(2):133-41.) 
**Randomized. 307 patients with superficial tumors. Treated with RT alone or RT + HT (following, to 42.5C for 45-60 min)
**Response: CR RT 30% vs. RT+HT 32%; improved LC in tumors &lt;3cm
**Toxicity: comparable, but 30% thermal blisters in heated tumors

==Timing of Hyperthermia==
*'''Jefferson, 1993''' (1983-1990) PMID 8515137 -- &quot;Randomized trial of one versus two adjuvant hyperthermia treatments per week in patients with superficial tumours.&quot; (Engin K, Int J Hyperthermia. 1993 May-Jun;9(3):327-40.)
**Randomized. 41 patients with 44 superficial tumors. Treated with QW vs. BIW HT + RT (mean dose 45 Gy)
**2-month CR: 59% QW HT vs. 55% BIW HT
**Predictive factors for CR: RT dose, tumor volume; Predictive factors for duration of response: minimum tumor temperature, tumor volume
**Toxicity: No difference.
**Conclusion: No difference in response or duration between once weekly and twice weekly hyperthermia

==Duration of Hyperthermia==
*Temperature should be converted to 43 celsius-equivalent minutes
**Each 1C above 43C requires 1/2 time for equivalent thermal damage (e.g. 1 min @ 45C = 4 min @ 43C)
**Each 1C below 43C requires 4x increase in time for equivalent thermal damage (e.g. 1 min @ 42C = 0.25 min @ 43C)
**t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2^(Temp1-Temp2)</text>

The roulette table has a '''layout''' printed onto a felt cover.  There are generally only two types of layouts:

==American Layout==

[[File:American roulette table layout.gif|American Layout]]

The American layout reflects the 38 possible numbers on the American wheel.  The main difference between this layout and the European layout is that at the top of the numbers there are a 0 and a 00.  This layout also has a unique betting option where one can play the 0, 00, 1, 2, and 3 however this only pays out 7:1 making it the only layout on the table where the house edge is greater than 5.263%.

==European Layout==

[[File:E_table.gif|European Layout]]

The European (aka French) layout reflects the 37 possible numbers on the European wheel.  The main difference besides the lack of the 00 is that European tables will generally allow announced bets.  In a casino you would tell the croupier the bet you would like and s/he would take your chips and place them on a special marker area to indicate your bet.  This marker area can vary widely among table makers.

This method of betting is especially used if you want to bet on segments of the roulette wheel (see [[Roulette/Mech_Sys|Mechanical Systems]]).  These are the Announce Bets and the chip increments needed:

Instructions: Write out the letters that the word is made up of. Write out the letters in lonely form.
&lt;!--Example:           #&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـت=؟&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      ---&gt;
&lt;!--Note: write to the left of the equal sign to add the Arabic word. The words you add do not have to be real words, they must connect as an Arabic word does though. Remember to add the connecting spacer by pressing SHIFT  then J. Do this so that the dots of one letter do not interfere with the letters of another--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A kernel module is a code that can be loaded into the kernel image at will, without requiring users to rebuild the kernel or reboot their computer. Modular design ensures that you do not have to make a monolithic kernel that contains all code necessary for hardware and situations.

Common kernel modules are device drivers, which directly access computer and peripheral hardware.

Kernel modules have a .ko extension as of kernel 3.0.

== Using modules ==

To determine loaded modules run the command lsmod, which reads the file /proc/modules. An example output of lsmod is the following:

In order to add a module to the kernel you can use the modprobe command. A kernel module daemon kmod, often executes modprobe in order to load a module. Modprobe is passed a string argument that may be a actual module name or an alias to module. Modprode search /proc/modprobe.conf to relate an module alias to an actual module. In order to determine module dependencies, modprobe searches /lib/module/version/modules.dep and determines if other modules must be loaded before the requested module can be. The modules.dep file is created using the depmod -a command, which determines if a particular module calls functions or variables (symbols) that are defined by other modules.

If there are dependencies, insmod loads these before it loads the requested module. While insmod requires detailed instructions about  the path and file names of requested modules, modprobe does not. Here is an example:

''Is there supposed to be an example here?''

Modprobe, insmod and depmod are found in the module-init-tools or kmod packages.

Loaded modules are listed in /proc/modules. Use modinfo modulename.ko to determine module information. ? doesn't work 
use modinfo modulename

Note that you cannot use X, such as an xterm, as the kernel only prints directory to consoles or log files.

== Writing and debugging modules ==

===A simple module===

The simplest kernel module:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
MODULE_LICENSE(&quot;Dual BSD/GPL&quot;);
static int hello_init(void)
{
    printk(KERN_ALERT &quot;Hello, world\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}
static void hello_exit(void)
{
    printk(KERN_ALERT &quot;Goodbye, cruel world\n&quot;);
}
module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);
&lt;/source&gt;

Kernel modules must always contain these two functions, init_module and cleanup_module. Insmod calls init_module when it loads the modules into the the kernel and rmsmod calls cleanup_module when it removes the module. printk() is a logging macro used by the kernel and is assigned a priority of &lt;1&gt;. Kernel priorities, of which there are eight, are defined in kernel.h. Each kernel priority has a particular intended meaning and a related definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

43 #define KERN_EMERG      &quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot;   /* system is unusable                   */
44 #define KERN_ALERT      &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot;   /* action must be taken immediately     */
45 #define KERN_CRIT       &quot;&lt;2&gt;&quot;   /* critical conditions                  */
46 #define KERN_ERR        &quot;&lt;3&gt;&quot;   /* error conditions                     */
47 #define KERN_WARNING    &quot;&lt;4&gt;&quot;   /* warning conditions                   */
48 #define KERN_NOTICE     &quot;&lt;5&gt;&quot;   /* normal but significant condition     */
49 #define KERN_INFO       &quot;&lt;6&gt;&quot;   /* informational                        */
50 #define KERN_DEBUG      &quot;&lt;7&gt;&quot;   /* debug-level messages                 */

&lt;/source&gt;

When using printk() when syslogd and klogd are running, the output of printk() will be appended to /var/log/messages. printk() if called with low priority will only be appended to /var/log/messages. To ensure that it prints to the console use KERN_ALERT priority.

===Compiling the simple module===

Kernel modules are not compiled in the same manner as userspace code. Here is a sample makefile:

&lt;pre&gt;
obj-m += hello.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
&lt;/pre&gt;

Evoke the command make to compile your simple module.

Using the module_init() and module_exit() macros you can change the name of the init_module() and cleanup_module(void).

The __init macro frees the memory of initialization function in the module after the built-in driver, for example, has been loaded. This does not occur, however, with modprobe.

The __exit macro prevents the cleanup_module from being loaded during initialization, as it will not be needed in the kernel while the kernel is in use. These macros can be found in linux/init.h, and are useful for managing memory. __initdata is analogous to __init but for variables.

The MODULE_LICENSE() macro allows you to determine the license of code, and define it for your module.

MODULE_PARM() allows you to pass command line parameters when insmod initializes the module.

In order to span modules across several files, the make file must be altered.

&lt;pre&gt;
obj-m += hello.o
obj-m += startstop.o
startstop-objs := start.o stop.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Testing your simple module===

&lt;pre&gt;
% make
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.10'
CC [M] /home/ldd3/src/misc-modules/hello.o
Building modules, stage 2.
MODPOST
CC /home/ldd3/src/misc-modules/hello.mod.o
LD [M] /home/ldd3/src/misc-modules/hello.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.10'
% su
root# insmod ./hello.ko
Hello, world
root# rmmod hello
Goodbye cruel world
root#
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Writing modules===

The symbols that are available to modules can be found in /proc/kallsyms.

Modules can be written to replace the kernel's system calls.

To see what system calls are executed by a userspace process evoke the process using '''strace'''.

===Kernel space and userspace===

A CPU has different modes, 80386 has four. For a description of rings, see the Wikipedia rings entry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of the information about stars is obtained from studying electromagnetic radiation. Interstellar dust can be observed to get information, as well.

Electromagnetic radiation includes UV (ultraviolet), radio waves, and X-rays. There are two kinds of waves: longitudinal (such as the way sound travels), and transverse (the way light and other electromagnetic radiation travels). Transverse waves are measured by their wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is represented by the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda). Longer wavelengths make shorter frequency.

The formula for frequency is 

&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of EM radiation, &lt;math&gt;3*10^8&lt;/math&gt; meters per second.

Astronomers can learn a lot about distant objects by analyzing spectra. The 3 types of spectra are continuous, emission, and absorption. A continuous spectrum comes from a high pressure '''blackbody''', or thermal source (such as a light bulb). An emission spectrum has bright lines. It is caused by cool, low-pressure gas. An absorption spectrum has dark lines it. It appears when a blackbody's light passes through a cool, low-pressure gas. For example, our sun's surface emits a continuous spectrum, but it becomes an absorption spectrum once it reaches us, because it has passed through the sun's atmosphere. Because of this, all normal stars have absorption spectra.

Since each element has a unique spectrum, astronomers can determine the chemical composition of stars by analyzing their spectra. They can also determine the pressure of the object by the type of spectrum: continuous (high pressure), or emission (low pressure).

An example web application, using the HAppS framework, is [http://hpaste.org hpaste], the Haskell paste bin. Built around the core Haskell web framework, HAppS, with HaXmL for page generation, and binary/zlib for state serialisation.

The [http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/warrickg/haskell/http/ HTTP and Browser modules] exist, and might be useful.

Noticing your comments here (&amp; reading them and the previous ones as an &quot;outsider&quot;) it looks as though the &quot;book&quot; can be improved and that no one is very active on it at present.  I am not knowledgeable in the subject area nor a particularly active editor at present but this is a Wiki - feel free to work on improving it, it is what Wikis are about!  It does look as tho the talk page could do with tidying - some of the older comments look redundant now - and I would help with that if you want me too - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

==1. Describe the function of and point out the following components of a personal computer:==
;a. CPU: 
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/CPU}}
;b. Memory (RAM): 
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/RAM}}
;c. Mother board:
[[Image:AsusP4PE MainboardSocket478.jpg|thumb|Typical Computer Motherboard]]
The mother board is located inside the main unit and contains the core circuitry of the computer, including the CPU.  It also contains &quot;slots&quot; that other circuit cards such can be plugged into to add extra functions to the computer, such as a modem, networking, video acceleration, or a television tuner.  The functions provided by these add-on cards (or ''daughter cards'') are often absorbed into the motherboard as new technology is introduced.  Modems, networking, sound, graphics, hard drive controllers, and USB adapters are examples of technology introduced as add-on cards, but now commonly found on the motherboard.
;d. Hard Drive: 
[[Image:Hdd od srodka.jpg|thumb|Hard drive]]
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Hard drive}}
;e. External Drive:
An external drive is a storage device that is connected to a computer via a USB (or other) port.  The drive itself remains outside the computer.  The advantage of an external drive is that it is easier to install and it can be moved from one computer to another.  This feature can be used for physically transporting large amounts of data between computers, or securing the data in an off-site location.
;f. Internal Drive:
An internal drive is a storage device that is installed inside the computer.  The advantage of an internal drive is that it takes up less space and is generally more reliable than an external drive.
;g. USB:
[[Image:USB TypeA Plug.JPG|thumb|USB connector]]
USB stands for '''U'''niversal '''S'''erial '''B'''us.  It is a convenient method of interfacing many different devices to a computer.  USB devices include cameras, printers, flash memory drives, external hard drives, music players, and many others.  USB ports are located on the back, front, or both sides of a computer, and sometimes even on computer monitors.  A USB device is simply plugged into the port, and the computer recognizes the device and prepares it for use.
;h. Optical Drive:
An optical drive is a device which reads and optionally writes data to optical storage media such as CD-ROMS and DVDs.  
;i. Input devices:
An input device is any device through which data can be provided to a computer.  Input devices include, the mouse, keyboard, network card, storage devices, cameras, and microphones.
;j. Monitor: 
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Monitor}}
;k. Keyboard: 
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Keyboard}}
;l. Printer:
A printer is a device for capturing the output of a computer on paper.
;m. Mouse:
A mouse is a device that is used by human operators to control a computer.  It can be used to move a cursor on a screen, highlight data on the screen, &quot;drag and drop&quot; files from one folder to another, control the action in a computer game, and manipulate data in many other ways.
;n. Modem / Network Card:
Modem stands for '''Mod'''ulator/'''Dem'''odulator, and it a hardware device which allows computers to communicate with one another over a telephone line (or some other audio channel).  A network card serves the same function except that it connects to a computer network (such as ethernet) and is much, ''much'' faster than a modem.  Modems are used for &quot;dial-up&quot; internet connections, and network cards are used for &quot;broadband&quot; internet connections.
;o. Digital Camera:
A digital camera is a device which digitally captures and stores an image in the form of a photograph.  The photograph can then be transferred to a computer where it can be stored, transmitted to other computers, or digitally manipulated.
;p. Scanner:
A scanner is a device which is used to digitize a two-dimensional image, such as a printed photograph, a page from a book, or a store receipt.

==2. Describe the proper handling and storage techniques of disks, CDs, CDR’s, DVDs, Flash/USB drives, and other equivalent optical media devices.==
CD's, CDR's, and DVD's are all forms of optical media, and as such, must be protected from scratches.  They are fairly impervious to water, and in fact can be cleaned with it (just be sure to completely dry them off before trying to use them).  Store them in protective cases, envelopes, or some other container designed to store them.

Flash/USB drives are incredibly durable and can take a lot of punishment.  But that doesn't mean they should be abused.  Though they are tough, they can still be crushed or snapped.  Do not open the casing, as this will expose the internal circuitry to static electricity which can damage them.  Unlike the optical media described above, flash drives can be damaged by liquids.

==3. Explain the difference between read-only, write once, and write-rewrite media. What are examples of each?==
;Read-only: Read-only media is prepared at the factory and cannot be altered by the consumer.  The most prevalent examples of read-only memory today are the CD-ROM and the DVD.
;Write-once: Write-once media is blank when purchased and is written by the consumer.  Once it is written to, the data on it cannot be changed.  An example of write-once media is the CDR (or CD-R).
;Write-rewrite: Write-rewrite media can be written, erased, and rewritten by the end user.  An example is the CD-RW.  This type if media is generally more expensive than the CD, the DVD, or the CDR.

==4. Determine the following on a computer system:&lt;br&gt;a. Processor speed&lt;br&gt;b. Storage capacity of the hard drive.&lt;br&gt;c. Memory capacity (RAM)==
===Windows===
Click the &quot;Start&quot; button.  Then click &quot;My Computer&quot; with the right mouse button, and select &quot;Properties&quot;.  This will bring up a window.  Select the &quot;General&quot; tab, and the computer will display the processor speed, memory capacity, as well as a number of other bits of information.

To find the storage capacity, click the &quot;Start&quot; button and then use the left mouse button to select &quot;My Computer&quot;.  This will open a new window which will show all the drives on the computer.  Generally, the &quot;C:&quot; drive is the hard drive, so right-click on that and select &quot;Properties&quot; - this will show you the drive capacity as well as how much of the drive is in use.

Be sure to pay attention to the use of the left mouse button verses the right mouse button.

===Mac===
Click on the &quot;Apple&quot; at the top left corner of the screen. Now click on &quot;About This Mac&quot;. This will bring up a window that contains the processor type and speed and how much memory the computer has. To find the storage capacity on the hard drive, click the &quot;More Info...&quot; button. Now click on &quot;ATA&quot; under &quot;Hardware&quot;. There should be two &quot;ATA Bus&quot; sections. Click on the bottom section or the one that doesn't contain anything about a CD drive. The hard drive capacity is under &quot;Capacity&quot;.

===Linux===
At the command prompt, type the following command:

 cat /proc/cpuinfo 

This will tell you the processor speed as well as the memory capacity.  For the storage capacity, type:

 df

This will yield an output similar to this:
 Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/hda2             20315844   7085116  12182088  37% /
 /dev/hda1               101086     11451     84416  12% /boot
 /dev/hda5             16674136  12303988   3523124  78% /home

This output above indicates that the computer has a single hard drive with three partitions.  The first of these is the root partition which has a total capacity of 20 Gigabytes, the second is 101 Megabytes, and the third is 16.7 Gigabytes.

==5. What are the advantages of increasing processor speed, hard drive storage capacity and RAM on a computer?==
Increasing the processor speed of a computer will allow it to make more computations per second, thus improving its performance.  Increasing the amount of RAM in a computer will also increase its performance, but for a different reason.  When a computer program needs RAM, it requests it from the operating system (OS).  If free memory is available, the OS assigns it to the program and all is well.  If there is not ''enough'' memory to satisfy the request, the OS will copy the contents of some ''other'' program's RAM to the hard drive, and then give ''that'' to the requesting program.  When the other program needs that memory again, the OS restores it from the hard drive (after writing the other program's version of the memory to the hard drive).  This process is called &quot;swapping,&quot; and it can really slow down a computer.  However, all the programs continue to work as designed, and the computer makes maximum use of the resources available to it.  Increasing RAM capacity will eliminate or reduce the amount of swapping that goes on.

Increasing the storage capacity of a computer will not make it run any faster (as increasing the processor speed and memory capacity will), but it will allow more files and programs to be stored on the computer.

==6. List two different types of printers and explain the uses and advantages of each type.==
===Laser Printer===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Laser printer}}
===Ink Jet Printer===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Ink jet printer}}

==7. Explain how each of the following elements helps protect a computer system. Why is computer safety so important?==
===a. Backup of personal files===
An important fact about modern computing is that computers eventually fail.  If the hard drive on a computer fails, it may be difficult or impossible to recover the data that is stored on it.  Forward-thinking computer users keep all of their important personal files backed up on external media so that when the computer fails, they still have their data.  
===b. Whole system image backup===
It is not nearly as important to back up program files, because the program can be re-installed when the computer is repaired or replaced.  However, re-installing every program that a computer user needs can be a time-consuming and frustrating process.  If the whole system is backed up, it can be restored in short order.

===c. Surge protection===
The A/C power that feeds most businesses and households is subject to all kinds of disturbances that can disrupt or damage a computer.  Lightning strikes can induce large currents in powrlines, and these translate into &quot;surge&quot; voltages.  The increased voltage can easily damage a computer.  Most often, this affects its power supply module.  A surge protector is designed to absorb these voltage surges, preventing damage to the computer.
===d. Internet safety hardware/software===
An unfortunate fact of modern life is that the world is filled with evil (or immature) people who think it great fun to destroy data on a stranger's computer.  Some of these people are capable of &quot;hacking&quot; their way into computer systems and altering files - even taking complete control of the computer.  The computer can then be used to launch attacks against ''other'' computers.  Sometimes this is done in order to install malicious software designed to analyze keystrokes.  When the program detects that someone is engaged in online banking activities or ordering merchandise with a credit card, it springs into action, gathering account numbers and passwords which are then passed to the programmer.  Once hacking was confined to a small community of immature, thoughtless programmers looking for a thrill, but it is becoming more and more an activity conducted by organized crime.

Firewalls and antivirus software are designed to combat these operations, but in order to be effective, they must be installed and constantly updated.

==8. Write a 250-word essay or give a three-minute oral report about the history of computers. Include prominent events and personalities that are significant to the development of the computer, both hardware and software. This report should focus on the development of the personal computer, not the internet or other accessory functions related to computing.==

'''Steve Wozniak''' and '''Steve Jobs''' are probably the most important people in the early history of personal computer hardware, as together, they formed Apple Computer which produced the first commercially viable home computer.  '''Bill Gates''' and the company he founded (Microsoft) have had more influence on computer software than anyone else.  Other people to know about include '''Brian Kernighan''', '''Dennis Ritchie''', '''Ken Thompson''', '''Richard Stallman''', '''Vint Cerf''', and '''Linus Torvalds'''.

==9. Spend one week charting the time you spend on a computer. List what time was spent on schoolwork, gaming, online, etc. At the end of the week, evaluate with your counselor, family, or group leader how your management of computer time relates to the Bible’s instructions on stewardship of our time and resources (Romans 14:12; Psalms 31:15; Ecclesiastes 3:1-8; Ephesians 5:15-16).==
''So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.'' - Romans 14:12, NIV

''My times are in your hands; deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me.'' - Psalm 14:12, NIV

''Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.'' - Ephesians 5:15-16, NIV.

We are responsible for how we spend our time, and God expects us to use it in His service.  Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 starts out 

''There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot'' - Ecclesiastes 3:1,2, NIV.  

Likewise, there is a time to compute and a time to not compute.  It is very easy to become addicted to computing, and as with all things, moderation is the key to temperance.

==10. Dialogue with a long-term computer user about the advantages/disadvantages of Macs and PCs. Some questions you should ask include:&lt;br&gt;a. What operating system does each use? What are some advantages of that OS?&lt;br&gt;b. What compatibility issues do these two types of computers have in relation to data sharing and program installation?&lt;br&gt;c. What type of industries / careers tend to use each type of computer system?==
With the importance of computing in today's world, it is highly likely that you know someone who could be described as &quot;a long-term computer user.&quot;  Perhaps a staff member in your Pathfinder club fits this description.  Invite this person to attend a meeting to have this discussion.  It would be a good idea to provide this person with the questions ahead of time to provide ample opportunity for preparations.

==Have the Computer Honor==
{{ay prerequisite|Vocational|Computer}}
==1. Give examples of each of the following computer software / media computer components. Explain the role that each plays in an individuals’ computer experience.==
===a. Word Processing software===
A word processing program assists the user in creating letter, reports, papers, and other documents.  Word processor software has filled the role that used to be assigned to a typewriter.  However, a word processor can do a variety of additional tasks, including bold, italics, and underline; spell &amp; grammar check; templates for a variety of advanced documents such as FAX, resume, and tables/forms; formatted tables, image import, Wordart, columns, and more.

Many word processing programs come with preloaded images, templates, and other assistant software.  Most word processors come bundled with graphics manipulation software, presentation software, spreadsheet software, and sometimes even website creation software.  Often these programs work seamlessly together, allowing spreadsheets to be presented within a word processing document or documents to be presented in public presentations.

Commercial word processing programs include:
Microsoft Word, Corel Wordperfect

Free programs include:  Openoffice.org (an excellent choice) and Abiword, though there are quite a range of free office suite programs available for download

===b. Presentation software===

A presentation program is a computer software package used to display information, normally in the form of a slide show. It typically includes three major functions: an editor that allows text to be inserted and formatted, a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images and a slide-show system to display the content.

There are many different types of presentations including professional (work-related), education, worship and for general communication. Presentation programs can either supplement or replace the use of older visual aid technology, such as Pamphlets, handouts, chalk boards, flip charts, posters, slides and overhead transparencies. Text, graphics, movies, and other objects are positioned on individual pages or &quot;slides&quot; or &quot;foils&quot;. The &quot;slide&quot; analogy is a reference to the slide projector, a device which has become somewhat obsolete due to the use of presentation software. Slides can be printed, or (more usually) displayed on-screen and navigated through at the command of the presenter. Transitions between slides can be animated in a variety of ways, as can the emergence of elements on a slide itself.

Many presentation programs come with pre-designed images (clip art) and/or have the ability to import graphic images. Custom graphics can also be created in other programs such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator and then imported.

With the growth of digital photography and video, many programs that handle these types of media also include presentation functions for displaying them in a similar &quot;slide show&quot; format. For example, Apple's iPhoto allows groups of digital photos to be displayed in a slide show with options such as selecting transitions, choosing whether or not the show stops at the end or continues to loop, and including music to accompany the photos.

The most commonly known presentation program is Microsoft PowerPoint, although there are alternatives such as Corel Presentations, OpenOffice.org Impress and Apple's Keynote.

===c. Graphic creation software===
Graphic creation software is a subclass of application software used for graphic design, multimedia development, specialized image development, general image editing or simply to access graphic files. Art software uses either raster or vector graphic reading and editing methods to create, edit, or view art.

Many artists (creative professionals) today use computers rather than traditional forms of art. Using graphic art software may be more efficient than rendering using traditional media by requiring less hand-eye coordination, requiring less visualization skills, and utilizing the computer's quicker (sometimes more accurate) automated rendering functions to create images.

Images created or enhanced in graphic creation software can be imported into word processing, presentation, publication, spreadsheet to enhance the overall final product.

Most graphic art software includes common functions, creation tools, editing tools, filters, and automated rendering modes.

Common general grapics editing software includes Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photo Elements, Macromedia Fireworks, Paintshop Pro (JASC), Ulead PhotoImpact.  

Several quality free programs available for download include IrfanView, Picasa (by Google), and OpenCanvas.  The Openoffice.org Suite includes an excellent program for creating vector-based graphics.

===d. Media burning software===
Media burning software  allows the user to copy data (music, video, data) from another disk or drive onto blank disk-media, such as CD-R (CD with record-once capability), CD-RW (CD with write/rewrite capability), DVD-R (DVD with record-once capability), and DVD-RW (DVD with one of several recording/re-recording capabilities).  DVD writable disks even come in a two-sided burnable technology that allows the DVD-burner to copy information onto both sides of the disk.  This doubles the available recording space.  Most CD-R/RW disks have 700-800 MB of data space, while DVD R/RW's have 4.0-8.0 GB of data space.

This media burning software communicates with a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive to perform these burning tasks.  Popular retail programs include Nero (PC), EasyMedia Creator (PC), and Burn (Mac). 

Other programs (many free) include - RealPlayer, UltraISO, RecordNow, Acoustica, Burn4Free, PowerISO, and BurnQuick.


Most computer systems come with one or more retail software programs, though sometimes it is a lite version of the program.  Both Windows and Mac OS X also have built-in programs built into their operating system to provide basic burning services.  Mac OS X even has a program to create interactive and beautiful DVD shows.


Burning software comes in a variety of recording technologies that facilitate burning DVD movies; documents and images; ISO images; CD audio files; and MP3/music files.


There are also different Freeware (free) software packages available.
The latest listing of popular burning software can be found at:
[http://www.download.com/sort/3150-2646_4-0-1-6.html? Download.com]

===e. Publication software===
Publication software, also known as desktop publishing software (DTP) allows the personal computer user to inexpensively  produce documents for either large scale publishing or smaller personal jobs.  The user is able to create complex page layouts that combine text, photos, clipart, and shapes, as well as other visual elements and textual layout patterns (such as columns, inlaid text, subscript text, articles, etc.)


Because of the ease of use of this software, individuals can print only a few copies to a personal printer or send the digital layout pages (often outputted to PDFs) to a commercial printing company.


Some may wonder, what can DTP software do that word processing software cannot?  In the early days (Pagemaker, the first DTP software was produced in 1985, whereas Wordstar and Wordperfect were already being used by thousands of users), there was a massive difference.  Word processing software could do basic typewriting, text and margins, whereas any other layout elements were largely unknown to word processors.  DTP software used a graphical user interface, where you could &quot;see what it would look like&quot; when it was published, a term now known as WYSIWYG (What-you-see-is-what-you-get).


In recent years, the strong suite for DTP software is in the templates, easily layouts that have been predefined, as well as output files &amp; scalable font handling that far exceed the word processor.  However, some of the layout options original designated to DTP software are now available in word processors (images, columns, spell check, etc.).


Publication software includes:
Adobe Indesign, Corel Ventura, Microsoft Publisher, Quark XPress, and Apple Pages (Mac).

Freeware DTP software includes Scribus and Passepartout.

===f. Database creation software===
Database creation software provides the interface to create and manage database records.  Databases are a collection of interrelated records that are arranged by a software program, called a Database Management System(DBMS), to create meaningful output, such as task lists, Pathfinder birthdays, or campout KP assignments.  Most common software programs create and manage relational databases, meaning that information in a variety of locations can be pulled together and presented in one form or output.  For example, you may have a list of Pathfinder birthdays, and you wish to assign KP list by birthday.  You could call up the meals needing cleanup from one database, and have it assign Pathfinders to a KP duty based on their birthday.  The final output would be one form, with three columns, but the information would be pulled from two databases.

Database Software programs include Microsoft Access and Corel Paradox.

Openoffice.org Suite contains a robust database similar to MS Access titled Base.

Specialized freeware databases can be found at downloading sites such as:
[http://download.com Download.com].

===g. Spreadsheet software===

Spreadsheet software creates spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets are grids of information, usually spread across several pages or books that are used widely in the financial field to calculate and display financial data.


Spreadsheet software performs a lot of the functions formerly assigned to bookkeeping ledgers, and the program offers countless self-calculating tools that can provides thousands of bits of information rapidly, allowing a bookkeeper to keep up with a variety of financial data very quickly and efficiently.


In recent years, the increased abilities of spreadsheet software to manage text fields has led some users to blend their usage of word processing with spreadsheet management, creating organized (but usually small) lists.  Some online database programs even output their information to tabular forms that can be edited in spreadsheet forms.  


In some ways, a spreadsheet program is a database program, in that it can sort and manage linear databases, that is, databases that only have one &quot;layer&quot; of information.


Pathfinder clubs might find a spreadsheet program useful to keep track of dues, campout fees, or even to keep meeting attendance.  Some counselors have even created Class level (Friend, Companion, Explorer, Ranger, Voyager, Guide) spreadsheets that allow the counselor to quickly &quot;check off&quot; who has completed the requirements towards their class level insignia.


Spreadsheet programs include:  Microsoft Excel and Corel Quattro Pro.


The free Openoffice.org Suite contains a program called Spreadsheet that performs the majority of tasks needed in a spreadsheet software program.

===h. Flash media===

Flash memory is a form of computer memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. It is a technology that is primarily used in memory cards. This type of memory is erased and programmed in blocks consisting of multiple locations.  This means that it can be saved and re-saved to, and files stored on it can be edited at any time. Flash memory is very inexpensive, and provides a cost-effective way to save large amounts of data (such as documents, pictures, and music) in one place. Examples of applications include digital audio players, digital cameras and mobile phones. Flash memory is also used in USB flash drives (thumb drives, handy drive), which are used for general storage and transfer of data between computers. It has also gained some popularity in the game console market, where it is often used for game save data.

===i. Disk media===
Disk media, more commonly referred to as removable media, is any media device that acts as an input or output device where data is displayed.  Removable media eliminates such permanent media options as the internal hard drive.    

In the 21st century, removable media provide specific niche devices and services, such as internet, GPS directions, music, and video, that all relate together through the common device, the computer.  removable media provides users with the opportunity to store information for processing at a later time or date.

Examples of removable media include DVDs, CDs, removable hard drives, floppy disks (in some older computers), media players, and digital cameras

==2. Successfully install and use a software program.==
Software comes in a variety of ways, most commonly on a CD or as a file downloaded from the internet.  If the file is downloaded from the internet, please verify that you trust the source you downloaded the file from.  Generally, opening executible files attached to email is unwise and may infest your computer with trojan or virus software.

==='''Installation'''===

Each installer program works slightly differently, but we'll attempt to explain the basics.

==='''Windows:'''===

===='''''CD:'''''====  

In most cases you would simply insert the program CD into your CD-ROM drive.  In most cases, the CD will be automatically recognized as needing to be installed and the install program will automatically begin.  If it does not, you can start the install program by choosing Start from your menu, then choosing Run...  Browse to the location of the CD (usually D:), then choose the program listed there called setup.exe (or something similar).  The CD should start installing the desired program.  At times, you may have to input a serial number or other code to verify that you are indeed the owner of a legitimate copy of the software you are attempting to install.  If you have pirated (illegally borrowed) the software, please choose to not install the program.  There are so many ''legitimately'' free software offering available over the Internet, that it really isn't necessary to use pirated copies.

===='''''Download:'''''====  

You will likely download a file named something.zip.  This is a compressed file that needs &quot;unzipped&quot; by your windows program before it can be installed.  Once you have uncompressed the file, you should double-click the file and it should start installing.  

The installer may ask for your name, email, or other information.  Please read the EULA Agreement carefully, since you are legally bound by this license agreement.  In some cases, software downloaded from the internet is &quot;free&quot; but has other software (often called malware) attached to the installer program.  These additional programs will be secretly installed on your system, and may impair the speed of your system.  However, if they are uninstalled, the main program will no longer work properly, if at all.  Again, if you read the EULA Agreement, you will have the opportunity to see if the software maker or company has added such programs, since they have to tell you about them in the EULA Agreement if they exist.

Some software programs may take awhile to install, especially if they come on more than one CD/DVD (such as mapping programs, office/graphics suites, and games).  

Once a software program is installed, a shortcut is installed under the Programs folder (Start | Programs) and also possibley on your desktop.  Click on this shortcut and the program will launch (begin).

==='''MAC'''===

Mac OS X has an application called Installer bundled with it that is used to &quot;install&quot; many MAC programs. However, this is not technically an installer, but a Package Manager. 

Some commercial applications for Mac OS X use a custom installer, often Installer VISE or Stuffit InstallerMaker. Applications that do not need to install additional system components can be installed by moving the application files to a desired location on a hard drive; this is known as &quot;drag-and-drop installation&quot; and no installer software is needed. MANY Mac programs use this type of installation.

Mac OS X also includes a separate software updating application, Software Update that keeps installed programs updated via the internet.

===='''''CD'''''====
In a way similar to Windows, programs on CD are inserted in the MAC CD-ROM drive, and an installer begins and automated setup begins.

===='''''Download'''''====

Mac OS X downloaded files are usually archived in a StuffIt archive.  The installer or drop-and-drag installation program can be unarchived and installed, following directions included with the archived program.

===Linux===
Most software for Linux systems is available over the Internet, though some commercial packages do occasionally come on media (such as a CD-Rom or DVD).  Various distributions of Linux have different strategies for installing software packages, so there is no &quot;one way&quot; to do this.  

Most software on a Linux system cannot be installed except by the System Administrator, so you will need to log in as root (or use the &quot;su -&quot; command to become root).  Some Linux systems will have an &quot;Install Software&quot; item on the menu, and clicking this will lead you through the steps necessary to install a new program.  Other systems require the use of a command line utility which must be executed from the system console.

RedHat developed the &quot;rpm&quot; file, which when downloaded can be installed either from a graphical user interface (follow the on-screen prompts) or from the command line, using the rpm utility:

 rpm -U packagename

The -U option means &quot;upgrade,&quot; and this will either replace an older version of the software that has already been installed, or install it if no version is present.  Unfortunately, rpm packages have dependencies - you cannot install package X unless package Y is there (and is sufficiently up-to-date).  You cannot install package Y until package Z is installed.  Package Z may have its own dependency problems as well.  This can go on seemingly forever.  To address this problem, another utility was developed called &quot;yum&quot; (which stands for the Yellowdog Update Manager, &quot;Yellowdog&quot; being the name of another Linux distribution).  Yum looks at all the dependencies and updates everything that is needed for package X, including packages Y, Z, and any other packages that are needed:

 yum install packagename

Yum will then go out on the Internet, find the latest version of the package on an approved ''repository'', download it, download its dependencies (and the dependencies' dependencies), install them, and perform some basic configuration.
Yum can be configured to run on a regular basis to keep all the software installed on a Linux PC up-to-date automatically.  Other Linux distributions have equivalent package management utilities.

==3. Discuss with your unit, group, and/or family the moral issues surrounding software piracy and file sharing. Using biblical support, be able to describe what a Christian’s stance and practice should be in this arena and explain the reasons for your answer.==

===Notes for discussion leaders:===

'''PLEASE do not begin this discussion without first prayerfully considering the potential direction of this HOT TOPIC conversation, as well as your practice in this arena.''' 

Each year, billions of dollars of software is illegally pirated by consumers.  When most leaders were young, they were instructed not to steal the candy bar from the 7/11 or the CD from Wal-mart.  In the twenty-first century, theft now encompasses what is often termed &quot;intellectual property.&quot;  That is, the items stolen are intangible in a physical sense, such as music, data, or software programs.  

Many Christians have not however mentally adjusted their application of the &quot;Thou shalt not steal&quot; commandment to intellectual property.  George Barna states that only 8% of American teenagers feel that piracy of music is morally wrong.   In fact, only 48% of the youth surveyed said that someone in their lives had mentioned the moral issues surrounding this common practice.  

For the complete article:  [http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=162  Barna Update Online]

In my teaching experience (I teach computers and bible for a Northern California Adventist Academy), I have found the approach of &quot;I choose not to do this because....&quot; and the &quot;here's what this researcher discovered&quot; approach as valid for most students.  Each student has their opinion and is at their own place in their spiritual journey.  Providing a discussion point is NOT likely to change their mind overnight (nor should it).  However, it does provide them with the information as well as the strong backing to take a stand that is different from the status quo among their peers.  I would strongly discourage an attitude of &quot;this is the right answer and this is how you should do it&quot; approach to this discussion!  Allowing them to read the Bible texts and to discuss the implications without prematurely moralizing what you understand the passages to say is invaluable to THEIR learning and application process.  Allow the Holy Spirit to do HIS work in HIS time.

==='''Bible texts that may provide a basis for your personal study and group discussion:'''===
Exodus 20:15 -- The commandment to not steal
Genesis 31 -- Rachel stealing the images
Romans 2:21 -- Being an consistent example of what you command of others
Leviticus 6:2-7 -- Stealing what has been entrusted to you
Joshua 7 -- Achan's theft
John 12:6 -- Judas' theft

==4. Complete four of the following activities, providing print or digital evidence of completion to your instructor.==

Most Adventist Academies have classes in Keyboarding and Computer Literacy.  Evidence of completion of these two courses would be adequate evidence for this requirement.

This requirement should show evidence of individual creativity and involvement.  

===a. Create a letter using a word processing program. Use a merge file to allow the same letter to be sent to five different people, with personalization in each letter (such as name field &amp; address field). Use the letter for a project such as:&lt;br&gt;i. Requesting finances for a mission trip or service activity.&lt;br&gt;ii. Communicating a non-perishable holiday food drive to your community.&lt;br&gt;iii. Describing activities in your Pathfinder club that would be of interest to your local newspaper.&lt;br&gt;iv. Inviting friends and family to a Pathfinder Sabbath or other youth ministry event.===

In Microsoft Word, this requires two separate documents, a data document for the addresses and the letter document for the standard part of the letter.  The merge wizard (see windows help file) will assist you in stepping through the process.

In creating the letter document, merge fields could be placed in the address and salutation lines.

===b. Create a database that includes at least 15 records of people that includes at least three other fields (such as addresses, honors earned, phone numbers). Use the database to provide forms that extract their information from the database. Use this information for providing a report such as:&lt;br&gt;i. Tracking which honors have been earned by your club during the current year.&lt;br&gt;ii. Determining the attendance and/or points structure of each pathfinder in your club.&lt;br&gt;iii. Tracking which class level requirements have been completed by each individual in your club or group.&lt;br&gt;iv. Tracking the contacts involved in a year-long service initiative.===

This should be done using a database, even though most of this could be done as a spreadsheet.  Remember that databases are a combination of form and database files.  The output form should display the necessary information.

===c. Create a spreadsheet. Use this spreadsheet to do something such as:&lt;br&gt;i. Tracking dues and/or donations to your Pathfinder club&lt;br&gt;ii. Tracking income and expenses for a campout, mission trip, or other group event&lt;br&gt;iii. Tracking unit completion of class level requirements===

This spreadsheet should not only display the data, but should also make use of formulas to automatically generate the data.  Spreadsheets have the advantage over other recording methods that formulas can make repetitive tasks much easier by filling in cells with accurate data without manual entry.  

===d. Create a two-page newsletter using a publications program. Use multiple columns, in-line graphics, two fonts, appropriate font sizes, and appropriate title and footer information. Use this newsletter for publishing one newsletter such as:&lt;br&gt;i. Pathfinder newsletter&lt;br&gt;ii. Church newsletter.&lt;br&gt;iii. Report from a recent mission trip or service activity.&lt;br&gt;iv. School publication===

Templates are graphically rich files created by most office programs, such as Publisher, that allow you to easily create newsletter, newspaper, or other graphically rich publications.  Combine images from the event with news information to create a FUN publication.   A publication program, unlike a word processing program, includes layout fields that closely integrate themed colors, pictures, clip art, and text. 

===e. Use a presentation program to create a presentation file containing at least six slides (with text and photos), and demonstrate its function in a full screen presentation. Use templates, design elements, colors, and transitions as appropriate in your presentation. Use the presentation in presenting a subject as:&lt;br&gt;i. AY Honor&lt;br&gt;ii. Class level concept&lt;br&gt;iii. Sermon&lt;br&gt;iv. Fundraising===

Presentations can be used to effectively communicate your message to a large audience through the use of media rich content with projected images and text.  For best effect, the presentation should use font sizes large enough to be read from a distance (typically size 24 or greater), and pictures of high-enough quality to not be pixelated.  The same template or background should be used throughout the presentation.  Slide transitions should be logical, and should not distract from the overall presentation.  One of the most common mistakes of beginning presenters is to have the transitions be so fancy that the text and images zoom and whiz all over the screen, but are unreadable or distracting to the audience.  KISS (Keep It Surprisingly Simple) is a great principle.


===f. Using a media burning software program, burn at least fifteen folders and/or files onto burnable media. Verify the media data integrity after the burn is complete.===
===g. Using a graphic creation program modify original digital photographs in the following ways:&lt;br&gt;i. Frame or blur the edges of a photograph&lt;br&gt;ii. Turn a color photo into a sepia-tone or black-and-white photo&lt;br&gt;iii. Save a photograph as a different file type than the original&lt;br&gt;iv.

* What's a Wiki Workbench Doing in My Mindspace? and Other Musings on Education, Technology, and Philosophy


''Key Words''

* '''archaeology''': In Foucaultian terms, the comparative study of epistemes.

* '''episteme''': An underlying system of thought. Broader than a paradigm or world-view, an episteme is so ubiquitous, taken for granted, or subconscious that we don't even engage with it consciously. Foucault defines two epistemes (and, in later works, modified his earlier position by stating that more than one episteme can be in effect at once):

:: '''continuity''': This episteme is one of fluidity, universality, and analogy; all things are inherently connected universally (e.g., the Great Chain of Being, with God at its summit) and can be known by juxtaposition with other things with similar qualities, which is why Foucault called it &quot;similitude.&quot; One can visualize a universal continuum or spiral that includes all things, including objects (be they abstract/spiritual or physical), phenomena (e.g., visible or invisible), utterances, words, even letters. Within this episteme, an athlete's speed can be explained by way of an analogy to a horse or wings (centaurs, winged sandals), which is analogous to the wind, to the incantation of a certain vowel sound by a sorcerer, etc.; a treacherous river is likened to the Hydra monster (&quot;hydra&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot; in Greek); society functions like a human body (the Medieval body politic, with arms being the soldiers, legs being the labourers, the king being the head, etc.). According to Foucault, this episteme began in prehistoric times and lasted until it experienced a gradual decline by the mid-1600s.

:: ''' reason''': Foucault argues that this episteme emerged during the Neoclassical Age (c. 1650-1810), hence why Foucault called it &quot;classisism.&quot; It is primarily one of containment, contextualization, and contrast. In particular contexts or fields of knowledge, units of meaning, such as words or signs, can be applied in a one-to-one correspondence to refer to things, and truth can be defined in context. Since the mind of man is the locus of reason, man, not God, becomes the centre of all knowing (hence what some boldly have called &quot;the death of God&quot;). Reason remains the dominant episteme among people in most Western countries (consider how controlled, contexualized, and well-defined utterances by &quot;experts&quot; are the kind that we take most seriously today).

* '''mindspace''': My conceptual model (think of it as an extended visual metaphor) of an individual's field of knowledge. I like to imagine a large, grassy field with trees, rocks, and some uneven terrain (although any image of an open field works). One's mindspace includes many components (see below):

:: '''materials''': Adhesives, parts, and pegs.

:::: '''adhesives''': Epistemes that keep building blocks securely together so that they can be understood in relation to one another. For quick reference, these can be '''glue''' (similitude) or '''tape''' (reason). (I chose glue because it can stretch in a continuous, analogous fashion; the image of tape works well because it is two-sided: one side &quot;sticks&quot; as a functional/contextual truth, whereas the other merely stands in opposition as falsehood.)

:::: '''parts''': Basic utterances that are complete ideas (e.g., basic phrases and individual sentences; signs, symbols, and gestures that denote meaning, such as a &quot;no-smoking&quot; sign that means &quot;Do not smoke or you may be punished,&quot; or crossed arms and a frown that collectively mean &quot;I am angry with you&quot;). Scattered on the ground in your mindspace, these are all the bits of knowledge that you have ever heard, read, or experienced in any shape or form. The average adult's mindspace contains millions upon millions of parts.

:::: '''pegs''': Individual content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and their empirical counterparts (images, colours, shapes, visible movements, sensations, sounds); function words (i.e., conjunctions, prepositions, etc.), punctuation marks, and other conventions of communication generally (e.g., frame changes). These help to keep parts together, but they have no real meaning themselves. We usually gloss over these when we listen to, read, or otherwise experience information.

:::: '''monuments''': Parts that have been partially or fully constructed (using adhesives and pegs) or taken apart. These can be '''heaps''' (piles of materials that have yet to be constructed--i.e., bits of undigested knowledge), or, at the other extreme, '''landmarks''' (unchanging constructions--i.e., ideas accepted as truths and no longer questioned). For instance, reading a book without really stopping to think of what you are inputting is like shovelling piles of materials into a big heap in your mindspace; then, reviewing the material, comprehending it, coming to a detailed understanding of it, and constantly engaging in building/taking apart is the activity of learning and lifelong engagement that I call '''monumental learning'''; if learning ends and the monument has dried and solidified into an unchanging, fossilized, &quot;finished&quot; structure, one has a landmark.

:: '''workbench''': A conceptual table or desk upon which rests an individual's short-term thoughts and concerns. Other popular concepts include the &quot;front burner&quot; or one's &quot;short-term memory.&quot; Imagine a table placed in front of you in your mindspace.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''uncertainty''': This (paradigm or type of thinking?) has been around in various forms and extremes since ancient times (e.g., the Skeptics), but it is only since the 19th century (and especially since the 1960s with the work of Foucault, Derrida, etc.) that the age-old notion of capital-T Truth (along with context-bound small-t truths) have been exposed as totally arbitrary. As Foucault writes in ''The Order of Things'', the early 19th-century saw uncertainty flare up with the loss of confidence in the social sciences' ability to define a single, collectively agreed-upon, capital-T Truth, once it was witnessed that these fields, unlike the pure sciences, were so easily splintered into contradictory schools of thought, each with its own small-t truth and respected proponents thereof. Socialist economists' and historians' writings (e.g., Marx), Darwin's Theory of Evolution, Nietszche's writings, Freud's (and others') discoveries about the instability of the human mind, and, at the level of our most fundamental units of understanding, Saussure's writings on the arbitrariness of language--all these developments have shattered previously accepted/respected notions of truth. Today, contingency, randomness, variability, and anxiety are increasingly being acknowledged as &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;inescapable&quot; by mainstream society. Interestingly, such notions have sometimes been manipulated in order to legitimize questionable practices, such as planning (often excessively) for the &quot;uncertainties of the future,&quot; as seen in excessively conservative budgets in which massive debt reduction and tax cuts are justified (&quot;just in case,&quot; or &quot;to be safe&quot;) at the expense of the desparate need for spending in social service sectors, such as health care, lest we report a budget deficit.</text>
