      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several kinds of functions that use or create lists.  These functions are found in the LIST menus.  The LIST menus are accessed by the 2nd function of the STAT key.  It is just below the DEL key.  Move over to the right one or two times to access the List menus.

There are several kinds of functions that use or create lists. These functions are found in the LIST menus. The LIST menus are accessed by the 2nd function of the STAT key. It is just below the DEL key. The functions that create new lists or change existing ones are found in the LIST OPS menu.

== Functions that change lists. ==

The functions in this section change existing lists.

=== dim( ===

The list dimension function ('''2nd LIST OPS 3''') has several uses.  It will tell you the length of a list (how many elements are in the list.)

:{1,3,5,7,9,11} STO&gt; L1
::::{1 3 5 7 9 11}
:dim(L1)
::::6
:dim({1,5})
::::2

The result of a dim( expression is a single number.

By storing a number in the dim( of a list you can create a new list with a certain number of elements or change the length of an existing list.

Creating a new list, fills it with elements that are all zero.

:3 STO&gt; dim(L1)
::::3
:L1
::::{0 0 0}

A list can be made shorter thus deleting elements on the end, or longer thus adding elements with zero value onto the end.

:{2,4,6,8,10} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 4 6 8 10}
:3 STO&gt; dim(L1)
::::3
:L1
::::{2 4 6}
:6 STO&gt; dim(L1)
::::6
:L1
::::{2 4 6 0 0 0}

=== Sorting ===
The sorting functions '''SortA(''' and '''SortD(''' are the first functions in the List Ops menu: ('''2nd LIST OPS 1''') and  ('''2nd LIST OPS 2''').  These functions sort the elements of the specified list.  The first does an ascending sort (smallest item first); the second does a descending sort (largest item first).

These functions will not work on lists given with curly brackets.  The parameter in the parentheses must be a list name.  This is because the calculator operates on this list in memory as it is rearranged.  The previous order of items is no longer available.  Sorting does not create a new list.
  
:{3,6,2,4} STO&gt; L1
::::{3 6 2 4}
:SortA(L1)
::::Done
:L1
::::{2 3 4 6}

A decreasing sort works in a similar way.

:{6,8,2,9,4} STO&gt; L2
::::{6 8 2 9 4}
:SortD(L2)
::::Done
:L2
::::{9 8 6 4 2}

=== Fill( ===

This function ('''2nd LIST OPS 4''') changes the specified list variable by replacing each element with the same value.

This function will not work on a list given with curly brackets. The parameter in the parentheses must be a list name. The previous items are no longer available. Filling does not create a new list.

:{2,7,4,5} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 7 4 5}
:Fill(-3,L1)
::::Done
:L1
::::{-3 -3 -3 -3}

You can start with all zeros.

:5 STO&gt; dim(L3)
::::5
:L3
::::{0 0 0 0 0}
:Fill(4,L3)
::::Done
:L3
::::{4 4 4 4 4}

== Functions that create new lists ==

The functions in this section create a new list.  The new list is available in the Answer variable.  If the list will be used later it should be stored in a list variable.

=== seq( ===

The sequence function ('''2nd LIST OPS 5''') creates a list based on an expression and a range of values for the variable in the expression.

The first example makes a list based on 3x + 5, where x takes on the values from 1 through 6.

:seq(2X+3,X,1,6)
::::{5 7 9 11 13 15}

Notice that the first parameter is the expression.  The second parameter is the variable that assumes the range of values.  The third and fourth parameters are the beginning and ending values for the range.  The numbers in the range can be incremented by an amount other than 1, by using an optional fifth parameter.

There are several ways to create the same list as in the first example.  Since the expression is linear, the range can be used to produce it.

:seq(N,N,5,15,2)
::::{5 7 9 11 13 15}

The expression can contain any mathematical calculation, and the parameters for the range can be negative or decimals.

:seq(round(sin(&amp;theta;),2),&amp;theta;,-0.7,&amp;pi;/8,0.3)
::::{-.64 -.39 -.1 .2}

Since this function creates a new list, if you want do something else with it, you must either use '''Ans''' or '''STO&gt;''' it to a list variable.

We can do the first example again in several steps.

:seq(J,J,1,6)
::::{1 2 3 4 5 6}
:Ans * 2
::::{2 4 6 8 10 12}
:Ans + 3
::::{5 7 9 11 13 15}

Here's another example that stores the non-rounded list:

:seq(1/R,R,1,6) STO&gt; L1
::::(1 .5 .33333333...
:round(L1,2)
::::{1 .5 .33 .25 .2 .17}

=== cumSum( ===

The cumulative sum function ('''2nd LIST OPS 6''') adds up the items in the list and creates a new list with the partial sums.  The first item in the new list is the same as the first item in the original list.  The second item in the new list is the sum of the first two items in the original list.  The third item in the new list is the sum of the first three items in the original list.  And so on.  The last item in the new list is the sum of the entire original list.

:cumSum({1,2,3,4,5,6})
::::{1 3 6 10 15 21}
:cumSum(Ans) STO&gt; L1
::::{1 4 10 20 35 56}

Once again, if the new list is to be used rather than just observed, it must be stored, or used immediately from the Ans variable.

=== &amp;Delta;List( ===

The list difference function ('''2nd LIST OPS 7''') subtracts adjacent list items and forms a list of the differences.  This new list will be one item shorter than the original.

:L1
::::{1 4 10 20 35 56}
:&amp;Delta;List(L1)
::::{3 6 10 15 21}
:&amp;Delta;List(Ans)
::::{3 4 5 6}
:&amp;Delta;List(Ans)
::::{1 1 1}
:&amp;Delta;List(Ans)
::::{0 0}

Using this function on a list with only one element will result in an error.

=== augment( ===

The list connecting function ('''2nd LIST OPS 9''') has two list parameters.  The result is a list with the two lists connected together.

:{1,2 3} STO&gt; L1
::::{1 2 3}
:{6,7,8,9} STO&gt; L2
::::{6 7 8 9}
:augment(L1,L2)
::::{1 2 3 6 7 8 9)
:augment(L2,L1)
::::{6 7 8 9 1 2 3}
:augment({10,14,8},L1)
::::{10 14 8 1 2 3}
:augment(Ans,{5,1,7}) STO&gt; L3
::::{10 14 8 1 2 3 5 1 7}

The new list must be stored if it is to be used later.

:SortA(L3)
::::Done
:L3
::::{1 1 2 3 5 7 8 10 14}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Green&quot; Roofs==
&quot;Green roofs&quot; refers to growing plants on the top of roofs of buildings. There are several different methods for implementing green roofs. Green roofs have been wide spread in Europe and especially in Germany. Now the concept of green roofs is starting to spread in the USA. Egypt has started a green roofs initiative as well but uses a different method for implementing green roofs.

===Benefits===
; Space Efficiency
: Except from keeping rain and sun off a building's occupants, roof space is essentially wasted.  Green roofing makes use of this wasted space.
; Air purification
: Plants absorb pollution from the air.  Growing plants on the roof of a building contributes to improved air quality in the surrounding city.  Obviously, green roofing will have a larger effect on air quality if it is employed in a widespread manner.
; Aesthetic appeal
: Even urban humans generally retain an aesthetic appreciation for being surrounded by plants.  Green roofs can add a serene communal space to a building.
; Food supply
: Green roofing can be used as a source of vegetables and other edible plants.

There are several schools of thought on how to train dogs, ranging from what are often termed &quot;Traditional&quot; methods, based largely on avoidance or escape, to &quot;Positive-Only&quot; methods, such as Clicker Training. All of these methods when properly applied can be used to train most dogs to be tractable companions.  

This project is aimed at '''novice''' and '''intermediately''' experienced dog owners. This book is about the basic training all dogs will need to have, for example to pass a Canine Good Citizen (CGC) or other similar certification. The training methods recommended in this book should be safe enough that a novice dog owner won't be in danger of harming a dog by following the instructions (or vice versa).

Additional topics in dog training include

* [[Dog Care/Training/Gun Training|Gun training]]
* General dog care
* Electrical, prong, choke collars, gentle leaders
* [[Dog Care/Training/Clicker training|Clicker training]]

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so. I'm also not sure what the best way to organize the chapters is yet. Please feel free to rearrange the sections if it makes more sense to you.

== What is dog training? ==
The key to successful dog training is communication. Dogs don't speak our language so we have to use a language they do understand.

== Set your dog up to succeed... or to fail?==

There are three stages to dog training. Motivational, correction and distraction (or 'proofing'). In the motivational stage, you will set your dog up to succeed, giving it short training sessions and big rewards in a quiet environment and with plenty of encouragement. For example, Sit. You will lure your dog, click, treat, big smile, excitement and if your dog slips, you shrug it off and do it all over again. 

Come the correction stage. Positive Reinforcement trainers view not getting the reward as a correction. They also teach a &quot;no reward marker&quot;, a word or sound such as &quot;oops&quot; or &quot;uh uh&quot; to signal the dog that no reward is coming and pick a new behavior. You're sure your dog knows Sit already. It does it even before the lure comes and you're very pleased. Now you try a 2 second stay without a lure. Your dog does it. You're pretty excited and the dog can feel it too as you dump a big reward on it. Next is a 5 second stay. Your dog slips. You give your no reward marker and help the dog figure out what is expected.  Your dog learns to choose, correctly  = reward, wrongly = correction, or no reward. The dog might get another correction but then it learns, a lightbulb goes up in its head, it has chosen the right path and gets the reward it has been waiting for all along. Using common sense, it is better if you are told what's wrong rather th
an be given little hints that aren't straight-forward.

Training should be done in increments. The biggest mistake novice trainers make is to move too fast. The dog has the mental capacity of the average 2 year old human child. They are sponges, but can only absorb so much at a sitting. Distractions should also be increased slowly. At first, you teach your dog a command, such as &quot;Sit&quot;, in its own house. As the dog masters this, you start moving the dog to places with more distractions, the back yard, the front yard, the sidewalk in front of the house, etc. 

There are certain common sense rules: when teaching stays, &quot;with time comes distance&quot;. Teach your dog to stay while you are close to your dog and can keep him/her in the stay position, before you disappear around the corner. Once your dog learns to stay with you there for 5 minutes, putting that leash down and walking away is a piece of cake.

Also, never call your dog to you and punish him/her. If your dog escapes, after you have panicked, chased him around, screamed yourself senseless, etc. When your dog is finally back to you, YOU CANNOT PUNISH HER. She is incapable of understanding she is being punished for running away. She only knows when she got back to you, bad things happened to her and next time, she won't come back at all.

This indicates a huge problem with your relationship with your dog, and says your dog is not interested in being with you. Perhaps the dog hasn't been trained, or has fear issues, but you need to go back to square one and train your dog.



== Food Lures ==

Luring with food is a very natural way to show the dog what you'd like it to do. Dogs generally will follow your hand with food. This can be used to teach many commands such as &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. If you've ever wanted to create a cool treat for your doggie, with style AND flavor then try &quot;Doggie Popsicles&quot;
&lt;!--This content merged from [[Transwiki:Doggie popsicles]] --&gt;                 

===Doggie Popsicles===

'''Ingredients'''
* 2 boullion cubes (beef, chicken, any flavor works0

== Discouraging Bad Behavior ==

There are many things dogs do that humans find unacceptable: Jumping up, mouthing, running away, urinating in the house, chewing, etc. The human has the big brain and should be able to manage the dog's environment so the dog doesn't get a chance to practice objectionable behavior. Don't leave shoes where the puppy can find them, teach the dog to &quot;sit&quot; when greeting people, yell &quot;OUCH!!!&quot; loudly when the puppy puts his teeth on you, go out with the puppy to be sure he potties outside and reward him instantly when he potties appropriately. 

Teach your dog to do something that make the objectionable behavior impossible: teaching your dog to touch the palm of your hand with its nose, makes it impossible for the dog to mouth your hand at the same time. So instead of constantly correcting bad behavior, or just yelling &quot;NO!&quot; to your dog, you will learn to be proactive and not give it a chance to misbehave. Everyone is happier that way.

Redirect your dog when the behavior is inappropriate. If your dog is loose at the dog park, for example, and is starting to be rude to other dogs, call your dog and start walking briskly away. Your dog should want to be with you and will come.

=== Ignoring Bad Behavior ===

Sometimes it is best to ignore the bad behavior. Many times people inadvertently reinforce the bad behavior by giving the dog attention. For example, letting a dog inside while it is outside barking teaches the dog to bark to get inside. You are better off to wait until the dog has stopped barking for several minutes before letting it inside. 



=== Distracting ===

Distracting the dog can be a useful tool to reduce the frequency of an undesirable behavior. A small rattle made from a plastic soda bottle, or a can with pennies placed inside can be shaken to distract the dog from repeating the behavior. Most dogs however only require your voice. A well timed 'Hey, quit it!' is very effective. Then ask the dog to do something that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. Instead of jumping up to Counter surf, call the dog to you and play some tug. 

Be very careful using sound distractions, many dogs are sound sensitive and the shaking of the penny can may make your dog skittish. If your dog is sound sensitive, you can create a situation when your dog will learn to mistrust you.



Using Equipment to get control of your dog while you are training.

If you have a dog that pulls or lunges at other dogs barking, it is imperative that you not give your dog the opportunity to practice that behavior. 

''''''Pulling''''''

If your dog just pulls, using something like the Sense-ation or other No pull harness. In this style of harness, the leash is connected in front of the dog's chest, so when the dog pulls, it inhibits should action and stops the pulling. 

If your dog pulls and bark/lunges at other dogs, you need a head halter. There are several types of head halters available and all fit a bit differently from each other. Some of the most popular brands are the Gentle Leader, the Halti, the Comfort Trainer, the Snoot Loop. The basic idea is like the halters used on horses. A person can control a beast weighing over a ton by controlling the head. The same is true for dogs. The strap over the nose is the control. It hits a pressure point that both controls and helps calm the dog. 

Another piece of equipment that can help with control is a prong, or pinch collar. Contrary to some myths, this is not designed to dig into the dog's neck or puncture the dog. If there is blood, the human is not only using the equipment wrong, but is guilty of abusing the dog. The prong should only be used as a last resort, after other alternatives have been exhausted. It can be an effective tool for dedicated pullers, but it is not recommended for dogs that lunge/bark. The tightening of the prongs on the dog's neck as it is looking at the dog it is lungeing at, can increase aggression.

=== Boobie-traps ===

Boobie-traps are items that will surprise a dog by making a loud noise when tripped or knocked over. They have a big advantage in that you don't have to be right there in order to correct the dog. This prevents the dog from associating you with the correction and allow for consistent correction even when you are out of the dogs sight.  The effectiveness of these traps depends on the dog; some dogs are very calm and won't care that something fell, while others will learn on the first try and never trip the trap again. As always, use good judgment when formulating a trap.  Do not cause harm to the dog, or cause an overconfident dog to get too scared.

Again, this can cause a lot of sound sensitivity. Management is the first defense. Pick up the shoes, keep food of off the counters, put the trash under the sink, etc.

'''Boobie-traps for use while training dogs can be made from various items:'''

Some traps can easily be produced from items found around the house.  An object balanced on the edge of a counter may fall and frighten the dog when the dog sniffs at it.  This is useful to deter a dog from patrolling the counter for food.
*A 12 oz. soda can with several coins inside will make a lot of noise when it falls. 
{{TODO|todonote=add picture of can on windowsill}}
*A small tuna can with water will splash the dog when it is tipped. (Of course, this is only useful if getting some water on the floor is acceptable.)
{{TODO|todonote=add picture of tuna can with water on it on edge of counter}}

Some alarm systems to deter a dog from unwanted behavior can be purchased at your local pet store.
*Motion alarms
*trash can lid alarms

== Walking on a Leash ==
Walking a dog gives it exercise to help it remain healthy.  It is also an easy way for the person walking the dog to get a little exercise.  A dog will enjoy being walked because it will be able to explore and see new things.  A dog being walked can often be distracted by things like cars, strange noises, objects, plants, other people, or other dogs, so the person walking the dog will want to keep a good hold on the leash.  Walking on a leash requires a collar and a leash, which may be purchased at a pet store.

It is important to teach a dog &quot;loose leash walking&quot;.  This involves teaching the dog not to pull and to walk with you regardless of distractions.  Treats/clicker can be helpful in this task. 

On of the most effective techniques is 'be a tree'. Dogs pull because they want to go somewhere. If you hold the leash tightly against your body, plant your feet and refuse to move forward when the dog pulls, the dog isn't getting what it wants. At some point, the dog will turn to look at you. When the dog looks back, the leash will get slack, you immediately reward the dog by moving in the direction the dog originally wanted to go. If the dog pulls again, stop moving until the dog looks at you.

This is effective because the dog learns that by not pulling, he gets what he wants. The dog is also learning to pay attention to where you are in relation to the end of the leash. This can build your bond and relationship. Let's work together instead of away from each other.

Another technique is reversing direction immediately when the dog begins to pull. This technique is not effective on a determined dog and will often result in the owner being rather dizzy. It works best on young pups as it is virtually painless. 

People often use 'Prong collars' or other devices such as 'Haltis' to discourage and teach the dog how to walk nicely. Never ever use a traditional halter as it only encourages the dog to pull more (think sled dog). However, the Sense-ation, Sense-ible and Easy Walk harnesses are designed to lessen pulling and work very well.

== House Training ==

{{sectstub}}

== Crating ==
Crating is the practice of keeping a puppy or dog in a kennel when you are not at home and at night.  This provides a safe place for the dog and keeps them from being destructive when unsupervised.  This is an excellent way to housebreak a new dog.

{{sectstub}}

==Basic Commands==
Here are a few commands that almost every dog should respond to:
*'''Come''': This command, also referred to as the '''recall''', is crucial.  If the dog won't come when called, it is not an obedient dog.  One method for training begins by allowing the dog to wander out on a long leash or line, then calling it by name and the command '''Come'''.  This method might require a quick, light tug on the leash to get the dog moving when first teaching this command. Like all commands, it is successful only if the dog is rewarded when it completes the command and only if the practice is repeated&amp;mdash;under different circumstances and distances and gradually removing the controls; until the dog performs flawlessly.  
Another good way to train them without reinforcement is to praise them while afar. They will hear this and come to you.  Then, grant them more &quot;good dog!&quot; and such.  
*'''Sit''': This command is also crucial.  Sitting dogs are under the handler's direct control.  It is common to precede other commands, such as the '''Stay''' command, with a sit command.  One method for training uses a treat held in front of the dog's nose and passed back over its head, forcing the dog to sit.  '''Sit''' and '''Stay''' are used in conjunction with many other commands.  
*'''Stay''': This command gives peace of mind.  An owner can park her dog while doing something else.  One method of training involves placing the dog in a sit or a down position, then telling it to stay while stepping away from the dog.  If the dog stays, the handler rewards it while it is still in the position.  Indoors, use this command to park your dog under a favorite table or bench.   
*'''Lie down''' or '''down''': this command allows even greater control than sitting.  One training method uses a treat drawn forward and down across the dog's face, forcing it to lie down to get at it.  Since even people without dogs are familiar with this command and use it when dogs are bothering them, the better the dog is at it, the better it can get along with strangers and visitors. But don't get discouraged if the dog refuses or is reluctant to drop into position. The Down is a submissive position and often a dominant dog will refuse to give in.  
*'''Go to bed''' or '''get in''': Directs the dog  to go to its bed or its crate and to remain there until released. The dog has freedom of movement in that location to stand up, turn around, or lie down, unlike when placed in a '''Stay'''.  Useful to keep a dog out from underfoot and safe in a busy or complicated situation. Not a necessary command as the dog is taught to 'stay' already while in Down or Sit. Useful for Stand stays though.
*'''Drop''' or '''drop it''': Dogs pick up all sorts of things, some of which they shouldn't have.  A dog that drops anything on command, no matter how attractive (which to a dog can be rotten and smelly), is a dog under control that the owner can prevent from eating dangerous items or from destroying valued personal property.
*'''Leave it''': An adjunct to '''Drop''', directing the dog to not touch an item.  Also useful before the dog has picked anything up.  One method of training involves leaving a treat on the ground and walking the dog past it without allowing the dog to pick it up.  '''Leave it''' is also used in conjunction with '''Take it'''.    
*'''Take it''': The dog leaves a desired object, such as a toy or treat, untouched until given this command.  This can protect an owner's, visitor's, or child's fingers. 
*'''Heel''', '''Close''', '''By me''': The dog walks with its head directly next to the handler's leg and does not deviate until released.  One method of training accompanies the command with a slap to the thigh indicating where the handler wants the dog's head. 
*'''Okay''', '''Free''', '''Break''', or '''Release''':  Releases the dog from '''Stay''', '''Heel''', '''Sit''', and so forth.  Also a general release to play. A clicker acts as a release. 

The specific command word is not important, although the preceding list covers some of the more common words. Short, clear words that are easily understood by other humans are generally recommended;  that way, people will understand what a handler is telling his dog to do and other handlers have a good chance of controlling someone else's dog if necessary.  In fact, dogs can learn commands in any language or other communications medium, including whistles, mouth sounds, hand gestures, and so forth.

== Less Common Commands ==

While dogs can be trained far beyond these rudiments, a dog that obeys these commands will be a pleasure to keep and take out.  Off-leash obedience is the hallmark of a well-trained dog.

There are a few commands that many domestic dogs learn, but that are not part of the basic repertoire.
*'''Stop''' – a dog that will simply stop whatever it is doing and lie down on command no matter how far it is from its keeper is a dog that can be taken anywhere.  Some handlers use the German word '''''Platz''''' (related to &quot;place&quot;, i.e. stay in position) for this action.  (Useful if your dog is in danger, or headed for some trouble. I.e., your dog is about to get run over by a car. He/she hears &quot;Stop!&quot; and drops and you can be sure it will not be hit. Much faster response than a &quot;Come&quot; command.)
*'''Back up''' – keepers of large dogs or dogs with a reputation for aggressiveness can make strangers more comfortable by teaching the dog to back up on command. (Also useful if you are carrying a large box or something and the dog's in your way.)
*'''Growl''' – the inverse of backing up.  Some owners teach non-aggressive dogs to growl on a subtle command – not the word ''growl'', usually a small hand gesture – as a way of letting strangers know that you and your dog value being left alone.  
*'''Steady''' – keep near by.  The dog can walk free, but not dash off.  Train to this command with a long leash, calling out '''Steady''' when the leash is taut.  Continue off leash.
*'''Stand''' – dog stands still.  Train from lying-down position by lifting under belly while repeating command.  Useful for grooming.  Many dogs are groomed frequently and need to stand quietly during the process.
*'''Speak''' – for amusement or showing off, a dog may be trained to bark on command.
*'''Chase Recall''' – 
*'''Paw, or Give Paw''' – Pretty much for showing off, a dog may be trained to give you a &quot;handshake&quot;. (Though it's also very useful if the dog needs to get their nails clipped or they have an injury.)
*'''Shake''' – Very useful after baths, or walks in snow or rain.
*'''Roll Over''' –
*'''Jump''' –
*'''Calm''' – tells the dog to stop growling and/or playing roughly.  Similar to '''Back Up'''.

== Games ==

Games can be fun for both the dog and the owner.

Here are some games that can be played with a dog:

*'''Fetch''' – This is a game where the owner throws out an object and the dog retrieves it and gives it back to the owner.  It can be played with a small ball like a tennis ball, a frisbee, a stick, or any small light object that is easy to throw and easy for the dog to pick up and carry. Large balls can also be used.

*'''Hide and Seek''' – You hide and your dog seeks. It is more difficult but worth attempting to make your dog hide while you seek.

*'''Tug-of-War''' – It should first be noted, that some (perhaps most) experts state that this game can teach or instil aggressive behavior in your dog.  However, most dogs love playing 'Tug-of-War,' and if vigorously participated in by the owner, will allow the dog, especially a younger dog, to use a lot of its extra energy. One rule of the thumb is that you decide when the game ends and you always win. Never let your dog win even if it means pinching your dog's lips against it's teeth to get it to let go. A 'drop it' command is very useful for this.

== Problem Behavior ==

====Chewing====
One of the causes of destructive chewing behavior in younger dogs, as with children, is 'teething.'  A good suggestion, that will allow your dog to relieve it's discomfort, without destroying your home, uses only a used, but clean hand, dish, or other small towel.  

Soak the towel in clean drinking water.  Wring out the excess, until the towel no longer drips.  Tie the towel in a knot, and place in the freezer (you may want to place the towel in a freezer bag to protect other items).  Once frozen it can be given to the dog as a chew toy.

A more expensive but better way is to purchase toys for your dog. The most popular amongst chewers is the Kong toy. Stuffable and challenging to even the most seasoned of veterans. Squeaky toys are noisy but fun to the dog as it mimics an animal that the dog has attacked. Dogs are often observed 'pouncing' on these. 

====Jumping up====

First you have to decide if you want to allow your dog to jump up on people or not.  Then you need to be consistent in enforcing the rules.  Being consistent is the important thing to help your dog learn what is acceptable behavior.  

Even if you decide it's okay, you may encounter other people who don't like it at all.  NOT jumping on people is generally considered good doggie manners.  Once you've made the decision that it will not be allowed you have to train your dog to understand what the rules are.  

To teach a dog not to jump up on you, simply turn your back on the dog when he jumps up.  The dog wants your attention.  When you turn away from him, you give him the message that jumping up on you will not earn your attention.  After a short time (a few seconds) of having you back to the dog, turn back to him and give him another chance to keep his feet on the ground.  If he does stay down, praise or reward him for it.  He may well try to jump up again then, because he hasn't yet learned what is getting him the praise and what is making you go away.  But the dog will figure it out.  Most dogs catch on quickly, after just a few times of ignoring him.  But remember, it will take a while for your dog to really learn what is expected.  So, don't be surprised if the next time he greets you he jumps up.  Just be consistent in letting him know it's not acceptable.  Keep the emotion out of it.  You don't need to scold the dog or correct him.  The fact that he is not getting the desired result from jumping on you will be self correcting to him.  

You should also ask your visitors not to encourage jumping up on people.  You can explain to them that they should turn their back on your dog if he attempts to jump up on them. A good alternative to permitting a dog to jump up on people is to teach him to sit when greeting people.  Only praise and reward your dog when he is sitting.  Turn away if he jumps up, as described above.  He will learn to offer sitting to get the attention he seeks.

====Barking====

====Scratching on doors====

====Begging====
Don't reward your dog for begging. Dogs learn to beg quickly if you drop food even just a few times and even if you dropped the food on accident. Teach it to lay down out of the way while you are eating or cooking. Crating or a stuffed Kong is also recommended. If you can't prevent the dog from getting the food (this is usually the case when small children have the food) it is best to remove the dog from the room while eating. A well timed correction is also another way to deter Begging forever. 

====Chasing Other Small Animals====
Everyone has heard stories about the dog who ate the gerbil, hamster, or even human baby. Try not to let this happen. Correct the dog (via training collar or voice) for attempting to even sniff the animal. It will soon learn to ignore it.

====Aggression====

====Submissiveness====

====Stealing Food====

Once the dog learns it can steal food, it's hard to break it out of the habit. A good way is also corrections, teaching the Leave It and anticipating the dog's action and reacting (verbal correction, taking the food away and turning the dog away, etc.).

====Getting in the Trash====

There are two situations to consider

1) dog gets into trash when you are present (supervising)

It will be helpful to teach your dog a &quot;Leave It&quot; command.  But start by teaching the command in a more controlled situation with a single piece of food. 

2) dog gets into trash when you are NOT there to supervise

Dogs are dogs, they get into trash if it's left out for them when they are unsupervised.  
Put the trash somewhere where your dog cannot get to it.  Or get a trash can that your dog cannot get open.

====Digging====

Best way to avoid this is to occupy the dog's time. Training, toys and walks are excellent ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Meritbadgedisclaimer}} butts of doom

== Merit Badge Requirements ==
'''1) Do THREE of the following:
'''A) Name three types of modern freight trains.  Explain why unit trains are more efficient than mixed fright trains.

Mixed freight trains- contain freight coming from many different origins.  
Unit trains - contain freight all originating from one place,  for instance a refinery, or a chemical plant.  These are more efficient because you don't require all of the time in a rail yard  connecting and disconnecting to attach the required freight.
Intermodal trains- contain flat cars that hold various containers (18 wheeler containers). These are useful in the respect that their freight can be transferred from ship to rail to roads easily.

'''B) Name a Class 1 or regional railroad.  Explain what major cities it serves, the locations of major terminals, service facilities, and crew change points, and the major commodities it carries.

''Class I Railroad: There are four primary Class I Railroads in the United States: '''Union Pacific''', '''BNSF''', '''Norfolk &amp; Southern''', and '''CSX'''. The Union Pacific and BNSF primarily operate west of Chicago and the Mississippi River, while the Norfolk Southern and CSX mainly operate east of Chicago and the Mississippi.

'''BNSF Railway''' - The BNSF Railway (AAR reporting mark BNSF), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the largest railroad networks in North America (only one competitor, the Union Pacific Railroad, is comparable in size).

The BNSF Railway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, the holding company formed by the September 22, 1995 merger of Burlington Northern, Incorporated and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. According to corporate press releases, the BNSF Railway is among the top transporters of intermodal traffic in North America, and moves more grain than any other American railroad. It also hauls enough coal to generate roughly 10% of the electricity produced in the United States.

Largest Intermodal Facilities (2004 Volume):

Lifts Hobart Yard (LosAngeles, California) 1,318,000 Lifts

Corwith Yard (Chicago, Illinois) 744,000 Lifts

Willow Springs (Illinois) 724,000 Lifts

Alliance (Fort Worth, Texas)561,000

SanBernardino(California)557,000

Cicero(Illinois)502,000

Argentine(KansasCity,Kansas)305,000

LogisticsParkChicago(Illinois)275,000


The '''Union Pacific''' is headquartered in Omaha, NE, and is the largest railroad in North America following a series of mergers between the mid 1980's and 1990's: Chicago North Western ('''CNW'''), Denver Rio Grande &amp; Western (DRGW), Southern Pacific (SP), and Missouri Pacific (MP). It serves most states west of the Mississippi River, as well as Illinois and Wisconsin.

'''CSX''' Transportation is headquartered in Jacksonville, FL, and is the largest railroad east of the Mississippi, serving most states east of the Mississippi River and part of Canada. CSX came about as the result of a 1980 merger between the Seaboard Coast Lines and the Chessie System. SCL was formed as the result of several mergers between the Atlantic Coast Line, Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Likewise, the Chessie System was a combination of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, and the Western Maryland Railway.

'''Norfolk Southern''' is headquartered in Norfolk, VA, and came about from the 1982 merger of the Norfolk and Western Railroad and the Southern Railroad. It serves most states east of the Mississippi River and part of Canada.

Kansas City Southern is headquartered in Kansas City, MO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I have an idea for a small, simple program that would help many.  Some people like to erase their Google usenet histories, but it is time consuming to look up every message you've ever posted and code in each &lt;Message ID&gt; into their &quot;automatic&quot; removal tool here:

http://services.google.com:8882/urlconsole/controller?cmd=reload&amp;lastcmd=login

Is there anyway to write a program that searches for all messages by your e-mail address, compiles a list of message IDs, then feeds that list into Google's tool?  

I think a lot of people would use this.  What language would you use to code this?

Thanks!

Metallic bonds occur among metal atoms.  Whereas ionic bonds join metals to non-metals, ''metallic bonding joins a bulk of metal atoms''.  A sheet of aluminum foil and a copper wire are both places where you can see metallic bonding in action.

[[Image:Electrona in crystallo fluentia.svg|thumb|The &quot;sea of electrons&quot; is free to flow about the crystal of positive metal ions.]]
When metallic bonds form, the s and p electrons '''delocalize'''.  Instead of orbiting their atoms, they form a &quot;sea of electrons&quot; surrounding the positive metal ions.  The electrons are free to move throughout the resulting network.  The delocalized nature of the electrons explains a number of unique characteristics of metals:
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
| ''Metals are good conductors of electricity''
| The sea of electrons is free to flow, allowing electrical currents.
|-
| ''Metals are ductile (able to draw into wires)&lt;br&gt;and malleable (able to be hammered into thin sheets)''
| As the metal is deformed, local bonds are broken but quickly reformed in a new position.
|-
| ''Metals are gray and shiny''
| Photons (particles of light) cannot penetrate the metal, so they bounce off the sea of electrons.
|-
| ''Gold is yellow and copper is reddish-brown''
| There is actually an upper limit to the frequency that is reflected.  It is too high to be visible in most metals, but not gold and copper.
|-
| ''Metals have very high melting and boiling points''
| Metallic bonding is very strong, so the atoms are reluctant to break apart into a liquid or gas.
|}

Metallic bonds can occur between different elements.  A mixture of two or more metals is called an '''alloy'''.  Depending on the size of the atoms being mixed, there are two different kinds of alloys that can form:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:AlloySubstitutional.png|Substitutional alloy
Image:AlloyInterstitial.png|Interstitial alloy
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The resulting mixture will have a combination of the properties of both metals involved.

 |description=These books deal with the '''[[w:C (programming language)|C programming language]]''': one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages. C is widely used on many different software platforms, and there are few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. It has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]], which originally began as an extension to C.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Glossary of terms'''

Albedo	

; Ambient color
: The overall color of an object. When rendering scene ambiance is multiplied by face ambiance.

Ambient light

; Attenuation
: The intensity of a light through the scene as it diminishes with distance from the source.

; Backface
: The interior side of a face on a solid object.

; Bezier 
: A mathematically defined curve formed by the placement of control points.

Bevel

Bevel smoothing

; Binaries
: Machine readable files created by compiling source code.

; Body
: A 3D object composed of vertices, edges, and faces.

; Bounding box 
: Generally, the minimum volume that can contain a selection. However, a single vertex bounding box is 0 and a single edge bounding box is two dimensional.

; Box modeling 
: A commmon term for the type of polygon modelling used in Wings3D.

; Central edge loop
: A set of edges that completely encircles a model on one of the primary axes, usually the Z axis, for example as the center line of a head.

; Chart packing
: This is the last step that happens before the AutoUV window appears, i.e. each 2d chart is placed somewhere on texture.

; Control Cage
: The model in shaded wireframe mode prior to any smoothing operation.

Crease

; Crease angle
: The angle between two faces that share an edge.

Diffusion

; Diffuse color
: The overall color of a surface absent any highlights, like a matte surface.

; Display Mode
: The way a model appears on the screen, solid shaded, smooth shaded, or wireframe.

; Dolly
: Moving the camera in and out towards or away from the model; i.e. zooming.

; Edge
: The boundary between two faces having exactly two vertices; the line joining two vertices together.

; Edge Loop
: A set of edges that connect at vertices with 4 way intersections.

; Edge Rings
: The lateral edges that run between two adjacent edge loops.

; Element
: A graphic element in the scene that can be selected; a vertex, edge, face, body, or a light are all elements of a scene.

; Emission
: A color setting that affect the overall self illumination of the object.

; Face
: An element of an object consisting of a set of interconnected edges.

; Facet subdivision
: Breaking down a component of two dimensions (i.e. a face) into more and more faceted surfaces (faces) without doing any smoothing.

; GNU GPL
: GNU General Public License, one of the most popular OpenSource licensing agreements. GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix.

; Ground plane
: Usually an imaginary plane used as the horizontal reference plane.

; GUI
: Graphic User Interface.

; Linear
: A light setting, which causes the light to fall off in a linear manner.

Lumen

Luminance

Luminosity

; Material
: The underlying surface properties of an object or faces on an object. A material is different than a color or a texture. Color is but one component of a material and can be applied to vertices as well, and textures can be applied over a material.

Matte

Matte surface

; Mesh
: A 3D object composed of interconnected faces, usually composed of triangles, quads and n-gons.

; Metaform Subdivision
: A subdivision method which shows the smoothed model with the unsmoothed cage floating about it.

; N-gon
: A face with more than 4 sides.

; Normal
: A vector that extends outward perpendicular to a graphic element.

NURBS

; NURBS curve
: Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines; a mathematically defined curve of infinite resolution.

; Object
: A self contained solid body composed of vertices, edges, and faces also known as a body.

; Opacity
: The level of transparency for a face as set in the Material Editor.

Orbit

; Organic model
: A model of non-manufactured item, such as living (organic) things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome to Wikibooks==

I'm sorry that your first experience on trying to write on Wikibooks happened with an almost immediate deletion of what you wrote.  You should have had at least a warning first, and a lot more patience toward what you wrote.

Still, I would strongly recommend that you review [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for more information about our project here.  Your Wikibook, [[The Ultimate Chance]], does seem like a get rick quick scheme and something that we generally try to keep off of Wikibooks in general.  Most business books in general seem to give us some sort of difficulty as the presentation of the idea is often difficult to seperate from a specific set of services.

I tend to be a champion of lost causes, but I want to encourage you to continue to contribute here on Wikibooks.  We need people from as wide of a variety of backgrounds as we can, and I hope that you can find a place to help improve this project as a whole.  There will be some criticisms of what you write here, and I promise that if you take the critcisms to heart as suggestions for improvement, you will become a much better writer and be able to present your idea in a much more clear fashion that will make your ideas stand on their own.  You may also be able to find other people who are interested in the same things that you are interested in.

If there is anything I can do to help you out, please drop me a note on my user talk page:  [[User talk:Robert Horning]]  That will get my attention faster than doing just about anything else.  Dropping an e-mail my way through [[Special:Emailuser/Robert_Horning]] will also bring something to my attention, if you want to say something to me in private.  I am one of the administrators here on Wikibooks, and have been here long enough that many of the participants will at least listen carefully to suggestions I make here. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Dev 2.JPG]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Dev 2.JPG]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well.

Insert &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|GFDL-self}}&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|PD-self}}&lt;/tt&gt; to all of your images and the problem will be solved. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== [[The Ultimate Chance]] ==

I wanted to let you know that I've nominated '''The Ultimate Chance''' as a [[WB:VfD|Vote for Deletion]] candidate.  What this means is that I believe that there are problems with the content in this Wikibook which are against project policy due to the nature of this content.  This should not be seen as something explicitly being against you as an individual, nor are we trying to say that your ideas that have been presented here are wrong.

Keep in mind that we are trying to create a collection of textbooks that can be used in academic settings.  There are a number of policies [[WB:WIW|that can be found here]] which have been developed over time to try and focus content here, and to keep this website from becoming a more general web content hosting service.

Please, if you want to defend keeping this content on Wikibooks, voice your opinions and state the reason why you think this content ought to remain on Wikibooks.  Or perhaps use this as an opportunity to learn about how to turn this page into something that could be much more useful and easier to read.  And to understand why we do what it is that we do here on this website.

If for some reason you come back to Wikibooks and find out that this book has been deleted before you had a chance to voice objections, you are also free to make a request on [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] requesting that this content be restored.  Decisions about removing content from Wikibooks has been reversed in the past, and for awhile content which is deleted can be restored... even though it may not be visible from the project by a general Wikibooks user.

Please, if you can, try to keep contributing your ideas to Wikibooks.  We are glad that you are here, and are grateful for those contributions you have already made to this project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:59, 22 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Forking Wikipedia ==

Comment from [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]: [[Overcoming Procrastination]] started out as a copy of [[Wikipedia:Procrastination]]. Wikipedia was not credited, so it was an obvious violation of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. Also, as a fork of a Wikipedia article, it was against [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]. Thus, I and other users voted to delete it.

However, Wikipedia decided to remove much of the content from its Procrastination article. Thus, I now recopy the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Procrastination&amp;oldid=42842587 last Wikipedia version] before removal from Wikipedia. ''This means that I discarded the old version at Wikibooks instead of doing a merge.'' (There was not anything substantial to merge.) As [[Overcoming Procrastination]] is now an expansion of the Wikipedia article, the reason for its deletion is obsolete, so I removed the {{tl|vfd}} tag.

In the coming days, I hope to split this book into subpages, add Authors and History pages (to replace the temporary History section at the top of the book now), provide a PDF version, and remove remnants of Wikipedia. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

Found this in the wikipedia article.  Doesn't fit there, but it might fit there.  Cheers.--[[User:P-Chan|P-Chan]] 17:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

* Realizing that brain is a complex system and its architecture is a factor contributing to difficulty associated with overcoming procrastination. Concepts like &quot;it's because you are lazy, there's nothing more to it&quot; indicate misunderstanding of the underlying issue, still they are common in population (and prevent success in dealing with procrastination).
* Identifying procrastination as a systematic factor in one's life causing problems. Imagining life without procrastination and identifying possible positive benefits of overcoming procrastination. Decision to begin working systematically on overcoming procrastination to get into the advanced &quot;level&quot; of life.
* Distinguishing clearly between &quot;I know&quot;, &quot;I want&quot;, and &quot;I enjoy&quot;.
* Stopping thinking in terms of &quot;I must&quot; and starting thinking in terms of &quot;I want to&quot;. For example no one has to complete a university exam. The student has always a free choice whether to complete an exam or not. However if the exam is not completed, the student gets kicked out of the university. Because he wants to complete the university, he actually wants to complete the exam.
* Identifying truly and realistically individual problems caused by procrastination.
* Proposing a solution to these problems and identifying a &quot;theoretically optimum&quot; behaviour.
* Establishing a TODO list mechanism (a software or a notepad) and considering the act of scratching over a completed entry a magic ritual indicating success in overcoming procrastination.
* Writing things into TODO list as soon as they come into mind and then freeing mind from them.
* Breaking down difficult complicated tasks in the TODO list into smaller, easier units.
* Abstaining from perfectionism.
* Defining two formal states of person: &quot;behaving optimally&quot; and &quot;procrastinating&quot;. Mentally associating positive outcomes with the &quot;behaving optimally&quot; state and negative outcomes and problems with the &quot;procrastinating&quot; state. Then, in course of day, spotting the transition from the &quot;behaving optimally&quot; into &quot;procrastinating&quot; state and asking oneself, if he wishes to continue remaining in the &quot;procrastinating&quot; state despite all the problems associated with this state and all the pleasurable things associated with the &quot;behaving optimally&quot; state.
* Systematically scheduling pleasurable activities in certain reasonable ratio into the activity stream. This makes sure that after completion of a boring activity, a pleasurable one will eventually come, and motivates the person to complete the boring activity.

Let's build a simple Haskell application, i.e. a piece of standalone software.

== The Main module ==

The basic requirement behind this is to have a module '''Main''' with an entry point called '''main''' and of type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 -- thingamie.hs
 module Main where

 main = putStrLn &quot;Bonjour, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We already know how to load this into GHCi, but here's how we compile it and then run it independently:

&lt;pre&gt;
 $ ghc --make -o bonjourWorld thingamie.hs
 $ ./bonjourWorld
 Bonjour, world!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Voilà! You now have a standalone application built in Haskell.

== Other modules ==

Most programs grow to be complicated enough to split across different files. Here is a toy example of an application which uses two modules.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- hello.hs
module Hello where

hello = &quot;Bonjour, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- thingamie.hs
module Main where

import Hello

main = putStrLn hello
&lt;/source&gt;

We can compile this fancy new program in the same way as before. Note that the --make flag to ghc is rather handy because it tells ghc to automatically detect dependencies in the files you are compiling.  That is, since thingamie.hs imports a module 'Hello', ghc will search the haskell files in the current directory for files that implement Hello and also compile that. If Hello depends on yet other modules, ghc will automatically detect those dependencies as well.

&lt;pre&gt;
 $ ghc --make -o bonjourWorld thingamie.hs
 $ ./bonjourWorld
 Bonjour, world!
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to search in other places for source files (including a nested structure of files and directories), you can add the starting point for the dependency search with the -i flag. This flag takes multiple, colon-separated directory names as its argument.

As a contrived example, the following program has three files all stored in a src/ directory. The directory structure looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
HaskellProgram/
   src/
      Main.hs
      GUI/
           Interface.hs
      Functions/
           Mathematics.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Main module imports its dependencies by searching a path analogous to the module name — so that '''import GUI.Interface''' would search for '''GUI/Interface''' (with the appropriate file extension).

To compile this program from within the HaskellProgram directory, invoke ghc with:

&lt;pre&gt;
 $ ghc --make -isrc -o sillyprog Main.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm also found on IRC from time to time (#wikibooks), under the name TubularBell, should you want to talk to me more directly.

== Your welcome message ==

Thank you for the welcome to wikibooks ([[User talk:Derek Andrews]]). I have added a few pages to the book ([[woodturning]]) and would really appreciate it if you could spare the time to take a look and make sure I am on the right lines before I go too far with this.

There is great online community of woodturners and I hope that between us we can make a wonderful resource for newcomers to our craft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial is intended for users already familiar with Wings 3D commands to some extent.&lt;br&gt;
With the technique demonstrated, a Wings 3D user should be able to able to duplicate items around a center rather quickly.

== Starting point ==
[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_01.jpg]]

Let's say we want to duplicate the twisted column on the right in a circle around the point indicated by the red spot.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Setting up duplication ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_02.jpg]]

First figure out what number of times you want the object to go around the point.&lt;br&gt;
Create a new cylinder with the number of sides set to this number.&lt;br&gt;
To set the number of sides on a cylinder either right click on cylinder or on the adjacent box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You may need to enable advanced menus first in preferences.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Place this cylinder so that its axis passes through the desired centerpoint.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

== Make an extrusion ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_03.jpg]]

Pick a side on the cylinder and extrude it outward by an arbitrary amount.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Loop cut ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_04.jpg]]

Loop cut the extrusion from the cylinder.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Combine ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_05.jpg]]

Select the extruded bit and the object to be duplicated and combine them.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Select interior face ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_06.jpg]]

Hide the cylinder. Select the face on the extruded bit that was facing the cylinder.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Use Put-On ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_07.jpg]]

Without deselecting the face, unhide the cylinder.&lt;br&gt;
Right click on the Put-On command.&lt;br&gt;
Select all visible faces on the cylinder.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Almost there ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_08.jpg]]

After executing the Put-On, you should see all your columns duplicated around the central cylinder.&lt;br&gt;What's this? Something's not quite right. A column is missing.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Select errant object ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_09.jpg]]

Fret not, fellow Wings3D user! There's a sort of bug in the Put-On command that occasionally makes it behave funny.&lt;br&gt;On random occasions it will rotate items being put on.&lt;br&gt;In this case the missing column is spotted poking through the bottom.&lt;br&gt;Clicking on it in body (object) mode will select it and its corresponding extruded bit.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Rotate to fix ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_10.jpg]]

Without deselecting the item from before, click rotate about selection.&lt;br&gt;
Select the face as shown. (It has the blue arrow sticking out of it, if not too clear otherwise.)&lt;br&gt;
Rotate 180°.
&lt;hr&gt;

== Check placement ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_11.jpg]]

Now the &quot;missing&quot; column is rotated into its proper position.&lt;br&gt;
That wasn't so hard to fix, was it?
&lt;hr&gt;

== Discard temporary objects ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_12.jpg]]

Select all the extruded bits in the center in body (object) mode. (All associated columns should select too.) Select separate from the menu. Go back and delete the cylinder and the extruded bits.
&lt;hr&gt;

== End result ==

[[Image:W3d_rdup_tut_13.jpg]]

If completed correctly, you should have columns going around the center.&lt;br&gt;
This technique should be handy for anything that gets repeated in a circle, not just architectural columns. This could be lug nuts on a wheel, decorative stars, spokes, meat grinder spikes, tire treads, etc. Have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Code wrapfloatbox not working ==

For some strange reason, the code in wrapfloatbox gives me a number of errors, of which the most important seems to be:
Missing \begin{document}...
Apparently, something goes wrong with the @ symbol, because in the output the text starts with:
simplerule[2]fs@cfont 12
simplerules@capt@@simplerule s@iftopcapt

I couldn't find a way around it yet, but in any case it would be nice to make the code self-contained. To run that example, people also have to remember to add the package wrapfig to the preamble.

== Text overlapping figures ==

Can we put a section about how to have a transparent figure legend placed over a full page picture, as this is something I really want to be able to do. 

== Errors in Wrapping figures ==

I modified Andy Robert's [http://andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial6/wrapping.tex wrapping.tex] according to instructions on additional parameters of wrapping and it did not work. The image was not wrapped, but sticked out of page. I was using latex + dvipdf because pdflatex had problems with .eps file.

If these examples do not work, perhaps, we should remove them? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:yes, the example you tried didn't work. Now I have fixed everything, improving the article. It should be fine now [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 15:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
:: Thanks! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== PDF's and .tex sources ==

I removed mention of .tex sources at the end of this chapter. I think that everything has already been used here, but if you want to link them again, see http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial6.html. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Aligning Captions ==

The captions under figures always are in the centre of the page, regardless of where the figure is. How can this be changed? --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 03:49, 5 July 2007 (UTC)
: what do you mean exactly? do you want to change the position or the alignment of the captions?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 15:43, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== Footnotes in Floats ==

Quite often one (me as well) would like to have footnotes in captions or in the body of a table. For example to explain the variables or the source of the information.

Two information I've found are:
for tables: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=footintab
for captions: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=ftncapt

The general (but for some reason disliked) solution is to put everything in a minipage. Should we add this to the page?

== placeins ==
We should mention the package placeins [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/placeins.html] somewhere (it &quot;Defines a \FloatBarrier command, beyond which floats may not pass; useful, for example, to ensure all floats for a section appear before the next \section command.&quot;)

== inside floats, \centering is better than \begin{center} ... \end{center} ==
We should mention that somewhere. It's documented at, e.g., [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/4c403107d4719e7e/67c315102e0e6743?lnk=gst&amp;q=centering+or+begin{center}#67c315102e0e6743]: &quot;with the combination of figure and  center you get a doublespacing before and after, whereas the combination of figure and \centering only gives you the spacing from figure.&quot;

== p placement specifier ==
[http://www.hep.manchester.ac.uk/u/jenny/jcwdocs/latex/figures.html]: &quot;...The placement specifier p  lets the figure take up a full page without waiting until the end of the chapter&quot;. Controlling placement of full-page figures is a very annoying problem for the unexperienced users. Clear explanation of [p] in this document would be very useful.

== Subfloats ==

Hey I just wanted to mention that subfig package overrides the definition of captions for the KOMA-Script package. 
Since koma is widely used I thought it should be mentioned here too. 
The remedy to this is to use the '''subfigure''' package, which is much more comprehensive and does not overide the KOMA-Script settings. 
If no body changes this note here, I will edit the main article and add this. Cheers, Oz.

I think that'd be the prober way, Oz. I'm a LaTeX newbie and I got confused since I don't have a '''subfig''' package with '''subfloats''', but a '''subfigure''' package using '''subfigures'''. Otherwise this article is a great resource. Weeeeeeee, Jack. (10:41, 23 March 2010 JackSchnippes)

The ''subfigure'' and ''subfig'' packaged are NOT under current developement anymore so I would suggest to replace subfig to ''caption'' and ''subcaption''
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}{width}
Picture\caption{Text}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

File:Latex example subfig.png&lt;br /&gt;
The shown example picture is quite misleading, as no horizontal spaces between figures are defined in the code itself but are visible in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Special:Contributions/141.19.87.180|141.19.87.180]] ([[User talk:141.19.87.180|discuss]])
:You're right, so I've tweaked the code to match the image as I don't have the source figures.  Also in testing this I noticed that the description in the list below the example didn't seem to be quite right, so I changed it to match the behaviour I can produce here.  It didn't 'feel' quite right anyway given the handling of whitespace elsewhere (just in case there could be a difference in implementation I'm using MikTeX 2.9 on Windows XP.

:::: Thanks again :-) You are right, I might edit on my own.

Changed the subfloat-part according to [[User:Nobelium|Nobelium's]] suggestion. &lt;code&gt;subfig&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;subfigure&lt;/code&gt; are listed as deprecated in the newest (german) version of [ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/german/l2tabu/l2tabu.pdf l2tabu.pdf]. -[[User:Konteki|Konteki]] ([[User talk:Konteki|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Konteki|contribs]]) 10:06, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

: forgotten [width=\textwidth] on include graphics, because \includegraphics takes a picture size way too big by default and the width must be \textwidth because subfigure is basically a minipage environment and thus \textwidth is already a third of the page's \textwidth Otherwise results in overlapping figures with pdflatex (TexLive 2012 Debian).

== the &lt;code&gt;h!&lt;/code&gt; specifier ==

In the examples the &lt;code&gt;h!&lt;/code&gt; specifier is often used but it isn't accepted as a good specifier. I admit that it should be explaned but it should'n be used in the example. The way I learned to use specifiers is:
# make your document without specifiers
# once a chapter is completely written, add the specifier &lt;code&gt;[hb]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[ht]&lt;/code&gt; to the figures that aren't placed like you want.
# if that doesn't help: use the &lt;code&gt;[h]&lt;/code&gt; specifier
# as last option, if it's still not looking good, you can use &lt;code&gt;[h!]&lt;/code&gt;. But if you have to use &lt;code&gt;[h!]&lt;/code&gt; a lot, your document is'n well written and contains to much figures compared to the amount of text.
::That feels like a good approach, but the last comment about the ratio of graphics to text isn't necessarily true - it depends what you're writing, a 3 page paper doesn't give you as much flexibility as a book, for example.

== auto reorder floats ==

IS there a way to have LaTeX automatically reorder my float numbers based on the order that I reference them? i.e. if I move a reference to Figure 2 up above the reference for figure 1, can I set it up so that I don't have to move the figure to get it to become figure 1?

&lt;hr&gt;
Paul - a good use for Put-On, I thought - just thought I'd mention that using Face | Extract &gt; Normal &gt; O (instead of 3, 4) would save user a step. 

I've also come across the bug / issue. Manually selecting all the faces in step 7, except for the one used for extraction / extrusion purposes seemed to give better results than going - Select Face, Select Similar (I) - and getting them all.
I doubt it's a 'proper' solution - just seemed to be better when I tried it.

pp
&lt;hr&gt;
I renamed all the steps involved. It seemed a bit redundant to see the content listed as &quot;1 Step 1&quot;. Hopefully the names are more descriptive in that regard. Yet they still might need further clarification.

== Picture flagged for deletion? ==

Anyone know why one of the pics in this tutorial is flagged for deletion. (Or at least I see that in my messages here. Sorry, haven't logged in in a loong time.) I thought it was a fairly straight forward process to release a screen shot as public domain. Especially one from an open source software with no known usage restrictions. I'm confused.

I am removing the section title &quot;Chinese Checkers Strategy by Darren A. Chilton(http://puzzle.roxr.com). Possibly &quot;Darren A. Chilton&quot; was one of the authors of this page, but I could identify nothing in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_checkers&amp;action=history edit history] with this name. As for http://puzzle.roxr.com, it offers a computer game called &quot;Advanced Chinese Checkers v0.90&quot;, but the download link does not work, so I wonder whether the game actually exists. I am removing the link; if they fix their site and the game works, then someone can add the link again. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:13, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

Reply --[[User:DarrenChilton|DarrenChilton]] 22:47, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
I have now become a member, and I can confirm that I created the original text for this. Obveously in traditional wiki style I added my knowledge as no-one had anything on the strategy of the game. I am dissapointed that all of the editing was never positive, and surprised that there are no good players out there who want to share their knowledge.
If you like you could put it as my strategy on the game in hoping that some grand master might put their strategies too.

Unfortunately the web site was continuously suffering from download problems, and indeed www.roxr.com have closed, so my web site is no more.
My game does exist, it is free, but I have no website to host it yet.

Since external links are better at the bottom of the page like : author game which lead to this wiki page (link...); I would like to be able to offer my game that I developped in my spare time to those who liked my rules of good playing, so that they can see them brought to life.

== Chinese Checkers play strategy ==


My name is Elaine, and I have been playing chinese checkers with different folks for 30 years.  There is nothing wrong with Darren Chilton's strategy guide.  Of course, I have other opening strategies, but the information he presented is the best of the basic best.

--Reply-- With so much experience you could put some of your strategies? --[[User:DarrenChilton|DarrenChilton]] 17:34, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

Not a proper greeting I realize, but one is in store.  I think that I should be clear.  On Wiki, we are serious, but just like anything in life, there is room for fun.  I don't know what you may think of Wikipedia or Wikibooks, but I hope you like it.  It really isn't hard to find your way around here, but if you have any questions, come to [[user:pampaeditor|my site]] and leave a comment on the discussion page.

      <comment>[[Dog Care:Heartworms]] moved to [[Dog Care/Heartworms]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heartworm''' is a parasitic roundworm (''Dirofilaria immitis'') that is spread from host to host through the bites of mosquitoes. The heartworm affects dogs, cats, wolves, coyotes, foxes, and some other animals, such as ferrets, sea lions, and even humans, but it is unusual for humans to become infected. The parasitic worm is called a &quot;heartworm&quot; because the parasite, in the final reproductive stage of its life cycle, resides in the heart of its host where it can stay for many years, until it kills its host through congestive failure of the heart.

==Prevention==

Prevention of heartworm infection can be obtained through a number of veterinary drugs. Most popular are [[w:ivermectin|ivermectin]] (sold under the brand name ''[[w:Heartgard|Heartgard]]''), [[w:milbmycin|milbmycin]] (''[[w:Interceptor|Interceptor]]'') and moxidectin (''[[w:ProHeart|ProHeart]]'') administered as pills or chewable tablets. These drugs are given monthly during the local mosquito season. Moxidectin is also available in a six-month sustained release injection administered by veterinarians, but the injectable form of Moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns. [[w:Selamectin|Selamectin]] (''Revolution''), on the other hand, is a topical preventive that is likewise administered monthly. Some of these drugs also kill other parasites, including [[intestinal worm]]s. In addition, Selamectin controls [[flea]]s, [[tick (biology)|tick]]s, and [[mite]]s. 

Preventative drugs are highly effective, and when regularly administered will protect more than 99 percent of dogs from infection. Most failures of protection result from irregular and infrequent administration of the drug. However, the monthly preventives all have a reasonable margin for error in their administration such that if a single month's dose is accidentally missed, adequate protection is usually provided so long as the next two monthly doses are administered on schedule.  

Monthly heartworm prevention should be administered beginning within a month of the onset of the local mosquito season and continued for a month after the cessation of local mosquito activity. In warm climates, such as the warm temperate climate along the immediate Gulf coast of the United States and in tropical and subtropical regions, heartworm prevention must be administered year round. Some authorities recommend year round administration even in colder climates on the theory that mosquito activity may occur during the occasional unseasonable warm spell, but others argue that computer models indicate heartworm transmission is highly unlikely under such circumstances.

==Symptoms of infestation==

Dogs show no indication of heartworm infestation during the 6 month long prepatent period prior to the worms' maturation, and current diagnostic tests for the presence of microfilariae or [[antigen]]s cannot detect prepatent infections. Rarely, migrating heartworm larvae get &quot;lost&quot; and end up in unusual sites such as the eye, brain, or an artery in the leg, which results in unusual symptoms such as blindness, [[seizure]]s and [[lameness]]. 

Many dogs will show little or no sign of infection even after the heartworms have matured. To some degree these dogs may be described as seeming to age slightly faster than normal as the worms slowly damage the lungs, [[kidney]]s and [[liver]]. These animals usually have a light infection and live a fairly sedentary lifestyle. However, active dogs and those with heavier infections will quickly show the classic symptoms of heartworm disease. Early symptoms include a cough, especially on exercise, and early exhaustion upon exercise. More advanced cases progress to severe weight loss, [[fainting]], coughing up blood, and, finally, congestive heart failure.

==Testing==

Heartworms can be detected by [[blood test]]. The filtration test finds [[microfilariae]] in the blood; the occult tests ([[antigen]] and [[antibody]]) are used to detect adult worms. Many [[veterinarian]]s prefer to do both tests, since the absence of microfilariae in the blood does not necessarily mean that there are no adult worms in the heart. Both tests are done with a single blood draw, preferably in the early spring before daily temperatures warm above 57&amp;deg; F.

[[X-ray]] radiographs and, to a lesser extent, [[ultrasound]] can also detect the presence of adult heartworms in the heart and lungs. X-rays also can provide a good estimate of the amount of lung damage caused by the presence of heartworms.

==Treatment==

If either a blood test or the onset of symptoms betray the presence of heartworms, treatment is indicated. Treatment is highly efficacious if the disease is caught early in the disease process. Before the worms can be treated, however, the dog must be evaluated for good heart, liver, and kidney function to ensure the animal can survive the treatment. Any insufficiencies in these organs must be dealt with first, before treatment, as the eradication process can be taxing on organ function. Usually the adult worms are killed with an [[arsenic]]-based compound. The currently recommended compound, [[Melarsomine dihydrochloride]], is marketed under the brand name ''[[Immiticide]]''. It has a greater efficacy and fewer side effects than previous formulation ([[Thiacetarsamide sodium]], sold as ''[[Caparsolate]]'') which makes it a safer alternative for dogs with late-stage infestations.

After treatment, the dog must rest (restricted exercise) for several weeks so as to give its body sufficient time to absorb the dead worms without ill effect. Otherwise, when the dog is under exertion, dead worms may break loose and travel to the lungs, potentially causing [[respiratory failure]] and death.

The course of treatment is not completed until several weeks later when the microfilariae are dealt with in a separate course of treatment. Once heartworm tests come back negative, the treatment is considered a success.

Surgical removal of the adult heartworms is also a treatment that may be indicated, especially in advanced cases with substantial heart involvement.

Long term monthly administration of [[ivermectin]] (but apparently not [[moxidectin]], [[milbemycin]] or [[selamectin]]) year round for at least three years at the dose normally used for heartworm prevention (see &quot;[[Heartworm#Prevention|Prevention]]&quot;) also removes most adult heartworms from most dogs. However, this is not the treatment of choice for removal of adult heartworms for two reasons. First, not all dogs are completely cleared of heartworms by this treatment. More importantly, adult heartworms do not begin to die until some 18 months of treatment have elapsed, which is not acceptable under most circumstances. This treatment is normally reserved for dogs that are not likely to tolerate treatment with the harsher, but more effective, melarsomine or instances where the owner cannot afford the more expensive melarsomine treatment.

From time to time various &quot;[[homeopathic]],&quot; &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;[[organic]]&quot; products are touted as cures or preventives for heartworm disease. However, such products have never been proven effective by rigorous scientific methods, and the claims should be viewed with skepticism.

      <comment>Again, a more scholarly tone, and inclusion of detail for the High Churches.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout Christian history, the topic of how or when a believer in Jesus as the Risen Christ becomes a Christian has been debated, and the debate continues into the modern era. Honestly, the debate is based on the divide between the High Churches (those which are highly ritualized, like the Catholic and Orthodox Churches) and Low Churches (those that are highly informal, like the Baptists, Pentecostals, and the several &quot;Free&quot;/&quot;Non-Denominational&quot; Churches), and it is centered on whether simply holding the belief inside one's heart and acting as a Christian (which includes &quot;confession&quot; of Jesus as Lord and Savior), is enough to enter the community of believers, or whether the convert should be entered into the community only after receiving certain rituals, like Baptism and First Communion. And the major problem in resolving the issue is that both sides have scripture that supports their position.

At the end of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus gives us two commandments beyond that of always act in love in all ways. He first tells his disciples to share the Communion meal, and then, in Mat 28, commissions them to &quot;Go forth and baptize all nations in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.&quot; Along with many passages in the letter of James and elsewhere, this is the Scripture that the High Church uses to justify their position. The Low Church, by contrast, prefers to use the scriptures which suggest a more free-form version, such as those in Acts or Paul's letters, in which all that is necessary to be admitted into Christian community is right belief.

In any case, all Christian denominations do celebrate the sacrament of Baptism, the ritual for which always begins with a reading of Scripture, followed by a profession of faith (in the High Churches, this is done by a short responsory to the Apostle's Creed), the immersion or imposition of water, and finally the anointing of the newly baptized.</text>

{{stub}}

The process that made you an administrator on the MediaWiki project that you are working on has made you one of the most visible members of that community.  Either you are starting out a brand new project, or you have been elected from your peers to take a larger role in moderating discussion.

== Becoming an Administrator ==

=== Starting a Completely New Project ===

If you have decided to take the path of starting a completely new project from scratch, as the founding member you are usually given administrator rights to get things going right away, and often even more.  This founding user is by definition the older person on the project.

Other sections of this book will deal with how to get a project to grow, especially just simply trying to get something started at all, but it is important to remember the implications of your position as the founder of a project.  Generally your opinion is going to be strongly considered, and you have available to you the ability to take drastic steps in controlling the community... particularly if you also have direct access to the physical computer equipment that is running the project.

Keep in mind that most people will have a sort of reverence toward the founder, even if the founder decides to go into semi-retirement and leave the main organization of the community to other people.  This is deserved in part because any on-line community only gets to where it is at because of the efforts of this founder.  It takes quite a bit of effort to get something going in the first place, and with enough different websites around the world nobody is simply going to get to a website simply because it exists.  This is in particular where the leadership principles come into place on a social level.

Often what is needed is simply a model example for what you as a founder want the project to look like.  In the initial stages, you need to demonstrate leadership both by showing examples, and gently trying to remind people when inappropriate content is being added.  How permissive or how abrasive you are toward new users is going to have a huge effect on the growth and popularity of the project, regardless of the merits of what you do or the quality of the content.

It is also important to realize that you can't be pleasing to everybody on every point.  The most successful leaders will always have detractors and possibly out right enemies.  The successful leader will know when they are being abusive and need to pull back, and when perhaps they have gone too far and created too many enemies that should be their friends.  Unfortunately, the only real way to learn how to do that is simply experience and getting opportunities to practice leadership ideas.

=== Being Chosen by Your Peers ===

There are several ways that you can become an administrator, but most likely you have been chosen by being an outstanding contributor to the project.  Often this selection is made through some sort of formal nomination process where other members of the community also have a chance to support your nomination in a sort of election.  The exact process is something that is specific to the project you are working on, but you should take the nomination as a sign of recognition that you have already done an outstanding job.

In this situation, you are going to need to learn the policies and procedures of the project in a little more depth.  This is not exactly an easy situation, and it is surprising how many policies that you didn't realize existed prior to becoming an administrator, even if you were a very active user previously.

== Moderate, Don't Dominate ==

One aspect of becoming an administrator is that you are now a part of the group that is enforcing policies.  If you have been vocal in the past, you need to tone down some of the arguments from the style you have used in the past, understanding that you need to help moderate the tone of the discussions you are involved with.

As a general philosophy, it would be wise to not immediately implement drastic changes to the project, especially in areas that require the extra privileges that come from being an administrator.  Seek input from the other people involved in the project before you make any major changes, and implement community decisions even if it goes against your own personal opinion.

Also, don't hesitate to admit that you might be wrong occasionally.  You will be making mistakes along the way as an administrator, especially if you are new to doing this sort of task.  Discover the different ways you can communicate to the other users in your community, including Water Cooler type pages, e-mail, user talk pages, article discussion pages, project e-mail lists, phone numbers and instant message accounts.

== Innovation and Project Development ==

One aspect of project leadership also takes on the social responsibility of project innovation and development.  It is likely that there was always some task you felt wasn't being adequately dealt with in some manner before you became an administrator, and now you have the opportunity to try and fix things in a way you couldn't before.

Innovation might also take many forms.  You can start new sections of your project, or try to fill in holes that weren't covered before.  In addition, if you were elected to become an administrator it is likely that you have a small group of supporters already who are interested in what you are doing, and it is possible to help motivate those supporters to work together and get some things accomplished as well.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Use ==
&lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; wraps the whole HTML document. The opening tag is placed directly after the doctype declaration, the end tag at the end of the document.

It is recommended that the primary language of the document is indicated with either the &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt;  attribute for HTML or the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; attribute for XHTML. XHTML 1.0 documents served with a MIME type of &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; should use both &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt;.

== Example ==
An English language HTML 4.01 document.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;

Below is a list of all attributes which are available for most elements in HTML.

You can also view a [[../Tag List|list of HTML elements]].

==Attributes==

===class===
This attribute allows you to designate an element to be a member of a given class. Multiple elements can be assigned to the same class (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p ''class=&quot;foo&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p ''class=&quot;foo&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), as well as a single element belonging to multiple classes (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p ''class=&quot;foo bar&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

===code===

===codebase===

===dir===
With this attribute you can define which direction the text is written for a given element, either &lt;code&gt;ltr&lt;/code&gt; for left-to-right or &lt;code&gt;rtl&lt;/code&gt; for right-to-left.

===height===
Setting this attribute with a numerical value defines the height of an element in pixels (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div ''height=&quot;150&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)

===id===
This attribute allows you to define a unique identifier for each element. This would be useful for hyperlinks that link to a specific section of a page or when styling using a style sheet.

===lang===
With this attribute you can specify a language that is used for an element.

===style===
This attribute allows you to apply specific styling to a given element.

===title===

With this attribute you can define what will be displayed when a user hovers the element. It is not available for [[../Tag List/base|base]], [[../Tag List/head|head]], [[../Tag List/html|html]], [[../Tag List/meta|meta]], [[../Tag List/param|param]], [[../Tag List/script|script]], [[../Tag List/style|style]], and [[../Tag List/title|title]].

===width===
Setting this attribute with a numerical value defines the width of an element in pixels (eg. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div ''width=&quot;230&quot;''&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)

==More attributes==

===accesskey===

The &lt;code&gt;accesskey&lt;/code&gt; attribute defines a keyboard shortcut for a hyperlink or form element.
The combination of keys need to activate the shortcut varies from browser to browser. In Microsoft Internet Explorer the user must press Alt+''accesskey''. If the shortcut is for a link the user must then press Enter to follow the link. The choice of Alt+''accesskey'' means that access keys can clash with shortcuts built-in to the browser.

It is quite common to use numbers for the access keys since these don't clash with any major browser's built-in shortcuts, e. g.
* 1 = Home Page
* 0 = List of access keys on this website.

&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a accesskey=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a accesskey=&quot;2&quot; href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a accesskey=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;/accesskeys&quot;&gt;Access keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is no standard way to let users know the access keys that are available on the page. Some suggestions can be found in [http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accesskeys Accesskeys: Unlocking Hidden Navigation].

|next=Model a Silver Goblet cylinder|Model a Silver Goblet from a cylinder
|previous=Model a Goblet}}
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

==Basic Shape==
[[image:Blender3d Silver goblet extrusion plan.jpg|right|200px]]

At first glance, the goblet looks like it is composed of cylinders. However, while it is possible to model the goblet with a cylinder mesh, it is easier to make a goblet by using cubes.  Cubes make the goblet faster to make and it makes fewer vertices to track. Now, lets start making the basic shape of the goblet.


Start with the default cube and go to Edit Mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}). Move to the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}). Box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the top edges of the cube. Extrude ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Regions'') upward about one grid square. Hold down {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} while extruding, for incremental movement, and press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to restrict movement to the Z-axis. This extrusion is called E1. Repeat 2 more times for extrusion 2 and 3 (E2 and E3). 


Now Extrude a longer piece upwards, for the Goblet's stem, of 10 grid squares (E4). Next we will define the area for the 2 top knobs and the bottom of the glass by Extruding upwards 5 more times at 1 grid square each (E5-E9). Next do another upward Extrusion of about 10 grid squares (E10). This is the actual glass itself.
{{clear}}

=== Inflate the Glass ===
[[Image:Blender3d_Silver_goblet_e2_scaling.jpg|right|400px|Sizing the first knob]]
Now, lets begin to inflate the glass. First, clear all selections by hitting the {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}. Make sure you are still in the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}). Box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the bottom most cube (all 8 vertices, not just the bottom 4). Then expand it outward by scaling ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}), then pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to lock/prevent any scaling in height along the Z-axis and finally pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|4}} to quadruple its size. Next, deselect all vertices ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the 4th pair of vertices (E2), scale them ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}), lock scaling ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) and triple the vertices in size ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|3}}). 


Do the same for E5 and E7 (the 7th and 9th pairs of vertices, respectively). Then expand ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) the top, Goblet rectangle (E9 and E10) to 6 times its current size ({{B3D:N2P/Do|6}}).



=== Make the cup's interior ===
[[Image:Bcup3.png|All extrusions|left]] [[Image:Bcup4.png|View of the finished basic goblet|right]]
Last is the cup's interior. Once again, you should still be in the side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}). Box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}) the very top most vertices of the Goblet (E10). Once selected, get a better view by changing to 'Orbit Up' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM8}}). With the top surface selected, initiate an Extrusion ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} &amp;rarr; ''Regions''), followed by a termination with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESCAPE}}. It will appear as if nothing has happened, but new, overlapping edges have been created and are now selected (this also creates E11). Next Scale ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}) the selected vertices to 4/5ths of the original size ({{B3D:N2P/Do|.8}}). This creates the inside lip of the cup. Now, Extrude ({{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}) the interior lip, along the Z-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) downward ({{B3D:N2P/Do|-10}}) to create the bottom interior of the Goblet (E12). Finish off with a 'Remove Doubles' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; '''Remove Doubles'''), for good measure. It should look something like this.

[Noob note: For some reason, when I extruded the interior of the cup to -10, I would have a lip sticking out of the bottom of the cup when I applied the subsurf. To resolve this, I extruded to -9. I was also left with a space at the bottom of the cup (i.e. you could see all the way to the base of the goblet) so I selected the bottom most vertices, pressed F, extruded and hit ESC, merged, selected the center vertice and translated that down -1. This gave me a nice looking bottom for the cup.]

['''Another Noob Note:''' When you create the interior of the cup with .8, be sure to hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to restrict it to just the X and Y axis, or when you extrude your glass downwards by 10, it will go through the bottom of the glass]

&lt;span style=color:grey&gt;[Noob Question: Does he really mean extrude the interior lip down along the Z-axis? It would seem to me that you should grab it and drag it down (or ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} then {{B3D:N2P/Do|-10}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}})]
[Answer: Yes. Extrude creates another set of vertices. Dragging down the existing vertices won’t give the lip and the interior the right shape. Try it both ways and see.]
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=color:gray&gt;[Pro Note: If you wish for a more detailed cup, extrude the bottom of the cup, then scale it by .2097. Then translate (in layman's terms, that's &quot;grab&quot;) it .7181 along the negative Z axis (or -.7181 along the Z axis). Through the use of creasing and control loop-cuts, you can get a ''very'' nice goblet.]&lt;/span&gt;

'''Note:''' If the thickness of the vessel sides or bottom is too thin, the Goblets interior faces may 'bleed through', affecting the exterior of the Goblet when you apply a subsurf.

You many want to try modeling the inside/bottom of the Goblet (sim. to &quot;Die Another Way&quot; tutorial). Turning on &quot;Occlude Background Geometry&quot; ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) will be helpful, as it turns off the ability to see &amp; select through the model. The button icon is that of a &quot;ISO Cube&quot; located with the 3 select mode buttons (4 dots, 2 lines, &amp; a triangle) of the 3D Toolbar, in Edit Mode.

==Smoothing and Defining==

Time to take the mesh and turn it into a proper goblet.  Add a subsurf level 2 ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|2}})to the mesh.  Change to Object Mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}) and select the Set Smooth button under ''Links and Materials''.  The cube-looking mesh will now look like an object that was created from a cylinder.
This has removed all our crisp edges, and our globlet is looking very unstable!  Let's rectify things by flattening the bottom.

'''Noob Note:''' ''If your goblet has a bulge in it after applying the subsurf, go to '''Edit mode''' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}), select all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, and select &quot;Remove doubles&quot;. (If a menu for boolean operations appears when you hit the {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, then you're not in '''Edit mode'''; change immediately to Edit mode and try the {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} again.)''

Select the four edges that surround the small circle at the very bottom (the very lowest set of edges) and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do| E}} to enable creasing.  Now drag the mouse up and down to select the level of the crease. When you're satisfied, hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}. Repeat the process for other edges you want to be sharp. I've turned on Draw Creases under ''Mesh Tools 1'' to illustrate which edges have been creased (highlighted yellow) in this example.

&lt;span style=color:grey&gt;
Note: Due to the vagueness of this tutorial I had problems trying to follow what was wanted. I got around it by beveling the goblet (for the cup-edge/thickness), and then merging necessary vertex. Here is how it turned-out:

[http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k185/captheathmalc/gobletinblender.jpg Goblet][http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k185/captheathmalc/goblet.jpg Render]

[[Image:Bcup5.png|Applied subsurf modifier]] [[Image:Bcup6.png|Crease edges]]
&lt;/span&gt;

[Noob Note: I found that if you select the bottom 4 vertices and extrude them down by 2 .5 increments ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} -.5 twice) and then you select the bottom 8 vertices (the bottom .5 section) 

and scale by 1.5 ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} 1.5) it makes for a more realistic looking goblet base.]

That concludes the creation of the goblet.  Save the scene for use in the lighting tutorial.  To jump to the relevant lighting section, go to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Light a Silver Goblet]]

==Transparency==
Okay, this is pretty much just because I wanted to show off my work, but also because transparency was really hard to find and really easy to actually '''do'''. I don't know if there's a lesson on transparency in this, but I really wanted glass, and I'm impatient. This little bit is for anyone else who's interested in modeling the goblet as glass and is impatient like me.
If you try this, first keep the non-transparent goblet saved somewhere, it is used in the &quot;silver goblet and lighting&quot; follow-up tutorial linked above.

Hit F5 to go to the shading context and then click the red ball icon to open the material buttons.

The following images show the settings needed, and the final render of my green glass goblet.

[[Image:Glass-transparency.PNG|right]]

In Materials is an Alpha slider- goes from 0.00 (invisible) to 1.00 (opaque). It needs to be pretty low, less than .25, I'd say.
Also in the Edit buttons (F5) is a section called &quot;Mirror Transp&quot;, for me it's a tab between &quot;Shaders&quot; and &quot;SSS&quot;.  In here the &quot;Ray Transp&quot; button must be on. The IOR value is refraction rate- the value of glass is 1.51714. Next to that is Depth, determines how deep to apply transparency. I recommend maxing it to 10, to play it safe.


*Tilescreen's addition

Ray transp stands for Ray Tracing Transparency, this basically involves shooting light out from the camera and bouncing it about your 3d scene. The depth value of the ray tracing settings determines how many times a ray of light can 'mirror' (reflect off a surface) or 'transp' (refract through a surface, just like at school with prisms and the light bends). It is possible to work out how much depth you need as each time it enters or exits a surface you will need +1 level of depth. So for this you should need about 4 or 5 depending on how complex you have made this goblet. If you don't have a sufficient depth it will just come out a solid colour with no transparency.

More on Ray tracing.
Samples refers to how many beams of light will be fired out of the camera to calculate the refraction and reflection. higher numbers = better quality but also increase render time, but the real killer is the depth. Increasing it by one means it has to work out an (in my case) an additional 18 bounces. Also try adding a filter to slightly blur your reflections and refractions but only a tiny one.

To get a softer shadow then click on the lamp, press F5 and increase the samples (found in Shadow and Spot) this will shoot out more shadow rays and give you softer shadows.

*End of my addition


*Yoshi's addition:

Try experimenting with the colours. The easiest way I know to do this is:

Select the goblet in object mode.
Go to the textures tab (next to the red ball), and under 'texture type' pick 'blend'.
Then click 'colours' next to the textures subwindow, and hit 'colorband'.
You can change the colours by click on the left of the bar, then double clicking the coloured bar under it.
Once you pick the darkest colour (left), click the far right of the checkered bar and do the same as before.

If you want a shadow, you'll need to create a plane and go into the &quot;Shader&quot; settings for it. Turn on &quot;TraShado&quot;, otherwise the shadow will be a flat black one and look all wrong.

:''Noob says: Even when I turn on TraShado, the shadow is flat black... I can't get those lighter edge shadows.  Solution: Make sure that TraShado is applied to the plane rather than the cube and that Shadow is also selected.''

Noob Note: Do not try and use this goblet for a fluid simulation it will not work.

'''Reader note:''' If the ray tracing transparency does not work for you, make sure that the ray tracing is enabled in the ''Scene'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F10}}) menu. It's the ''Ray'' button in the ''Render'' panel.

:''Noob says: No matter what I do, my goblet stays opaque and my goblet has no shadow when on a plane. Do I have to somehow link my goblet to my plane?''
Noob answer: Adjust the alpha ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}}) and look in the material section. Adjust the (A) slider under RGB sliders (bottom right) to something like 0.25.&lt;BR&gt;
Noob Answer 2: Try changing the “Filter” value under the Ray Transp button from its default value of zero to something like 0.1 or 0.2. This will cause the light to take on more of the colour of the object each time it passes through. It should give you a nice, deep colour for the glass, and its shadow, to the point where the alpha value makes no further difference, and can be set to 0.

 



Here's the final result:

Noob Note: If you have problems with a sandy texture showing up (like in the picture above) your cup is clipping through the plane (bottom face is trying to occupy exactly the same space as the plane), just move it up a little bit on the Z axis, and it should go away.

&lt;small&gt;'''Note:''' The draft Table of Contents for the Statewide Water Plan was written by the [[Georgia Water/External Links/Organizations/Georgia Water Resources Council|Georgia Water Resources Council]] and submitted to Governor Sonny Perdue on January 6, 2004.  This 2004 draft [http://www.gadnr.org/gwrc/Assets/Documents/Comprehensive_Water_PlanTOC.pdf] may be revised as the state planning process unfolds.&lt;small/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;STATE COMPONENTS OF STATE WATER PLAN&lt;big/&gt;
:&lt;big&gt;Table of Contents (draft)&lt;big/&gt;
===[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Vision|Mission &amp; Vision]]===
:This ‘top of the trees’ mission/vision statement would provide the proper social, environmental, economic, and cultural context for comprehensive water management in Georgia. The Council recommends using the following vision statement from the work of the Joint Water Study Committee:
::''“Georgia manages water resources in a sustainable manner to support the state’s economy, to protect public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens.”'' ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks|Status]]''' = done)


===[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Vision|Goals &amp; Objectives]]===
:This section of the Plan would include a set of statements that collectively express the aspirations of development and implementation of a State Water Plan.  A suggested starting point for this section of the Plan would be the set of six goals adopted by the Joint Water Study Committee in its document entitled “Water Management Planning – Vision, Principles, &amp; Goals”.

:#Description of how existing and in-progress regional plans will be integrated into the state plan. ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Integrating existing plans|Status]]''')


===Guiding Principles &amp; Policy Framework===

====General Guiding Principles====
The Council believes the following principles (from the work of the JWSC) should guide the development of the State Water Plan:
#Effective water resources management protects health and the safety and welfare of Georgia’s citizens;
#Water resources are managed in a sustainable manner so that current and future generations have access to adequate supplies of quality water that supports both human and natural systems;  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Sustainability|Status]]''')
#All citizens have a stewardship responsibility to conserve and protect the water resources of Georgia; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Stewardship responsibility|Status]]''')
#Water management efforts recognize that economic prosperity and environmental quality are interdependent; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Economic prosperity|Status]]''') 
#Water quality and quantity and surface and ground water are interrelated and require integrated planning as well as reasonable and efficient use; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Integrated planning|Status1]]''') and [[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Reasonable use|Status2]]''')
#A comprehensive and accessible database must be developed to provide sound scientific and economic information upon which effective water management decisions can be based; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Database|Status]]''')
#Water resources management encourages local/regional innovation, implementation, adaptability, and responsibility for watershed and river basin management; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Local responsibility|Status3]]''') and ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Local capability|Status4]]''')
#Sound water resources management involves meaningful participation, coordination, and cooperation among interested and affected stakeholders and citizens, as well as all levels of governmental and other entities managing or utilizing water; ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Public involvement in decisions|Status5]]''') ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Coordination|Status6]]''')
#Periodic revisions of the comprehensive statewide water management plan may be required to accommodate new scientific and policy insights as well as changing social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors. ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Scanning|Status7]]''') and ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Updating procedure|Status8]]''')

====Current Statutory, Regulatory, and Water Management Policy Framework====
:The Law Department would be enlisted to provide a description of Georgia’s current water quality and water quantity management statutory framework. A description of Georgia’s water quantity management statutory framework – produced by the Law Department - has already been completed for other purposes, and may require editing for inclusion in a State Water Plan.  Additionally advice and guidance should be sought from the governor’s legal counsel.  As the State agency with principal water management regulatory responsibilities, EPD would be assigned the task of describing the current regulatory requirements related to the statutory framework completed by the Law Department. Before completing this section, EPD would seek input from other State government entities having water management responsibilities under Georgia law.  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Policy Framework|Status]]''')

====Guidance on Water Public Policy Issues====
:If the sub-state strategies for managing water are to meet the goals defined for the Plan, development of these strategies must be guided by clearly articulated guidance – from the State – on a number of critical public policy issues.  This section of the Plan would address itself to these critical water public policy issues.  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Guidance on Water Public Policy Issues|Status]]''')


===Planning Standards===
:This section of the Plan would provide a description of minimum planning standards that would guide the sub-state planning regions in developing sub-state resource management components of the Plan. ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Planning Standards|Status]]''')


===Executive Summary of Sub-State Components of State Water Plan===
:This section of the “State Components” of the Plan would provide an executive summary of each of the sub-state components of the State Plan. Such a summary will not be possible for many of the sub-state components until some time after completion of the “State Components”; however as the State Plan must be a ‘living’ document, these substate executive summaries can/should be added whenever the sub-state plans have been completed.
:This summary might also generally address itself to an appropriate subset – or all - of the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/issues.php 42 issues] the JWSC identified during the conduct of its work.  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#42 issues|Status]]''') 

====Water Quantity Management====
:'''State Overview'''
:*Highlights
:*Planning Area Boundary Issues
:'''Water Quantity Management Summary by Planning Area'''
:*Water Quantity Management to Meet Present and Anticipated In-Stream Needs 
:*Water Quantity Management to Meet Present and Anticipated Off-Stream Needs

====Water Quality Management====
:'''State Overview'''
:*Highlights
:*Planning Area Boundary Issues
:'''Water Quality Management Summary by Planning Area'''
:*Water Quality Management to Meet Present and Anticipated Federal and State Statutory and Regulatory Mandates  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Mandates list|Status]]''')
:*Water Quality Management to Meet State Water Policy Objectives Not Mandated by Statute and/or Rules
:*Description of Items Requiring Further Attention and Research

====Information &amp; Data Management====
:*Water Quality, Quantity, and Biotic Integrity Monitoring  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Monitoring|Status]]''')
:*Data Management Systems ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Data Management Systems|Status]]''')
:*Real Time Water Management ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Real Time Water Management|Status]]''')
:*Additional Data and Research Needs :('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Additional Data and Research Needs|Status]]''')

====Implementation====
:*Interagency coordination  ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Interagency coordination|Status]]''')
:*Enforcement ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Enforcement|Status]]''')
:*Funding ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Funding|Status]]''')
:*Schedule/mechanism to monitor and report on the implementation of the Plan ('''[[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Tasks#Implementation reporting|Status]]''')
&lt;br/&gt;



===SUB-STATE COMPONENTS OF STATE WATER PLAN (for each Region)===
'''Outline for each Regional Plan'''
(The State Water Plan would eventually include several regional water plans that are developed – and integrated – in accordance with guidance developed early in the state water planning process.  The configuration of the sub-state regions, while not yet determined, should at a minimum take into consideration both natural and political boundaries.  Some of the expected major topic areas of the sub-state plans are shown below.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I live in Tacoma, Washington.  Photograph available. [http://www.plu.edu/~jensenmk/]  I was born on August 13, 1951, in Bethesda, Maryland.  I am married and have one son.  E-mail: jensenmk@plu.edu

My areas of specialization as a faculty member at Pacific Lutheran University, where I have taught since 1989, are 19th-century French literature and French.  I have taught 18th-century and 20th-century French literature as well, as well as modern European literature generally.  More broadly, I majored in history at Princeton University and am interested in modern European and American history, with additional interests in world history, the philosophy of history, and the history of ideas.

After briefly studying law, I pursued literary interests while working in a San Francisco bookstore and decided to return to graduate school in 1980.  I hold a Ph.D. in French literature from the University of California, Berkeley.  I find the Wikibook project interesting from every point of view.  I had been contributing to Wikipedia for about a year when I became aware of Wikibooks in January 2006.

In recent years I have become politically active in the peace movement at the local level, and am involved in several groups in Pierce County, Washington.  This has led me to develop new interests:  national security, 20th-century U.S. history, media studies, etc. 

I am fluent in French and am an experienced translator from French to English with have a particular interest in translating the work of the French literary historian and critic Paul B&amp;eacute;nichou (1908-2001).  I have published a translation of B&amp;eacute;nichou's &lt;I&gt;Le Sacre de l'&amp;eacute;crivain&lt;/I&gt; (1973) entitled &lt;I&gt;The Consecration of the Writer, 1750-1830&lt;/I&gt; (U. Nebraska, 1999), and am currently at work on a translation of &lt;I&gt;Le Temps des proph&amp;egrave;tes&lt;/I&gt; (1977).

I maintain a home page. [http://www.plu.edu/~jensenmk/]  I also am active on the web on the pages of United for Peace of Pierce County [http://www.ufppc.org] and People for Peace, Justice, and Healing. [http://www.tacomapjh.org]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pastor Rex Humbard once said, the Christian life is like a bicycle, either go on or go off. Thus, after the believer turns to Jesus, there are certain things required:
*To grow in Christ. (Eph. 4: 15)
*To grow in grace and knowledge of the things of God (2 Peter 3: 18)
*To grow as the Word is read. (1 Peter 2: 2)
*To love one another. (John 13: 35) (1 Cor. 13)
*To be a witness of Jesus to others (Acts 1: 8)
*To give to God what is God’s. (Luke 20: 25)
*To pray always. (1 Thess. 5: 17) 
*To pray in the Holy Spirit. (Jude 20)
*To receive help from the Holy Spirit when we do not know how to pray. (Rom. 8: 26)
*To join a body of believers. (Heb. 10: 24,25)
::With oneness in unity of purpose. (Rom. 12: 5)
::With oneness, but different ministries. (Eph. 4: 11,12)
::With oneness in symbols. (Rev. 19: 7)
::With oneness in testimony. (Rev. 12: 10,11)
::With oneness as children of God. (Matt. 5: 9)

:''And if the Holy Spirit is in you, He who raised up Christ from the dead will add to your mortal existence such abundant Life as comes with the indwelling of His Spirit. Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are under no obligation to live a life ruled by our baser instincts. For if you follow that path, death is near; but under the powerful sway of the Spirit, when you put those inclinations aside, you will live. For all who are led by the Holy Spirit are children of God.'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;(Romans&amp;nbsp;8:&amp;nbsp;11-14&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Modernity)&lt;/CENTER&gt;

==Vectors==

Physical effects involve things acting on other things to produce a change of position, tension etc. These effects usually depend upon the strength, angle of contact, separation etc of the interacting things rather than on any absolute reference frame so it is useful to describe the rules that govern the interactions in terms of the relative positions and lengths of the interacting things rather than in terms of any fixed viewpoint or coordinate system. Vectors were introduced in physics to allow such relative descriptions.

The use of vectors in elementary physics often avoids any real understanding of what they are. They are a new concept, as unique as numbers themselves, which have been related to the rest of mathematics and geometry by a series of formulae such as linear combinations, scalar products etc.

Vectors are defined as &quot;directed line segments&quot; which means they are lines drawn in a particular direction. The introduction of time as a geometric entity means that this definition of a vector is rather archaic, a better definition might be that a vector is information arranged as a continuous succession of points in space and time. Vectors have length and direction, the direction being from earlier to later.

Vectors are represented by lines terminated with arrow symbols to show the direction. A point that moves from the left to the right for about three centimetres can be represented as:

[[Image:relvectsym.gif]]

If a vector is represented within a coordinate system it has components along each of the axes of the system. These components do not normally start at the origin of the coordinate system. 

[[Image:Relvector2.jpg]] 

The vector represented by the bold arrow has components a, b and c which are lengths on the coordinate axes. If the vector starts at the origin the components become simply the coordinates of the end point of the vector and the vector is known as the position vector of the end point.

===Addition of Vectors===

If two vectors are connected so that the end point of one is the start of the next the sum of the two vectors is defined as a third vector drawn from the start of the first to the end of the second:

[[Image:Relvectoradd.jpg]] 

&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; is the sum of &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;:

&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;

If a components of &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; are a, b, c and the components of &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; are d, e, f then the components of the sum of the two vectors are (a+d), (b+e) and (c+f). In other words, when vectors are added it is the components that add numerically rather than the lengths of the vectors themselves.

Rules of Vector Addition

1. Commutativity &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

2. Associativity (&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) + &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + (&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;)

If the zero vector (which has no length) is labelled as 0

3. &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + (-&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) = 0

4. &lt;b&gt;a&lt;b&gt; + 0 = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

===Rules of Vector Multiplication by a Scalar===

The discussion of components and vector addition shows that if vector &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; has components a,b,c then q&lt;b&gt;a&lt;b&gt; has components qa, qb, qc. The meaning of vector multiplication is shown below:

[[Image:relvectormult.jpg]] 

The bottom vector c is added three times which is equivalent to multiplying it by 3.

1. Distributive laws q(&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;b&lt;b&gt;) = q&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + q&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; and (q + p)&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; = q&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; + p&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

2. Associativity q(p&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) = qp&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

Also 1 &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;

If the rules of vector addition and multiplication by a scalar apply to a set of elements they are said to define a vector space.

===Linear Combinations and Linear Dependence===

An element of the form:

&lt;math&gt;q_1\mathbf{a_1} + q_2\mathbf{a_2} + q_3\mathbf{a_3} +.... + q_m \mathbf{a_m}&lt;/math&gt;

is called a linear combination of the vectors.

The set of vectors multiplied by scalars in a linear combination is called the span of the vectors. The word span is used because the scalars (q) can have any value - which means that any point in the subset of the vector space defined by the span can contain a vector derived from it.

Suppose there were a set of vectors (&lt;math&gt;{a_1,a_2,.... ,a_m}&lt;/math&gt;) , if it is possible to express one of these vectors in terms of the others, using any linear combination, then the set is said to be linearly dependent. If it is not possible to express any one of the vectors in terms of the others, using any linear combination, it is said to be linearly independent. 

In other words, if there are values of the scalars such that:

(1). &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_1} = q_2\mathbf{a_2} + q_3\mathbf{a_3} +.... + q_m\mathbf{a_m}&lt;/math&gt;

the set is said to be linearly dependent.

There is a way of determining linear dependence. From (1) it can be seen that if &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is set to minus one then:

&lt;math&gt;q_1\mathbf{a_1} + q_2\mathbf{a_2} + q_3\mathbf{a_3} +.... + q_m\mathbf{a_m} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

So in general, if a linear combination can be written that sums to a zero vector then the set of vectors (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_1,a_2,.... ,a_m})&lt;/math&gt; are not linearly independent.

If two vectors are linearly dependent then they lie along the same line (wherever a and b lie on the line, scalars can be found to produce a linear combination which is a zero vector). If three vectors are linearly dependent they lie on the same line or on a plane (collinear or coplanar).

===Dimension===

If n+1 vectors in a vector space are linearly dependent then n vectors are linearly independent and the space is said to have a dimension of n. The set of n vectors is said to be the basis of the vector space.

===Scalar Product===

Also known as the 'dot product' or 'inner product'. The scalar product is a way of removing the problem of angular measures from the relationship between vectors and, as Weyl put it, a way of comparing the lengths of vectors that are arbitrarily inclined to each other.

Consider two vectors with a common origin:

[[Image:relscalar.jpg]]

The projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; on the adjacent side is:

&lt;math&gt;P = | \mathbf{a} | cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a} | &lt;/math&gt; is the length of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

The scalar product is defined as:

(2) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a . b} = | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{b} | cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that &lt;math&gt;cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; is zero if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular. This means that if the scalar product is zero the vectors composing it are orthogonal (perpendicular to each other).

(2) also allows &lt;math&gt;cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; to be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;cos \theta = \mathbf{a . b} / ( | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{b} |)&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of the scalar product also allows a definition of the length of a vector in terms of the concept of a vector itself. The scalar product of a vector with itself is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a . a} = | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{a} | cos 0&lt;/math&gt;

cos 0 (the cosine of zero) is one so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a . a} = a^2&lt;/math&gt;

which is our first direct relationship between vectors and scalars. This can be expressed as: 

(3) &lt;math&gt;a = \sqrt{\mathbf{a . a}} &lt;/math&gt;

where a is the length of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

Properties:

1. Linearity &lt;math&gt;[G\mathbf{a} + H\mathbf{b}].\mathbf{c} = G\mathbf{a.c} + H\mathbf{b.c}&lt;/math&gt;

2. symmetry &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = \mathbf{b.a}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Positive definiteness &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.a}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to 0

4. Distributivity for vector addition &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{(a + b).c} = \mathbf{a.c + b.c}&lt;/math&gt;

5. Schwarz inequality &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a.b} | \leq ab&lt;/math&gt;

6. Parallelogram equality &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} |^2 + | \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} |^2 = 2( | \mathbf{a} |^2 + | \mathbf{b} |^2)&lt;/math&gt;

From the point of view of vector physics the most important property of the scalar product is the expression of the scalar product in terms of coordinates. 

7. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us the length of a vector in terms of coordinates (Pythagoras' theorem) from:

8. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.a} = a^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of 7 is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1\mathbf{i} + a_2\mathbf{j} + a_3\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors along the coordinate axes. From (4) 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = (a_1\mathbf{i} + a_2\mathbf{j} + a_3\mathbf{k}) .\mathbf{b} = a_1\mathbf{i}.\mathbf{b} + a_2\mathbf{j}.\mathbf{b} + a_3\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; 

but &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = b_1\mathbf{i} + b_2\mathbf{j} + b_3\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = b_1a_1\mathbf{i .i} + b_2a_1\mathbf{i .j} + b_3a_1\mathbf{i .k} + b_1a_2\mathbf{j.i} + b_2a_2\mathbf{j.j} + b_3a_2\mathbf{j.k} + b_1a_3\mathbf{k.i} + b_2a_3\mathbf{k.j} + b_3a_3\mathbf{k.k}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i .j, i .k, j .k,}&lt;/math&gt; etc. are all zero because the vectors are orthogonal, also &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i .i, j.j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k.k}&lt;/math&gt; are all one (these are unit vectors defined to be 1 unit in length).

Using these results:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrices==

Matrices are sets of numbers arranged in a rectangular array. They are especially important in linear algebra because they can be used to represent the elements of linear equations.

11a + 2b = c

5a + 7b = d

The constants in the equation above can be represented as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
11 &amp; 2 \\
5 &amp; 7 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of matrices are usually denoted symbolically using lower case letters:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Matrices are said to be equal if all of the corresponding elements are equal.

Eg: if &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}= b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix Addition===

Matrices are added by adding the individual elements of one matrix to the corresponding elements of the other matrix.

&lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; 

or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix addition has the following properties:

1. Commutativity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Associativity &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) + \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + (\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt;

and

3. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + (-\mathbf{A}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

4. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + 0 = \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

From matrix addition it can be seen that the product of a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and a number p is simply &lt;math&gt;p\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; where every element of the matrix is multiplied individually by p.

Transpose of a Matrix

A matrix is transposed when the rows and columns are interchanged:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
  
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A^T} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{21} &amp; a_{31} \\
a_{12} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{32} \\
a_{13} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

 
Notice that the principal diagonal elements stay the same after transposition.

A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose eg: &lt;math&gt;a_{kj} = a_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is skew symmetric if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A^T} = -\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; eg: &lt;math&gt;a_{kj} = -a_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;. The principal diagonal of a skew symmetric matrix is composed of elements that are zero.

Other Types of Matrix

Diagonal matrix: all elements above and below the principal diagonal are zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Unit matrix: denoted by I, is a diagonal matrix where all elements of the principal diagonal are 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix Multiplication===

Matrix multiplication is defined in terms of the problem of determining the coefficients in linear transformations.

Consider a set of linear transformations between 2 coordinate systems that share a common origin and are related to each other by a rotation of the coordinate axes.

 

Two Coordinate Systems Rotated Relative to Each Other

If there are 3 coordinate systems, x, y, and z these can be transformed from one to another:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11}y_1 + a_{12}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21}y_1 + a_{22}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

 

&lt;math&gt;y_1 = b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_2 = b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

 

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = c_{11}z_1 + c_{12}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = c_{21}z_1 + c_{22}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

 

By substitution:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11}(b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2) + a_{12}(b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21}(b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2) + a_{22}(b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2) &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;x_1 = (a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}(b_{21})z_1 + (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22})z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = (a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}(b_{21})z_1 + (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22})z_2 &lt;/math&gt;


Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;c_{11} = (a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}(b_{21})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{12} = (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{21} = (a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{22} = (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22})&lt;/math&gt;
 

The coefficient matrices are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} &amp; b_{12} \\
b_{21} &amp; b_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} &amp; c_{12} \\
c_{21} &amp; c_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From the linear transformation the product of A and B is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AB} =
\begin{bmatrix}
(a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\
(a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In the discussion of scalar products it was shown that, for a plane the scalar product is calculated as: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a.b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2&lt;/math&gt; where a and b are the coordinates of the vectors a and b.

Now mathematicians define the rows and columns of a matrix as vectors:

A Column vector is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} \\
b_{21} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And a Row vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
 

Matrices can be described as vectors eg:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a_{1}} \\ 
\mathbf{a_{2}} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} &amp; b_{12} \\
b_{21} &amp; b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{b_{1}} \mathbf{b_{2}} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix multiplication is then defined as the scalar products of the vectors so that:


:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a_1.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_1.b_2} \\
\mathbf{a_2.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_2.b_2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of the scalar product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_1.b_1} = a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}&lt;/math&gt; etc.

In the general case: 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a_1.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_1.b_2} &amp; . &amp; \mathbf{a_1.b_n} \\
\mathbf{a_2.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_2.b_2} &amp; . &amp; \mathbf{a_2.b_n} \\
. &amp; . &amp; . &amp; . \\
\mathbf{a_m.b_1} &amp; \mathbf{a_m.b_2} &amp; . &amp; \mathbf{a_m.b_n} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is described as the multiplication of rows into columns (eg: row vectors into column vectors). The first matrix must have the same number of columns as there are rows in the second matrix or the multiplication is undefined.

After matrix multiplication the product matrix has the same number of rows as the first matrix and columns as the second matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
6 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
3 \\
7 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; has 2 rows and 1 column &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
39 \\
35 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

ie: first row is &lt;math&gt;1*2 + 3*3 + 4*7 = 39&lt;/math&gt; and second row is &lt;math&gt;6*2 + 3*3 + 2*7 = 35&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
2 &amp; -1 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4\\
3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; has 2 rows and 3 columns&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
21 &amp; 11 &amp; 13 \\
16 &amp; 7 &amp; 16 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

Notice that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{BA}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be determined because the '''number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix''' to perform matrix multiplication. 


Properties of Matrix Multiplication

1. Not commutative &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} \ne \mathbf{BA}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Associative &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A(BC)} = \mathbf{(AB)C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(k\mathbf{A})\mathbf{B} = k(\mathbf{AB}) = \mathbf{A}(k\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

3. Distributative for matrix addition

&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B})\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AC} + \mathbf{BC}&lt;/math&gt;

matrix multiplication is not commutative so &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{CA} + \mathbf{CB}&lt;/math&gt; is a separate case.

4. The cancellation law is not always true:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AB} = 0&lt;/math&gt; does not mean &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=0&lt;/math&gt;

There is a case where matrix multiplication is commutative. This involves the scalar matrix where the values of the principle diagonal are all equal. Eg:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} =
\begin{bmatrix}
k &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; k &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; k \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In this case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AS} = \mathbf{SA} = k\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If the scalar matrix is the unit matrix: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{AI} = \mathbf{IA} = \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linear Transformations===

A simple linear transformation such as:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11}y_1 + a_{12}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21}y_1 + a_{22}y_2 &lt;/math&gt;

can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{Ay}&lt;/math&gt;

eg:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
*
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and
&lt;math&gt;y_1 = b_{11}z_1 + b_{12}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_2 = b_{21}z_1 + b_{22}z_2 &lt;/math&gt;


as: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Bz}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the associative law:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{Bz}) = \mathbf{ABz} = \mathbf{Cz}&lt;/math&gt;

and so:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{AB} =
\begin{bmatrix}
(a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\
(a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21}) &amp; (a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

as before.

==Indicial Notation==

Consider a simple rotation of coordinates:

[[Image:relrotate2.jpg]]

&lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^'&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} =g_{\mu \nu} x^\mu x^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and is called the metric tensor for this 2D space. 

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{s.s} = g_{11} x_1x_{1}^' + g_{12} x_1x_2^' + g_{21} x_2x_{1}^' + g_{22} x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;g_{11} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{12} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{21} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{22} = 1&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_{1}^' + x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

If there is no rotation of coordinates the scalar product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_1 + x_2x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which is Pythagoras' theorem.

===The Summation Convention===

Indexes that appear as both subscripts and superscripts are summed over.

&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} x^\mu x^\nu = g_{11} x_1x_{1}^' + g_{12} x_1x_2^' + g_{21} x_2x_{1}^' + g_{22} x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

by promoting &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; to a superscript it is taken out of the summation ie:.

&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu}^\nu x^\mu x^\nu = g_{1\nu} x_1x_{\nu}^' + g_{2\nu} x_2x_{\nu}^'&lt;/math&gt;

===Matrix Multiplication in Indicial Notation===

Consider:

Columns times rows:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_1 &amp; y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 y_1 &amp; x_1 y_2 \\
x_2 y_1 &amp; x_2 y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Matrix product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{XY} = x_iy_j &lt;/math&gt; Where i = 1, 2 j = 1, 2 

There being no summation the indexes are both subscripts.

Rows times columns:
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 &amp; x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 y_1 &amp; x_2 y_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{XY} = \delta_{ij} x^iy^j &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is known as Kronecker delta and has the value 0 when &lt;math&gt;i \ne j &lt;/math&gt; and 1 when &lt;math&gt;i = j &lt;/math&gt;. It is the indicial equivalent of the unit matrix:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

There being summation one value of i is a subscript and the other a superscript.

A matrix in general can be specified by any of:

&lt;math&gt;M_{i}^j&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;M_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;M^{i}_j&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;M^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depending on which subscript or superscript is being summed over.

===Vectors in Indicial Notation===

A vector can be expressed as a sum of basis vectors.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\mathbf{e}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

In indicial notation this is: &lt;math&gt;x = a^ie_i &lt;/math&gt;

===Linear Transformations in indicial notation===

Consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{Ay}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; are coordinate matrices.

In indicial notation this is: 

&lt;math&gt;x^{\mu} = A^{\mu}_{\nu} x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; 

which becomes:

&lt;math&gt;x_1 = a_{11} x^{'}_1+ a_{12} x^{'}_2+ a_{13} x^{'}_3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 = a_{21} x^{'}_1+ a_{22} x^{'}_2+ a_{23} x^{'}_3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_3 = a_{31} x^{'}_1+ a_{32} x^{'}_2+ a_{33} x^{'}_3&lt;/math&gt;

===The Scalar Product in indicial notation===

In indicial notation the scalar product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x.y} = \delta_{ij} x^i y^j &lt;/math&gt;

==Analysis of curved surfaces and transformations==

It became apparent at the start of the nineteenth century that issues such as Euclid's parallel postulate required the development of a new type of geometry that could deal with curved surfaces and real and imaginary planes. At the foundation of this approach is Gauss's analysis of curved surfaces which allows us to work with a variety of coordinate systems and displacements on any type of surface.

Elementary geometric analysis is useful as an introduction to Special Relativity because it suggests the physical meaning of the coefficients that appear in coordinate transformations.

Suppose there is a line on a surface. The length of this line can be expressed in terms of a coordinate system. A short length of line &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; in a two dimensional space may be expressed in terms of Pythagoras' theorem as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta s^2 = \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/SUP&gt;Suppose there is another coordinate system on the surface with two axes: x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;, &lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, how can the length of the line be expressed in terms of these coordinates? Gauss tackled this problem and his analysis is quite straightforward for two coordinate axes: 

'''Figure 1:'''

[[Image:constudtensor.gif]]

It is possible to use elementary differential geometry to describe displacements along the plane in terms of displacements on the curved surfaces:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta Y = \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Y}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Delta Z = \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Z}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The displacement of a short line is then assumed to be given by a formula, called a metric, such as Pythagoras' theorem

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = \Delta Y^2 + \Delta Z^2&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta Z &lt;/math&gt; can then be substituted into this metric:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = ( \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Y}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2} )^2 + ( \Delta x_1 \frac {\delta Z}{\delta x_1} + \Delta x_2 \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} )^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which, when expanded, gives the following:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} ) \Delta x_1 \Delta x_1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; +( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} ) \Delta x_2 \Delta x_1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; + ( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_1}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_1} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} ) \Delta x_1 \Delta x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; + ( \frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_2}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_2} ) \Delta x_2 \Delta x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

This can be represented using summation notation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 =  \sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{k=1}^2 (\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_i}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x_k}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_i} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x_k} ) \Delta x_i \Delta x_k &lt;/math&gt;

Or, using '''indicial''' notation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = g_{ik} \Delta x^i \Delta x^k &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt; g_{ik} = (\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x^i}\frac{\delta Y}{\delta x^k}  + \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x^i} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta x^k} ) &lt;/math&gt;

If the coordinates are not merged then &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on both sets of coordinates. In matrix notation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta s^2 = \mathbf{g} \Delta \mathbf{x} \Delta \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

becomes:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1 &amp; \Delta x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1 \\
\Delta x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where a, b, c, d stand for the values of &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1a + \Delta x_2c &amp; \Delta x_1b + \Delta x_2d \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x_1 \\
\Delta x_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which is:

&lt;math&gt;(\Delta{x_1}a + \Delta{x_2}c) \Delta{x_1} + (\Delta{x_1}b + \Delta{x_2}d) \Delta{x_2} = \Delta{x_1}^2a + 2\Delta{x_1}\Delta{x_2}(c + b) + \Delta{x_2}^2d&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \Delta{x_1}^2a + 2\Delta{x_1}\Delta{x_2}(c + b) + \Delta{x_2}^2d&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2&lt;/math&gt; is a '''bilinear form''' that depends on both &lt;math&gt;\Delta{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta{x_2}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be written in matrix notation as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \mathbf{\Delta{x}^T A \Delta{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where A is the matrix containing the values in &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case of the bilinear form known as the quadratic form because the same matrix (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta{x}}&lt;/math&gt;) appears twice; in the generalised bilinear form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{x^TAy}&lt;/math&gt; (the matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; are different).

If the surface is a Euclidean plane then the values of gik are:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp; \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \\
\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp; \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which become:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

So the matrix A is the unit matrix I and:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \mathbf{\Delta{x^T} I \Delta{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta{s}^2 = \Delta{x_1}^2 + \Delta{x_2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem yet again.

If the surface is derived from some other metric such as &lt;math&gt;\Delta{s^2} = -\Delta{Y}^2 + \Delta{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; then the values of gik are:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
-\delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp;  -\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} \\
-\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_1} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_1} &amp;  -\delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Y}/\delta{x_2} + \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \delta{Z}/\delta{x_2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which allows the original metric to be recovered ie: &lt;math&gt;\Delta{s^2} = -\Delta{x_1}^2 + \Delta{x_2}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

It is interesting to compare the geometrical analysis with the transformation based on matrix algebra that was derived in the section on indicial notation above:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{s.s} = g_{11} x_1x_{1}^' + g_{12} x_1x_2^' + g_{21} x_2x_{1}^' + g_{22} x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

Now, 

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

ie:
&lt;math&gt;g_{11} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{12} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{21} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{22} = 1&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_{1}^' + x_2x_{2}^'&lt;/math&gt;

If there is no rotation of coordinates the scalar product is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s.s} = x_1x_1 + x_2x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem. However, the reader may have noticed that Pythagoras' theorem had been assumed from the outset in the derivation of the scalar product (see above).

The geometrical analysis shows that if a metric is assumed and the conditions that allow differential geometry are present then it is possible to derive one set of coordinates from another.  This analysis can also be performed using matrix algebra with the same assumptions.

The example above used a simple two dimensional Pythagorean metric, some other metric such as the metric of a 4D Minkowskian space:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^2 = - \Delta T^2 + \Delta X^2 + \Delta Y^2 + \Delta Z^2&lt;/math&gt;

could be used instead of Pythagoras' theorem.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Problem with step by step==
If you do the following:

4. Insert every chapter like a template, preceded by chapter title. Remember about chapter with list of authors.

    = Chapter name =
    {{:Book/Chapter name}}

And the chapter already includes the chapter name then in the contents menu on the print version the chapter's name will appear twice, one as a subtitle of the other.

Doesn't this need to be changed? [[User:Glich|Glich]] ([[User talk:Glich|talk]]) 16:29, 23 July 2008 (UTC)


== Deeper explanation of &quot;Creating separate page for print version&quot; required? ==
Could someone take some time to provide a more in depth explanation of the steps needed in the section &quot;Creating separate page for print version&quot;. For example, step 3 mentions &quot;Copy the TOC as an ordered list&quot;. Does this mean just the text on the web page as I see it, or the wikitext or html code which is behind the TOC? I looked at the proposed reference work (Python Programming) but don't quite understand whether they created their TOC, or whether there is a way for wikibooks to create it for me that I am supposed to use. 

Can someone provide some clarification? Many thanks. --[[User:Codinghead|Codinghead]] ([[User talk:Codinghead|talk]]) 11:18, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright inclusion ==
In [[Ada Programming]] we already have a &quot;print version&quot; in [[Ada Programming/All Chapters]] so I followed the additional recomendations and have added the template and included the GFDL text. I wonder whether this last inclusion is really necessary; it adds too much text to the page and what is worst, it adds the page to the [[:Category:Wikibooks enforced policies]]. Could an administrator at least use the noinclude tag around the category? Otherwise we need other method for including the GFDL text. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:40, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

: Ok, done, adding noinclude helped.
: About GFDL problem: yes, it is strictly required that any print version of text under GFDL license has full text of the license. In fact, we should also include it in all our pages, but we &quot;cheat&quot; a bit by providing only link to the license text. Yes, GFDL is a stupid license, but unfortunately when Wikibooks were created there was no better alternative (like CC-BY-SA license). It's too late to change anything so we are stick to GFDL forever. Remember, when you create your own wiki, never ever use GFDL, maybe except dual-licensing ;-) --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:13, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::I reread the license and I don't think we are cheating since we follow the requirements of section titled [[GNU Free Documentation License#6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS]].   Actually I don't see any problem on using the GFDL for a wiki. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 23:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Automatic generation of print version pages from a navigational map ==

Take a look at [[m:User:Nigelk/Nav]] and [[m:User:Nigelk/ConcatPages]]. This extension could be used to keep the TOC of the book synchronized with the print version. This extension also automatically adds next/up/previous links to the pages listed in the TOC page, aka nav map. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

== No Print Question ==

If I do the following:

:To prevent block of text from being printed, cover it with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

and the block of text contains a header. Is there a way to also not show the header in the TOC?
:Try &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;   It solved some problems for me [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 14:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Inclusion of Module Sections? ==

Is there a way to link a module's section from the print version's page, but not include the entire module as well? I was thinking about creating an Endnotes page for some books instead of having footnotes at the end of each chapter. I tried &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Book/Module#SectionName}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but no luck. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 23:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

: Not quite sure what, precisely, you're asking. If you want to include only parts of the module in the &quot;all-pages&quot; version, you can use the &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt; tag to mark the parts that you don't want included. If you want all the endnotes included, you may have to make each module's endnote section a seperate page and include it both at the end of each module as well as in the &quot;all-pages&quot; endnote page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:47, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

== Patent and PDF ==

I noticed that PDF is the file type of choice. Due to the various patents surrounding this format, it should be avoided. Wikimedia takes a stance against similar formats such as MP3, AVI and, to a lesser extent, GIF/JPG. How about promoting the use of ODF and other unencumbered (but equally powerful) formats? --[[User:OldakQuill|OldakQuill]] 15:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
: AFAIK JPG cannot be substituted and I haven't heard of any instructions from any Wikimedia project to avoid JPG files. Currently, PDF is the only reasonable publication format: it can be viewed in various web browsers and operating systems. I don't see any alternative and in my opinion it's not Wikimedia Foundation role to promote free software and new standards. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
::I'm not simply talking about advocacy. Patents often put a burden on Wikimedians to pay various companies whenever they create a file in a patented format. This is precisely the reason why we do not allow MP3 files. ODF is a very viable, flexible alternative. PNG can be used in the place of most JPG files. --[[User:OldakQuill|OldakQuill]] 12:39, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

::: Certainly I'm all in favor of open file formats, including the [[w:OpenDocument]] format (ODF) developed by OASIS. Certainly *some* patent holders require a license fee to use their license. However, the wikipedia article on pdf [[w:pdf]] claims that PDF is also an open file format. Also, according to the wikipedia article on pdf, &quot;Anyone may create applications that read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to Adobe Systems; Adobe holds a number of patents relating to PDF but licenses them royalty-free for use in developing software that complies with its PDF specification.&quot;
::: Likewise, since the LZW patent has expired, [[w:GIF]] is now a open file format (and free). But PNG is technically superior to GIF, even if it is no longer &quot;morally&quot; superior, so I still recommend converting all GIFs to PNG.
::: I don't know enough about ODF vs PDF to know whether one is technically superior to another. But it seems reasonable to me for ODF advocates to post ODF versions, so that users have a choice of viewing a Wikibook in HTML/XHTML, PDF, or ODF.
::: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 04:16, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

== Don't over complicate task of book making ==

I can understand the open source community has its roots in programming but word processing is a common thing. You don't need to use a programming language to make pdfs or even E-books the programming has already been done for you from many many sources. If you can have an HTML page you can make it into an RTF page, if you can make it into an RTF page you can edit it in any number of word processing programs and print it out into PDF form or MSReader form or Palm Doc form. I've done all this countless times. I've taken text files off of Gutenberg.org and done everything from making them into paperbacks you can hold in your hand to e-books for e-readers -- ALL FROM COMMONLY AVAILABLE PROGRAMS (pardom my volume) -- MSWord and WordPerfect being the most common. The point is DON'T set it up as a specialist's task but one countless people can accomplish from their home computers. ALL the Wikibooks should be available in downloadable format. Infact MULTIPLE formats ... HTML, palm Doc, MSWord Doc, MSReader, PDF and whatever else format is requested. Set a place where the source text is available for book makers and you'll get them back from home book makers as quick as you can write or devise them. -- Thank you. JN

== Print version tag prints! ==

I have including the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Print version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag on the [[A-level Computing]] page, as I am trying out the print version to see how it looks (no where near finished i know!).  However the tag appears on the printed version, [[A-level Computing/Print version]].  Using the div noprint tag doesn't get rid of it!?!  any suggestions [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 14:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:'''Solved'''Try &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 14:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== More tips on PDF creation ==

Can you explain me, step by step, how do you create PDF files from print versions? I tried method described in [[Help:Print versions#PDF versions]] but it did not work. I was saving true print version (without navigation bar, print version notice and so on) as HTML file with images using Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer and opening them as HTML file in OpenOffice.org 2.0.2 and Microsoft Word 2003. None of these combinations worked. The thing I got in word processor was text with print version notice, section edit links and so on. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

:I save articles as &quot;Web page complete&quot;. MS Word displays the files properly for me (looking like the Print Version) provided they are small (under 50 pages). Larger files may need breaking into parts for viewing. Recently I have used Wordpad to &quot;top and tail&quot; the files before viewing. I remove all the unnecessary code before the BODY tag and after the end of text, before the /BODY tag. I just stick the standard HTML HEAD /HEAD sequence in front of the BODY tag. 

:Once the file has been saved as a word processor file it looks like the Print Version but does have irritating additions such as section templates still in place. I chop off the Print Version heading and any Table of Contents and use recorded macros in Word to cut out all the repeating elements that are not needed such as &quot;edit&quot; links and templates. I then page through the whole file looking for headings that have the wrong 'level', links that are incorrect and missing graphics. If there is a missing graphic I go to the online version and copy and paste the graphic into place. Once the text looks OK I insert a Cover Page and Table of Contents at the start. The whole process takes about 45 minutes for a 200 page book so it is a labour of love if you are a busy person. Once the Word Document is complete I print it to file using PDF Creator and upload.  

:Some books make Word 'hang' when you try to view them as HTML. The only way round this (that I have found) is to chop them into pieces, top and tail the small files with HTML tags and combine them in Word. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)


== How to stop template appearing in print version ==

How can I stop a navigational template from appearing in a print version? [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 15:05, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:there are a number of ways to go about doing this, although the nuances can be tricky. The easiest way to stop something from appearing in a print version is to surround the text of the navigational aide in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. The templates will still appear on the print version page, but will not appear on the paper when you print it. If you need a better solution, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:59, 1 April 2007 (UTC)


:An other solution is &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Tempalte}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:-- [[User:MichaelFrey|MichaelFrey]] 15:57, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks it worked. [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 15:23, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

== Something that editors may find useful ==

To create manual page breaks in the print version, use {{tl|Print version page break}}. According to an HTML comment inside the template, it only works in Firefox. [[User:JeremyMcCracken|JeremyMcCracken]] ([[User talk:JeremyMcCracken|talk]]) 21:52, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

== MediaWiki to LaTeX conversion for printing ==

I've written a [http://www.osresearch.net/wiki/index.php/LaTeX_and_MediaWiki MediaWiki to LaTeX] conversion script that ties into the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Pdf_Export ExportPDF extension] to produce high-quality PDF documents on the fly from Mediawiki pages.  There are also a set of templates that go with the script to allow index generation, references, citations, abstracts, epigraphs, equations and figures.  There is preliminary support for fairly complicated markup like the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, which is converted into floating subfigures, and tables, which are converted into floating tables inside of figures.  I'm still working on bibliographies and style sheets.

It is still very much in beta, but I hope that it proves useful for other users.

== Move to the Help namespace ==

I propose we move this page to the Help namespace. It is, in essence, a page helping users get a task done on Wikibooks, not about the Wikibooks site or community.

== move to Using Wikibooks ==

I propose we move this page (again), making it a module of the &quot;[[Using Wikibooks]]&quot; book.
Would &quot;Using Wikibooks/Print versions&quot; be appropriate?

      <text xml:space="preserve">the tutorial is still under contruction.

ive added a little more.

== Could be simplyfied ==

You may use simple boxes instead of circles and then slapping a SubSurf modifier on the model. Or spinning a profile of the whole cup. --[[User:DanMan|DanMan]] 10:38, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Very confusing and not specific enough. ==

There are many parts in this tutorial that just simply do not explain what is going on.  In te first part it doesn't even say how far to extrude the cube face, because in the picture is is obviously not the same length of the cube.  Secondly, when it says extrude 12 more times, once again, it does not explain how far to extrude each face.  Some extrusions are extremely long while others are much shorter.  This need much better directions.

I added a better image showing the extrusion blueprint [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 03:15, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

== User Notes From Main Article ==

(User note: I didn't do this tutorial because it didn't explain important things. I suggest you skip this tutorial and move on.)

(Fallen Fate: I think that this is a good tutorial to try out your creativity skills because it allows the user to fill in the blanks so to speak while giving the main idea.)

(User note: i found it much easier to use the spin method that was used to make the simple hat)

== Potential Problem ==

Although this tutorial is rather unspecific, I was able to use the images, instruction and my own idea of what the author was aiming for to create the &quot;box version&quot; of the goblet. Following this, however, I had significant amounts of grief trying to get the curved look of the cup part of the goblet as shown in the tutorial photo (labeled &quot;Applied SubSurf modifier&quot;). No matter what I tried I couldn't get the SubSurf function to behave the way I wanted it to. The body instead looked like a cylinder with a flat bottom. I used the Set Smooth function like he said and even the smooth ability multiple times, as well as other functions I am less familiar with to try to bevel the bottom part of the container. In the end, the entire problem was remedied with the simple vertex command Remove Doubles. Apparently there were too many excess vertices which interfered with the Subsurf modifier. 

I just figured I might save someone out there an hour or so by sharing ...


== Extra part ==

I found the beginning of the tutorial fine. They didn't specify the amount you extrude and scale by but you sound be able to work it out instead of being spoon-fed

I could not get the base right however. 

But what I most found difficult was the extra part. My goblet did not look like the one in the final picture at all. It did not have that &quot;glass&quot; look. Are we suppose to do something with the colour in the plane??

== Page now links to the new Cylinder version ==
I've done a version of this tutorial but starting from a cylinder rather than a cube as here.

I've modified the forward link to insert the new page between this page and &quot;Simple Vehicle Part I&quot;.

Hope you like the new page.

==Problem with Shadow?==
I found a surefire way to get that transparent shadow-- open your light settings-whether a lamp, spot, sun, etc. Under &quot;Shadow and Spot&quot;, there are two main buttons: RayShadow and Buf. shadow. The default should be Buf. shadow. But Buf. Shadow (shadow buffer) is a plain shadow. Click &quot;Rayshadow&quot; and It will use Raytracing for the shadow, allowing for that perfect Transparent shadow. Note: Render times will extend a little bit more.

== General Suggestion ==

The tutorial gets completely confusing for newbies, when people start discussions and adding notes on the tutorial page. 

Suggestion: All disscussions, notes, remarks, whatsoever should be moved to this discussion page.

==Streamline the tutorial with functions mentioned in the previous tutorials==
I think later tutorials should build on the knowledge from the previous tutorials to speed up learning.
For example, in this tutorial we could assume the reader is already familiar with the multi-cut knife tool.
If that's the case then the first part of the tutorial is tedious and ineffective. Instead of extruding the same face 12(!) times, 
we can:&lt;br/&gt;
1) make a single extrusion of length 5&lt;br/&gt;
2) cut it with the multi-cut tool along the X axis into 10 pieces &lt;br/&gt;
3) select unnecessary edge loops and delete them&lt;br/&gt;
4) make 2 extrusions on the other side&lt;br/&gt;

== Your building a sky scraper ==
keep in mind that this is actually a giant goblet, almost like a sky scraper! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 03:12, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

== combining the transparent glass section with the lighting page ==
I think the bottom half of this page needs to go into the lighing tutorial that follows it, with a better quick breakout of how to light it, and get a transparent, or a reflective ray tranced surface [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 19:48, 14 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

I think that תלמידה/תלמיד should be in place of סְטוּדֶנְטְ/סְטוּדֶנְטית Any thoughts?

[[User:EyalDr|EyalDr]] 20:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC) &quot;Student&quot; can be translated as תלמיד/תלמידה and as סטודנט/סטודנטית. It depends if we're talking about a high school student (תלמיד) or a college student (סטודנט).

----

Not to be a stickler and comment on every page I come across here on WikiBooks.org, but there is an error with the transliteration of the phrases for asking how someone (m or f) is.

Rather than being transliterated as: &quot;How are you? (to a man, Ma sh'lome)&quot; and &quot;How are you? (to a woman, Ma sh'loma)&quot; it should read as &quot;How are you? (to a man, Ma sh'lomcha)&quot; and &quot;How are you? (to a woman, Ma sh'lomech)&quot;

The examples given on the page are completely wrong. Even taking into account this missing chet transliteration for each example, even the genders have been mixed up and dont match with the given hebrew of each example.

Thanks,

==Merge or Reorganize==
I agree about the merge-in (because the [[Hebrw Conv 1]] page is redundant), but not all of the other page belongs in pronouns.  I suggest that some of it go into other appropriate pages (re questions or common phrases).  See the [[Talk:Hebrew]] page for some organizational suggestions. --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 21:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)


==Babel Template for He-0==
Would someone be willing to create a Babel template for He-0 (that is, a notice that can be used on a user page explaining that the user does not know Hebrew).    (Reference:  [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Babel]])  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 21:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

== RTL issues ==

Mixing LTR and RTL in my browser is exceedingly frustrating.  As can be seen in the dialog, inserting a break (using Latin characters) confuses the browser and sticks the trailing question mark at the beginning of the sentence!  Can a more proficient typist than I fix this? [[User:Dancxjo|Dancxjo]] 01:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Proof:'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

According to the Cauchy criterion for series convergence, exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;
so that for all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;m,n&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

We know that:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;/math&gt;

And then we get:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Now we get:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Which is exactly the Cauchy criterion for series convergence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Embouchure ==

The embouchure is an essential part of creating a good tone; it's like a carefully crafted doorway that the air stream flows through.  The embouchure has only one job, and it should feel the same all the time, and that job is to allow the airflow to act upon the clarinet so that the best possible quality of sound results.  Keith Stein calls the clarinet embouchure a combination of &quot;sets and draws,&quot; meaning that you set some muscles and pull on others.  And David Pino writes that only one basic embouchure setting is needed for the entire range of the clarinet (assuming the reed is doing what it's supposed to.)  The clarinet embouchure is so sensitive that the subtle, most minute change in the muscular structure can result in variations of tuning and color that the clarinet is producing.

== Relaxation ==

Playing the clarinet is all about comfort. For most, standing is preferred during auditions - it is actually best if the player sits in a comfortable straight chair, which is to say that a normal chair with padding on the seat and the back would be perfect (best without any arms,) but a chair like a recliner would be unacceptable.  The idea of being comfortable is so that the player relaxes, so that there is no extra tension anywhere in the body. Extra tension would start at the airflow, which would trickle down to the embouchure, which would give the player a bad sound, then the player would be confused as to why the clarinet is producing a worse sound, so with the sound the tonguing would be off, and finally the technique would go wrong as well.  That just shows you how important relaxation is! Clarinets are cool but as long as you are relaxed and comfortable there is nothing to worry about

== Embouchure Formation ==

Before actually touching mouth to mouthpiece, it is best if the player does a preliminary exercise to further prove the point of how everything should feel the same.  First, with the reed, mouthpiece, and ligature together, take the mouthpiece and hold it sideways to the light.  Look to see where the reed and the mouthpiece touch; this is where your bottom lip will touch.  Now stretch your bottom lip across your bottom teeth so that the red part of the lip is on top of the teeth. This should, in turn, make your chin &quot;dimple.&quot; Though it does, keep your chin flat and pointing downward.  This is one of the most important parts of the embouchure, since if you don't keep your chin flat, drool will run down your chin.  Now instead of a mouthpiece, take your thumb and place it inside your mouth, and gently lay your top teeth down.  You should not be biting your thumb, but the purpose of the top teeth is to merely hold the mouthpiece in place.  Now exhale air as if you were to produce a good airflow, and gradually close your lips around your thumb, being sure that your chin is still flat, and your to teeth are lightly resting on your thumb.  Close your lips around your thumb until all of the air stops leaking from your mouth.  Take note of what this feels like, this is what it should always feel like when you are playing the clarinet.  Your abdomen muscles have a constant pressure against them, you have a certain amount of speed that your air is moving (imagine that its moving, the pressure will feel the same,) your chin is flat, and your top teeth are just sitting there.  Try this a couple of times, then try blowing faster air, you will find that you don't need any much more muscle in your lips to keep it from leaking.

Now take your mouthpiece and barrel joint assembled in your right hand, and take your left hand and place it over the bottom of the barrel, and do the same thing.  After that take your left hand away from the barrel, and again, do the same thing.

This is a great exercise to help get an idea of what things should feel like.  To create an embouchure this way is very unnatural for the human lip, so it will take a good deal of practice to concentrate on the airflow and embouchure at the same time, but that's okay - Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.  These are issues that college students still have to address, and some instances the beginning college student doesn't know how to create a good airflow, or a good embouchure until his or her instructor teaches the player.  Your teacher may have a different exercise he or she may want you to do, as stated in the introduction, these are guidelines, this will never take the place of individual instruction.

Besides the standard embouchure described above, a small number of clarinetists use a technique taught by Auguste Périer at the Paris Conservatory early in the 20th Century. Rather than resting the upper teeth on the mouthpiece, the upper lip is rolled over them in a manner similar to the lower.

This technique, which is more difficult to acquire than the standard one, requires slow, careful development of the musculature in the upper lip. A beginner should not try to use it more that five minutes during a practice session during the first couple of months. Otherwise, there is risk that the muscles will be damaged, making it impossible to employ this technique.

To compensate the difficulty learning the “double lip” technique, practitioners contend that it produces a fuller, sweeter sound. Famous clarinetists who have used double lip include Ralph McLean, Harold Wright, Kalmen Opperman and his students, who include many orchestral players including Steven Hartman and soloists including Richard Stoltzman.

== '''The Big Misconception''' ==

A big misconception about the clarinet embouchure is that it should look like you're smiling. This is not true at all!  The &quot;smiling&quot; exercise will allow air-leaks, will tire out the embouchure more quickly, and will create more tension on the reed, making a good clarinet sound harder to produce.

== Holding the Clarinet ==

This section to this &quot;subchapter&quot; is in in its place because the author has decided that holding the clarinet has everything to do with how the face looks.  The clarinet should be held at a thirty-five to forty degree angle. When assembled, the clarinet's bell should either be between the players knees, or a little closer than that.  The idea is that you want the airflow to go through the clarinet as easily as possible, i.e. a straight line.  If the clarinet is positioned too far up, then the air bounces back and forth between the reed and the mouthpiece before settling in at a straight line, and this squeezes the reed so that you can't produce a good sound (this problem is more common that holding the clarinet too closely.)  Holding the clarinet too close makes the airflow bounce off the bore of the mouthpiece, and though its a little different from holding it too far away, it's just as ineffective.  In some rare cases the clarinet may have to be held a little higher or lower than normal due to its players dental condition. Those with overbites tend to need the clarinet closer to them while those with under-bites tend to need the clarinet away from them, and from then on its just how the teeth are arranged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A definition of war would be helpful here.

&quot;However, throughout history there are as many invasions and annexations that did not lead to a war, such as the U.S.-led invasion of Haiti in 1994&quot;
Depending on your definition of war, the US intervention in Haiti in 1994 could be seen as causing the recent (2004?) overthrow of Aristide.  Also, Cedras allowed the US-led forces into Haiti (as did Aristide, whatever scrap of power he had), so although Powell et al verbally threatened that they would invade anyway if they didn't have Cedras's permission, isn't that the point of diplomacy?  If they had his permission, it wasn't an act of aggression.  Obviously this is a detailed topic, but I don't believe it is a good example for what you are saying.

Also, discussion of old wars versus new wars would be good (Kaldor, van Creveld, etc), as would perhaps more of a discussion on political philosophy's different views of war</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Finland|Finland]]

'''Vorschmack''' has long traditions in Finnish cuisine. Vorschmack can be served as an everyday meal, as well as a festive speciality. To be served heated, with pickled beetroot in vinegar, pickled cucumber and sour cream.

The Savoy restaurant is located on the top floor of Eteläesplanadi 14 in Helsinki. The restaurant has traditions that go back generations. One of the frequented guests in the 1920’s and 1930’s was [[w:Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Marshal Mannerheim]]. Mannerheim’s table at the Savoy was always reserved, and out of respect no one would ever consider demanding to be seated there. Vorschmack was one of Mannerheim’s favorite appetizers.

==Ingredients==

* 4 lbs. (1800g) boned leg of [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]]
* ½ lbs. (225g) of boned [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* six [[Cookbook:Herring|herring fillets]] in [[Cookbook:Brining|salt brine]]
* one can of [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]], about 2 ounces (60g)
* 5 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* five [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Let the herring fillets soak in 1 G cold water over night. Dry the fillets on paper towels. Preheat the oven to 400°F (220°C). Cut the meat in 1&quot; (2.5cm) cubes. Slice the onions. Arrange the meat and onion in a greased baking dish and roast on the medium shelf until golden brown (about 15-20 minutes).
# Let the dish cool, and then grind the contents with the herring and anchovy using a meat grinder. In a large bowl, add some water to the mixture to give it the consistency of thick porridge. Season with white pepper and pressed garlic.
# Place the contents in a baking dish. Spread out some tomato paste over the surface of the mixture. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for two hours. Add water if the Vorschmack looks dry. If the consistency is too light, continue baking to evaporate excess water. The consistency should resemble thick hot porridge.
# Serve hot with baked potatoes, smetana and a shot of ice cold vodka, filled to the rim. The saltiness of the Vorschmack is regulated by the time used to soak the herring fillets. For high saltiness, let the herring soak two hours, for low saltiness let them soak eight hours.

'''Green Chili Stew''' is a New Mexican dish that is known as the beef stew of New Mexico.  It is a basic dish with as many variations as there are cooks. Usually served with tortillas or sopapillas.  

== Ingredient ==
* 2 pounds cubed stew meat
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 chopped onion
* 2 minced cloves of garlic
* 6 green New Mexican roasted and peeled chiles
* 2 peeled and dice potatoes
* 3 to 4 cups water
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 cup of celery
* 1 can of corn (2 if desired)

== Procedure ==
# Place the meat in a skillet and brown it in the oil, remove the meat and place it in a stock pot.
# Put the onions in the skillet, and sauté until they are browned. 
# Add the garlic and cook for an additional couple of minutes. 
# Remove them from the skillet and add to the meat. 
# Add all the remaining ingredients, and simmer for 1 to 2 hours or until the meat is very tender.

This is a delicious, refreshing, and simple Brazilian dessert. It does have some alcohol (Creme de Cassis -- blackcurrant liqueur), but a non-alcoholic blackcurrant syrup could be substituted.

==Ingredients ==
* 1 ripe [[cookbook:papaya|papaya]]
* 1 scoop [[cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|vanilla ice cream]]
* 1 tbsp [[cookbook:blackcurrant|blackcurrant liqueur]]
* 1 sprig of [[cookbook:mint|mint]] for decoration (optional)

== Procedure ==
;Method 1: 
#Peel papaya and remove seeds. [[cookbook:Cube|Cube]] the papaya. 
#Put papaya pieces in [[cookbook:blender|blender]] with ice cream and blackcurrant liqueur. [[cookbook:Puree|Blend]] well until smooth. 
#Pour into a small bowl and decorate with mint. 

;Method 2: 
#Peel papaya and remove seeds. Cube the papaya. 
#Put papaya pieces in blender with ice cream and blend until creamy consistency. 
#Pour some blackcurrant liqueur on the bottom of a large dessert glass. 
#Add the cream mixture. Add a swirl of blackcurrant liqueur on the top. 

;Method 3: 
#Cut papaya in half and remove seeds. Scoop papaya from peel with a spoon (this is easier and cleaner than peeling the fruit). 
#Place approximately equal portions of papaya and vanilla ice cream in a blender. Blend until creamy. 
#Place the mixture into a serving dish and pour about an ounce of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Crème liqueur#Crème de Cassis|Crème de Cassis]] on top.

Either way, it is best served immediately, but can be chilled for a short time.

Serves one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Common Lisp has much more support for performing number-crunching tasks than most programming languages. This is achieved by having support for large integers, rational numbers, and complex numbers, as well as many functions to work on them.

==Types of numbers==

The hierarchy of the '''number''' type is as follows:

*'''number'''
**'''real'''
***'''rational'''
****'''integer'''
*****'''fixnum'''
*****'''bignum'''
****'''ratio'''
***'''float'''
****'''short-float''' 
****'''single-float'''
****'''double-float'''
****'''long-float'''
**'''complex'''

===Fixnums and Bignums===
'''Fixnums''' are integers which are not too large and can be manipulated very efficiently. Which numbers are considered fixnums is implementation-dependant, but all integers in &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;-2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are guaranteed to be such.

'''Bignums''' are integers which are not fixnums. Their size is limited by the amount of memory allocated for Lisp, and as such they can be really large. Operations on them are significantly slower than on fixnums. Of course, that doesn't make them less useful.


===Ratios===
'''Ratios''' represent the ratio of two integers. They have the form ''numerator''/''denominator''. The function '''/''' which performs division always produces ratios when its arguments are integers or ratios. For example &lt;code&gt;(/ 1 2)&lt;/code&gt; will result in 1/2, not 0.5. Other arithmetic operations also work fine with ratios.

===Floats===
'''Float''' is short for [[w:floating-point number|floating-point number]], a datatype used to represent non-integer numbers in most programming languages. There are four kinds of floats in Common Lisp, which provide increasing precision (implementation-dependent).  By default, implementations assume short floats, which have limited precision.  To input a more precise float, other textual notations must be used, e.g., &quot;1.0d0&quot; for a double-float.

===Complex===
'''Complex''' is a datatype for representing [[w:complex numbers|complex numbers]]. The notation for complexes is #C(''real'' ''imaginary''). Real and imaginary parts are both either rational or floating-point. The operations that can be performed on complexes include all arithmetic operations and also many other functions which can be extended to complex numbers (such as exponentiation and logarithm).

==Numeric Operations==
The following functions are defined for all kinds of numbers:
*The arithmetical operations '''+''','''-''','''*''','''/''' are quite obvious (note, though, that they can have more than two parameters).
*'''sin''', '''cos''', '''tan''', '''acos''', '''asin''', '''atan''' provide trigonometric functions.
*The same, with '''h''' at the end (like '''asinh''') provide corresponding hyperbolic functions.
*'''exp''' and '''expt''' perform exponentiation. '''exp''' accepts one parameter and calculates e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;, while '''expt''' accepts two parameters (base and power).
*'''sqrt''' calculates the square root of a number.
*'''log''' calculates logarithms. If one parameter is supplied, the natural logarithm is calculated. If there are two parameters, the second parameter is used as the base.
*'''conjugate''' returns the [[w:complex conjugate|complex conjugate]] of a number. For real numbers the result is the number itself.
*'''abs''' returns the absolute value (or magnitude) of a number.
*'''phase''' returns the complex argument (angular component) of a number.
*'''signum''' returns a number with the same phase as its argument, but with unit magnitude.

The following functions are defined for specific kinds of numbers:
*'''gcd''' and '''lcm''' calculate [[w:greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] and [[w:least common multiple|least common multiple]] of several integers.
*'''isqrt''' returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the exact square root of a given natural number.
*'''cis''' calculates e&lt;sup&gt;iφ&lt;/sup&gt; where φ is supplied in radians.

==Comparison of numbers==

The following functions can be used for comparison of numbers. Each of these functions accepts any number of arguments.

*'''=''' returns '''t''' if all arguments are numbers of the same value and '''nil''' otherwise. Due to imprecise nature of floating-point numbers it is not advised to use '''=''' on them. 

*'''/=''' returns '''t''' if all arguments are numbers of ''different'' value. Note that &lt;code&gt;(/= a b c)&lt;/code&gt; is not always the same as &lt;code&gt;(not (= a b c))&lt;/code&gt;.

*'''&lt;''', '''&lt;=''', '''&gt;''', '''&gt;=''' check if their arguments are in the appropriate monotonous order. These functions can't be applied to complex numbers for obvious reasons.

*'''max''' and '''min''' return the largest and the least of their arguments, respectively.

==Numeric type manipulation==
These functions are used to convert numbers from one type to another.

*'''floor''', '''ceiling''', '''truncate''', '''round''' take two arguments: ''number'' and ''divisor'' and return ''quotient'' (an integer) and ''reminder''=''number''-''quotient''*''divisor''. The method for choosing the quotient depends on the function. '''floor''' chooses the largest integer that is not greater than ''ratio''=''number''/''divisor'', '''ceiling''' chooses the smaller integer that is larger than ''ratio'', '''truncate''' chooses the integer of the same sign as ''ratio'' with the largest absolute value that is less than absolute value of ''ratio'', and '''round''' chooses an integer that is closest to ''ratio'' (if there are two such numbers, an even integer is chosen). ''Note'': these functions return two values (see [[Programming:Common Lisp/Multiple values|Multiple values]]).
*'''ffloor''', '''fceiling''', '''ftruncate''', '''fround''' are the same as above but the ''quotient'' is converted to the same float type as ''number''.
*('''mod''' a b) returns the second value of ('''floor''' a b).
*('''rem''' a b) returns the second value of ('''truncate''' a b).
*'''float''' converts its first argument (a real) to a float. It may be useful to avoid slow operations with rational numbers (see example 1). The second optional argument may be supplied, which must be float - it will be used as a ''prototype''. The result would be of the same floating-point type as a prototype.
*'''rational''' and '''rationalize''' convert a real number to rational. When this number is a float '''rational''' returns a rational number that is mathematically equivalent to float. '''rationalize''' approximates the floating-point number. The former function usually produces ratios with a huge denominator so it's not as useful as you may think.
*'''numerator''' and '''denominator''' return the corresponding parts of a rational number.
*'''complex''' creates a complex number from its real part and imaginary part. Functions '''realpart''' and '''imagpart''' return real and imaginary part of a number.

==Predicates related to numbers==
Predicate returns a non-nil result if it's true and '''nil''' if it is false.
*'''zerop''' - the number is zero (there may be several zeros in Lisp - integer zero, real zero, complex zero, there may be negative zeros too).
*'''plusp''', '''minusp''' - the real number is positive/negative.
*'''evenp''', '''oddp''' - the integer is odd/even. 
*'''integerp''' - the number is integer (of the type '''integer''' - see type tree above).
*'''floatp''' - the number is float.
*'''rationalp''' - the number is rational.
*'''realp''' - the number is real.
*'''complexp''' - the number is complex.

'''Pumpkin bread''' is a type of quick bread that's popular in the United States in October and November when fresh pumpkins are in season. There are countless variations.

Although pumpkin bread and other pumpkin recipes are closely associated with [[cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] cuisine, these foods have a lengthy pre-Columbian history in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainstudies.org/databank/history/Anasazi.htm History of the Anasazi]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native Americans tribes developed their own pumpkin-based recipes prior to the arrival of European settlers in the New World. Native tribes taught those settlers how to dry pumpkin flesh and grind it into a meal for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art24245.asp The history of pumpkin as a food on BellaOnline]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pumpkin based foods are so old in North America that archaeologists have found pumpkin remnants among the 800-year-old ruins of the Anasazi in the southwestern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art24245.asp The history of pumpkin as a food on BellaOnline]&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a pumpkin bread recipe that's very easy as long as you use canned pumpkin. You can use fresh pumpkin, if you prefer, but you'll have to put a lot of work into cutting, boiling, peeling and mashing.

== Some Notes ==
If you plan on cooking this recipie in a bundt pan, you'll want to cover your pan for it to cook right. This will almost fill a standard aluminum bundt pan. In my gas oven, it needed almost exactly the full cooking time, and came out nice and moist.

This recipie may need some cloves, possibly a teaspoon of ground cloves.

'''Hot water crust''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]] used for savory [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]]s, such as pork pie and steak and kidney pie. As it contains [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], it is unsuitable for [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarians]]. Vegetable fat or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] can be substituted in equal measure, but the texture will be slightly different (and mouth-feel will be somewhat lighter) due to the &quot;grain&quot; of lard. 

== Ingredients ==

* 170g (6 oz) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 170ml (6 fl oz) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 85g (3 oz) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
* [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
# Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre.
# Place the water and lard into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] over low heat. When the lard has melted, bring to a boil.
# Pour the mixture into the centre of the flour.
# Working very quickly, mix with a wooden spoon.
# Knead with hands to produce a smooth dough.
# This pastry must be used while still warm; otherwise it will become brittle and hard to mould.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Sometimes an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg yolk]] is added to the flour and salt mixture.
* To shape the dough for a small pie, the bottom of a jam jar works well.

Has anyone actually had success with this recipe? I think someone might have messed things up when converting between volumes (i.e, cups) to weights (the current ounces). I tried using this recipe recently and the crust was way too soft; it wouldn't hold any sort of shape. Other recipes on the Internet have a much larger ratio of flour and lard to water. For instance, [http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-make-melton-mowbray-pork-pie this recipe] uses 16 oz flour, 6 oz lard and 3.5 oz milk. That's about a 6:1 ratio of flour:liquid, compared to the current 1:1 - which I think is a glaring disparity. Perhaps someone who's successfully made a hot water crust pastry before should look at this recipe?

'''Butter tea''', known as ''Po Cha'', is a traditional drink of the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibetans]] and is also consumed in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bhutan|Bhutan]]. Butter tea is an indispensable part of Tibetan life. Before work, a Tibetan will down several bowlfuls of this tangy beverage, and it is always served to guests. Since butter is the main ingredient, butter tea is a very warming drink and a good antidote to the cold, so it is especially suited to high altitudes. 

According to the Tibetan custom, butter tea is drunk in separate sips, and after each sip the host refills the bowl to the brim. Thus the guest never drains his bowl yet it is constantly topped up. If the visitor does not wish to drink, the best thing to do is leave the tea untouched until the time comes to leave and then drain the bowl. In this way etiquette is observed and the host will not be offended. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 tablespoon regular [[Cookbook:Tea|black tea]] (preferably [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Nepal|Nepalese]] or [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]])
* 3 cups whole [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (or 1½ cup &quot;half-and-half&quot;/&quot;cereal&quot; [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] + 1½ cup water)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

== Procedure == 
# Boil tea with milk for 2-10 min, depending upon the strength of tea desired
# Strain into tea cups. 
# Add butter and salt. Stir thoroughly - ideally by carefully using a blender - and serve. Makes two servings.

It is the most disgusting drink I've ever tasted. Please try it only if you want a bad taste in your mouth. I had to have lemon tea over it to mask the bad taste. It does not taste like tea, nor does it have much a butter flavour. I guess you'd have to get used to it to enjoy it. {{User:Nichalp/sg}} 15:12, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

'''Boilo''' is a traditional Yuletide drink of the north-eastern United States, specifically  Pennsylvania.

Boilo is a type of whiskey-based liqueur made with oranges, lemons, sugar and various different spices such as cinnamon.  Recipes vary and may include nutmeg, cloves, caraway seed and aniseed.

== Ingredients == 
* 2 medium-large [[cookbook:orange|orange]]s 
* 2 [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s
* 1 small box [[cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s (about 1½ ounces [40g])
* 8 oz (220g) [[cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 12 oz (355 mL) [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Whisky, whiskey|whiskey]] or more, to taste. Use a whiskey that is at least 80 proof (40% alcohol).
* ½ to 1 teaspoon each of any or all of these spices: [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[cookbook:clove|cloves]], [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seed]], [[Cookbook:Anise|aniseed]]

==Procedure==
#Make this in a [[Cookbook:Crock Pot|crock pot]]. It's easier than cooking on the stove and much less likely to overcook or scorch. For the quantities shown here, a small (1.5 quart) crock pot will do.
#Peel the oranges and lemons. Cut up the fruit and squeeze them into the crock pot. A [[Cookbook:Garlic Press|garlic press]] works, or some kind of juicer or fruit squeezer. Put the remaining fruit pulp into the crock pot as well.
#Add the raisins, honey, and spices. Stir.
#*NOTE: do not add whiskey yet!
#Start the crock pot and let the mixture cook for about 2-4 hours. Stir occasionally. It's complete when the fruit pulp gets cooked down.
#Strain into a pitcher. Mash down the fruit in the strainer to get all the liquid. Now add the whiskey to the pitcher and stir. If you cook the whiskey, even for a short time, the alcohol will start to evaporate . Taste, and add more whiskey to your liking.
#Serve hot in shot glasses, espresso cups, or coffee mugs. After the first round, each individual serving can be heated in the microwave.
#This recipe makes about 12 ounces (355 mL) of &quot;virgin&quot; boilo. Add 12 ounces of whiskey to this and you get 24 ounces (710 mL) of coal region nectar, enough for 12-18 servings.

== Introduction ==

Internet is bringing sweeping changes in most of our daily activities. It is offering access to news, banking services, business opportunities, mails, educational facilities and technology online at our desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. This has changed the overall ways and means, mode and methods of information dissemination. Here the only mantra is how fast the information can be sent to the end users. Like other fields, in the field of library and information science too it has made a great impact. It has changed the overall concept of libraries, role of librarians and has shown the library professionals how the information can be disseminated to their clientele at minimum cost, effort and time. With the fast growth and easy accessibility to internet, libraries either now or in the near future have to develop their own homepages to meet the wide information requirements of their clientele. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2 WEBSITE: its Definition

A web page is an electronic document, written in computer language called HTML, which can be viewed in the computer screen by using the Internet. A website, Web site or WWW site (often shortened to just site) is a collection of Web pages - that is, HTML/XHTML documents accessible generally via HTTP on the Internet; all publicly accessible websites in existence comprise the World Wide Web. The pages of a website will be accessed from a common root URL, the homepage, and usually reside on the same physical server. The homepage may be the only or the first page of a website, or may act as a guide to various carefully planned sections of a large professionally designed site. 

The technical definition of a website is that it is a distinct location on the Internet, identified by an IP address that returns a response code of 200 and a webpage in response to an HTTP request for the root page. The website consists of all interrelated webpages residing at the IP address. The URLs of the pages organize them into a hierarchy, although the hyperlinks between them control how the reader perceives the overall structure and how the traffic flows between the different parts of the site.

Homepage or Home may refer to: the start page or main web page of a website, the website of a group or individual, the page that is displayed when you enter only a domain name as URL (e.g. http://domain.tld), the URL or local file that is automatically loaded when a web browser starts. To take the visitors to other pages, the home page carries hyperlinks, so that one can jump between them by clicking on a link.

Websites are written in, or dynamically converted to, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and are accessed using a software package called a web browser. Web pages can be viewed on computers or various portable devices (PDAs, cell phones, etc.) that have Internet-capable functionality and an available Internet connection.

Static websites can be created using text editors like Notepad, or WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver. Active Server Pages (ASP), Java Server Pages (JSP) and/or a host of other dynamic web-scripting languages can also be used to generate web pages. Static content may also be dynamically generated periodically or if certain conditions for regeneration occur, (cached) to avoid the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis.

Dynamic HTML also provides for user interactivity and real-time element updating within web pages (ie - pages don't have to be loaded or reloaded to effect any changes), mainly using the DOM and JavaScript - support for which is built-in to most modern browsers.

A website also requires software known as an HTTP Server. Two very common examples include Apache, the most commonly used web server software used on the Internet (according to Netcraft statistics), and Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS). Often websites may include content that is pulled from one or more databases or using XML-based technologies such as RSS.
--------------------------------------------------------

3 LIBRARY WEBSITE: NEED AND PURPOSE 

The Library's website is built within the context of its hosting institution. It reflects the mission, objectives, and resources of the public library. “A library website is a virtual library service that should be no different than a fixed library facility, a clean well-lighted place filled with services and information for library users.” (Anderson: www.wiredlibrarian.com/htmlw/htmlfront.htm). The public library website &quot;statement of purpose&quot; should align with overall public library mission or philosophy. Many websites have their mission statements on an &quot;about this site&quot; or &quot;background&quot; page. The purpose of the public library's website mirrors a few of the Libraries' goals in the Strategic Plan (ie - learning, teaching, and scholarship). It emphasizes access and communication. Explore the statements below. These kinds of purpose statements can be found on many sites. One can use these to formulate his/her own statement of purpose.

3.1 Easy to understand: The visual or graphical information system of library website is more popular as compared to text based information system.

3.2 Shifting of the environment: Today’s generation heavily uses online shopping, banking and news reading, amongst other activities. They also prefer to transfer those experiences to other actions in their lives. This increases their expectation about the functionality of a library website and how one interacts with it. The new generation user may only be happy when they will be able to read from the computer screen.

3.3 Multiple function of same information: In the case of library websites which utilise hypertext, it is possible to structure and organize the same digital information in a variety of ways which serve multiple functions. 

3.4 Information explosion: A library website is expected to be able to handle the problem of information explosion in some way. It will be able to handle and manage large amounts of digital content by simply providing links - without actually procuring the document. 

3.5 Information retrieval: By using a library website, one will be able to retrieve specific information - for example, a particular image, photo, a definition and so on. Supplementary access to the library's resources, such as the online catalog and databases, its collections, services, and staff may also be available.

3.6 Distance learning: Provide a &quot;library without walls&quot; that can be accessed 24/7, anytime, anywhere, for example - from home, office or other places which are convenient to the user. 

3.7 To procure online publication: More and more information is going to be published over internet. A library website needs to be able to procure the online publication, such as electronic book, electronic journal and to provide links to important sources of information.

3.8 Facilitate the public library's mission of learning and teaching: improve information literacy, promote life-long learning, reading and literacy.

3.9 Communications channel: Through the library website, the user can have access to reference assistance at any time and from anywhere. 

3.10 Online help: Encourages positive, productive experiences - both in and out of the library - for children and young adults. Supports the sharing of student work and curriculum needs of teachers and research scholars.

3.11 Wide range of services: Provide access to community information with a wide range of other services, such as downloading of catalog records, reading and so forth.

3.12 Psychological need: Library users are changing and technology continues to evolve. Education is adapting to these changes and libraries need to anticipate the effect of these changes 
	-----------------------------------------------------

4. USERS OF LIBRARY WEBSITE
The primary audiences of the public library website are the general public - for example, children, students, teachers, researchers, faculty and staff of the public library. These people expect the website to help them facilitate their learning, teaching, and scholarships. The following tiers of users can be enumerated and ranked as the website's primary audiences with the understanding that services and collections created for lesser tiered audiences should not detract from the functionality and usability of services and collections of higher tiered audiences. Below is a list of possible audiences for public library websites. 

I). Students, teachers, scholars, administrators and board members of local schools. 
II). Parents and local community members.
III). Students, T=teachers, A=administrators and board members from other areas.
IV). People from outside the community or locality.
V). Staff of the particular library.
VI). People who arrive at library website site through a search for an unrelated topic.
VII). Users from all over the world, in other words - everybody else.

------------------------------------------------------------

5. LIBRARY WEBSITE: PROBLEMS IN DEVELOPMENT

In the Internet era, for a library to be recognized and its services to be made available globally, the creation of library website is indispensable. However, the huge costs involved in developing the necessary infrastructure such as owning and maintaining the web servers, high bandwidth internet connection, the required software, and the necessary technical knowledge has made it difficult for many libraries - especially in developing countries like India - to take steps in this direction. However, lack of funds or certain infrastructure should not be constraints for owning and designing a library website. With even minimal knowledge of HTML, librarians can develop homepages utilizing the services of web space providers like Geocities, Tripod, Xoom etc. The main problems in developing a library website are:

I) Lack of technically qualified manpower/librarian.
II) Lack of motivation of library staff.
III) Traditional view of the librarian.
IV) Lack of leadership role of the librarian.
V) Lack of common platform.
VI) Lack of funding.

--------------------------------------------------------------
6. PRINCIPLES FOR DESIGNING A LIBRARY WEBSITE:
The following Guiding Principles are suggested for the development of any library's website in order to provide excellent service to all users. These guidelines should be reviewed annually as capabilities are enhanced.

SELF DESCRIBING: The public library website should have enough information for completing a specific task. It should direct where to start, and move within the site's information architecture - in particular with relatiion to interpreting various categories and their labels.

CORRECTLY USE CAMPUS AND LIBRARY INDENTITY STANDARDS: Correct usage of names, logos and seals must be followed. 

INFORMED BY ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH AGENDAS: Wherever appropriate, the Library website design should be informed by the academic programs and research agendas of the campus.
 
PROVIDE TARGETED AND TIMELY RESPONSE: User interfaces should be designed to get users started in the direction most likely to result in success for their current need. The system should provide a response time that is acceptable to the user. 

BASED ON USER-CENTERED DESIGN: Design will be focused on how the user will use the system. This includes user testing and usability studies at the appropriate stages of the design process. 

FACILITATE COMMENT AND FEEDBACK: Users should be able to easily report problems they encounter with interfaces and search engines, databases and applications. Feedback forms should be readily available.
 
PROVIDE ACCESS ON and OFF-CAMPUS: Off-campus access should be as easy as on-campus access for authorized users. 

CONCISE:  Library web pages should be in a brief and concise format. 

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUTED AND UPDATED: To keep the website looking fresh and up-to-date it constantly needs to be reviewed as new capabilities are added. 

INTEGRATE VARIOUS INFORMATION SOURCES: Wherever appropriate, library web pages should provide, to each level of user, a single interface that transparently integrates separate resources (for example, the local catalog, the union catalog, the CDL directory, and perhaps information on / access to Library services). 

MAINTAIN USER TASK CONTEXT: The user interface should keep users informed about where they are in the session and, as much as possible, help them keep their place in the web-based user interfaces. 

MAINTAIN SETTING VISIBILITY: Make objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 

LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PLACES USER HAS TO GO TO SEARCH: Make access to the multitude of electronic resources easy and simple for the user to find. 
ABILITY TO SEARCH THE ENTIRE LIBRARY WEBSITE: (http://www.google.com/services). 

PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE BROWSERS: Access needs to allow for a number of different browsers and versions. 

HAVE ABILITY TO CHECK LINKS TO KEEP BROKEN LINKS TO A MINIMUM: Reduce the number of broken links by having them checked automatically periodically.

JARGON-FREE: The interface should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than using jargon, acronyms, and system-oriented terms. The names of library services and systems or their explanatory labels should reflect what they do. 

ORGANIZED, SIMPLE, AND CLEAN AND SHOW CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION, NAVIGATION, TERMINOLOGY AND CONTENT: To assist users in assessing the information interface should provide useful, consistent navigational tools (eg - navigation bars) that represent the most-used navigational features. Standard language and terminology should be used throughout the website to refer to the same activity or item. 

BROWSING OPTION:  A hierarchical, supplemental, or contextual browsing approach should be provided to user (http:// 42explore.com).

INDEXING:  Provide indexing of the entire website (http://www.boxesandarrow.com/archives/what_is a_control_vocabulary.php)
(http://www.boxesandarrow.com/archives/Creating_a_ Controlled _Vocabulary .php)

PROVIDE TIPS FOR IMPROVING SEARCH RESULTS: Assist users to refine their searches.
 
PROVIDE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON USE: Help screens should be easy to find and search, be focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out and be brief. 

REFER USER TO HUMAN ASSISTANCE: The site should be able to refer a user, who needs more help, to a person. 

COMPLY WITH ALL CAMPUS AND UCOP POLICIES: The library website should comply with all policies and guidelines. Copyright standards should be adhered to. 

COMPLY WITH ALL STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS: The website should comply with the American Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 requirements that information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. 

COMPLY WITH THE WEB content ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES: The website should comply with the web content accessibility guideline as outlined by the W3C http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/full-checklist.html .

DATA SECURITY AND INTEGRITY: All those intending to place information on the server should first seek approval from the authority.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS IN THE CREATION OF LIBRARY WEBSITE: The creation of homepage/ website and its subsequent hosting involves certain major steps such as signing with the webspace provider, creating contents, uploading the site by using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and so on. Each one of these has to be dealt with carefully to make the website live and interesting.

PLANNING: Why spend the time and effort to create a website that isn't used? All planning must start by exploring the users' information needs. Quality web resources begin with a user investigation that incorporates a wide range of tools to discover the information needs of the target audience. While the website entry page may be designed for a number of audiences, you'll want to focus selections to particular audiences. For example, the section for children should be written at a low reading level and contain developmentally-appropriate materials. A section designed for the elderly might contain larger font sizes to accommodate the visual needs of seniors.

SIGNING WITH THE FREE WEBSPACE PROVIDERS: A whole industry has been created around placing the website. Good placement can mean major increases in visitor traffic, leading to increased site visibility and users. A good number of service providers available on the Internet offer free webspace for developing homepages. The amount of space provided by them varies from company to company. Most of these services are ad-based - in other words, they are sponsored and will therefore have sponsor advertisements on the site. The advertisement may be a banner or a pop-up. It is needless to say that the service providers earn revenue from these advertisements. Therefore, while seeking free service, it becomes mandatory to accept certain conditions posed by the service providers. These ads really will not be distractions and make no much difference as these appear on top of the page or at a corner. There are some services which provide webspace without advertising being featured. However, this should not be the sole criterion for selecting service providers. Main consideration should be the speed, i.e., how fast the service provider's site gets loaded on to the browser and how fast will be the subsequent retrieval.
The following table gives a comparative statement of some of the major service providers.
Table-1
Website	Free Space Per account (in MB)	Advertisement	
www.1freespace.com	50	YES	
www.50megs.com	50	YES	
www.freeservers.com	20	YES	
www.geocities.com	15	YES	
www.netcolony.com	35	YES	
Free.prohosting.com	50	NO	
www.tripod.com	11	YES	
www.webjump.com	25	YES	
 A detailed comparative study of various service providers can be had from the website http://www.freewebspace.net, which eases the selection process.
On signing the agreement with the service provider, one can get user name and a password of one's choice. This user name later becomes the web address of a site on the internet. It is also known as URL (Uniform/Universal Resource Locator). 
An URL may look like: http://www.geocities.com/library/index.htm.
 
 CONTENTS ANALYSIS FOR THE WEBSITE:
After signing with the service provider, one has to create contents for library's homepage. However, people who are familiar with HTML can even keep the homepage ready before signing. There are certain tools, which can be had from the service providers if one is not acquainted with HTML. According to Eric Anderson, web developers should keep three simple ideas in mind: (1) keep it current, (2) develop as much local content as possible, and (3) make it interactive for your users.
           The library website should reflect the mission and the needs of  users. The content of the website is not very much different from the content of traditional, physical libraries, and therefore it contains tools to access bibliographic information, access to digital library services and collections, instructions for pedagogy, and last but not least, access to people who can help with all these processes -- librarians. The website is not designed to be comprehensive list of resources. Instead, it is designed to highlight the most significant resources and provide starting points for learning and research. The content of the website is very much like the content of traditional library pathfinders. 
It should be noted the things articulated in this dissertation were not conceived of arbitrarily. Analysis of existing strategic planning documents, extensive focus group interviews, surveys, usability tests, and many discussions with as many people as possible have all played a significant part in the creation of this document's content and so all these are should be consider before determine the content of a public library website. 
To start with, one can include the following information:
1. Brief introduction about library
2. Working hours
3. Details about Collection
4. List of Current journals
5. Journal Holdings list (Back volumes)
6. Monthly additions 
7. Staff
8. Services
9. Databases available etc.
10. Links to other sites (with a disclaimer)


IMPLEMENTATION 
	To create a homepage with above-mentioned contents, one needs to have an HTML editor. These editors are popularly called as WYSIWYG editors. These editors basically hide HTML codes and make creation of HTML pages a simple process just like word processing documents.  Netscape composer or Front Page Express can also be used to create a HTML page. These come along with Netscape and Internet Explorer respectively. The HTML pages can also be created using MS-WORD. People who are familiar with HTML are recommended to use text editors such Norton Editor, EDIT or NOTEPAD and then insert the HTML commands to get the desired output. 
	Whenever possible, the data transferred from the Web server to the browser will be in the form of XHTML documents. By adhering to the XHTML standards the Libraries will reap all the benefits of XML, namely, separation of presentation from content, compatibility with future Web standards, and the ability to reformat content for different purposes and reading devices (http://www.useit.comalertbox/20031222.html)(http://www.webstyleguide.com/site/index.html). 
	In the implementation phase the librarian or website designer can use a builder to create a web site from scratch for getting all necessary help. There are several types of website builders i.e. Online Website Builders, Offline Website Builder Programs etc.
Programs like Dreamweaver or FrontPage  of offline category are very popular among designers. But they are costly and require a learning curve. 

A). Technical Standards: Standards keep the Internet functioning efficiently. There are standards related to hardware, software, graphics, email, and almost everything related to the Internet. For information one can scan the following references
(Adkisson:http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/examining the role of de_facto_standards on the Web.php); (http://www.wigglebits.com/standards.html) (http://www.webstandards.org/).
B). How to pick a memorable website name and file name: When possible, the file names should be very short, and should represent the library and are of memorable value. File names should be less than 8 characters plus a file extension. The file extension can be .htm or .html. It doesn't matter. However it is better to maintain consistency. File names should be all lowercase letters. If you want to separate words use a dash - or underscore _. Your home page should be called index.html or index.htm. 
C). Folders/Directories: Create a folder for your website. Keep all files in this folder. Create subdirectories or additional folders for major areas of your website. The core page for each of these sections should be named index.html.
D). Use HTML and CSS to build web pages: HTML is the language used to build websites. You can do amazing things with so little of it. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can create and control the style of the page (colors, sizes, spacing) but also the layout (the position of text, navigation, graphics). 
E). How much screen should your website use: Some websites that don't use up all of the available space. Building liquid designs fixes this problem of by making the layout fit the screen. 
F). What background colors work best? The rule of thumb is to build a website with dark text on light colored background or white background. Some argue that the background should not be completely white, but just slightly darker. Often, the best choice for a background has proved to be a single color. 
G). How to and build good navigation: All web pages should point back to the home page and any other important &quot;first level&quot; pages. It is better to put links where people expect to see them. Build a horizontal menu bar with 7 or 8 options maximum. Put it at the top of the screen. Create a left hand side menu to list options at deeper levels.
If you have more than three levels, you might consider hiding some of the options from the level above. Listing only local options related to the page people are on. Always keep the main menu visible. Avoid drop down menus.
	Top-down and bottom-up are the two main approaches to building information architectures. In many cases these two approaches are interwoven and occur simultaneously.
For more information on navigation one can consult the following references

H) Browsing: The library website must provide browse using a hierarchical, supplemental, or contexual approach. 
I) How to make the text easier to read: The type of fonts that work best on websites are sans serif. These are simplified type letters created to be very readable at small sizes and on most screens. To make the text attractive to read the librarian should use different sizes and colors for headings, subheadings and paragraphs proves and give plenty of space in between. People should be given provision for increase font size for easier reading. Nearly all browsers have an option to increase text size but only if the web page is designed to allow it. 
J). Why serve information in bite sized chunks? Breaking up the information in smaller paragraphs can greatly cut the time people need to scan the content so rather than using endless paragraphs of information, librarian may consider chunking information into small pieces, Separate paragraphs with spaces and use indentation to show levels of importance. Or, use tables to organize major areas. 
K). Sound: There are many ways to incorporate sound into a page. But the librarian should be sure the sounds attract rather than distract from the content.
L). What graphics to use:  The librarian should accept the fact that words is the core reason people visit their website. Graphics should be used only when they are essential to communicate something that is not possible to with words alone. Avoid using graphics that have no relation to the surrounding text. 
M). GIF Animation: The librarian should choose animations that contribute to the theme. For example, he/she might use a rotating globe on the geography page. (http://www.frsd.k12.nj.us/barleylibrary/lib/5fingrtst.htm) 
N). What should stand out on each page:  The librarian should create a list of important features to go on every page. He/She should decide which the most important element is.
If the librarian want visitors to look at the special announcement, then it is better to place them in the home page itself.
O). How to use links on your website? People learned early on that links were the blue, underlined phrases you can click on. Visited links were purple. All other text was black. So if possible follow the same line, again the Links should always stand out and be easily distinguished from regular text.
P). Why put load speed above anything else: The library website designer can cut load times to a minimum by Taking out any graphic that doesn't add to the user experience,  
By removing font tags and by using CSS instead to style your text etc. 
Q).How to make websites popular with search engines: Most people use search engines to find the information they want on the web. If the website can get top rankings for keywords that match the content then there is a guaranteed to see a spike in visitor numbers. One way to achive this is to follow the guidelines of W3C. 
2.9.5. VERIFICATION OF THE WEBSITE: After creating the pages, one has to verify the contents and design before finally putting these on the net. This can be done by loading the page(s) on the browser locally. It is necessary to check the results both on Netscape and Internet Explorer and on some other browser as pages may look differently on different browsers and even on different versions of the same browser.

 
SUBMISSION OF SITE TO SEARCH ENGINES:
To make the site known to all, it is necessary to submit the site to search engines. This will increase the hits to the site. The submission can be done either automatically or manually. To get best results, it is suggested that submission be done manually to each one of the search engines. 
Automatic submission can be done by using the services of following sites:
http://uswebsites.com/submit
http://www.netcreations.com/postmaster
http://addme.com
Manual submission can be done individually by going to the respective sites of the search engines. The search engines index sites under various categories such as education, business, sports etc. To submit a site one has to click on the option 'Submit your site or Add URL', which in turn asks for URL, category, description and keywords. The category could be 'Education' and then 'Libraries' and all these information need to be typed manually. Some search engines do accept URL without asking for categories. Depending upon the keywords and description given, search engines themselves will put the submitted site under the appropriate category. Important search engines available on the net are:
http://www.google.com
http://www.yahoo.com
http://www.altavista.com
http://www.lycos.com
http://www.infoseek.com
http://www.khoj.com
http://www.indianindex.com
http://www.hotbot.com
Each search engine has its own rules for accepting the sites for indexing. All search engines may not accept sites of all categories. Therefore, one has to do some homework for knowing the policy and specificity. Search engines will take some time to index the submitted site. Hence, it may please be noted that results will not be immediate.
For further reading and help on HTML, webpage design, graphics etc, a list of internet resources has been given in APPENDIX-II

 MANAGEMENT: Management involves a wide range of functions related to website development and can be group into policies, promotion, and staff development.
A).Policies: Policies are essential for a smooth running of public library website.
Rather than building all new policies one can use existing collection development policy. The web resources that librarian choose for inclusion in the library website should meet the guidelines established in the collection development policy. The policies should include collection development policy, Acceptable Use Policy, Licensing Policy, Content Disclaimer etc.
B).Promotion: The librarian will need a plan for website promotion.Like any good promotion, he/she will need a strategy to establish client base, then keep them coming back. The librarian might start with posters, bookmarks, demonstrations, and public service announcements to advertise the library website resources. Next, general people should make aware that new things are being posted all the time. Posting student projects, user comments, and other local materials are a good way to generate interest. 
C). Staff Involvement: Everyone on the library staff should be familiar with the content and use of the website. Although not everyone will be developing and posting pages themselves, everyone should be encouraged to play a role in the success of the materials. From content development to checking links, there is many ways staff members can help. A truly interactive website may require a number of ongoing responsibilities such as checking email, monitoring discussion groups, or checking online registrations or scheduling. In order for staff to play an active role, the librarian may need to set up training sessions. He/she can do the same with student workers.

MAINTENANCE: The librarian will need a mechanism in place to handle the ongoing needs of library website including new content, revisions and link rot. There’s nothing more frustrating for users than link rot. This occurs when URLs become outdated or change. The librarian can explore each of the following ways to deal with link rot and other similar problem.

 EVALUATION OF THE LIBRARY WEBSITE

The library WebPages should be modified and expanded, rename and gives a prominent place on the home page based upon its evaluation by the user. A particular department within the public library must assign the jobs of continuous evaluation of the Public Library website with a whole lot of help from user community, faculty, staff, and Libraries employees of the public library. For example, user community, faculty, and staff will be regularly enlisted for the purpose of focus group interviews and usability studies. According to E.A.Dupis for the evaluation of the library homepage “call it what they’ll understand and put it where they’ll find it” (Cox, Suellen and Housewright, Elizabeth: 2001, Pp.3) 

 Libraries must have good understanding of its audience before it can be re-created,. 

 CONCLUSION

Users don't notice when a website works well for them because they're too busy taking in the information they came for. They do notice, however, when the pages take too long to load, the text is hard to read, that top right image is blinking all the time and they have no idea where to go next. In the above description an effort has only been made to describe how a basic library homepage can be created at minimum cost without investing on webservers and related softwares. This may not be an exhaustive article where- in one may find every thing on web page development under one roof. Future development of homepage can be done by using other programming languages and software such as JAVA, PERL, WWWISIS, ISEARCH etc.</text>

'''''Bua Loi''''' or '''Thai Rice Balls in Coconut Milk'''

== Ingredients ==
* 3 cups (700g) [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|glutinous rice flour]]
* 1.5 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Pandan Essence|pandan essence]]
* 4 cups (950ml) [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut cream]]
* 2 cups (480g) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon (5ml) [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 3 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s (optional)

== Procedure ==
# Mix the rice flour with enough water to make a stiff paste. The pandan essence should be added to the water before mixing with the rice flour. [[cookbook:Knead|Knead]] well and then form pea-sized balls.
# Bring a large pot of water to a [[cookbook:boil|boil]], toss in the balls and remove when they float to the surface. Drain. 
# Bring half the coconut cream to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent it from separating, then add the flour balls. 
# When the mixture returns to a boil, remove from heat and stir in the remaining coconut cream.
# Serve as dessert in small bowls. Thais often add [[Cookbook:Maize|sweet corn]] kernels to the final product.

If serving this dish with eggs, in a separate saucepan bring water to a boil and reduce heat, crack eggs one at a time into the water. When eggs are done, remove from water and set aside. One egg should be added to each bowl prior to serving.

With the &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; element you can define, as the name says, code. This could be any code, [[Subject:PHP scripting language|PHP]], [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]], [[HTML]] anything. Anywhere you have some code in a line of text you should use a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; element to indicate it, e.g.

The &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element must contain exactly one &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element.

Using the element consistently allows you to specify a special layout in [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] for code.

If you are writing an article that uses code you will probably want to use the related elements:
; var : a variable in computer code;
; kbd : text the reader should type at the keyboard;
; samp : sample output from a program or script.

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==

This is an attempt to create a HTML Tag reference to offer an alternative to the W3Schools one, preferable a better one of course :D. I have checked it on the W3Schools site, and you are allowed to link to any of their pages, as long as you don't embed it in an iframe or something (which we don't). I have also created the Standard Attributes List, as to provide information about those.
Here's how a tag page is built up:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
== Use ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''Here some information about what this tag can be used for''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Example ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''An example of the tag in use, preferably with as many attributes as possible''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Required attributes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

====&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A required attribute''&lt;nowiki&gt;====&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
...&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Optional attributes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

====&lt;/nowiki&gt;''An optional attribute''&lt;nowiki&gt;====&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Standard attributes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

====[[HTML Standard Attributes List: &lt;/nowiki&gt;''A standard attribute''|''A standard attribute''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]====&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== More info ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A link to a page with more info, then the name of the site the info came from (i.e. W3Schools).''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

[[Category: HTML Tag List|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''First letter of tag''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

[[nl: HTML:_&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Tag name''&lt;nowiki&gt;-tag]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Dutch Wikibooks is also busy on a tag list, that's what the link at the bottom points to. They haven't finished it yet, but at least when it is, the link will point there. [[User:Vincentt|Vincentt]] 13:28, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

==Merger==

This module has once been the book &quot;HTML Tag List&quot;, intended to be a ''reference''. It has been merged on 4 June 2006 with the present book, originally called &quot;HTML Programming&quot;, now called &quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot;, which is intended and currently structured and written as a ''user guide''. This merger of two completely different kinds of works is going to create problems; the two kinds of materials use different organizing principles. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:06, 14 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The process of woodturning is not without its dangers. Some are fairly obvious, some less so. Some may result in short term minor injuries, some may be much more serious, and others may cause long-term health problems that may not be apparent for many years.

The purpose of this chapter is to highlight these dangers and make recommendations to minimize or remove the risk. Ultimately, safety is the individual's responsiblity and will depend largely on both their knowledge and attitude. If in doubt seek proper training or advice.


* As with any rotating machinery, the operator must take care not to let their clothing, hair or jewelry get caught by the machine or wood.
* Work pieces must be securely attached to the lathe before turning it on.
* Make sure that the workpiece can be fully rotated without hitting the lathe bed, toolrest, banjo or other objects around the lathe.
* Workpieces must be of sound material that will not break while being shaped. Wearing a face mask is recommended.
* Tools must be supported by the toolrest before contacting the wood.
* Beware of turning wood which is not perfectly round. Irregular edges turn to a nearly invisible blur when spinning. Examples include work not yet roughed down to a round, or natural edge. Some chucks may pose a similar hazard.
* Wood dust of any type can cause problems with the respiratory system, skin or eyes. Some woods are toxic and present even worse hazards. Dust extraction and dust masks or respirators are recommended.
* Many finishes use solvents that are dangerous, either through skin contact or inhalation of fumes. 
* Many finishes cure by polymerisation which is an exothermic chemical reaction. Rags used for applying these finishes should be disposed of so they cannot spontaneously combust and cause a fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blood Pressure is the pressure that blood exerts on the wall of the blood vessels. The pressure originates in the contraction of the [[../Heart|heart]], in turn, forcing blood out of the heart and into the blood vessels. The concept is more mechanical than biochemical.

There are two mechanisms that take place in the heart, Diastole and Systole. Diastole is the relaxation of the chambers of the heart whereas Systole is the contraction of the heart chambers. This is regulated through measuring your blood pressure of which the normal blood pressure should be around 120/80 to be accounted for at a safe level. The figure 120 is measured through Systole and the 80 accounts for Diastole. The Systolic Pressure will show the pressure that your heart emits when blood is forced out of the heart, whereas Diastolic Pressure is the pressure that your heart shows when it's relaxing. This is the main mechanism by which blood pressure operates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
'''
It is the part of nervous system concerned with the receiving of stimulus and sending those signals to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) for interpretation and action.

== Components==

Sensory system consists of two main parts, peripheral &amp; central.

Peripheral portion of the sensory system consists of:
* '''receptors''': the part which senses the stimuli it can the peripheral terminals of the primary Aferants spatially in pain sensation. The activation of these receptors will discharge the primary Aferant neurons.
* '''Primary Aferant neurons''': They are  peripheral Neurons that transmit the signals of stimuli in the form of action potential to the central portions of sensory system.
Central portion of the sensory system consists of: 
* '''nuclei &amp; ganglions of the spinal cord &amp; sensory nuclei &amp; ganglions of cerebral nerves'''.They amplitude the signals to the upper portions or altered sensations.
* '''Secondary Aferants'''. They are neurons in the central nerves system that transmit Aferant signals to the upper regions in the brain.
* '''The sensory regions of the brain'''. They process incoming signals and make sensations ultimately.

== Function ==
# Reception of impulses from environment as well as from within the body
# Conversion of impulses in the form of action potential
# Transmission of action potential through nerves to the [[../Central Nervous System|central nervous system]]

::See: [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/why_comprehensive_water_plan.pdf &quot;Why Georgia Needs a Comprehensive Water Plan&quot;]


===Planning Process===
:This section of the Plan would describe the planning process.
::See:  [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/06-07-05_presentation.pdf &quot;Planning Process&quot;] presentation by Carol Couch to [[Georgia Water/Georgia Water Council|Georgia Water Council]] on June 7, 2005.

===Guiding Principles &amp; Policy Framework===

====General Guiding Principles====
:'''Status--'''  No specific tasks to implement these general principles have been identified by the Georgia Water Council.

The Council believes the following principles (from the work of the [[Georgia Water/Georgia Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committe|JCWPSC]]) should guide the development of the State Water Plan:
#Effective water resources management protects health and the safety and welfare of Georgia’s citizens;
#Water resources are managed in a sustainable manner so that current and future generations have access to adequate supplies of quality water that supports both human and natural systems;
#All citizens have a stewardship responsibility to conserve and protect the water resources of Georgia;
#Water management efforts recognize that economic prosperity and environmental quality are interdependent;
#Water quality and quantity and surface and ground water are interrelated and require integrated planning as well as reasonable and efficient use;
#A comprehensive and accessible database must be developed to provide sound scientific and economic information upon which effective water management decisions can be based;
#Water resources management encourages local/regional innovation, implementation, adaptability, and responsibility for watershed and river basin management;
#Sound water resources management involves meaningful participation, coordination, and cooperation among interested and affected stakeholders and citizens, as well as all levels of governmental and other entities managing or utilizing water
#Periodic revisions of the comprehensive statewide water management plan may be required to accommodate new scientific and policy insights as well as changing social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors.

====Current Statutory, Regulatory, and Water Management Policy Framework====
:The Law Department would be enlisted to provide a description of Georgia’s current water quality and water quantity management statutory framework. A description of Georgia’s water quantity management statutory framework – produced by the Law Department - has already been completed for other purposes, and may require editing for inclusion in a State Water Plan.  Additionally advice and guidance should be sought from the governor’s legal counsel.  As the State agency with principal water management regulatory responsibilities, EPD would be assigned the task of describing the current regulatory requirements related to the statutory framework completed by the Law Department. Before completing this section, EPD would seek input from other State government entities having water management responsibilities under Georgia law.

====Guidance on Water Public Policy Issues====
:'''Status--''' No task has been initiated.
:('''[[Statewide Water Resources Management Plan for Georgia:Comments#Sub-state Guidance on Policy Issues|Comments]]''')


===Planning Standards===
:'''Status--''' No task has been initiated.
:('''[[Statewide Water Resources Management Plan for Georgia:Comments#Planning Standards|Comments]]''')


===Executive Summary of Sub-State Components of State Water Plan===
:This section of the “State Components” of the Plan would provide an executive summary of each of the sub-state components of the State Plan. Such a summary will not be possible for many of the sub-state components until some time after completion of the “State Components”; however as the State Plan must be a ‘living’ document, these substate executive summaries can/should be added whenever the sub-state plans have been completed.
:This summary might also generally address itself to an appropriate subset – or all - of the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/issues.php 42 issues] the [[Georgia Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committee|JWSC]] identified during the conduct of its work.  '''Status--''' A subset of the 42 issues has been identified.  [[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Technical Advisory Committees|Technical Advisory Committees]] are being set up to address some of these issues.

== Introduction ==
You may have heard various people talk about HDR images. (WETA, Lucas, even Tim Sweeny). HDR images are part of a technology called HDRi which stands for &quot;High Dynamic Range (image)&quot;. So... what on earth does that mean?

Here's a link to Wikipedia's article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging the HDR format] which I personally give all my credit to Paul Debevec for putting it to use for computer graphics purposes. Anyway, before you start trying to understand the usefulness of HDRi, please read the wikipedia link.

Also, visit [http://www.debevec.org Paul Debevec's website] if you've got some more time to spare.

To sum up the excitement of HDR CG, think of it like the hype of the next-generation videogames that are about to come out, except set the stage for 1996 instead of 2006. Paul Debevec pioneered paralax mapping, HDR lighting, image-based modeling, his latest work includes some even more amazing technologies, and for the record he's my hero too.

To use HDRi images for 3D rendering, you need something called a [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating a Light Probe|light probe]]...

== Definitions == 

;HDRI:
[[File:Ball3 1 2.jpg|300px|right|HDR image file example]]
HDRI stands for '''High Dynamic Range Imaging''', and is basically an image format that contains from the deepest shadow up to the brightest highlight information. While an 'ordinary' digital image contains only 8 bits of information per color (red, green, blue) which gives you 256 gradations per color, the HDR image format stores the 3 colors with floating point accuracy. Thus the 'depth' from dark to light per color is virtually unlimited.
Using HDR images in a 3D environment will result in very realistic and convincing shadows, highlights and reflections. This is very important for realistic emulation of chrome for example.

;Light Probe:
A Light Probe is a HDR image containing 360 by 360 degrees ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle solid angle] 4π [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian steradians]) image information. In other words : it's a 360 degree spherical panorama image, not only looking around the horizon, but also up and down. Thus a Light Probe image contains all visible information as can be seen from a specific point, wherever you turn your head.

== Usage ==
Given that a Light Probe image is an 'all around' image with a high dynamic range, it's the perfect solution for your 'world' background, especially for a 3D animation.

== Quick Tutorial ''(for experienced blendies)'' ==

First of all, you'll need an HDR image. There is a whole range at http://debevec.org/Probes/ that you can download for free. (There are even more at http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=24038 ). I will use the St. Peter's Basilica probe, but any other HDR image will do just fine.

To apply the HDRI environment to your scene:

* Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
* Enable &quot;Real&quot; to force the horizon to stay still, as opposed to follow the camera
* If you're rendering with Blender Internal (ver. 2.49), go to &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot; tab and activate &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot;, then activate &quot;Sky Texture&quot;. Skip this step if you're using external renderers.
* In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;.
* Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
* Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
* Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.
* If you're using YafRay or other external renderers, you need to turn on Global Illumination and to set the quality to something other than &quot;none&quot;.

== Step-by-step Tutorial ==

===Build a simple scene===
To see the advantage of using a 360 by 360 world image, the simplest example to demonstrate this is a scene with a mirrored sphere.
[[File:Blender 3D Scene.jpg|frame|Scene]]
#Add a sphere and a cube to your scene and place them in a bit of an interesting position. (note that I added a second lamp to light up the shadow part of the cube)
#Perhaps give the cube a different color than the default grey.
[[Image:Blender_HDR_Mirror.jpg|frame|Material setting for a mirror surface and a preview of it]]
#Give the sphere a mirrored material : go to the '''Shading -&gt; Material''' panel (F5) and find the '''Mirror Trans''' buttons.
#Check that '''Ray Mirror''' button is pressed. If it is not, check it.
#Set the '''RayMir''' value to a value of 0.5 or higher. Your preview should show the reflection of the checkboard environment.

===Render with HDR (Blender Internal v2.49)===
#Download a HDR image (see Paul Debevec's website)
#Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
[[Image:Blender_HDR_AngMap.jpg|frame|AngMap enabled]]
#Go to &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot; tab and activate &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot;, then make sure &quot;Raytrace&quot; is chosen as gather method, and activate &quot;Sky Texture&quot; 
#Adjust quality settings:
##Increasing number of samples reduces noise, but increases render times
##Adaptive QMC is faster, but generates more noise than Constant QMC
#In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;
#Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
#Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
#Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.

===Render with YafRay===
#Download a HDR image (see Paul Debevec's website).
#Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
#In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff0000&quot;&gt;Note that the Angmap button is the important thing to tell Blender that this file is a Light Probe file !&lt;/span&gt;
#Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
#Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
#Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.
(optional step, as it was not needed for my setup :)
:5. Press F10 and change the &quot;Blender Internal&quot; to &quot;YafRay&quot;.  You need to turn on Global Illumination and to set the quality to something other than &quot;none&quot;. Note that the YafRay renderer does not come standard with the Blender installation. You need to download and install this separately.
Your result should look like this: (Rendering: left with Blender, right with YafRay) Click for larger version&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Blender_HDR_Result.jpg|300px]][[Image:Blender_HDR_YafRay_Result.jpg|300px]]&lt;br/&gt;
Note that the reflecting ball reflects the whole interior from every angle, even though we added just a single image to the World settings !&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Disclaimer:  While this method is reasonably likely to get a mechanical watch running again, it is also likely to cause greatly increased wear if the watch is run much afterwards.  I recommend this in limited circumstances only.  One is to sort watches--If you can get a watch running with this, a standard clean/lube/regulate will very likely put the watch in good condition.  The other situation is when a watch would be interesting, but even in good running condition would not be worth the cost of a servicing.  

With that in mind--Many watches can be resurrected by oiling the critical friction surfaces that are accessible without disassembly.  If you can get an oiler to the escape wheel, a drop of oil on each of about 3 teeth will be the most likely to revive the watch.  Be extremely careful--you will be working in the area of the most fragile parts of the watch.  Additionally, oil to each of the visible pivot jewels can help.

The light probe is, in the simplest terms, a photograph of your environment. they work in very much the same way that reflection maps do, and are made the same way.

Equipment:
#A pure silver ball. Try a plastic Christmas tree ball ornament.
#A camera, prefferably digital. If you have a high-end digital camera, you'll have less work ahead.
#A place you'd like to capture the lighting from. Try laying different things in your environment to get a good idea.
#Something to fire the shutter without touching the camera. For digital cameras, Paul Debevec recommends using a program that will take all the pictures for you.
#A tripod.

Set it up like so. Remember that the height of your camera and the height of the ball relative to each other controls the angle at which the horizon will be shot. In other words, shoot the ball at the same angle that you plan to shoot your 3D scene in. If your scene is animated... consider making a similar rig except attaching your reflective ball to a video camera as was done for [[wikipedia:Flight_of_the_Navigator|Flight of the Navigator]].

[[Image:Lightprobe_hardware_diagram.png]]

#Note that the diagram is incorrect.  The camera will see items reflected from behind the sphere as well.
The process:
#Set up your rig and take a series of images with varying exposure times.
#Taking 2 sets of pictures, each offset by 90 degrees, will enable you to get better coverage of the background and eliminate the reflection of the camera taking the picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scene Summaries==
====Act One : Scene 1====
In a short 16 lines, Shakespeare quickly and effectively sets the scene for this play.
From the first the play is restless and unnatural.

The witches, emblems of darkness and deceit, are the only characters present. They discuss a battle which they ''know'' will be finished shortly, they also ''know'' they will meet Macbeth &quot;upon the heath&quot;, i.e. they have insight into the future. Their unnatural powers are further underlined in the last line of the scene &quot;Hover through the fog and filthy air&quot;

The restlessness and unease of the play as a whole is evoked in the thunder and lightening and the mentions of &quot;hurly burly&quot; and &quot;battle&quot;.

====Act One: Scene 2====
This scene opens with the King Duncan awaiting news of the battle we have just heard the witches discussing. A &quot;bloody man&quot; has just arrived to report. 
What is significant is that Duncan himself is not fighting the battle. This indicates that he is perhaps too old or too weak to fight himself.

Malcolm, Duncan's son, and next in line to the throne, comments that the bloody man has saved him from being captured - &quot;fought gainst my captivity&quot;. This suggests that Malcolm is a poor fighter, not capable of looking after himself on the battlefield. The question of why this is, is left open, perhaps he is simply young and inexperienced. 

Next the Seargeant answers Duncan's enquiries and describes the battle. 
&quot;Macdonwald&quot; is the internal rebel being fought, there is evidently unrest in the kingdom. &quot;Macdonwald&quot; is not a weak enemy he is strong and tough - &quot;merciless Macdonwald--Worthy to be a rebel&quot;. Indeed it looked like Macdonwald would win the day until by dint of some very hard fighting by Macbeth, Duncan's side won. To further emphasize the problems troubling Duncan's kingdom Shakespeare introduces an external foe who landed just as Macdonwald had been beaten. Instead of being disheartened by this Duncan's two leading soldiers redoubled their efforts and beat the second enemy.

Next two noblemen Ross and Lennox arrive bringing further news of the battle.
It turns out that the external enemy (Norway) was being assisted by another internal traitor - The Thane of Cawdor. However not only has Macbeth succeeded in defeating them, he has made them pay a large fine to Duncan.

Duncan is very grateful to Macbeth for his courage, valour and success. Macbeth (along with Banquo) has succeeded in saving Duncan's Kingdom for him, against stiff odds. In addition he has enriched Duncan with the fine. Duncan concludes by granting Macbeth the title of the traitor. Macbeth becomes '''The Thane of Cawdor'''

Most significant in this scene is the emphasis on Macbeth's loyalty. Traitors are portrayed as evil but powerful, and Macbeth's bravery and courage in facing them are emphasized. This emphasis becomes ironic later in the play when Macbeth becomes the rebel

      <text xml:space="preserve">JavaSpace05 (http://www.jini.org/nonav/standards/porter/doc/specs/api/net/jini/space/package-summary.html) is a standard extension interface which JavaSpaces implementations may optionally support.  It provides:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch operations for write and take designed to reduce network round-trips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contents() - a streaming read which has some properties of an iterator but is adapted for remote operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;registerForAvailabilitEvent - a notify() variant which provides a broader set of events concerning the state transitions of an Entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In some cases, it's expected that contents() and registerForAvailabilityEvent() will be used together to bring a client up to speed with current state.  This is achieved by having the client first register for events and then using contents() to recover state which was created prior to registration for events.

Both the batch operations and contents() support the use of multiple templates to allow logical OR matching semantics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When using the JRMP mechanisms provided in the java.rmi package, the java.rmi.UnicastRemoteObject class can be subclassed to get some simple programming tasks done for you.

In Jini2.0 and later, the use of net.jini.export.Exporter implementations, requires that subclassing not be performed, and instead, explicit exporting and unexporting be done.  There are several important points about this.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each place that a remote object leaves the VM might need to explicitly export, and manage the lifecycle of the remote object returned by the exporter.
&lt;li&gt;If there is local and remote use of the same object, you might need to keep two different references around, one for local use, and one that will be passed out of the VM for remote use unless #1 applies, in which case, you can just export as needed.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Set the section on [[Jini and Network Computing:Using Jini Exporters|Using Jini Exporters]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The net.jini.export package provides a power feature in Jini 2.0 and later.  The foundation of this package is the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.export.Exporter|net.jini.export.Exporter]] interface.  An instance of this interface provides the ability to export and unexport a single object used for remote access.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method Signature&lt;th&gt;Javadoc Summary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;public java.rmi.Remote export( java.rmi.Remote impl );&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exports the specified remote object and returns a proxy that can be
used to invoke remote methods on the exported remote object.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;public boolean unexport(boolean force);&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
 Unexports the remote object that was exported by this Exporter
 such that it will no longer receive remote method invocations 
 that were made possible as a result of exporting it with this Exporter.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Typically, an instance of an [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.export.Exporter|Exporter]] will be obtained using the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.Configuration|net.jini.config.Configuration]] implementation established at service startup. The section on [[Jini and Network Computing:Using Configuration Files|Using Configuration Files]] has more information on how a &lt;b&gt;Configuration&lt;/b&gt; instance is typically obtained.

There are many types of scenarios for using an Exporter.  Your particular circumstances will largely govern whether a single exported object can be used by all external references, or if you need to have multiple exports of the same object.  As noted above, each export will require a separate Exporter, and for any [[Jini and Network Computing:java.rmi.Remote|Remote]] object exported, you will need to maintain a strong reference to the Exporter, if unexporting will be done and the Remote object, if it will be reused by other remote clients at a later time.

[[Jini and Network Computing:Distributed Garbage Collection|Distributed Garbage Collection]] (DGC) provides the ability for you to export a remote reference to a local object, send the reference back to a remote client, and to then have the Remote object be unexported and reclaimed when the remote client finishes using the remote object, or otherwise can no longer maintain its reference to that object because of network partitioning or other failures that keep it from updating its lease.

Some types of applications utilize a single Remote object for all clients.  Other types of applications will, in fact, export a single object reference for remote use, one per remote client.  In the former case, DGC is not needed, and can create problems because of its attempts to manage leases.  In the later case, either DGC, or some other type of lease based lifecycle management needs to occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config|net.jini.config]] package provides the facility to utilize live objects for configuring not just Jini services, but any Java application that can have this package and the associated dependencies in its classpath.  The primary implementation of the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.Configuration|net.jini.config.Configuration]] interface is the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.ConfigurationFile|net.jini.config.ConfigurationFile]] class.  

The [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider|net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider]] Service Provider Interface (SPI) provides the generic mechanism for allowing a service deployer to provide a configuration in whatever way is appropriate.  In almost all cases, the correct way to get a configuration for a service is to use the expression:
&lt;pre&gt;
String args[] = ...
Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getInstance(args);
&lt;/pre&gt;
For many types of services, the args[] value is the set of command line arguments that the Java virtual machine would be started with.

Services utilizing the [[Jini and Network Computing:com.sun.jini.start|com.sun.jini.start]] package, will receive the args[] value in the required constructor which has the signature &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;( java.lang.String[], com.sun.jini.start.LifeCycle )&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider|ConfigurationProvider]] javadocs provides more information on how one can use the SPI to provide a completely different source for configuration data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">present tense, parasmaipada

the verb is formed by putting a personal affix on the verbal root, sometimes using an infix.

endings:

:ti, tha, nti
:si, thah, tha
:ami, avah, amah

:-ति, -थ, -न्ति
:-सि, -थः, -थ
:-अमि, -अवः, -अमः

infixes: 

:1P: -अ-
:4P: -य-
:10P: -अय-

for verbs in the 1, 4, and 10 class, the vowel in the verbal root is strengthened to its gunah substitute, eg:

तृ (1P) (to cross over) -- to form the 1st person singular, we convert &quot;ऋ&quot; to &quot;अर्&quot;, giving &quot;तर्&quot;.  we then add the infix for 1P verbs, &quot;-अ-&quot;, to get &quot;तर&quot;.  then we add the 1st person singular ending, &quot;ति&quot; to get the conjugated verb, &quot;तरति&quot; (&quot;he crosses over&quot;).

गम् (1P) (to go) -- to form the 3rd person singular, we convert &quot;गम्&quot; to &quot;गच्छ्&quot;.  we then add the infix for 1P verbs, &quot;-अ-&quot;, to get &quot;गच्छ&quot;. we then add the postfix &quot;अमि&quot; to get the conjugated form &quot;गच्छामि&quot;.

चुर् (10P) (to steal) -- to form 1st person plural, we change &quot;चुर्&quot; to &quot;चोर्&quot;, then add infix &quot;-अय-&quot; and termination &quot;-न्ति&quot; to form &quot;चोरयन्ति&quot; (&quot;they steal&quot;).

&quot;The Exchange
In pretty much any game, a player will have the opportunity to take one of his opponents pieces in exchange for one of his own pieces. This should NOT be done for its own sake!&quot;

Not be done for its own sake?  I always trade pieces because I play a better game with less pieces on the board.  This statement seems a little shallow :-P.  Especially trading in the beginning to force the other player into a weak board position.
: If it's forcing the other player into a weak position, then it's not for its own sake.  Similarly, it's a valid tactic to reduce the number of pieces in play when facing a superior opponent (and thus reduce the scope of his advantage) but that's not for its own sake either. Really though, it's a poor habit that prevents you developing the skills needed to handle a more cluttered board. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

--

&quot;Forking with check
Forks which also include the king are the most powerful. The opponent must then move his king to safety and the other piece in the fork has no chance of escape.&quot;

Move his king... or kill the position causing the fork... or block the piece from putting the king in check.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Macules are small skin lesions (&lt;10 mm) characterised by change in colour of skin without any palpable elevation of skin.  To be &quot;macular&quot; means the area of abnormality is not palpable; it can't be felt.  You might find macular erythema (an area of redness) or a &quot;macular pigmented skin lesion&quot;, which could be a junctional nevus (often referred to as a &quot;mole&quot;) or lentigo (a kind of freckle).  Being macular implies the process does not thicken the skin or represent an increase or decrease of the keratinocytes in this area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The piece on Homer is useful because it introduces the whole area of how minds or outlooks may have changed as well as how they were. We need an entry in the 20th century section on Jaynes' Bicameral Mind thesis ( http://julianjaynessociety.tripod.com/ ).  On the subject of Homer, some quotes from Iliad showing how thoughts and actions of gods etc. were intertwined would be helpful (though I appreciate that locating apposite quotes will be time consuming). I put Aristotle up front because he is so central to medieval and modern science and philosophy, not because I believe he is &quot;better&quot;, the order of the other philosophers is probably immaterial. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

I think you need to consider how you motivate the history of consciousness per se as opposed to the history of subjectivity or personal identity or the relation of personal subjectivity to biological life or any number of related issues. If you go back to these sorts of concerns, then I think you need to perhaps do as Karen Armstrong doesin her (2006?) book The Great Transformation and show the origins of this look inward within religions around the world.  If you want to limit your self to consciousness, perhaps it is better to focus on the Socratics--especially the Latin Stoics, like Seneca--who used 'conscientia' in this inward sense and had a big impact on Augustine.--[[User:Michelferrari|Michelferrari]] 00:03, 8 June 2007 (UTC)---

:Good points. The big problem here is that consciousness studies is so contentious. The biographical approach has been adopted to permit the historical section to contain divergent approaches yet still be useful to academic students, a sort of &quot;lucky dip&quot; of historical work. This is also why it has so many quotes - nothing should be reported without being supported! This section desperately needs articles on both Seneca and Augustine, particularly Augustine's view on time - any volunteers? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:58, 8 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>I changed the first example, which seemed incorrect:  from &quot;e.g. I am coming back.&quot; (je reviens)  to &quot;I just returned&quot;  (je viens de revenir)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FrenchToC}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The ''Passé Récent'' is the tense which represents doing something.

e.g. I just returned.

However, in French you say that you '''come''' from doing something rather than having just done it, so that sentence would be:
e.g. 'Je viens de revenir''

If we break it down into its parts it looks like this:

(pronoun) (conjugated form of venir) de (infinitive verb)

Here are some more examples:

We have just finished = Nous venons de finir

She has just arrived = Elle vient d'arriver

They have just eaten = Ils viennent de manger

The teaching of Special Relativity on undergraduate physics courses involves a considerable mathematical background knowledge. Particularly important are the manipulation of vectors and matrices and an elementary knowledge of curvature. The background mathematics is given at the end of this section and can be referenced by those who are unfamiliar with these techniques.

==The Lorentz transformation==

The Lorentz transformation deals with the problem of observers who are moving relative to each other. How are the coordinates of an event recorded by one observer related to the coordinates of the event recorded by the other observer? The '''standard configuration''' used in the calculation of the Lorentz transformation is shown below:

[[Image:relstandard.gif]]

There are several ways of deriving the Lorentz transformations. The usual method is to work from Einstein's postulates (that the laws of physics are the same between all inertial reference frames and the speed of light is constant) whilst adding assumptions about isotropy, linearity and homogeneity. The second is to work from the assumption of a four dimensional Minkowskian metric.

In mathematics transformations are frequently symbolised with the &quot;maps to&quot; symbol:

&lt;math&gt; (x,y,z,t) \mapsto (x^',y^',z^',t^') &lt;/math&gt;

===The '''linearity''' and '''homogeneity''' of spacetime===

Consider a clock moving freely. According to Newton's first law, objects continue in a state of uniform motion unless acted upon by a force; so, the velocity of the clock in any given direction (&lt;math&gt;dx_i/dt&lt;/math&gt;) must be a constant. 

If the clock is a real clock with readings given by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; then the rate of change with respect to these readings of the elapsed time at any other point in an inertial frame of reference,  &lt;math&gt;dt/d\tau&lt;/math&gt;, will be a constant. If the clock were to tick at an uneven rate compared with other clocks then the universe would not be homogeneous in time—at some times the clock would appear to accelerate. This would also mean that Newton's first law would be broken and the universe would not be homogeneous in space.

If &lt;math&gt;dx_i/dt&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dt/d\tau&lt;/math&gt; are constant then &lt;math&gt;dx_{\mu} (\mu=1,2,3,4)&lt;/math&gt; is also constant. This means that the clock is not accelerating, i.e. that &lt;math&gt;d^2x_{\mu}/d\tau^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Linearity is demonstrated by the way that the length of things does not depend on position or relative position; for instance, if &lt;math&gt;x' = ax^2&lt;/math&gt; the distance between two points would depend upon the position of the observer whereas if the relationship is linear (&lt;math&gt;x' = ax&lt;/math&gt;) separations are independent of position. 

The linearity and homogeneity assumptions mean that the coordinates of objects in the &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; inertial frame are related to those in the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; inertial frame by:

&lt;math&gt;x_{\nu}' = (\sum \Lambda_{\nu\mu}x_\mu) + B_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is known as a '''Poincaré transformation'''. It can be expressed in indicial notation as:

&lt;math&gt;x^{'\nu} = \Lambda_{\mu}^\nu x^\mu + B^\nu&lt;/math&gt;

If the origins of the frames coincide then &lt;math&gt;B_\nu&lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be zero and the equation:

&lt;math&gt;x_{\nu}' = \sum \Lambda_{\nu\mu}x_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Those who are unfamiliar with the notation should note that the symbols &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; etc. mean &lt;math&gt;x_1=x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2=y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3=z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_4=t&lt;/math&gt; so the equation above is shorthand for:

&lt;math&gt;x' = a_{11} x + a_{12} y + a_{13} z  + a_{14} t &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y' = a_{21} x + a_{22} y + a_{23} z  + a_{24} t &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z' = a_{31} x + a_{32} y + a_{33} z  + a_{34} t &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t' = a_{41} x + a_{42} y + a_{43} z  + a_{44} t &lt;/math&gt;

In matrix notation the set of equations can be written as: 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}=\mathbf{\Lambda x}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''standard configuration''' (see diagram above) has several properties, for instance:

:The spatial origin of both observer's coordinate systems lies on the line of motion so the x axes can be chosen to be parallel.

:The point given by &lt;math&gt;x=vt&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;x'=0&lt;/math&gt;.

:The origins of both coordinate systems can coincide so that clocks can be synchronised when they are next to each other.

:The coordinate planes ,y, y' and z,z', can be arranged to be orthogonal (at right angles) to the direction of motion.

:Isotropy means that coordinate planes that are orthogonal at y=0 and z=0 in one frame are orthogonal at y'=0 and z'=0 in the other frame.

According to the relativity principle any transformations between the same two inertial frames of reference must be the same. This is known as the '''reciprocity theorem'''.

===The Lorentz transformation===

From the linearity assumption and given that at the origin &lt;math&gt;y=0=y^'&lt;/math&gt; so there is no constant offset then &lt;math&gt;y^'=Ky&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=Ky^'&lt;/math&gt;, therefore K=1. So:

&lt;math&gt;y^'=y&lt;/math&gt;

and, by the same reasoning:

&lt;math&gt;z^'=z&lt;/math&gt;

Now, considering the x coordinate of the event, the z and y axes can be assumed to be 0 (ie: an arbitrary shift of the coordinates to allow the event to lie on the x axes). If this is done then the linearity consideration and the fact that &lt;math&gt;x=vt&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^'=0&lt;/math&gt; are the same point gives:

(1) &lt;math&gt;x^' = \gamma (x - vt)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. According to the reciprocity theorem we also have:

(2) &lt;math&gt;x = \gamma (x^' + vt^')&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein's assumption that the speed of light is a constant can now be introduced so that &lt;math&gt;x=ct&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;x^'=ct^'&lt;/math&gt;. So:

&lt;math&gt;ct^'= \gamma t(c - v)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;ct= \gamma t^'(c + v)&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;c^2tt^'= \gamma^2tt^'(c^2 - v^2)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\gamma = \frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the Lorentz transformation equations are:

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \gamma (t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^' = \gamma (x - vt)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y^'=y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z^'=z&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation for the time coordinate can derived from the transformation for the x coordinate assuming &lt;math&gt;x=ct&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^'=ct^'&lt;/math&gt; or directly from equations (1) and (2) with a similar substitution for &lt;math&gt;x=ct&lt;/math&gt;.

The coefficients of the Lorentz transformation can be represented in matrix format:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
c t' \\x' \\y' \\z'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\gamma&amp;-\frac{v}{c} \gamma&amp;0&amp;0\\
-\frac{v}{c} \gamma&amp;\gamma&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c t\\x\\y\\z
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A coordinate transformation of this type, that is due to motion, is known as a '''boost'''.

[[Image:relltex.gif]]

The Lorentz transformation equations can be used to show that:

&lt;math&gt;c^2dt^{'2} - dx^{'2} - dy^{'2} - dz^{'2} = c^2dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Although whether the assumptions of linearity, isotropy and homogeneity in the derivation of the Lorentz transformation actually assumed this identity from the outset is a moot point.

Given that: &lt;math&gt;c^2dt^{'2} - dx^{'2} - dy^{'2} - dz^{'2}&lt;/math&gt; also equals &lt;math&gt;c^2dt^{''2} - dx^{''2} - dy^{''2} - dz^{''2}&lt;/math&gt; and a continuous range of other transformations it is clear that:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta s}^2 = c^2\Delta{t}^{2} - \Delta{x}^{2} - \Delta{y}^{2} - \Delta{z}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''spacetime interval''' and the quantity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta s}^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''squared displacement'''.

A given squared displacement is constant for all observers, no matter how fast they are travelling, it is said to be '''invariant'''. 

The equation:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = c^2dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

is known as the '''metric''' of spacetime.

===Another look at the Lorentz transformation===

We have seen how length and duration both look different to a moving observer:

* lengths are contracted by a factor &amp;gamma;, ''when measured at the same time''.
* durations are contracted by a factor &amp;gamma;, ''when measured in the same place''.

We can extend these results to allow for measurements taking place at different times and places.

Lets consider two observers, O and O' such that O' is moving at velocity ''v'' along the ''x''-axis with respect to O. We'll use primed variables for all the measurements O' makes.

We can assume for now both observers have the same origin and ''x''-axis because we already know how to allow for observers being relatively rotated and displaced. We can put these complications back in later.

Now any length or duration can be written as the difference between two coordinates, for the two ends of the body or the start and end of the event, so it is sufficient to know how to change coordinates from one frame to the other.

We know how to do this in classical physics,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x' &amp; = &amp; x-vt \\ t' &amp; = &amp; t \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

we need to extend this to relativity.

Notice that the in classical physics the relationship is linear; the graphs of these equations are straight lines. This makes the maths much simpler, so we will try to find a linear relationship between the coordinates for relativity, i.e equations of the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x' &amp; = &amp; mx + nt \\ t' &amp; = &amp; px + qt \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''q'' are all independent of the coordinates.

To begin with know that

*when ''t''=0, ''x&amp;prime;'' = &amp;gamma;''x'' (Lorentz contraction)
*when ''x''=0, ''t&amp;prime;'' = &amp;gamma;''t'' (Time dilation)

and that O' is travelling at velocity ''v''. They measure their position to be at ''x&amp;prime;''=0, but O measures it to be at ''vt'' so we must have

:''x&amp;prime;''=0 when ''x''-''vt''=0

The only relationship between ''x'' and ''x&amp;prime;'' that satisfies these criteria is

:&lt;math&gt;x'=\gamma (x - vt) \, &lt;/math&gt;

Both observers must measure the same speed for light,

:&lt;math&gt; x=ct \Rightarrow x'=ct' \,&lt;/math&gt;

or, substituting and rearranging,

:&lt;math&gt; x=ct \Rightarrow t'=\gamma \frac{x-vt}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

The only linear relationship between ''t'' and ''t&amp;prime;'' that satisfies these criteria is

:&lt;math&gt;t'=\gamma (-\frac{vx}{c^2} + t) \, &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--leave proof for exercises --&gt;

So the primed and unprimed coordinates are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
x' &amp; = &amp; \gamma (x-vt) \\ t' &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left(-\frac{vx}{c^2} + t \right)
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

These equations are called the Lorentz transform.

They look simpler if we write them in terms of ''ct'' rather than ''t''

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
x' &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( x-\frac{v}{c}ct \right) \\ 
ct' &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( -\frac{v}{c}x + ct \right)
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Written this way they look much like the equations describing a rotation in three dimensions. In fact, once we allow for the different Pythagorean theorem, they are ''exactly'' like the equations for rotation.

* If observers are moving relative to each other, their coordinate systems are rotated in the (''x'',''ct'') plane.

===The derivation of the constancy of the speed of light from the first postulate alone===

The following text was taken from a &quot;Wikiversity&quot; lecture.

The [[wikipedia: lorentz transformation | lorentz transformation]] can be deduced from the first postulate alone with no additional assumptions.

The Lorentz transformation describes the way a vector in spacetime as seen by an observer O1 changes when it is seen by an observer O2 in a different inertial system.

The postulate of special relativity states that the laws of physics are independent of the velocity of an observer. This is equivalent to the requirement that the mathematical formulation of the laws of physics must be invariant if the coordinates of space and time are altered using a lorentz transformation.

This is the reason why the Lorentz transformation is a central concept in special relativity.

Four-vectors are vectors that, subjected to the Lorentz transformation, behave like vectors from spacetime. The standard approach to find relativistic laws to the corresponding non-relativistic ones is to find four-vectors to replace space vectors. Surprisingly often this simple approach is successful.

Here, for simplicity, the space coordinates are choosen so that the x-axis points in the direction in which O2 is moving with respect to O1 and the y and z coordinates are not considered.

Here is a way to determine a matrix &lt;math&gt;L(v)&lt;/math&gt; that transforms coordinates from O1 to O2 where ''v'' is the velocity of O2 seen from O1.

Most generally, this matrix looks like &lt;math&gt;L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and transforms &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t^\prime \\ x^\prime\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t' \\ x'\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The first requirement on this matrix is that O2 will be at rest (in space) within its own coordinate system.

Therfore &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t' \\ 0\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix} t \\ tv\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt; for any time t.

This gives us &lt;math&gt; ct +tvd = 0 \Rightarrow c = -vd &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ -vd &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The backward transformation from O2 to O1 is described by the inverse matrix &lt;math&gt;L(v') = L(v)^{-1} =  (\det(L(v))^{-1}\left(\begin{matrix}d &amp; -b \\ vd &amp; a\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\, v'&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of O1 seen from O2) has to leave O1 at rest  in its own coordinates.

Assuming &lt;math&gt; v' = -v &lt;/math&gt; (being strict this would have to be proved) we have 
&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ 0\end{matrix}\right) = (\det(L(v))^{-1}\left(\begin{matrix}d &amp; -b \\ vd &amp; a\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix} t' \\ -t'v\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt; for any time &lt;math&gt;\, t'&lt;/math&gt;
resulting in &lt;math&gt; a=d \Rightarrow L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ -va &amp; a\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The coefficients are functions of ''v''.
For all ''v'' the transformation is invertible, so &lt;math&gt;0 \neq \det L(v) = a(v)^2 + v a(v) b(v) \Rightarrow a(v) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For ''v=0'' ''L(v)'' is the identity matrix, so ''b(0)=0''. This allows to rewrite &lt;math&gt; b(v) = -v a(v) \varepsilon(v) &lt;/math&gt; with a yet unknown function &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(v)&lt;/math&gt;.


Now &lt;math&gt; L(v) =a(v) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v\varepsilon(v) \\ -v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.


Now for every &lt;math&gt;v_0, v_1&lt;/math&gt; there exists a velocity &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;L(v_0) L(v_1) = L(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Using what we have proved up to now gives
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L(v_0)L(v_1) &amp; = a(v_0) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v_0\varepsilon(v_0) \\ -v_0 &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) a(v_1) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v_1\varepsilon(v_1) \\ -v_1 &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) \\
&amp; = a(v_0) a(v_1)\left(\begin{matrix} 1+v_0v_1\varepsilon(v_0) &amp; -v_1\varepsilon(v_1)-v_0\varepsilon(v_0) \\ -v_0-v_1 &amp; 1+v_0 v_1 \varepsilon(v_1)\end{matrix}\right) \\
&amp; = a(v_2) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v_2\varepsilon(v_2) \\ -v_2 &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) \\
&amp; = L(v_2).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the diagonal components, we see immediately that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(v_0) = \varepsilon(v_1)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary values of &lt;math&gt;v_0, v_1&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(v) = \operatorname{const.} = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Using this we can rewrite the equation for the  
&lt;math&gt;a(v_0)a(v_1)(1+v_0v_1\varepsilon) = a(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;\,a(v_0)a(v_1)(-v_0-v_1) = -v_2 a(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;
by comparing each of the components at indeces ''(1,1)'' and ''(2,1)'' respectively.
Substituting &lt;math&gt;a(v_2)&lt;/math&gt; yields

&lt;math&gt;(1) \ \ a(v_0)a(v_1)(-v_0-v_1) = -v_2 a(v_0)a(v_1)(1+v_0v_1\varepsilon) &lt;/math&gt;

from which we have &lt;math&gt;v_2 = \frac{v_0+v_1}{1+v_0v_1\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;.

Reinserting this into the first equation we have
&lt;math&gt;
a(v_0)a(v_1)(1+v_0v_1\varepsilon) = a(\frac{v_0+v_1}{1+v_0v_1\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

In case &lt;math&gt; v := v_0 = -v_1&lt;/math&gt; this simplifies to 
&lt;math&gt;
a(v)a(-v)(1-v^2\varepsilon) = a(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;  as &lt;math&gt;\, L(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix.


Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) = \varphi(-x)&lt;/math&gt; be an even function and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = -\psi(-x)&lt;/math&gt; an odd function
such that &lt;math&gt;a(v) = e^{\varphi(v) + \psi(v)}&lt;/math&gt;.

This gives us &lt;math&gt;e^{\varphi(v) + \psi(v) + \varphi(v) - \psi(v)-2\pi\operatorname i k} = (1-v^2\varepsilon)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Taking the logarithm and simplifying yields &lt;math&gt;\varphi(v) = -\frac12\ln (1-v^2\varepsilon) + \pi\operatorname i k&lt;/math&gt;
from which we get &lt;math&gt;a(v)=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-v^2\varepsilon)}} e^{\psi(v)}&lt;/math&gt; with any odd function
&lt;math&gt;\,\psi(-v)=-\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;. The negative sign is ruled out by &lt;math&gt;\, a(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;.


Substituting &lt;math&gt;\, a(v)&lt;/math&gt; in equation (1) verifies the solution but leaves us with
&lt;math&gt;\psi(v_0) + \psi(v_1) = \psi(\frac{v_0+v_1}{1+v_0v_1\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove &lt;math&gt;\psi(v) \equiv 0 &lt;/math&gt; we flip the direction of the x-axis in the base system as well as in the transformed system. The choice of the direction of the axis must not lead to different results. In the flipped coordinates the Lorentz transformation takes the form &lt;math&gt;L(v') = a(v') \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v'\varepsilon \\ -v' &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) = a(-v) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; v\varepsilon \\ v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;v' = -v&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand we can compute &lt;math&gt;L(v')&lt;/math&gt; by using a coordinate transformation on &lt;math&gt;L(v)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; L(v') = \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1\end{matrix}\right) a(v) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; v\varepsilon \\ v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{matrix}\right) =
a(v)\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v\varepsilon \\ -v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; from which we get
&lt;math&gt;\,a(-v) = a(v)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\,\psi(-v)=\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;. Together with &lt;math&gt;\,\psi(-v)=-\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;
this gives &lt;math&gt;\psi(v) \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Looking at the [[wikipedia:eigenvector | eigenvectors]] of ''L(v)'' we see they are &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix} 1 \\ \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt\varepsilon}\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; independent of ''v''.

This is equivalent to a ''transformation invariant'' velocity &lt;math&gt;\frac1\sqrt\varepsilon=:c_0&lt;/math&gt; which experimentation shows to be equal to the speed of light. 
Altogether we have:

 &lt;center&gt; 

 &lt;math&gt;L(v)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c_0^2}}}\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -\frac{v}{c_0^2} \\ -v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0&lt;/math&gt; we would have the Galileian case with no finite invariant velocity.

Behold that if we did the same deduction not in the spacetime plane for ''(t, x)'' but in the space plane ''(x, y)'' with [[wikipedia:slope | slope]] ''m=y/x'' instead of velocity ''v=x/t'' nothing would change except that, not by calculation but by experimentation alone, it would have turned out that &lt;math&gt;\,\varepsilon = -1&lt;/math&gt; and ''L(m)'' is just a rotation in the [[wikipedia: Euclidean geometry | euclidian]] space with no real valued eigenvectors.

{{clr}}
It is an interesting exercise to compare this result with the assumptions of reciprocity, homogeneity and isotropy mentioned earlier. Do the linear equations contained in the matrix formulation of the Lorentz transformation above assume a particular spacetime from the outset? 

{{clr}}
It is further important to mention that the [[wikipedia:determinant | determinant]] &lt;math&gt;\, \det L(v) = 1&lt;/math&gt; independent of velocity. This directly implicates that ''spacetime volumes are conserved.''

=== The geometry of space-time ===

SR uses a 'flat' 4-dimensional Minkowski space, which is an example of a space-time.  This space, however, is very similar to the standard 3 dimensional Euclidean space, and fortunately by that fact, very easy to work with.

The differential of distance(''ds'') in Cartesian 3D space is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(dx_1,dx_2,dx_3)&lt;/math&gt; are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions. In the geometry of special relativity, a fourth dimension, time, is added, with units of c, so that the equation for the differential of distance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

In many situations it may be convenient to treat time as imaginary  (e.g. it may simplify equations), in which case &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation is replaced by &lt;math&gt;i.t'&lt;/math&gt;, and the  metric becomes

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 + c^2(dt')^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that ds in this case is the distance, and not the interval. Caution should be exercised in the use of 'imaginary' time, it is not part of the modern theory of relativity.  Blandford and Thorne (2004) in their &quot;Applications of Classical Physics&quot; (http://www.pma.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2004/ ), write the following about imaginary time: &quot;(i) it hides the true physical geometry of Minkowski spacetime, (ii) it cannot be extended in any reasonable manner to non-orthonormal bases in flat spacetime, and (iii) it cannot be extended in any reasonable manner to the curvilinear coordinates that one must use in general relativity.&quot; 

If we reduce the spatial dimensions to 2, so that we can represent the physics in a 3-D space

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

We see that things such as light which move at the speed of light lie along a dual-cone:

[[image:sr1.jpg]]

defined by the equation 

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = 0 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 = c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the equation of a circle with &lt;math&gt;r=c dt&lt;/math&gt;.
The path of something that moves at the speed of light is known as a '''null geodesic'''. If we extend the equation above to three spatial dimensions, the null geodesics are
continuous concentric spheres, with radius = distance = c×(±time).

[[image:Null_spherical_space_(special_relativity).jpg]]

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = 0 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 = c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This null dual-cone represents the &quot;line of sight&quot; of a point in space.  That is, when we look at the stars and say &quot;The light from that star which I am receiving is X years old.&quot;, we are looking down this line of sight: a null geodesic.  We are looking at an event &lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2} &lt;/math&gt; meters away and ''d/c'' seconds in the past. For this reason the null dual cone is also known as the 'light cone'. (The point in the lower left of the picture below represents the star, the origin represents the observer, and the line represents the null geodesic &quot;line of sight&quot;.)

[[image:Sr1.jpg]]

The cone in the ''-t'' region is the information that the point is 'receiving', while the cone in the ''+t'' section is the information that the point is 'sending'.

===Length contraction, time dilation and phase===
Consider two inertial frames in standard configuration.  There is a rigid rod moving along in the second frame at v m/s. The length of the rod is determined by observing the positions of the end points of the rod simultaneously - if the rod is moving it would be nonsense to use any other measure of length. An observer who is moving at the same velocity as the rod measures its &quot;rest length&quot;. The Lorentz transformation for coordinates along the x axis is:

&lt;math&gt;x^' = \gamma (x - vt)&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the positions, &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2&lt;/math&gt;, of the two ends of the rod are determined simultaneously (ie: &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is constant):

&lt;math&gt;(x^'_1 - x^'_2) = \gamma (x_1 - x_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Or, using &lt;math&gt;L_0 = (x^'_1 - x^'_2) &lt;/math&gt; for the rest length of the rod and &lt;math&gt;L = (x_1 - x_2)&lt;/math&gt; for the length of the rod that is measured by the observer who sees it fly past at v m/s:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L_0 = \gamma L}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, elaborating &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L = {L_0}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words the length of an object moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is contracted in the direction of motion by a factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of motion.

The Lorentz transformation also affects the rate at which clocks appear to change their readings. The Lorentz transformation for time is:

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \gamma (t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

This transformation has two components:

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \gamma t - \gamma vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;

and is a straight line graph (ie: &lt;math&gt;t^' = mt + c&lt;/math&gt;).

The gradient of the graph is &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' = \gamma \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

or:

&lt;math&gt;t^'_1-t^'_2 = \gamma (t_1 - t_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore clocks in the moving frame will appear to go slow, if &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is a time interval in the rest frame and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a time interval in the moving frame:

&lt;math&gt;T = \gamma T_0&lt;/math&gt;

Or, expanding:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T = \frac{T_0}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The intercept of the graph is:

&lt;math&gt;-\gamma vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;

This means that if a clock at point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is compared with a clock that was synchronised between frames at the origin it will show a constant time difference of &lt;math&gt;\gamma vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt; seconds. This quantity is known as the relativistic phase difference or &quot;phase&quot;.

[[Image:reldil.gif]]

The relativistic phase is as important as the length contraction and time dilation results. It is the amount by which clocks that are synchronised at the origin go out of synchronisation with distance along the direction of travel. Phase affects all clocks except those at the point where clocks are syncronised and the infinitessimal y and z planes that cut this point. All clocks everywhere else will be out of synchronisation between the frames. The effect of phase is shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:rel1.gif]]

If the inertial frames are each composed of arrays of clocks spread over space then the clocks will be out of synchronisation as shown in the illustration above.

It is interesting to see how the phase term cancels out when time differences are being considered. It cancels out because the phase term &lt;math&gt;x^'v/c^2&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the clock that is at a constant position in the primed frame. The Lorentz transform for time is:

: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{t^' + (v/c^2)x^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

A difference between two times is:

: &lt;math&gt;t_1 - t_2 = \frac{t_1^' + (v/c^2)x^' - t_2^' - (v/c^2)x^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The important thing to note is that the clock is at the same position &lt;math&gt;x^'&lt;/math&gt; '''in its own reference frame'''.

The result is that: 

: &lt;math&gt;t_1 - t_2 = \frac{t_1^' - t_2^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where the phase terms have cancelled.

==Hyperbolic geometry==

In the flat spacetime of Special Relativity: 

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = c^2t^{2} - x^{2} - y^2 - z^2&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the x-axis alone:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = c^2t^{2} - x^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The standard equation of a hyperbola is:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of spacetime:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(ct)^2}{s^2} - \frac{x^2}{s^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Spacetime intervals separate one place or event in spacetime from another. So, for a given motion from one place to another or a given fixed length in one reference frame, given time interval etc. the metric of spacetime describes a hyperbolic space. This hyperbolic space encompasses the coordinates of all the observations made of the given interval by any observers.

[[Image:relhyperb.gif]]

It is possible to conceive of rotations in hyperbolic space in a similar way to rotations in Euclidean space. The idea of a rotation in hyperbolic space is summarised in the illustration below:

[[Image:relhyper2.gif]]

A rotation in hyperbolic space is equivalent to changing from one frame of reference to another whilst observing the same spacetime interval. It is moving from coordinates that give:

&lt;math&gt;(ct)^2 - x^2 = s^2&lt;/math&gt;

to coordinates that give:

&lt;math&gt;(ct^')^2 - {x^'}^2 = s^2&lt;/math&gt;

The formula for a rotation in hyperbolic space provides an alternative form of the Lorentz transformation ie:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c t \\x 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cosh \phi &amp; \sinh \phi \\
\sinh \phi &amp; \cosh \phi 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c t'\\x'
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

From which:

&lt;math&gt;x = x^' \cosh \phi + ct^' \sinh \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ct = x^' \sinh \phi + ct^' \cosh \phi&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be determined by considering the coordinates assigned to a moving light that moves along the x axis from the origin at &lt;math&gt;v m sec^1&lt;/math&gt; flashes on for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; seconds then flashes off.

The coordinates assigned by an observer on the light are: &lt;math&gt;t',0,0,0&lt;/math&gt;, the coordinates assigned by the stationary observer are &lt;math&gt;t, x=vt, 0, 0&lt;/math&gt;. The hyperbola representing these observations is illustrated below:

[[Image:relbeta.gif]]

The equation of the hyperbola is:

&lt;math&gt;(ct)^2 - x^2 = s^2 = (ct^')^2&lt;/math&gt;

but x=vt for the end of the flash so:

&lt;math&gt;\tanh \phi = \frac {v}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, from hyperbolic trigonometry:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\tanh^2{\phi}}} = \sqrt{ 
\frac{\cosh^2\phi} 
{\cosh^2\phi-\sinh^2\phi}
}= \cosh\phi&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\tanh\phi = \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\cosh\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

and, from the hyperbolic trigonometric formula &lt;math&gt;\sinh\phi = \tanh\phi \cosh\phi&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\sinh\phi = {\frac{v}{c}}\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting these values into the equations for the hyperbolic rotation:

&lt;math&gt;x = x^' \cosh \phi + ct^' \sinh \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma x^' + ct^' \gamma v/c &lt;/math&gt;

Which gives the standard transform for x:

&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma ( x^' + vt^')&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar way &lt;math&gt;ct = x^' \sinh \phi + ct^' \cosh \phi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt;t = \gamma (t^' + vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

So the Lorentz transformations can also be derived from the assumption that boosts are equivalent to rotations in hyperbolic space with a metric &lt;math&gt;s^2 = c^2t^{2} - x^{2} - y^2 - z^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''rapidity''' of the boost.

===Addition of velocities===

Suppose there are three observers 1, 2, and 3 who are moving at different velocities along the x-axis. Observers 1 and 2 are moving at a relative velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and observers 2 and 3 are moving at a relative velocity of &lt;math&gt;u^'&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is to determine the velocity of observer 3 as observed by observer 1 (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;).

It turns out that there is a very convenient relationship between rapidities that solves this problem:

If &lt;math&gt;v/c = \tanh{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u^'/c = \tanh{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; then:

&lt;math&gt;u/c = \tanh(\phi + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words the rapidities can be simply added from one observer to another ie:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \phi + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Hence: 

&lt;math&gt;\tanh(\sigma) =  \tanh(\phi + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

So the velocities can be added by simply adding the rapidities. Using hyperbolic trigonometry:

&lt;math&gt;u/c = \tanh(\alpha + \phi) = \frac{\tanh{\alpha} + \tanh{\phi}}{1+\tanh{\alpha}\tanh{\phi}} = \frac{u^'/c + v/c}{1+u^'v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;  Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u = \frac{u^' + v}{1+u^'v/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the relativistic velocity addition theorem.

The relationship &lt;math&gt;u/c = \tanh(\phi + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is shown below:

[[Image:relvelh.gif]]

Velocity transformations can be obtained without referring to the rapidity. The general case of the transformation of velocities in any direction is derived as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'}= (u^'_1, u^'_2, u^'_3) &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;u^'_1&lt;/math&gt; etc. are the components of the velocity in the x, y, z directions.

Writing out the components of velocity:

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = dx^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = dy^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = dz^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;

But from the Lorentz transformations:

&lt;math&gt;dx^' = \gamma (dx - v dt)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dy^' = dy&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dz^' = dz&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dt^' = \gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = dx^'/dt^' = \frac{\gamma (dx - v dt)}{\gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = dy^'/dt^' = \frac{dy}{\gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = dz^'/dt^' = \frac{dz}{\gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing top and bottom of each fraction by &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = \frac{\gamma (dx/dt - v)}{\gamma (1 - vdx/dt/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = \frac{dy/dt}{\gamma (1 - vdx/dt/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = \frac{dz/dt}{\gamma (1 - vdx/dt/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = \frac{u - v}{1 - uv/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = \frac{u_2}{\gamma (1 - uv/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = \frac{u_3}{\gamma (1 - uv/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

The full velocity transformations are tabulated below:

&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Having calculated the components of the velocity vector it it now possible to calculate the magnitudes of the overall vectors between frames:

&lt;math&gt;u = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^' = \sqrt{u^{'2}_1 + u^{'2}_2 + u^{'2}_3}&lt;/math&gt;

====Addition of velocities - another approach====

In classical physics, velocities simply add. If an object moves with speed ''u'' in one reference frame, which is itself moving at ''v'' with respect to a second frame, the object moves at speed ''u''+''v'' in that second frame.

This is inconsistant with relativity because it predicts that if the speed of light is ''c'' in the first frame it will be ''v''+''c'' in the second.

We need to find an alternative formula for combining velocities. We can do this with the Lorentz transform.

Because the factor ''v''/''c'' will keep recurring we shall call that ratio &amp;beta;.

We are considering three frames; frame O, frame O' which moves at speed ''u'' with respect to frame O, and frame O&quot; which moves at speed ''v'' with respect to frame O'.

We want to know the speed of O&quot; with respect to frame O,''U'' which would classically be ''u''+''v''.

The transforms from O to O' and O' to O&quot; can be written as matrix equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ ct' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta \\ -\beta &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \gamma' 
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta' \\ -\beta' &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ ct' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where we are defining the &amp;beta;'s and &amp;gamma;'s as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\beta = \frac{u}{c} &amp; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2 }} \\
\beta^\prime = \frac{v}{c} &amp; 
\gamma^\prime  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\beta^\prime}^2 }} 
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

We can combine these to get the relationship between the O and O&quot; coordinates simply by multiplying the matrices, giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \gamma^\prime 
\begin{pmatrix} 1+\beta \beta' &amp; - (\beta + \beta') \\
- (\beta + \beta')  &amp; 1+\beta \beta'  \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

This should be the same as the Lorentz transform between the two frames,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = 
\gamma'' \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta'' \\ -\beta'' &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad (2) \mbox{  where }
\begin{matrix} \beta'' &amp; = &amp; \frac{U}{c} \\
\gamma'' &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\beta''}^2 }} \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

These two sets of equations do look similar. We can make them look more similar still by taking a factor of 1+&amp;beta;&amp;beta;' out of the matrix in (1) giving:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \gamma' (1+\beta \beta')  
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'} \\
- \frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'}  &amp; 1  \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This will be identical with equation 2 if

:&lt;math&gt;\beta''=\frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'} \mbox{ (3a)   and } 
\gamma'' = \gamma \gamma' (1+\beta \beta')  \mbox{ (3b)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two equations ''must'' give identical results, we know these conditions must be true.

Writing the &amp;beta;'s in terms of the velocities equation 3a becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U}{c}=\frac{\frac{u}{c} + \frac{v}{c}}{1+\frac{uv}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which tells us ''U'' in terms of ''u'' and ''v''.

A little algebra shows that this implies equation 3b is also true &lt;!-- exercise --&gt;

Multiplying by ''c'' we can finally write.

&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{u+v}{1+\frac{uv}{c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that if ''u'' or ''v'' is much smaller than ''c'' the denominator is approximately 1, and the velocities approximately add but if either ''u'' or ''v'' is ''c'' then so is ''U'', just as we expected.

===Acceleration transformation===

'''This section is under development'''. 

It was seen above that:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {u}{c} = \tanh{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

and, if &lt;math&gt;\frac {v}{c} =\tanh \beta&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{u^'}{c} = \tanh \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; the velocity addition theorem can be expressed as the sum of the rapidities:

&lt;math&gt;\phi = \beta + \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

If we differentiate this equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to investigate acceleration, then assuming &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is constant:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

so


(1) &lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt^'}\frac{dt^'}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} \!&lt;/math&gt; is also equal to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac {d\phi}{du}\frac{du}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\phi = \tanh^{-1} (u/c) \!&lt;/math&gt; and the derivative of an arctangent is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \tanh^{-1}(x)}{dx} = \frac{1}{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{du} = \frac{1}{c}\frac {1}{(1-u^2/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

For brevity we will use the notation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{1-u^2/c^2} = \gamma^2(u)&lt;/math&gt;

ie: &lt;math&gt;\gamma(u)&lt;/math&gt; is gamma for observers moving at a relative velocity of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.

So:

(2)&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac{1}{c} \gamma^2(u) \frac{du}{dt}\!&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the object observed by the unprimed and primed observers is:

&lt;math&gt;u^2 = {u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + {u_3}^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^{'2} = {u_1}^{'2} + {u_2}^{'2} + {u_3}^{'2}\!&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{dr}{dt}\!&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^' = \frac{dr^'}{dt^'}\!&lt;/math&gt; 

So:

&lt;math&gt;u^2dt^2 = dr^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^{'2}dt^{'2} = dr^{'2} \!&lt;/math&gt;

and using the Minkowski metric:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dr^2 - cdt^2 = dr^{'2} - cdt^{'2} \!&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;u^2dt^2 - cdt^2 = u^{'2}dt^{'2} - cdt^{'2} \!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;dt^2(c^2 - u^2) = dt^{'2}(u^{'2} - c^2) \!&lt;/math&gt;

Given that &lt;math&gt;\gamma (u) = \frac {c}{\sqrt{c^2 - u^2}} \!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma (u^') = \frac {c}{\sqrt{c^2 - u^{'2}}}\!&lt;/math&gt;

(3)&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt^'}{dt} = \frac {\gamma(u^')}{\gamma(u)}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, substituting (2) and (3) in (1):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c} \gamma^2(u) \frac{du}{dt} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt^'}\frac {\gamma(u^')}{\gamma(u)}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the differential of arctanh as before to determine &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\epsilon}{dt^'}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma^3(u^')\frac {du^'}{dt^'} = \gamma^3(u)\frac {du}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a different result from the Newtonian formula in which &lt;math&gt;du/dt = du^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''proper acceleration''', &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the acceleration of an object in its rest frame. It is the instantaneous change in velocity for an observer for whom &lt;math&gt;u^'=0 \!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = du^'/dt^' \!&lt;/math&gt;.  In these circumstances:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \gamma^3(u)\frac{du}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The term 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{dt}\!&lt;/math&gt; is called &quot;coordinate acceleration&quot;.

==Another approach to acceleration==

Classically we would talk about a particle at ''x''(''t'') with acceleration ''d''&amp;sup2;''x''/''dt''&amp;sup2;. In relativity we must treat time as just another coordinate, and use derivatives with respect to proper time, which means our notion of acceleration will change. We can assume the particle is moving slower than light.

Since &amp;tau; increases monotonically with ''t'' (no time travel allowed) we can easily parameterise the path of the particle with &amp;tau; rather than ''t''. Derivatives with respect to these two variables then differ only by a factor of &amp;gamma;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\tau} = \gamma \frac{d}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

which gives us the connection between the classical and relativstic formulae.

Lets suppose we have a particle moving on the path (''x''(&amp;tau;),''ct''(&amp;tau;)), where &amp;tau; is the particle's proper time.

Its velocity four vector is

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u} = \frac{d}{d\tau}(x, ct) = \gamma (\dot{\mathbf{x}}, c) &lt;/math&gt;

In the particles rest frame this is (0,''c''), which has constant magnitude -''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but this scalar must be the same in all frames, thus

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u} \cdot \underline{u} = -c^2 &lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''the magnitude of the velocity is '''always''' constant.''

Differentiating this, we can immediately say

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u} \cdot \underline{a} = 
\frac{d}{d\tau} \underline{u} \cdot \underline{u}= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so, ''velocity and acceleration are '''always''' perpendicular''.

These two results are much simpler than in classical physics.

Differentiating the velocity gives us, after some algebra &lt;!-- appropriate level of detail  here? --&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = \gamma^4 \ddot{x} (1, \frac{v}{c}) &lt;/math&gt;

when the motion is along the ''x''-axis. Since the spatial and temporal components must be 3-vectors and scalars respectively we immediately see that for motion in arbitary directions,


:&lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = \gamma^4 \left( \ddot{\mathbf{x}} , \frac{\ddot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot \mathbf{v} }{c} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of this is 

:&lt;math&gt;|\underline{a}| = \gamma^3 \ddot{x} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the classical magnitude, corrected by a factor dependant on &amp;gamma;. When the velocity is much less than ''c'' this factor is approximately 1, so in that limit the magnitudes are the same, as they should be.

Knowing this, we can work out the equation of motion for a particle with constant acceleration ''a'' along the ''x''-axis. For simplicity, we'll assume the initial velocity is 0.

Since the accleration is constant

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\dot{v}}{\left( 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}} = a &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating once we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = at &lt;/math&gt;

or, on rearranging

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{at}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2/c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

If ''at'' is much less than ''c'' this gives a velocity of approximately ''at'', identical to the classical result, but as ''t'' tends to infinity the velocity tends to ''c''.

The position is

:&lt;math&gt; x = d+ \frac{c^2}{a}\sqrt{1+ \frac{a^2 t^2}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is some constant. We can choose our coordinate system to make ''d'' zero.

Calling the interval between the origin and the particle, ''I'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
I^2 &amp; = &amp; x^2 &amp; - &amp; c^2t^2 \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{c^4}{a^2} \left( 1+ \frac{a^2 t^2}{c^2} \right) &amp; - &amp; c^2t^2\\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{c^4}{a^2} &amp; &amp; \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the interval between the particle and the origin is constant. Notice, this is the equation for an hyperbola, so we know the particle's trajectory.

==Momentum==

Classically, momentum is velocity multiplied by mass. We can use the same definition in relativity, and see where it takes us.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{p}=m_0 \underline{u}= m_0 \gamma (\mathbf{v}, c)&lt;/math&gt;

You may sometimes see the product ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gamma; which shows up here called the ''relativistic mass'', but we will not be using this approach.

The mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is generally called the ''rest mass'', to distinguish it from the relativistic mass.

The spatial component of the four-momemntum is clearly the classical momentum, scaled by a factor of &amp;gamma;. At speeds much less than ''c'' this will be approximately 1.

The temporal component is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gamma;''c''. To see what this means we can look at its value when ''v''/''c'' is small.

:&lt;math&gt;m_0 \gamma c = \frac{m_0 c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}= 
m_0 c \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{v^4}{c^4} + \cdots
\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The first term in this expansion is a constant.

The second term is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_0 v^2}{2c}&lt;/math&gt;
which we recognise as being the classical kinetic energy, divided by ''c''.

Now, adding a constant to the definition of kinetic energy makes no real difference, since all that matters are changes in energy, so we can identify this temporal component of relativistic momentum with the energy over ''c''.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{p}= (\gamma \mathbf{p}, E/c)&lt;/math&gt;

We then have

:&lt;math&gt;E = m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 + \frac{3}{8}\frac{m_0 v^4}{c^2} 
+ \cdots  &lt;/math&gt;

Even at rest, the particle has a kinetic energy,

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: thick solid blue;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E=m_0 c^2, \,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

the most famous relativistic equation.

==Force==

Classically, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

We can get the equivalent relativistic equation simply by replacing 3-vectors with 4-vectors and ''t'' with &amp;tau;, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = \frac{d\underline{p}}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Provided the rest mass is constant, as it is for all simple systems, we can rewrite this as  

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = m \underline{a}&lt;/math&gt;

We already know about &lt;u&gt;''a''&lt;/u&gt; so we can now write

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = \gamma^4 \left( \mathbf{F}, 
\frac{ \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} }{c} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The temporal component of this is essentially the ''power'', the rate of change of energy with time, as might be expected from energy being the temporal component of momentum.

==Accelerated Frames and Event Horizons==

Figure: Spacetime diagram showing the world line of the origin of a reference frame undergoing constant acceleration.  

We know this world line is an hyperbola, with asymptotes ''x''=&amp;plusmn;''ct''. Looking at the diagram show another property.

'''No''' light from the 'twilight zone', where ''x'' is smaller than ''ct'', can  '''ever''' reach the accelerated observer. Hence, no event in the twilight zone can affect the observer. 

Conversely, there is a region, where ''x'' is smaller than -''ct'', which '''no''' light from the accelerated observer can '''ever''' reach. Hence the observer can not affect any events in this region.

Because of this we call the two aymptotes ''event horizons''. In some ways, they are like one-way barriers in space-time. The accelerated observer can see objects vanishing behind an event horizon, but they never see any re-emerge from it.

These particular event horizons are observer dependent, as are all event horizons in special relativity. However, general relativity permits event-horizons which are observer independent.

We are not going to prove this, but we can some idea about how event horizons apply to general relativity by using its basic principle, called the equivalence principle by Einstein: that gravity is nothing more than an inertial force. 

This means that gravity is locally indistinguishable from forces due to acceleration; if the elevator doors are closed, we can't tell whether we are stationary in a 1g gravity field or being accelerated at 1g in zero gravity.

This suggests that something can be learned about general relativity by examining the properties of accelerated reference frames

Now, since the gravitational force on the Earth points downward, it follows that we must be constantly accelerating upward as we stand on the surface of the Earth. The obvious problem with this interpretation of gravity is that we don't appear to be moving away from the center of the Earth, which would seem to be a natural consequence of such an acceleration. 

However, the calculation of the previous chapter shows that even though the object associated with the curved world line in the figure above is accelerating away from the origin, it always remains the same distance (in its own frame) from the origin. In other words, even though we are accelerating away from the center of the Earth, the distance to the center of the Earth remains constant!

Therefore, because of the equivalence principle, we can expect to see the same things as an accelerated observer in special relativity, ''including an event horizon.''

For acceleration in special relativity, ''inertial'' objects pass the event horizon at speed ''c'' at time infinity, ''relative to the observer''.

Similarly, in general relativity, ''freely falling'' objects pass the event horizon at speed ''c'' at time infinity, ''relative to a static observer.''
By reversing the trajectories we can conclude that at the event horizon the escape velocity is ''c'', i.e gravity is so strong light can not escape.

Thus, using the equivalence principle, and behaviour under acceleration in special relativity, we've predicted black holes.

There isn't actually an event horizon inside the earth, since the mass of the earth is not concentrated in a point and the earth can only be treated as a point mass while outside the earth's surface, which lies outside where the event horizon should otherwise have been.

==The red shift==

Spacetime diagram for explaining the gravitational red shift. 

Light emitted at a lower level in a gravitational field has its frequency reduced as it travels to a higher level. This phenomenon is called the gravitational red shift. 

We can see why this happens by using the principle of equivalence. Being in a gravitational field is equivalent to being in an accelerated frame, so knowing how the doppler shift works in such a frame will tell us how it works in a gravitational field. 

We view the process of light emission and absorption from the the unaccelerated or inertial frame, as shown in the figure above. In this reference frame the observer of the light is accelerating to the right, as indicated by the curved red world line, which is equivalent to a gravitational force to the left. 

The light is emitted at point A with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; by a source which is stationary at this instant. At this instant the observer is also stationary in this frame. However, by the time the light gets to the observer, they have a velocity to the right which means that the observer measures a Doppler shifted freqency &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;/math&gt; for the light. Since the observer is moving away from the source, &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, as indicated above.

The relativistic Doppler shift is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\omega'}{\omega} = \sqrt{ \frac{1 - U/c}{1 + U/c}} , &lt;/math&gt;

so we need to compute ''U''/''c''. The line of simultaneity for the observer at point B goes through the origin, and is thus given by line segment OB. The slope of this line is ''U''/''c'', where ''U'' is the velocity of the observer at point B. From the figure we see that this slope is also given by the ratio ''X' /X''. 

Equating these, eliminating ''X'' in favor of ''L'' = &amp;radic;(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''X''&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the actual invariant distance of the observer from the origin, and substituting into the previous equation results in our gravitational red shift formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
\frac{\omega'}{\omega} &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{ \frac{X - X'}{X + X'} } &amp; = &amp;
\sqrt{\frac{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} - X'}{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} + X'} }\\
&amp; =&amp; \frac{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} - X'}{L} &amp; =&amp; \frac{X-X'}{L}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X''&amp;prime; = 0, then there is no redshift, because the source is collocated with the observer. On the other hand, if the source is located at the origin, so ''X''&amp;prime;=''X'', the Doppler shifted frequency is zero. In addition, the light never gets to the observer, since the world line is asymptotic to the light world line passing through the origin. If the source is at a higher level in the gravitational field than the observer, so that ''X''&amp;prime; &lt; 0, then the frequency is shifted to a higher value, i. e., it becomes a ''blue shift''.

To see how this doppler shift relates to the strength of gravity, ''g'', and the distance ''h'' between the source and the observer, first note that

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{c^2}{g} \qquad X-X'=L-h &lt;/math&gt;

Making these substitutions gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega'}{\omega} = 1-\frac{gh}{c^2} \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

So the redshift is proportional to gravity.

Since this doppler shift doesn't depend on the type of wave we can conclude that it is actually caused by time dilation, just like the doppler shift due to relative motion.

That is, gravity slows down time.

==Energy and frequency==

In equation 1 ''gh'' is the change in gravitational potential energy so the change in frequency is proportional to change in potential energy, which suggests there might be a connection with energy conservation.

However, since we haven't yet established any connection between frequency and energy, we can't simply apply an energy conservation argument. Instead, we can argue in reverse, finding out what the energy-frequency relationship must be if energy is to be conserved.

Suppose we have two identical systems, both at rest in a uniform gravitational field ''g'' with initial energy ''E'' separated by a vertical distance ''h''.

The system has mass ''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, giving it potential energy, so the total energy of the two systems is initially 

:&lt;math&gt;E_i=2E - \frac{gh}{c^2}E &lt;/math&gt;

where the second term is due to the lesser potential energy of the lower system.

The lower system emits a burst of waves, frequency &amp;omega;, energy ''E''(&amp;omega;). When this reaches the upper system the waves have been
red-shifted to frequency &amp;omega;', energy ''E''(&amp;omega;'). This energy is absorbed by the upper system.

The total energy is now

:&lt;math&gt;E_f=E-E(\omega)+E+ E(\omega') - \left(E-E(\omega)\right)\frac{gh}{c^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since we want to preserve energy conservation, these two equations must give the same result. Equating them, we get

:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega') = E(\omega)(1-\frac{gh}{c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this with the doppler shift we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E(\omega')}{E(\omega)} = \frac{\omega'}{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;

which can only be true if ''E''(&amp;omega;) is proportional to &amp;omega;

I.e, energy conservation implies ''energy is proportional to frequency'', which is one of the axioms of quantum theory.

We could equally well have started with the quantum result and proved the gravitational red shift must exist. Either theory requires the other for consistency.

Since energy and frequency are each the temporal components of a four-vector, their being proportional implies the four-vectors themselves, and their spatial components, are also proportional. So, for waves, momentum is proportional to '''k'''.

Remember too, we saw earlier, when we looked at Hamilton's equations, that classical mechanics would be equivalent to a theory of anisotropic waves, in the geometrical optics limit, if energy were proportional to frequency and momentum to wave number. This proportionality isn't just required for energy conservation, it would make possible a theory uniting waves and particles.

None of this actually proves the proportionality, doing that requires experiment, but it does make it a natural assumptiom, which is indeed
confirmed by experiment.

Because of all this, from now on we'll assume that energy and frequency are related in this way, with the constant of proportionality being &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (c\mathbf{p}, E) = \hbar (c\mathbf{k}, \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

==Gravity and curvature==

The gravitational redshift also implies that space is curved. We can see this by considering a rectangle in space-time.

Without gravity, if we start at some point A, wait for time ''t'', then move at light-speed to the right for a distance ''h'', we get to the same place, B, as if we move at light-speed for a distance ''h'' then wait for time ''t'' at rest with respect to A. &lt;!-- diagram? --&gt;

With gravity, if we follow the first path, we rise a distance of ''ct'' then wait for time ''t''. On the second path, we begin by waiting for time ''t'', ''but this is dilated by gravity.'' To an observer at B we appear to be waiting for a time ''t''(1+''gh''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) before we start, so we end up at B later than on the first path. 

Thus, with gravity, it matters which order we add distance vectors in. This can't happen if space is flat, so ''space must be curved.''

To describe how it's curved we'd need the techniques of General Relativity.

==Potential Momentum==

In classical physics we know that kinematics can often be described by a potential energy alone. Now we've seen that in relativity the energy is just the temporal component of the momentum 4-vector, so we should expect the same of the potential energy. To see how this works, we'll reason by analogy from the classical case. 

For a free, non-relativistic particle of mass ''m'', the total energy ''E'' equals the kinetic energy ''K'' and is related to the momentum &amp;Pi; of the particle by

:&lt;math&gt; E = K = \frac{| \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2}{2m} \qquad \mbox{(free, non-relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt;

In the non-relativistic case, the momentum is  &amp;Pi;= ''m'''v''''', where '''v''' is the particle velocity.

If the particle is not free, but is subject to forces associated with a potential energy ''U''(''x'',''y'',''z''), then the equation must be modified to account for the contribution of ''U'' to the total energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = K = \frac{| \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2}{2m} \qquad \mbox{(non-free, non-relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt; 

The force on the particle is related to the potential energy by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = - \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} , \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \right) . &lt;/math&gt; 	

For a free, relativistic particle, we have
:&lt;math&gt; E = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(free, relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

The obvious way to add forces to the relativistic case is by rewriting this equation with a potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(incomplete!)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

However &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Pi = (\Pi, E/c)&lt;/math&gt; is a four-vector, so an equation with something subtracted from just one of the components of this four-vector is not relativistically invariant. In other words, this equation doesn't obey the principle of relativity, and therefore cannot be correct!

How can we fix this problem? One way is to define a new four-vector with ''U/c'' being its timelike part and some new vector '''Q''' being its spacelike part:
:&lt;math&gt; \underline{Q} \equiv ( \mathbf{ Q} , U/c) \qquad \mbox{(potential four-momentum)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

We then subtract '''Q''' from the momentum '''&amp;Pi;'''. When we do this, equation (13.5) becomes
:&lt;math&gt; E - U = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{ Q}|^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(non-free, relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity '''Q''' is called the potential momentum and &lt;u&gt;''Q''&lt;/u&gt; is the potential four-momentum.

If |'''&amp;Pi;'''-'''Q'''| is much smaller than ''mc'', this becomes approximately

:&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2m}\left( \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{Q} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This expression for the energy has the same form as the Hamiltonian we looked at for classical [[General Mechanics/Velocity Dependent Forces|velocity dependent forces]], so we know it predicts a force perpendicular to the velocity, when the condition is met. It turns out to be perpendicular even when the condition is met.

In classical physics the potential momentum is an optional extra. In relativity it is a necessary part of any potential field.

Some additional terminology is useful. We define
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ p} \equiv \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{ Q} \qquad \mbox{(kinetic momentum}) &lt;/math&gt;

as the kinetic momentum since in the classical case it reduces to ''m'''v'''''. In order to avoid confusion, we rename '''&amp;Pi;''' the total momentum. Thus, the total momentum equals the kinetic plus the potential momentum, in analogy with energy.

&lt;!-- Now superfluous
So far, we have shown that the introduction of a potential momentum complements the potential energy so as to make the energy-momentum relationship for a particle relativistically invariant. However, we as yet have no idea what causes potential momentum and what it does to the affected particle. We shall put off answering the former question and address only the latter at this point. A hint comes from the corresponding behavior of energy. The total energy of a particle is related to the quantum mechanical frequency &amp;omega; of the particle, and the total momentum is related to its wave vector '''k''':
:&lt;math&gt; E = \hbar \omega \qquad\qquad \boldsymbol{\Pi} = \hbar \mathbf{ k} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

However, the kinetic energy and the kinetic momentum are related to the particle's velocity '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = \frac{mc^2}{(1 - v^2 / c^2 )^{1/2}} \qquad 
\mathbf{p}= \boldsymbol{\Pi}-\mathbf{Q} = 
\frac{m \mathbf{ v}}{(1 - v^2 / c^2 )^{1/2}} , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' = |'''v'''|.

The relationship between kinetic momentum and velocity can be proven by dividing equation (13.7) by &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a dispersion relation and then computing the group velocity, which we equate to the particle velocity. However, we will not do this here.
--&gt;

==Conservation of 4 momentum==

We earlier introduced the ideas of energy and momentum conservation. In other words, if we have a number of particles isolated from the rest of the universe, each with momentum '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then particles may be created and destroyed and they may collide with each other.

In these interactions the energy and momentum of each particle may change, but the sum total of all the energy and the sum total of all the momentum remains constant with time:

:&lt;math&gt; E = \sum_i E_i = \mbox{const} \qquad 
\mathbf{p} = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i = \mbox{const}  &lt;/math&gt;

The expression is simpler in terms of four-momentum:

:&lt;math&gt; \underline{p} = \sum_i \underline{p}_i = \mbox{const} &lt;/math&gt;

At this point a statement such as the one above should ring alarm bells. Just what does it mean to say that the total energy and momentum remain constant with time in the context of relativity? Which time? The time in which reference frame?

Suppose two particles exchange four-momentum remotely at the time indicated by the fat horizontal bar in the left panel. Conservation of four-momentum implies that

&lt;math&gt; \underline{p}_A + \underline{p}_B = \underline{p}'_A + \underline{p}'_B
&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripted letters correspond to the particle labels in the figure. Primed values refer to the momentum after the exchange while no primes indicates values before the exchange.

Now view the exchange from the reference frame in the right panel. A problem with four-momentum conservation exists in the region between the thin horizontal lines. In this region particle B has already transferred its four-momentum, but it has yet to be received by particle A. In other words, four-momentum is not conserved in this reference frame!

This problem is so serious that we must eliminate the concept of action at a distance from the repertoire of physics. The only way to have particles interact remotely and still conserve four-momentum in all reference frames is to assume that all remote interactions are mediated by another particle, or by a field.

If the force is being mediated by a particle then first, particle A emits particle C in a manner which conserves the four-momentum. Second, particle C is absorbed by particle B in a similarly conservative interaction. 

If the force is being mediated by a field then first, particle A emits wave C, with momentum proportional to its wavenumber in a manner, which conserves the four-momentum. Wave C then travels at ''c'' or less until it is absorbed by particle B in a similarly conservative interaction. 

We'll see that in quantum theory the difference between a particle and a field vanishes, so these two pictures actually both describe the same mechanism a different perspective. Which every picture we use, four-momentum is conserved at all times in all reference frames.

In other words, momentum and energy are transferred from particle A to particle B in a two step process. In between the momentum resides in a particle or field.</text>

Hi,
I'd be more than happy to help out, I also despise the Heathcote book, and have personally found it useless in some cases. I'll add bits and pieces to it, since computing is one the most enjoyable and easiest subjects for me. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 11:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

Hi,
Thanks for the offer of help with the CIE section of the [[A-level Computing]] book.  I'll be adding to it over the course of the year as I teach the course, but the more people there are working on it the better, so do feel free to dip in as you feel like it!  Hoping that the book will become a great resource for any exam board. --[[Special:Contributions/Pastbury|Pastbury]] ([[User talk:Pastbury|discuss]]) 14:04, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

== Print version ==

I completely don't understand where's the problem. The proper use of print version is: you go to [[A-level Computing/Print version]] and click &quot;Press Refresh this page before you print to have the latest changes.&quot;. You will then see true print version and I can assure you won't see unneccessary templates there.

Anyway, because [[Template:Print version notice|print version notice]] seemed to introduce some confusion, I changed it to be more clear. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:04, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

: Page [[A-level_Computing/Print_version]] is no true print version, you should not print it in this shape. Besides print version notice, there are also &quot;edit&quot; links, left navigation bar and lots of elements that should not appear on print. This page is not ment to look like it would afer being printed, because it simply cannot. You have to click the bolded &quot;Printable version&quot; link or &quot;Refresh&quot; link in order to get page which really is ready to be printed.
: To sum up, you don't have to get rid of all templates like the print version notice, from [[A-level_Computing/Print_version]], because this is not page that will be printed. It's just an overview of how print version looks like. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:24, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== defining tables w/ integrity rule ==

Hi Pluke. I've been looking at your book - our curricula are not the same as the UK's, but similar - and I came across the DDL page. The primary key definition seems to be a bit different from what I've learnt at school. I'm wondering if this 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE crooks
(
ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
NAME CHAR(16),
GENDER CHAR(6),
DOB DATE,
TOWN CHAR(20),
NUMSCARS INTEGER
)&lt;/source&gt;

What I learnt at school was:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE crooks
(
ID INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
NAME CHAR(16),
GENDER CHAR(6),
DOB DATE,
TOWN CHAR(20),
NUMSCARS INTEGER,
PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);&lt;/source&gt;

I've tested yours and it works well, but I wonder if your code tells the RDBMS that the field is supposed to be not null and unique, or if that's already 'implied' in this code. Of course, RDBMSes are supposed to alert the data entry operator if the key field is null or non-unique, but I think it's better to define it explicitly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

=== Files and channels ===
In addition to the functionalities known from C's stdio, Tcl offers more commands that deal with files, similar to what shells provide, though often a bit more verbose. Here are some examples:

 glob *.tcl

List all files in the current directory that match the pattern *.tcl.

 file copy /from/path/file.ext /to/path
 .
 file delete /from/path/file.ext
 .
 file rename before.txt after.txt
 .
 cd /an/other/directory
 .
 pwd
To let code temporarily execute in another directory, use this pattern:
 set here [pwd]
 cd $someotherdir
 #... code here
 cd $here

More precisely, many &quot;file&quot; operations work in general on &quot;channels&quot;, which can be
* standard channels (stdin, stdout, stderr)
* files as opened with '''open ...'''
* pipes as opened with '''open |...''
* sockets (TCP)

=== File names ===
Files are often addressed with ''path names'', which indicate their position in the directory tree. Like Unix, Tcl uses &quot;/&quot; as path separator, while on Windows &quot;\&quot; is the native way - which brings trouble not only to Tcl, but even to C, because &quot;\&quot; is the escape character on both, so that e.g. \t is parsed as horizontal tab, \n as newline, etc. Fortunately Windows accepts natively &quot;/&quot; as well, so you can use forward slash in both Tcl and C programs as path separator without worries. However, you still have to take care of escape sequences. One stopgap measure is 
* to escape the escape character, i.e. write \\ for \, or
* brace backslashed names, e.g. {\foo\bar\grill.txt}
But Tcl allows to use the &quot;normal&quot; separator / in almost all situations, so you're safer off with that. Unfortunately, things are sad for Mac users, since MacOS (before X) accepts only &quot;:&quot; as file separator. 

If you need to, here's ways to convert between the two forms:
 % file normalize \\foo\\bar\\grill.txt
 C:/foo/bar/grill.txt
 % file nativename /foo/bar/grill.txt
 \foo\bar\grill.txt

You can even use file join command:
''file join arg1 arg2 ... argN''

Tcl will then take care of all platform dependent details to create platform independent path. For example:

''set somepath [file join foo bar grill.txt]''

will result in following path (on windows machine): foo/bar/grill.txt

=== Input and output ===
Tcl's input/output commands are pretty closely based on those from C's stdio (just strip off the leading ''f''):

* set handle ['''open''' ''filename ?mode?'']
* set data ['''read''' ''$handle ?int?'']
* '''tell''' ''$handle''
* '''seek''' ''$handle offset ?from?''
* '''puts''' ''?-nonewline? ?$handle? content''
* '''gets''' ''$handle ?varname?''
* '''close''' ''$handle''

C's ''printf'' functionality is split in two steps:
* format the data into a string with '''format''' (which is very much like ''sprintf'')
* output the resulting string with '''puts'''. For example,
 puts $handle [format &quot;%05d %s&quot; $number $text]

To process a text file line by line, you have two choices. If the file is smaller than several megabytes, you can read it just in one go:
 set f [open $filename]
 foreach line [split [read $f] \n] {
     # work with $line here ...
 }
 close $f
For files of any big size, you can read the lines one by one (though this is slightly slower than the above approach):
 set f [open $filename]
 while {[gets $f line] &gt;= 0} {
     # work with $line here ...
 }
 close $f
 
Finally, if you can format your file so that it is executable Tcl code, the following reading method is fastest:
 source $filename

To &quot;touch a file&quot;, i.e. create it if not exists, and in any case update its modification time, you can use this:
 proc touch name {close [open $name a]}

=== &quot;Binary&quot; files ===

All files are made of bytes, which are made of bits, which are binary. The term &quot;binary&quot; with files relates mostly to the fact that they can contain bytes of any value, and line-ends (Carriage Return+Newline in the DOS/Windows world) are not to be translated. Tcl can handle &quot;binary&quot; files without a problem -- just configure the channel as binary after opening:
 set fp [open tmp.jpg]
 fconfigure $fp -translation binary
 set content [read $fp]
 close $fp
Now the variable ''content'' holds the file's contents, byte for byte.

To test whether a file is &quot;binary&quot;, in the sense that it contains NUL bytes:
 proc binary? filename {
    set f [open $filename]
    set data [read $f 1024]
    close $f
    expr {[string first \x00 $data]&gt;=0}
 }

=== The file command ===
Many useful operations with files are collected in the '''file''' command. The first argument tells which operation to do:

* file atime name ?time? 
* file attributes name 
* file attributes name ?option? 
* file attributes name ?option value option value...? 
* file channels ?pattern? - returns the handles of currently open files
* file copy ?-force? ?- -? source target 
* file copy ?-force? ?- -? source ?source ...? targetDir 
* file delete ?-force? ?- -? pathname ?pathname ... ? 
* file dirname name - e.g. [file dirname /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; /foo/bar
* file executable name 
* file exists name 
* file extension name - e.g. [file extension /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; .txt
* file isdirectory name 
* file isfile name 
* file join name ?name ...? 
* file link ?-linktype? linkName ?target? 
* file lstat name varName 
* file mkdir dir ?dir ...? - creates one or more directories (folders)
* file mtime name ?time? 
* file nativename name 
* file normalize name 
* file owned name 
* file pathtype name 
* file readable name 
* file readlink name 
* file rename ?-force? ?- -? source target 
* file rename ?-force? ?- -? source ?source ...? targetDir 
* file rootname name - e.g. [file rootname /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; /foo/bar/grill
* file separator ?name? 
* file size name 
* file split name - e.g [file split /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; {foo bar grill.txt}
* file stat name varName 
* file system name 
* file tail name - e.g. [file tail /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; grill.txt
* file type name 
* file volumes - Windows: returns your &quot;drive letters&quot;, e.g {A:/ C:/}
* file writable name

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

[[Image:Seitan.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chunks of seitan]]
'''Seitan''' is a food made from [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] protein that has been extracted from wheat flour. It has a springy texture, with protein strands similar to those in chicken running through it, making it a reasonable replacement for meat in vegan or vegetarian dishes.

== Ingredients ==
* 10 oz (280g) High-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour)
* Water

== Procedure ==

# Add 2 cups water to 10 oz (280g) high-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour).
# Knead together until '''well-combined''' and elastic. It is advisable to keep hands wet so that the gluten doesn't stick to the hands.
# Cover with water and place in refrigerator for 1 hour. 
# Knead under water until water is cloudy; dump cloudy water and replace with clear, cold water. In the beginning the dough can still easily dissolve underwater so it is advisable to only cautiously squeeze it against the bowl. Later you might find it easier to knead over the water, squeezing out the water, and only to dip the mass into the water to wash off the starch, if the mass contains too much water you easily wash out gluten as well. The enriched water can be used to gain the insoluble starch, which settles on the bottom of the container, and what remains can serve as a base for grain milk.
# Continue kneading and replacing water until water remains clear after kneading.
# Divide gluten mass into loaf- or roll-shaped halves. At this point, there are several things you can add to the mass.
## Adding [[Cookbook:soy_sauce|soy sauce]] is recommended; this is traditional in the making of seitan.
## Spices. For example, the seitan can simulate Italian sausage by adding the correct spices, or adding poultry seasoning can make the seitan more similar to chicken or turkey.
## Adding [[Cookbook:Nutritional_Yeast|nutritional yeast]] is recommended, particularly if those consuming the seitan are vegetarian, and especially vegan. The B12 in nutritional yeast is a vitamin that is usually obtained through meats, eggs and/or dairy products.
# Place halves in pot, cover with vegetable broth or ''[[Cookbook:dashi|dashi]]''.
# Bring to a boil.
# Reduce heat to simmer; simmer for 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
# Remove from heat and serve as desired or use in place of meat.

Unused portions of Seitan can be kept in broth under refrigeration for up to a week, or can be frozen (drained from broth) for up to a month.

This will make approximately 28 oz (790g). of gluten. Because of their high protein content, gluten &quot;steaks&quot; can be grilled and fried to good effect.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* To avoid the washing process you can also buy 100% gluten flour in some stores. This flour would require only enough water to form it into a solid mass.
* Gluten created using just gluten flour can be rubbery and has a very &quot;gluteny&quot; taste. Adding 1 part garbanzo bean flour (Chick pea flour or gram flour) to 4 parts gluten flour makes for a less chewy texture and a better flavor.

'''Seitan burgers''' (''[[wikipedia:Schnitzel|vegetarian Schnitzel]]'') have a consistency similar to that of [[w:fillet|fillet]] and are easy to cover with breading.
For the breading the usual spices for meat can be used.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|Soy sauce]]
* Salt
* optional:
** Spices (e.g. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]])
** [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
** Breading: [[Cookbook:breading|breading mix]], salt, pepper, optional: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]]

==Procedure==
* Take 25% (volume) more water than gluten flour.
* Mix liquid ingredients (e.g. soy sauce) with the water.
* Mix solid ingredients (e.g. spices) with the flour. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
* Make gluten dough from 100% gluten flour (or use wheat flour, see above) and water. The dough should be suitable for kneading.
* The patties can be formed easily by hand and are sticky enough to pick up the breading mix easily.
* The finished patties can be fried in an oiled pan. Don't use too much oil but enough to let the breading pick up some oil on both sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to start programming in Common Lisp, you need to obtain a Common Lisp implementation. There are many of them available for most operating systems. There are both free and commercial implementations.

== Lispbox ==

[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/lispbox/ Lispbox] is an attempt to provide a newbie-friendly Common Lisp environment working out of the box. In addition to a Common Lisp implementation, Lispbox includes:
* [[Emacs]], a powerful and extensible text editor,
* SLIME, an Emacs extension which provides very good Common Lisp integration,
* ASDF, a Common Lisp extension for loading and installing code libraries and
* examples from the book &quot;Practical Common Lisp.&quot;

Using Lispbox should be quite easy. After running it, Emacs should display a Lisp prompt, where you can edit code interactively. Try to paste examples from this book and see what happens. If you don't want your code to be lost, you should learn how to manipulate files and buffers in Emacs, which is outside the scope of this book (check out the tutorial that comes with Emacs, which you can either find through the editor's &quot;Help&quot; menu or by hitting '''Ctrl-H, T''' or '''C-h t''' in Emacs-speak). Once you created a new file with Emacs that contains Lisp code, check if you're in Lisp mode (if the file's extension is .lisp, then you probably are) and hit '''C-c C-k''' to compile and load the whole file, or '''C-c C-c''' to compile and load the top-level expression you're currently editing.  

''More info on using Slime should be included somewhere''

== Able ==

[http://phil.nullable.eu/ Able] is an editor where installing libraries can be done by putting it in the directory able/systems. It hopes to work out of the box. It also includes some libraries by default.

== Free implementations ==

'''Note''': Even if you don't want to install Lispbox, it's still highly recommended to use the Emacs/SLIME combination to interface with these implementations. The reason is that the text console which they provide is quite awkward to work with, so most users prefer a nicer environment like the one SLIME provides.

=== GNU CLISP ===

[http://clisp.cons.org GNU CLISP] is a popular free implementation which can run on Windows and most Unix-like systems. If you're using Windows, you don't have much choice but to use CLISP. CLISP provides all ANSI Common Lisp features and is quite easy to install.

==== Features ====

* Full Unicode support
* Localised interface and compiler messages
* High portability: runs practically anywhere
* Compiles to portable bytecode (most or all other Common Lisp implementations compile to native code)
* Small memory footprint
* Arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic

==== Shortcomings ====

* Slow at number crunching

=== CMUCL ===

[http://www.cons.org/cmucl/ CMU Common Lisp] is a high performance Common Lisp implementation.

==== Features ====

* Non-native threading (“green” threads; x86 only)
* Produces fast code due to its optimizing compiler that produces native code
* Fast compiler

==== Shortcomings ====

* Relatively low portability (see the [http://www.cons.org/cmucl/platforms.html CMUCL portability webpage] for a list of supported platforms)

=== SBCL ===

[http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/ Steel Bank Common Lisp], a fork of CMU Common Lisp, is a portable implementation featuring native code compilation. It's easily the most popular Common Lisp compiler on platforms which neither CMUCL nor CCL will run on and an excellent choice even on those mainly because of its better debugging support (for instance, its compiler yields more warnings and is said to be stricter regarding ANSI compliance).

==== Features ====

* Unicode support
* Quite portable: runs on Unix-like systems including Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.
* Native threading support on Intel-based platforms
* Good speed because of the optimizing compiler that produces native code

==== Shortcomings ====

* Slow compilation speed (SBCL performs *many* optimizations, which can be slow)

=== Clozure CL ===

[http://www.clozure.com/clozurecl.html Clozure CL] is a Common Lisp implementation the PowerPC and AMD64. There is a pre-release x86 version. It is easily the most popular choice on Mac OS X, but it runs equally well on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD/amd64 systems; there is also a beta for Windows. On Mac OS X, CCL features a Cocoa interface.

==== Features ====

* Full Unicode support
* A fast compiler that produces equally fast code
* A Cocoa interface for Mac OS X GUI development
* Native threading

=== Embeddable CL (ECL)===

[http://ecls.sourceforge.net/ ECL] is a Common Lisp implementation focusing on portability and embeddability.  These goals are obtained by translating CL into C and passing that to a C compiler (typically gcc).  It runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Windows, running on top of the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and PowerPC processors.

==== Features ====

* Unicode support
* Translates CL into C, which produces relatively fast native code
* Interpreter which circumvents the slow build times
* Load on demand.  ECL defers loading modules until needed
* Ability to output portable C source files that can be compiled on other architectures
* Call C from Lisp and call Lisp from C (i.e. ECL can be used as an extension language for any program that can call a C function)
* Native threading

==== Shortcomings ====

* Relatively slow compilation method (gcc is slow, maybe if you use a faster C compiler)
* Relatively fragile error handling (i.e. you can seg-fault ECL fairly easily)

=== Armed Bear Common Lisp ===

[http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/ ABCL] is a Common Lisp implementation that runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine.  It provides a runtime system, a compiler that compiles Lisp source to JVM bytecode, and an interactive REPL for program development.

==== Features ====

* Produces portable Java bytecode
* Java libraries are transparently available

==== Shortcomings ====

* Quite slower than other implementations

== Commercial implementations ==

* [http://www.franz.com/ Allegro Common Lisp (ACL)]
* [http://www.lispworks.com/ LispWorks]
* [http://www.cormanlisp.com/ Corman Lisp]
* [http://www.scieneer.com/scl/ Scieneer Common Lisp]

There are free trial versions of Allegro, LispWorks, and Corman Lisp, which can be handy for learning the language. All of them work on Windows.

==What is iLife?==
Often cited as a reason to use a Mac over a Windows PC, iLife is a suite of six digital media applications that let you organize photos, music, and videos; create home movies, songs, and podcasts; and publish your projects to the internet and DVDs. Although it isn't included with Mac OS X, it ''is'' included with every new Mac that Apple ships, and is available separately for $79.

==About this Wikibook==
Although iLife is considered very easy to use compared to the competition, using its six applications can prove difficult at times. New users may find they need help before they can use iLife by themselves. In addition, power users may wish to learn about some of iLife 06's new features.

In the past, the preferred way of learning how to use iLife was a traditional book. Unfortunately, these books can be expensive, especially when in color, which is important for a book pertaining to editing movies and photos. Many users simply try to learn iLife by themselves, often missing out on important features and time-saving tricks.

With the advent of the wikibook, you can learn iLife online for free. Don't worry, there are no hidden charges for using this site.

Wikibooks are great because anyone can edit them. See a confusing explanation of how to do something? Once you figure out a better way to explain, come back and fix it for everyone else. In a real book, you can't help other readers understand something the author explained poorly.

In addition, unlike traditional bound books, Wikibooks are always up-to-date. This is especially important for iTunes, the music-managing app in iLife, that is updated frequently over the course of the year. Features are added, new iPods debut, and the interface improves.

Keep in mind that this book assumes you already know how to use Mac OS X as a whole. If you don't, please read our companion wikibook, [[Mac OS X Tiger]].

This wikibook also covers Front Row, which while not part of iLife, is heavily dependent on it.

==Using this Wikibook==
===Structure===
This wikibook is divided into six &quot;parts&quot;, one for each application. Each part is divided into chapters. There is also an appendix on Front Row.

===Nesting===
Arrows &gt; Like &gt; These are used to show menus. For instance, &quot;Open the menu labeled File. In that menu is an item labeled Save As. Click Save As &quot; could be abbreviated to &quot;File &gt; Save As...&quot;. 

Likewise, these &gt; arrows are also used for file locations. &quot;Macintosh HD &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities&quot; is shorthand for &quot;Open the Macintosh HD folder. Inside is a folder labeled Applications. Inside that is another folder labeled Utilities. Open that.&quot;

===Right Click===
Another convention in this Wikibook is the use of &quot;right click&quot;. Mac OS X supports both one-button and two-button mice. On a two-button mouse, when told to &quot;right click&quot;, simply press the right mouse button. But if using a one-button mouse,  hold down the &quot;control&quot; key on your keyboard while you click.

===Info Boxes===
A computer book mainstay, info boxes have called attention to important items for ages. This wikibook is no exception, offering four different flavors.

{{Mac Note Box|Notes contain handy &quot;sidebar&quot; information that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the chapter. We recomend reading them, since they're often quite interesting.}}

{{Mac Warning Box|Look out! Not reading these yellow Warning boxes could cause headaches and the loss of time, data, or equipment!}}

{{Mac Trick Box|Essential? Maybe not. Fun? Definitely. Learn about extra features and timesavers in these boxes.}}

{{Mac Background Box|Gather 'round for a bit of iLife history.}}

==Contents==
# [[/iTunes/]]{{stage short|25%|Feb 5, 2006}}

=Introduction=
Welcome to the Discussion page for the Mac OS X Tiger Wikibook! This page is divided into two main sections: the first is a guidelines section for outlining how to write this wikibook, and the second is a discussion section for discussing the guidelines and the wikibook itself.

=Guidelines=
==Who is this book Designed for?==
This book is designed for users with users with moderate computer experience. Assume that they know everything about the Tiger desktop and the Finder, and they know the general purpose of everything in the Mac OS X (e.g. they understand the concept of &quot;System Preferences&quot;, even if they don't actually know what all of the controls do).

==Detail==
Make sure this wikibook covers every detail of iLife: don't over-simplify.

==Priorities==
Applications should be written about in this order:
#iTunes
#iPhoto
#iMovie
#GarageBand
#iDVD
#iWeb

==Chapter Labels==
Chapters are labeled according to how far along they are:
*Empty - The chapter has not yet been created.
*Sparse - The chapter has gaping holes and desperately needs more content.
*Developing - The chapter is coming along, but is still not good enough.
*Developed - The chapter needs more content and polish.
*Almost Complete - The chapter needs a final layer of polish, and needs screenshots added.
*Complete - The chapter is done. While you may edit it, please leave it largely the same.

Labels should be in [brackets].

In addition, an &quot;Out of Date&quot; label should be used on chapters that contain information pertaining to an older version of a piece of software. This label should be in {braces}

==No Advertising!==
It's legitimate and helpful to mention an application (freeware, shareware, open source, commercial, or otherwise), brand of hardware, or website, but this wikibook shouldn't be a platform for advertising, nor should any tutorial contained in it ever rely on a non-Apple product.

==Book, Not Encyclopedia==
Remember that this is a book, not an encyclopedia. Keep a casual tone. This book is supposed to be the iLife user's best friend, not a dry encyclopedia of information.

==Screenshots==
Put in color screenshots, product images, and diagrams in important places. Use them when necessary, but never frivolously, so the pages can load over a dial-up connection. Also make sure the screenshots do not show any &quot;haxies&quot;, themes, etc. Screenshots should be taken only in Mac OS X Tiger. Keep the screens uncluttered and familiar to the average user (for instance, use bundled Apple wallpaper, don't over-customise toolbars, and don't show any alternative icons). Also, when talking about a window or a menu, the screenshot should not include anything else.

Screenshots should be centered except when absolutely necessary, always appear as thumbnails, and be labeled in this format: &quot;Fig 1. Here is a caption, which is relativly dry and does not contain instructions.&quot;

==Tables==
Tables should be used whenever appropriate.

*Table width should be set to 600px
*The border should be set to 0
*Cell Padding should be set to 3
*Cells should be either 4D804D (dark green) or B5E3B5 (light green)
*Tables should be labeled in this fashion &quot;Table 1. This is a simple caption.&quot;

==Info Boxes==
Use Info Boxes whenever they make sense. Use the following templates:

  &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' Put Warning text here.}}
  
  {{Info|'''NOTE:''' Put Note Text here.}}

  {{Info|'''TRICK:''' Put Trick Text here.}}

  {{Book_Box|'''BACKGROUND:''' Put Background Text here.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=Discussion=
Use this section to discuss the above guidelines.

Remember that English language Wikibooks are read by English speakers the world over, not just in America. For many, English might also not be their first language. Refrain therefore from &quot;americanizations&quot; and watch your spelling. There's nothing more confusing (or annoying in some cases) for Europeans than to see text full of unnecessary zzzzzz's!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Music has taken many forms since the invention of the gramophone in 1887. First there were vinyl records, then cassette tapes, then CDs. Fast forward to now. The era of music stored on CDs is coming to a close, and &quot;digital music&quot; (music stored in files on your computer's hard drive) is rapidly replacing it. To manage your collection of digital music, you use a specialized music-managing application. And Apple's iTunes is widely considered to be the best availible.

iTunes lets you:
*Organize the music files on your Mac.
*Turn your current CD collection into digital files.
*Burn custom mix CDs.
*Manage your iPod.
*Legally download a variety of media (music, video, and more) from the internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc}}

Haskell has at least four toolkits for programming a graphical interface:
* [[:w:WxHaskell|wxHaskell]] - provides a Haskell interface to the wxWidgets toolkit 
* [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gtk2Hs Gtk2Hs] - provides a Haskell interface to the GTK+ library
* [http://code.google.com/p/hoc/ hoc] (documentation at [http://hoc.sourceforge.net/ sourceforge]) - provides a Haskell to Objective-C binding which allows users to access to the Cocoa library on MacOS X
* [http://qthaskell.berlios.de/ qtHaskell] - provides a set of Haskell bindings for the Qt Widget Library from Nokia 

In this tutorial, we will focus on the wxHaskell toolkit, as it allows you to produce a native graphical interface on all platforms that wxWidgets is available on, including Windows, Linux and MacOS X.

==Getting and running wxHaskell==

To install wxHaskell, look for your version of instructions at:
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/Linux Linux] 
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/Mac Mac]
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/Windows Windows]


or the [http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/download.html wxHaskell download page] and follow the installation instructions provided on the wxHaskell download page. Don't forget to register wxHaskell with GHC, or else it won't run (automatically registered  with Cabal). To compile source.hs (which happens to use wxHaskell code), open a command line and type:

 ghc -package wx source.hs -o bin

Code for GHCi is similar:

 ghci -package wx

You can then load the files from within the GHCi interface. To test if everything works, go to $wxHaskellDir/samples/wx ($wxHaskellDir is the directory you installed it in) and load (or compile) HelloWorld.hs. It should show a window with title &quot;Hello World!&quot;, a menu bar with File and About, and a status bar at the bottom, that says &quot;Welcome to wxHaskell&quot;.

If it doesn't work, you might try to copy the contents of the $wxHaskellDir/lib directory to the ghc install directory.

==Hello World==

Here's the basic Haskell &quot;Hello World&quot; program:

 module Main where
 
 main :: IO ()
 main = putStr &quot;Hello World!&quot;

It will compile just fine, but it isn't really fancy. We want a nice GUI! So how to do this? First, you must import &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX&lt;/tt&gt;. This is the wxHaskell library. &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore&lt;/tt&gt; has some more stuff, but we won't be needing that now.

To start a GUI, use (guess what) &lt;tt&gt;start gui&lt;/tt&gt;. In this case, &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of a function which we'll use to build the interface. It must have an IO type. Let's see what we have:

 module Main where
 
 import Graphics.UI.WX
 
 main :: IO ()
 main = start gui
 
 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   --GUI stuff

To make a frame, we use &lt;tt&gt;frame&lt;/tt&gt;. Check the type of &lt;tt&gt;frame&lt;/tt&gt;. It's &lt;tt&gt;[Prop (Frame ())] -&gt; IO (Frame ())&lt;/tt&gt;. It takes a list of &quot;frame properties&quot; and returns the corresponding frame. We'll look deeper into properties later, but a property is typically a combination of an attribute and a value. What we're interested in now is the title. This is in the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; attribute and has type &lt;tt&gt;(Textual w) =&gt; Attr w String&lt;/tt&gt;. The most important thing here, is that it's a &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. Here's how we code it:

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]

The operator &lt;tt&gt;(:=)&lt;/tt&gt; takes an attribute and a value, and combines both into a property. Note that &lt;tt&gt;frame&lt;/tt&gt; returns an &lt;tt&gt;IO (Frame ())&lt;/tt&gt;. You can change the type of &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;IO (Frame ())&lt;/tt&gt;, but it might be better just to add &lt;tt&gt;return ()&lt;/tt&gt;. Now we have our own GUI consisting of a frame with title &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Its source:



 module Main where
 
 import Graphics.UI.WX
 
 main :: IO ()
 main = start gui
 
 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
   return ()

The result should look like the screenshot.  (It might look slightly different on Linux or MacOS X, on which wxhaskell also runs)

==Controls==
{{Info|From here on, its good practice to keep a browser window or tab open with the [http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/doc/ wxHaskell documentation]. It's also available in $wxHaskellDir/doc/index.html.}}

===A text label===

Simply a frame doesn't do much. In this chapter, we're going to add some more elements. Let's start with something simple: a label. wxHaskell has a &lt;tt&gt;label&lt;/tt&gt;, but that's a layout thing. We won't be doing layout until next chapter. What we're looking for is a &lt;tt&gt;staticText&lt;/tt&gt;. It's in &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/tt&gt;. As you can see, the &lt;tt&gt;staticText&lt;/tt&gt; function takes a &lt;tt&gt;Window&lt;/tt&gt; as argument, and a list of properties. Do we have a window? Yup! Look at &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Frame&lt;/tt&gt;. There we see that a &lt;tt&gt;Frame&lt;/tt&gt; is merely a type-synonym of a special sort of window. We'll change the code in &lt;tt&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt; so it looks like this:

[[Image:WxHaskell2_winxp.png|thumb|Hello StaticText! (winXP)]]

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
   staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
   return ()

Again, &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is an attribute of a &lt;tt&gt;staticText&lt;/tt&gt; object, so this works. Try it!

===A button===

Now for a little more interaction. A button. We're not going to add functionality to it until the chapter about events, but at least something visible will happen when you click on it.

A &lt;tt&gt;button&lt;/tt&gt; is a control, just like &lt;tt&gt;staticText&lt;/tt&gt;. Look it up in &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/tt&gt;.

Again, we need a window and a list of properties. We'll use the frame again. &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is also an attribute of a button:

[[Image:WxHaskell3_winxp.png|thumb|Overlapping button and StaticText (winXP)]]

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
   staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
   button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
   return ()

Load it into GHCi (or compile it with GHC) and... hey!? What's that? The button's been covered up by the label! We're going to fix that next, in the layout chapter.

==Layout==

The reason that the label and the button overlap, is that we haven't set a ''layout'' for our frame yet. Layouts are created using the functions found in the documentation of &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore.Layout&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that you don't have to import &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore&lt;/tt&gt; to use layouts.

The documentation says we can turn a member of the widget class into a layout by using the &lt;tt&gt;widget&lt;/tt&gt; function. Also, windows are a member of the widget class. But, wait a minute... we only have one window, and that's the frame! Nope... we have more, look at &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/tt&gt; and click on any occurrence of the word ''Control''. You'll be taken to &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore.WxcClassTypes&lt;/tt&gt; and it is here we see that a Control is also a type synonym of a special type of window. We'll need to change the code a bit, but here it is.

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
   st &lt;- staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
   b &lt;- button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
   return ()

Now we can use &lt;tt&gt;widget st&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;widget b&lt;/tt&gt; to create a layout of the staticText and the button. &lt;tt&gt;layout&lt;/tt&gt; is an attribute of the frame, so we'll set it here:

[[Image:WxHaskell4_winxp.png|thumb|StaticText with layout (winXP)]]

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
   st &lt;- staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
   b &lt;- button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
   set f [layout := widget st]
   return ()

The &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; function will be covered in the chapter about attributes. Try the code, what's wrong? This only displays the staticText, not the button. We need a way to combine the two. We will use ''layout combinators'' for this. &lt;tt&gt;row&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;column&lt;/tt&gt; look nice. They take an integer and a list of layouts. We can easily make a list of layouts of the button and the staticText. The integer is the spacing between the elements of the list. Let's try something:

[[Image:WxHaskell5_row_winxp.png|thumb|A row layout (winXP)]]
[[Image:WxHaskell5_col_winxp.PNG|thumb|Column layout with a spacing of 25 (winXP)]]

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
   st &lt;- staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
   b &lt;- button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
   set f [layout := 
           row 0 [widget st, widget b]
         ]
   return ()

Play around with the integer and see what happens, also change &lt;tt&gt;row&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;column&lt;/tt&gt;. Try to change the order of the elements in the list to get a feeling of how it works. For fun, try to add &lt;tt&gt;widget b&lt;/tt&gt; several more times in the list. What happens?

Here are a few exercises to spark your imagination. Remember to use the documentation!


{{Exercises|1=
# Add a checkbox control. It doesn't have to do anything yet, just make sure it appears next to the staticText and the button when using row-layout, or below them when using column layout. &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is also an attribute of the checkbox.
# Notice that &lt;tt&gt;row&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;column&lt;/tt&gt; take a list of ''layouts'', and also generates a layout itself. Use this fact to make your checkbox appear on the left of the staticText and the button, with the staticText and the button in a column.
# Can you figure out how the radiobox control works? Take the layout of the previous exercise and add a radiobox with two (or more) options below the checkbox, staticText and button. Use the documentation!
# Use the &lt;tt&gt;boxed&lt;/tt&gt; combinator to create a nice looking border around the four controls, and another one around the staticText and the button. (''Note: the &lt;tt&gt;boxed&lt;/tt&gt; combinator might not be working on MacOS X - you might get widgets that can't be interacted with.  This is likely just a bug in wxhaskell.'')}}


After having completed the exercises, the end result should look like this:
[[Image:WxHaskell6_winxp.png|thumb|Answer to exercises]]
You could have used different spacing for &lt;tt&gt;row&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;column&lt;/tt&gt;, or the options of the radiobox are displayed horizontally.

==Attributes==

After all this, you might be wondering things like: &quot;Where did that &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; function suddenly come from?&quot;, or &quot;How would ''I'' know if &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is an attribute of something?&quot;. Both answers lie in the attribute system of wxHaskell.

===Setting and modifying attributes===

In a wxHaskell program, you can set the properties of the widgets in two ways:
# during creation: &lt;tt&gt;f &lt;- frame '''[ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]'''&lt;/tt&gt;
# using the &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; function: &lt;tt&gt;set f '''[ layout := widget st ]'''&lt;/tt&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; function takes two arguments: one of any type &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt;, and the other is a list of properties of &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt;.  In wxHaskell, these will be the widgets and the properties of these widgets. Some properties can only be set during creation, like the &lt;tt&gt;alignment&lt;/tt&gt; of a &lt;tt&gt;textEntry&lt;/tt&gt;, but you can set most others in any IO-function in your program, as long as you have a reference to it (the &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;set '''f''' [''stuff'']&lt;/tt&gt;).

Apart from setting properties, you can also get them. This is done with the &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt; function. Here's a silly example:

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f []
   ftext &lt;- get f text
   set st [ text := ftext]
   set f [ text := ftext ++ &quot; And hello again!&quot; ]

Look at the type signature of &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt;. It's &lt;tt&gt;w -&gt; Attr w a -&gt; IO a&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; attribute, so we have an &lt;tt&gt;IO String&lt;/tt&gt; which we can bind to &lt;tt&gt;ftext&lt;/tt&gt;. The last line edits the text of the frame. Yep, destructive updates are possible in wxHaskell. We can overwrite the properties using &lt;tt&gt;(:=)&lt;/tt&gt; anytime with &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt;. This inspires us to write a modify function:

 modify :: w -&gt; Attr w a -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; IO ()
 modify w attr f = do
   val &lt;- get w attr
   set w [ attr := f val ]

First it gets the value, then it sets it again after applying the function. Surely we're not the first one to think of that...

And nope, we aren't. Look at this operator: &lt;tt&gt;(:~)&lt;/tt&gt;. You can use it in &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt;, because it takes an attribute and a function. The result is a property, in which the original value is modified by the function. This means we can write:

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f []
   ftext &lt;- get f text
   set st [ text := ftext ]
   set f [ text :~ ++ &quot; And hello again!&quot; ]

This is a great place to use anonymous functions with the lambda-notation.

There are two more operators we can use to set or modify properties: &lt;tt&gt;(::=)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(::~)&lt;/tt&gt;. They do the same as &lt;tt&gt;(:=)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(:~)&lt;/tt&gt;, except a function of type &lt;tt&gt;w -&gt; orig&lt;/tt&gt; is expected, where &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; is the widget type, and &lt;tt&gt;orig&lt;/tt&gt; is the original &quot;value&quot; type (&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; in case of &lt;tt&gt;(:=)&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/tt&gt; in case of &lt;tt&gt;(:~)&lt;/tt&gt;). We won't be using them now, though, as we've only encountered attributes of non-IO types, and the widget needed in the function is generally only useful in IO-blocks.

===How to find attributes===

Now the second question. Where did I read that &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; is an attribute of all those things? The easy answer is: in the documentation. Now where in the documentation to look for it?

Let's see what attributes a button has, so go to [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/wx/0.10.2/doc/html/Graphics-UI-WX-Controls.html &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/tt&gt;], and click the link that says [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/wx/0.10.2/doc/html/Graphics-UI-WX-Controls.html#4 &quot;Button&quot;]. You'll see that a &lt;tt&gt;Button&lt;/tt&gt; is a type synonym of a special kind of &lt;tt&gt;Control&lt;/tt&gt;, and a list of functions that can be used to create a button. After each function is a list of &quot;Instances&quot;. For the normal &lt;tt&gt;button&lt;/tt&gt; function, this is ''Commanding -- Textual, Literate, Dimensions, Colored, Visible, Child, Able, Tipped, Identity, Styled, Reactive, Paint''. This is the list of classes of which a button is an instance. Read through the [[../Classes and types/]] chapter. It means that there are some class-specific functions available for the button. &lt;tt&gt;Textual&lt;/tt&gt;, for example, adds the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;appendText&lt;/tt&gt; functions. If a widget is an instance of the &lt;tt&gt;Textual&lt;/tt&gt; class, it means that it has a &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; attribute!

Note that while &lt;tt&gt;StaticText&lt;/tt&gt; hasn't got a list of instances, it's still a &lt;tt&gt;Control&lt;/tt&gt;, which is a synonym for some kind of &lt;tt&gt;Window&lt;/tt&gt;, and when looking at the &lt;tt&gt;Textual&lt;/tt&gt; class, it says that &lt;tt&gt;Window&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of it. This is an error on the side of the documentation.

Let's take a look at the attributes of a frame. They can be found in &lt;tt&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Frame&lt;/tt&gt;. Another error in the documentation here: It says &lt;tt&gt;Frame&lt;/tt&gt; instantiates &lt;tt&gt;HasImage&lt;/tt&gt;. This was true in an older version of wxHaskell. It should say &lt;tt&gt;Pictured&lt;/tt&gt;. Apart from that, we have &lt;tt&gt;Form&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Textual&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Dimensions&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Colored&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Able&lt;/tt&gt; and a few more. We're already seen &lt;tt&gt;Textual&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Form&lt;/tt&gt;. Anything that is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Form&lt;/tt&gt; has a &lt;tt&gt;layout&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.

&lt;tt&gt;Dimensions&lt;/tt&gt; adds (among others) the &lt;tt&gt;clientSize&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. It's an attribute of the &lt;tt&gt;Size&lt;/tt&gt; type, which can be made with &lt;tt&gt;sz&lt;/tt&gt;. Please note that the &lt;tt&gt;layout&lt;/tt&gt; attribute can also change the size. If you want to use &lt;tt&gt;clientSize&lt;/tt&gt; you should set it after the &lt;tt&gt;layout&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;tt&gt;Colored&lt;/tt&gt; adds the &lt;tt&gt;color&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;bgcolor&lt;/tt&gt; attributes.

&lt;tt&gt;Able&lt;/tt&gt; adds the Boolean &lt;tt&gt;enabled&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. This can be used to enable or disable certain form elements, which is often displayed as a greyed-out option.

There are lots of other attributes, read through the documentation for each class.

==Events==

There are a few classes that deserve special attention. They are the &lt;tt&gt;Reactive&lt;/tt&gt; class and the &lt;tt&gt;Commanding&lt;/tt&gt; class. As you can see in the documentation of these classes, they don't add attributes (of the form &lt;tt&gt;Attr w a&lt;/tt&gt;), but ''events''. The &lt;tt&gt;Commanding&lt;/tt&gt; class adds the &lt;tt&gt;command&lt;/tt&gt; event. We'll use a button to demonstrate event handling.

Here's a simple GUI with a button and a staticText:

[[Image:WxHaskell7_before_winxp.png|thumb|Before (winXP)]]

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Event Handling&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;You haven\'t clicked the button yet.&quot; ]
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Click me!&quot; ]
   set f [ layout := column 25 [ widget st, widget b ] ]

We want to change the staticText when you press the button. We'll need the &lt;tt&gt;on&lt;/tt&gt; function:

   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Click me!&quot;
                 , on command := --stuff
                 ]

The type of &lt;tt&gt;on&lt;/tt&gt;: &lt;tt&gt;Event w a -&gt; Attr w a&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;command&lt;/tt&gt; is of type &lt;tt&gt;Event w (IO ())&lt;/tt&gt;, so we need an IO-function. This function is called the ''Event handler''. Here's what we get:

&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;!--
[[Image:WxHaskell7_after_winxp.png|thumb|After (winXP)]]
--&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

 gui :: IO ()
 gui = do
   f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Event Handling&quot; ]
   st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;You haven\'t clicked the button yet.&quot; ]
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Click me!&quot;
                 , on command := set st [ text := &quot;You have clicked the button!&quot; ]
                 ]
   set f [ layout := column 25 [ widget st, widget b ] ]

''Insert text about event filters here''

Modules are the primary means of organizing Haskell code. We met them in passing when using &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statements to put library functions into scope. Beyond allowing us to make better use of libraries, knowledge of modules will help us to shape our own programs and create standalone programs which can be executed independently of GHCi (incidentally, that is the topic of the very next chapter, [[../Standalone programs/]]).

== Modules ==

Haskell modules&lt;ref&gt;See the Haskell report for [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html more details on the module system].&lt;/ref&gt; are a useful way to group a set of related functionalities into a single package and manage different functions that may have the same names. The module definition is the first thing that goes in your Haskell file.  

A basic module definition looks like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module YourModule where
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that
# the name of the module begins with a capital letter;
# each file contains only one module.

The name of the file is the name of the module plus the &lt;tt&gt;.hs&lt;/tt&gt; file extension. Any dots '&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;' in the module name are changed for directories.&lt;ref&gt;In Haskell98, the last standardised version of Haskell before Haskell 2010, the module system was fairly conservative, but recent common practice consists of employing a hierarchical module system, using periods to section off namespaces.&lt;/ref&gt; So the module &lt;tt&gt;YourModule&lt;/tt&gt; would be in the file &lt;tt&gt;YourModule.hs&lt;/tt&gt; while a module &lt;tt&gt;Foo.Bar&lt;/tt&gt; would be in the file &lt;tt&gt;Foo/Bar.hs&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Foo\Bar.hs&lt;/tt&gt;. Since the module name must begin with a capital letter, the file name must also start with a capital letter.

== Importing ==

Modules can themselves import functions from other modules. That is, in between the module declaration and the rest of your code, you may include some import declarations such as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Char (toLower, toUpper) -- import only the functions toLower and toUpper from Data.Char

import Data.List -- import everything exported from Data.List
 
import MyModule -- import everything exported from MyModule
&lt;/source&gt;

Imported datatypes are specified by their name, followed by a list of imported constructors in parenthesis.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Tree (Tree(Node)) -- import only the Tree data type and its Node constructor from Data.Tree
&lt;/source&gt;

What if you import some modules that have overlapping definitions? Or if you import a module but want to overwrite a function yourself? There are three ways to handle these cases: Qualified imports, hiding definitions, and renaming imports.

=== Qualified imports ===

Say MyModule and MyOtherModule both have a definition for &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt;, which removes all instances of ''e'' from a string. However, MyModule only removes lower-case e's, and MyOtherModule removes both upper and lower case. In this case the following code is ambiguous:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule
import MyOtherModule

-- someFunction puts a c in front of the text, and removes all e's from the rest
someFunction :: String -&gt; String
someFunction text = 'c' : remove_e text
&lt;/source&gt;

It isn't clear which &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; is meant! To avoid this, use the '''qualified''' keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified MyModule
import qualified MyOtherModule

someFunction text = 'c' : MyModule.remove_e text -- Will work, removes lower case e's
someOtherFunction text = 'c' : MyOtherModule.remove_e text -- Will work, removes all e's
someIllegalFunction text = 'c' : remove_e text -- Won't work as there is no remove_e defined
&lt;/source&gt;

In the latter code snippet, no function named &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; is available at all. When we do qualified imports, all the imported values include the module names as a prefix. Incidentally, you can also use the same prefixes even if you did a regular import (in our example, &lt;tt&gt;MyModule.remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; works even if the &quot;qualified&quot; keyword isn't included).

{{body note|There is an ambiguity between a qualified name like &lt;code&gt;MyModule.remove_e&lt;/code&gt; and the function composition operator &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;.  Writing &lt;code&gt;reverse.MyModule.remove_e&lt;/code&gt; is bound to confuse your Haskell compiler.  One solution is stylistic: always use spaces for function composition, for example, &lt;code&gt;reverse . remove_e&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Just . remove_e&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;Just . MyModule.remove_e&lt;/code&gt;}}

=== Hiding definitions ===

Now suppose we want to import both &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;MyOtherModule&lt;/tt&gt;, but we know for sure we want to remove all e's, not just the lower cased ones. It will become really tedious to add &lt;tt&gt;MyOtherModule&lt;/tt&gt; before every call to &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt;. Can't we just exclude the &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt;?

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule hiding (remove_e)
import MyOtherModule

someFunction text = 'c' : remove_e text
&lt;/source&gt;

This works because of the word '''hiding''' on the import line. Whatever follows the &quot;hiding&quot; keyword will not be imported. Hide multiple items by listing them with parentheses and comma-separation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule hiding (remove_e, remove_f)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that algebraic datatypes and type synonyms cannot be hidden. These are always imported. If you have a datatype defined in multiple imported modules, you must use qualified names.

=== Renaming imports ===

This is not really a technique to allow for overwriting, but it is often used along with the qualified flag. Imagine:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName

someFunction text = 'c' : MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName.remove_e $ text
&lt;/source&gt;

Especially when using qualified, this gets irritating. We can improve things by using the '''as''' keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName as Shorty

someFunction text = 'c' : Shorty.remove_e $ text
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows us to use &lt;tt&gt;Shorty&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName&lt;/tt&gt; as prefix for the imported functions. This renaming works with both qualified and regular importing.

As long as there are no conflicting items, we can import multiple modules and rename them the same:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule as My
import MyCompletelyDifferentModule as My
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, both the functions in &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt; and the functions in &lt;tt&gt;MyCompletelyDifferentModule&lt;/tt&gt; can be prefixed with My.

=== Combining renaming with limited import ===

Sometimes it is convenient to use the import directive twice for the same module. A typical scenario is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified Data.Set as Set
import Data.Set (Set, empty, insert)
&lt;/source&gt;

This give access to all of the Data.Set module via the alias &quot;Set&quot;, and also lets you access a few selected functions (empty, insert, and the constructor) without using the &quot;Set&quot; prefix.

== Exporting ==

In the examples at the start of this article, the words &quot;import ''everything exported'' from MyModule&quot; were used.&lt;ref&gt;A module may export functions that it imports. Mutually recursive modules are possible but need [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/separate-compilation.html#mutual-recursion some special treatment].&lt;/ref&gt; This raises a question. How can we decide which functions are exported and which stay &quot;internal&quot;? Here's how:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module MyModule (remove_e, add_two) where

add_one blah = blah + 1

remove_e text = filter (/= 'e') text

add_two blah = add_one . add_one $ blah
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, only &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;add_two&lt;/tt&gt; are exported. While &lt;tt&gt;add_two&lt;/tt&gt; is allowed to make use of &lt;tt&gt;add_one&lt;/tt&gt;, functions in modules that import &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt; cannot use &lt;tt&gt;add_one&lt;/tt&gt; directly, as it isn't exported.

Datatype export specifications are written similarly to import.  You name the type, and follow with the list of constructors in parenthesis:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module MyModule2 (Tree(Branch, Leaf)) where

data Tree a = Branch {left, right :: Tree a} 
            | Leaf a
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, the module declaration could be rewritten &quot;MyModule2 (Tree(..))&quot;, declaring that all constructors are exported.

Maintaining an export list is good practice not only because it reduces namespace pollution but also because it enables certain [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/GHC#Inlining compile-time optimizations] which are unavailable otherwise.

==Fundamentals==
Every class in Java can be composed of the following elements:
*'''fields''' or '''member variables''' — Fields are variables that hold data specific to each object.  For example, an employee might have an ID number. There is one field for each object of a class.
*'''member methods''' — Member methods perform operations on an object.  For example, an employee might have a method to issue his paycheck or to access his name.
*'''static fields''' — Static fields are common to any object of the same class.  For example, a static field within the Employee class could keep track of the last ID number issued. Only one static field exists for one class.
*'''static methods''' — Static methods are methods that do not affect a specific object.
*'''inner classes''' — Sometimes it is useful to contain a class within another one if it is useless outside of the class or should not be accessed outside the class.
*'''Constructors''' — A special method that generates a new object.
*'''Parameterized types''' — Since 1.5, ''parameterized types'' can be assigned to a class during definition.  The ''parameterized types'' will be substituted with the types specified at the class's instantiation. It is done by the compiler. It is similar to the C language macro '#define' statement, where a preprocessor evaluates the macros.

== Constructors ==
A constructor is called to initialize an object immediately after the object has been allocated:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-3&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.3: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-5&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
  // This is a constructor
  public Cheese() {
    System.out.println(&quot;Construct an instance&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Typically, a constructor is invoked using the {{java:new}} keyword:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.1: A constructor call.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Cheese cheese = new Cheese();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The constructor syntax is close to the method syntax. However, the constructor has the same name as the name of the class (with the same case) and the constructor has no return type. The second point is the most important difference as a method can also have the same name as the class, which is not recommended:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-4&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.4: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
  // This is a method with the same name as the class
  public void Cheese() {
    System.out.println(&quot;A method execution.&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The returned object is always a valid, meaningful object, as opposed to relying on a separate initialization method. A constructor cannot be {{java:abstract}}, {{java:final}}, {{java:native}}, {{java:static}}, {{java:strictfp}} nor {{java:synchronized}}. However, a constructor, like methods, can be overloaded and take parameters.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-5&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.5: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8, 13&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
     // This is a constructor
     public Cheese() {
          doStuff();
     }

     // This is another constructor
     public Cheese(int weight) {
          doStuff();
     }

     // This is yet another constructor
     public Cheese(String type, int weight) {
          doStuff();
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

By convention, a constructor that accepts an object of its own type as a parameter and copies the data members is called a ''copy constructor''. One interesting feature of constructors is that if and only if you do not specify a constructor in your class, the compiler will create one for you. This default constructor, if written out would look like:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-6&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.6: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-4&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
     public Cheese() {
           super();
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; command calls the constructor of the superclass. If there is no explicit call to &lt;code&gt;super(...)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;this(...)&lt;/code&gt;, then the default superclass constructor &lt;code&gt;super();&lt;/code&gt; is called before the body of the constructor is executed. That said, there are instances where you need to add in the call manually. For example, if you write even one constructor, no matter what parameters it takes, the compiler will not add a default constructor. The [[#code-listing-8|code listing 4.8]] results in a runtime error:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-7&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.7: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
     public Cheese(int weight, String type) {
          doStuff();
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-8&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.8: Mouse.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class Mouse {
     public void eatCheese() {
             Cheese c = new Cheese(); // Oops, compile time error!
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
This is something to keep in mind when extending existing classes. Either make a default constructor, or make sure every class that inherits your class uses the correct constructor.

== Initializers ==
''Initializers'' are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for fields.

=== Static initializers ===
''Static initializers'' are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for static fields.  Static field initializers and static initializers are executed in the order declared.  The static initialization is executed after the class is loaded.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.2: Static initializer.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-7&quot;&gt;
static int count = 20;
static int[] squares;
static {  // a static initializer
    squares = new int[count];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
        squares[i] = i * i;
}
static int x = squares[5];  // x is assigned the value 25
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== Instance initializers ===
''Instance initializers'' are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for instance (non-&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;) fields.  Instance field initializers and instance initializers are executed in the order declared. Both instance initializers and instance field initializers are executed during the invocation of a constructor.  The initializers are executed immediately after the superclass constructor and before the body of the constructor.

==Calculus==

A little category set aside for Calculus class questions.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 22:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

*[[School of Mathematics:Calculus]] looks fine. In what sense is it &quot;a practical approach&quot;? I want to make a module for people who are interested in biology. The module will deal with exponential growth and decay and will be built around examples from biological systems. It will be an introduction to calculus for biology students but can also provide some specific examples for [[Calculus/More Differentation Rules]]. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 00:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
**&quot;some other sort of synthesis action&quot; &lt;-- One of the powers of wiki technology is that wiki webpages can be highly inter-connected. Some of the topics I want to include in the Cell Biology part of Wikiversity involve complex biological processes where amplification and feedback are important and it is useful to apply mathematics. I want to be able to link from biology pages to useful parts of math books. I think it is helpful for people who are interested in biology to provide them with specific examples of how to use the math rather than just drop them into an abstract presentation of the math. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 19:53, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

:I'm glad we finally have a book about this subject. I do alot of work on the EE bookshelf, and when i need to try and explain residues for my books, I personally don't know all the mathematical rigour.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:48, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity ==

Hi Fephisto, and thanks for your questions about Wikiversity. I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to reply - I've just logged in to Wikibooks after a stint doing other things (including travelling)..

On what's going on with Wikiversity, I think the best pages are over on Meta. There's the [[m:Wikiversity subcommittee]] which is trying to put together a proposal to the board to get it set up as an official sister project - though this is not meant to stop anyone else get involved with this process (or even join the subcommittee). I don't see this as too far off in the future - we are just trying to figure out things like whether it will host courses at first and if so what types of courses, amongst other questions. On that page as well as the [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal|current proposal]] there are a list to the most relevant links - but yes, there is a lot of text and an awful amount of discussion.

If you want to set up a class, it might be good to see (for now) whether it fits in with what the board last specified, ie. &quot;no online courses&quot;. We're still trying to figure this out, but this is the safest route. Still, there are plenty of people who want to set up live, active classes, so you're free to experiment with what you feel best. Overall, I would say for now, focus on creating the content of the course, rather than inviting students to participate. And no, there's nothing like accreditation involved, don't worry - and I don't think this would be productive for now anyway (though it may be an option for the future).

Thanks for your interest and all the best with your Wikiversity project(s). Let me know how it goes, and please don't hesitate to ask any further questions here or on Meta (where I'm more active). Cheers. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 18:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

== welcome to Wikireason ==

Hi Fephisto. Welcome to [[Wikireason:Forum Entrance|Wikireason]]! Thanks for your contributions--I provided a couple of responses to what you wrote about [[Wikireason:Category:Globalization|globalization]]. As stated at the forum entrance, we're still working out organizational issues and producing documentation to help newcomers. We would love to hear any feedback or questions that you have about the site. I look forward to your future contributions. It's best to reach me at [[Wikireason:User:Adam|my wikireason page]]--I was surprized to find that I even have an account here! [[User:AdamRetchless|AdamRetchless]] 23:57, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

== Calculus ==

Hi Fephisto - apologies for not replying sooner (I saw your message, just didn't have anything particular to say at the time). It occurs to me to ask (regarding your offer to teach Calculus), what/where were you thinking of teaching? Also, how? Wikiversity will need to have materials to teach with - particularly if it is to move from Wikibooks - as I think it should. So, where are the materials for this course? Is it simply directing people to the book [[Calculus]]? One one hand, I'm asking this because I'm curious; on the other, I'm eager to actually have some material to show people that this is a Wikiversity, not simply a library. I suppose another way of saying this is: teach me calculus! [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 15:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for the reply (btw, I've moved it to the bottom of my talk page, where it's easier to find). I suppose I was asking: &quot;where are the materials by which you're thinking of teaching Calculus?&quot;. And you're saying that they are in the Wikibooks mentioned on that page, and that you're going to then teach people about Calculus using those books, and according to their needs - right? Sounds fine. It's just that, with the process to separate Wikiversity and Wikibooks, there will need to be some content on Wikiversity itself in order to teach or learn about this subject. The current proposal for Wikiversity is a place where specific learning materials (eg. a segment of information and a related learning activity) will be hosted so that someone could come along and start learning by themselves, or a teacher could come along and print off that exercise (and possibly a lesson plan to go with it) to use in their class that afternoon. However, the interesting part is where people come to learn themselves and find that there are people there (like yourself) that could help them to learn further. You yourself could then not just direct that person to further reading on Wikibooks or Wikipedia (which I would expect there would be within the Wikiversity material anyway), but also ask further provocative questions, set tasks as you see fit, ie do what you were thinking of doing anyway. But if these projects are to separate (and I, amongst others, am working towards this), then we will need to prompt or facilitate learning somehow through the material we have in Wikiversity.

:This might all be a bit confusing to you - in fact, it occurs to me to ask you about what you say on your page (&quot;I hope Wikiversity doesn't go away&quot;) - does this mean you hope the projects don't separate? Are you aware of the context of all this? See the links to the current proposal I gave you before, if not. In any case, I'd really like to hear your views on the matter. Thanks. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 11:48, 14 July 2006 (UTC)


::Ok, thanks for clearing those points up. Maybe you could point me to some Wikiversity-specific material if/when you develop it, and hopefully we'll have a new project soon that we can start afresh with. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 16:12, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
'''
Hi Fephisto''' - I was wondering what you plan on doing for the Calculus Lessons and how I may join as a student. I already answered all the questions on the PRE-CALCULUS page. The only answer that I think you would be curious about would be to the comments question. I believe that if you are going to do lectures, it would be benificial for them to be in a downloadable. Preferably in an audio format such as mp3 or wav, or a PDF if typed.

Thank you
--[[User:Superwiki|Superwiki]] 03:52, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

#I'm just going to go over very basic 1st, 2nd, and 3rd semester Calculus as in University undergraduate Mathematics.  If by pre-calculus you take this as too simplistic, then this is probably not for you; however, if you said pre-calculus by meaning that you covered the pre-calculus section in the pre-test then go ahead and e-mail those answers to me and I can start making things from seeing where you stand.

#My original plan was just to have a planned lecture and go over it at a certain time so you could ask questions if you wanted to along the way.

#Other than that, if you have any other questions, go ahead and reply.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 01:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)


== Regarding your query ==

Sorry to be so late responding.  I have been waiting a couple of years for Wikiversity to get a goahead and so not checking messages much.  Regarding your calculus class.  The Board was very concerned the term class might give people the wrong idea about what a wiki environment is capable of and so directed us not to use the term in the Wikiversity proposal.  Everything is very much up in the air regarding how to effectively use the wiki medium for  learning.  My advice to you is to experiment a bit.  If you have applicable credentials or education feel free to advertise them on a synopsis along with a proposed approach.  If anyone gets militant approach &lt;b&gt;NO COURSES&lt;/b&gt; invite them to go elsewhere and leave your group or materials alone.  Try to structure your material so that people feel welcome to simply work through them and leave comments or improvements behind.  As I see it the really tricky part is how to integrate those questions/comments/improvements back into concise material while still giving credit where credit is due.

Perhaps a useful method will be to start a credits page with an obvious link on the main course page and use footnotes pointing to the credits page from elsewhere.  That way you are giving credit while removing distracting questions or comments.   Another approach might be to establish a link from a specific area where expansions can be made.  A potential subloop in material where anyone felt a question or comment or request for clarification was useful.   This is still very new to all of us so please feel free to innovate.  I will try to drop.   I need some review if I am going to be useful to engineering students anyway.  Thanks for joining us here at Wikiversity!!!

== Calculus course ==

Hi Fephisto - thanks for the update. Well, sorry that you didn't get all the participants you would have liked, but I'm not sure how many people would have seen it in the first place (this is regarding the participant base in Wikibooks:Wikiversity overall, not directed at anything of your own doing..)

In any case, I'm not sure if you heard, but Wikiversity is now a separate project - see [[v:Wikiversity:Main Page]]. We've been transwikiing some content from Wikibooks - I think your lectures (eg. [[Calculus/Building up to the Riemann-Darboux Definition]] would be useful to have there. I'm hoping to have material in place on Wikiversity so people can come and go as they please, rather than have to wait for a tutor to come along or initiate a timetable. You can request that this page be imported [[v:Wikiversity:Import|here]] (please don't simply copy and paste). Thanks. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 10:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Statistical Mechanics (Thermal Physics) ==

I believe the A-level Physics book doesn't have enough depth into the true rigourisation this subject has and will be starting a book in [[Statistical Mechanics]], for those who want to work with me, or have questions, leave me a line here.

== Partial Differential Equations ==

As far as I'm concerned, this needs a heavy inclusion (for more general techniques, adding some info abotu eigenfunctions, some fourier series uses, etc.) and rewrite, I'm going to try adding to this one too.  [[Partial Differential Equations]].

[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

== Statistics ==

I was kind of angered that when I last read [[Statistics]] there was no reasoning for the methods provided therein.  However, it seems as if it has been collaberated since I last saw it, so I might not need to put what I've learned in the subject in it.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

== Ring Theory, Algebra ==

We can put these individual subjects wherever we would like. For instance, we could create 2 &quot;versions&quot; of the linear algebra book, one that relies on concepts developed in [[Abstract Algebra]] and [[Ring Theory]] (for advanced readers), and one that only explores the &quot;highschool&quot; version of linear algebra from the standpoint of solving linear systems of equations.

I don't really care how the books are organized per se, but what I do know is that the way they were organized previously was terrible. Anything will be an improvement over what it was. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

Hi there Fephisto, I am a vagrant from en.wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cronholm144] and have found the calculus book to be a rather shabby affair. Any chance that we could get a team together to clean things up a little bit? Cheers --[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:14, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Calculus ==

Hmm... I think that general clean-up is needed. I left messages at the multi-variable page and on some of the others in the book. One thing I found was that whoever wrote the more differentiation formulas page used Euler's formula to derive the trig derivatives. I think that is completely unacceptable. Anyway, I will leave my comment on each talk page of the book and then I will start editing. Pitch in whenever and where ever you are able. Hopefully we can make some progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My van is a 1990 GMC Vandura 2500. It has a 5.7L (350) FUEL INJECTED V8. The caps are for the noobs out there that need to be schooled: electronic fuel injection or bust if you get a van.

I won't go into too much detail on the how, but the why is definitely a must. First, electricity is not the necessity we sometimes make it out to be. In order for you to have a good electrical setup that doesn't require a lot of driving to charge your batteries, you need to spend about 1,000 dollars...at least. I'd suggest you get off that idea. Right now my van meets all my needs, including food storage and preparation. Wal-Mart has all the toilet you need in a convenient 24 hour package, but I frequently suffer from diarrhea, so I'm getting a toilet in there too.

1. Sleeping: Just a twin mattress, but I suggest you build your own bedframe as I did. the 16 inches of vertical storage space underneath it is invaluable.

2. Food: Coleman camp stove/grill. The grill comes in handy when you don't want to clean a pan. It traps the grease. Don't cook heavily seasoned meat in your van though. It smells for days. Chicken leaves the least odor, unless you're a garlic fiend. These stoves claim to run 1.1 hour with both the grill and stove on high off of one 16.4 oz propane canister. You will never need to turn both on high or either on high individually, as this thing gets HOT! This translates into you getting about 10 meals out of 1 canister. Easy. Also, unless you want to die in a fire or of carbon monoxide poisoning, I suggest you get an ABC fire extinguisher and either a vent or cook with both front windows open and your curtain drawn. I've found also that just about any 5 day cooler (mine is a 60 US quart Igloo cooler) will keep your food cold enough.

3. Hygiene: Babywipes and mouthwash. I have a sink in my van that I cut into a dresser with the drawers removed.

== More Pronouns ==

For a laid back country such as Indonesia, the people can seem surprisingly status conscious to the new arrival.  One of the ways in which this social order is established and maintained is through the language one uses in conversation.

Unlike some other languages in the archipelago (notably Sundanese and Javanese) modern Indonesian does not have well defined language levels which indicate the status of each party in conversation, although there are certainly words one would not use in a discussion with one's boss, one's friend's parent and so on.

As a general rule, it is easier and safer to err on the side of politeness and always use ''saya'' for a first person pronoun and ''Bapak'' or ''Ibu'' for a second person pronoun, but to do so would exclude you from most everyday speech.  

Master the phrases below and be prepared to receive compliments aplenty.

=== Titles ===

In Indonesian instead of referring to the person you are talking to as &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; and yourself as &lt;i&gt;I/me&lt;/i&gt;, people often use their name, or term of address.  Using someone's title instead of a second person pronoun (&lt;i&gt;you, your&lt;/i&gt; etc.) is normally considered the most polite way of addressing someone, as long as you don't use the incorrect title...  Referring to yourself by name sounds a little childish if you are the person with lower social standing, and patronising if the reverse is true.  In most cases unless speaking with small children, or unless you are a small child, it's safer to stick with &lt;i&gt;saya&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Word''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Origin''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Context''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''own name'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Almost exclusively used in conversation between adults and small children.  One's title is also often used.  This can also be used to hint at your preferred form of address. 
e.g. Pak Bambang: &quot;Selamat pagi, Tuan John&quot;  
John: &quot;Selamat pagi Pak, Mas John minta kopi biasa&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Bapak, Ibu''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mr, Mrs.  Most respectful, used when the addressee is above the age of 20 or so in a formal setting.  Note: unless used in conjunction with a name ''Pak'' is not considered a second person pronoun, that is, ''Pak Bambang'', or ''Bapak'' can be used in place of ''kamu'' but ''Pak'' by itself can not.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Tuan (m), Nyonya (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Malay&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sir, Madam.  Very formal, used almost exclusively for white expatriates, ''Tuan'' and ''Nyonya'' were used during colonial times and to many ears sound a little too colonial for contemporary society, although are still used in legal documents.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Mas (m), Mbak( f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Javanese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;An English equivalent would be ''buddy'', ''bro'', or ''mate'' (or ''miss'' for the feminine), but can also be used as a title (e.g. ''Mas John'', ''Mbak Vanessa'').  More formal than using the person's name directly, but still too informal to use unless the person is younger or you know them very well and they are around the same age.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Akang/Kang; Aang; Aa(m), Teteh; Ceuceu(f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sundanese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Practically identical to ''Mas'' or &quot;Mbak&quot; respectively but only really heard in Sundanese speaking areas; i.e. Bandung, and other places in West Java and Banten.  Extended form is Akang. 
How to use. &quot;where to go, brother?&quot;=''&quot;pergi kemana,'''A''' -or- '''Kang''' -or- '''Ang'''?&quot;''
&quot;where to go, sister?&quot;=''&quot;pergi kemana, '''Teh''' -or- '''Ceu'''?&quot;''
Brother John = ''Akang/Aa/Aang John''
Sister Mary = ''Teh/Ceu Mary''
&lt;/td&gt; the most popular form to address brother and sister in West Java and Banten is Aa and Teteh.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Bang, Bung (m)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Melayu&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Practically identical to ''Mas'' heard in Jakarta and most of Sumatera.  Extended form is Abang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Bli (m), Mbo (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Balinese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Practically identical to ''Mas'/&quot;Mbak&quot;' but only used in Bali.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== First Person ===

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Word''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Origin''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Context''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''saya''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Safest option for most conversations, though may seem overly formal if one is speaking with a child&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''aku''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian, also Javanese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;More familiar, used when the speaker is of a lower or similar social status and wants to be respectful, yet familiar. e.g. in discussions with one's friend's parents and so on.  Used more commonly by the Javanese where it is slightly closer to ''saya''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''gua, gue''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chinese via Betawi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very familiar, used between people of a similar social standing and only in informal situations.  While coming from Jakarta, it is now common among the youth throughout the archipelago and adults in major cities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''aye''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Betawi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Similar to ''gue'', only really heard in Jakarta.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''wo''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chinese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Used only by ethnic Chinese in conversation with other ethnic Chinese in some areas of Jakarta, Medan and other areas with high concentrations of ethnic Chinese&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Used mainly by Ethnic Chinese in Jakarta and other areas with high concentrations of ethnic Chinese, pronounced as the English ''I'', it functions as all forms of the first person pronoun just as other Indonesian first person pronouns. e.g. ''ini buku I'' = ''this is my book'', ''I mau pulang'' = ''I'm going home'', ''tolong jemput I'' = ''please pick me up''.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Second Person ===

As a general rule, Indonesians tend to use a person's title or their given name (often in conjunction with their title) in place of a true second person pronoun in spoken language.  This sounds less childish (as the younger person) or patronising (as the older person) than doing so with the first person pronoun and is probably your safest bet in most instances.

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Word''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Origin''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Context''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Anda''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You.  Very formal.  While theoretically the most correct form of standard Indonesian, you rarely hear it outside of advertisements and prepared speeches; and even then only rarely.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Kamu''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You. Informal.  Used between people of a similar social standing or when the speaker is older or of a higher social standing than the addressee.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Loe''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chinese via Betawi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You.  Very informal, used between people of a similar social standing and only in informal situations.  While coming from Jakarta, it is now common among the youth throughout the archipelago and adults in major cities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Ente''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Arabic via Betawi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You. Informal.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to get help properly==
This guide is going to give you a good start in the world of Linux, but I'm sure you will have questions along the way. Don't be afraid to ask questions but be sure to ask them right.

#Try searching around for the answer first.
#:You can imagine that help forums get asked the same questions many times over so see if someone else has run into the same problem as you. You'll save time and effort for both yourself, and whoever you might ask.
#Go ahead and ask your question.
#:Especially on IRC, you should not ask to ask your question (&quot;Does anyone here know about linux?&quot;) -- just ask.
#Try to be concise and comprehensive with background information.
#:You’re more likely to get an answer if people don't have to read large chunks of possibly irrelevant information they could have deduced from hearing your problem or asked at a later date.

If you're getting help on IRC, read a tutorial like [http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc] or [http://www.reactor-core.org/irc-help.html] if you aren't familiar with getting help on IRC.

== Built-In ==
===help===
Help for built-in commands are available from the '''help''' command. For example
 help logout
Provides help on the logout command. Help just prints a few lines of text to the console. You may need to be in a shell for this to work.

Note that even common commands like [[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities#cp|cp]] and [[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities#mv|mv]] are not built-in. In addition, most built-in commands have man and info pages (see below) - so it is generally more useful to look in man or info first.

If you have no idea about what command you should use, but you have a vague idea about some keywords that may be related to the topic you want (e.g., you want to print something), you can use the apropos command, like this:
  apropos print
that will display a lot of things related to print.

===man===
''See also: [[Guide to Unix/Commands/Getting Help#man|Guide to Unix]]''

Man pages are a flexible format of help page: they can be viewed in the console, and can be viewed as HTML in a web browser. For example, to view the man page for cp, type
 man cp
If you don't know the name of the command, you can search by using -k
 man -k &quot;copy&quot;

Man is split into sections 
# Executable programs or shell commands
# System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
# Library calls (functions within program libraries)
# Special files (usually found in /dev)
# File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
# Games
# Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
# System administration commands (usually only for root)
# Kernel routines [Non standard]
If a page with the same name is in more than one section, the correct one can be accessed by specifying the section number:
 man 1 cp
alternatively, specify -a to walk through all the sections
 man -a cp

Man pages can also be viewed in web browsers. Some web browsers, such as [[w:Konqueror|Konqueror]] allow you to use man: like a protocol - for example, typing
 man:cp
into the location bar shows the man page for cp. More generally, however, the man command can generate an HTML file, and then display it in a browser by using the -H command with the browser of your choice - in this example, firefox:
 man cp -Hfirefox

===info===
''See also: [[Guide to Unix/Commands/Getting Help#info|Guide to Unix]]''

Info pages are another type of help page. Pages here are sometimes duplicates of man pages - and sometimes are more complete. To view an info page, type
 info cp

===Yelp===
Yelp is a graphical program to display help documentation on GNOME systems. Run the command 'yelp' to begin.

==LUGs==
[[w:Linux User Group|Linux Users' Groups]] are a great resource for getting help. They're typically local organizations, or perhaps specific to a university. They may have a website with helpful information, or a mailing list or IRC channel where you can get personal assistance. Depending on the area served by the LUG, you might be able to meet face-to-face with fellow users who may offer to help you.

      <comment>/* Coordinate free paradigm */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">cool :) i like this page. [[User:Boud|Boud]] 12:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

I also like this page.  I'm trying to teach myself relativity using an actual textbook.  I'd like to help make the wikitextbook on relativity accessable. [[User:Itzamna|Itzamna]] 27 Jan 2009

helpful. i am reading penrose 'the road to reality' and his explanation of tensors is very abstract (although a fascinating book overall). i have searched the web for an easier intro to tensors. this page is a good start as it uses real examples. further explanation especially around the super and subscript notation used with tensors would be good. (ib 6 Feb 09)

== T as a matrix ==

Hi,
Could you specify please, what is denoted as x, y, z and v in the first formula? (The matrix of T)

== Coordinate free paradigm ==

One can play around with the words. We talk about &quot;abstract vectors&quot; to remove ourselves from the specific representations of the vector, because we are so used to think of vectors as n-tuples of numbers, members of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. That was the old way. So the new way is the &quot;abstract&quot; one.  But in another perspective, the new way is actually more concrete.  Young students raised in the new way of thinking may not at all know what you mean when you say that the vector exists as something abstract.

The coordinate-free way of thinking about vectors and linear operators just pretends there is a vector space V that is not at all the same as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  In this thinking, any member of V is a physical entity with a physical direction and a magnitude with physical dimension (length, force, etc). The n-tuple of components is just an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, not an element of V.  This physical nature of ''v'' is why it does not seem particularly abstract. 

Also the equations are equations of physical entities, not component equations. We have F = Tw where F is a member of the (tangent) space of forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, w is a member of the space of wind speeds, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;, and T is a member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{W};\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;, the space of linear operators &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}\to\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

I suggest that the text emphasizes the closeness to the physics, not the &quot;abstractness&quot;.  The &quot;abstract&quot; vectors and the &quot;abstract&quot; tensors or multilinear operators are (closer to) the real things that exist in the physical world independent of the observer that may choose a coordinate system and a representation.

It appears that some of the difficulty derives from a lack of a proper language to express things clearly. We talk about the &quot;vector (''x,y,z'')&quot; when we actually mean the vector &lt;math&gt;x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}+z\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\vec{i}&lt;/math&gt; etc, are physical basis vectors.  Now, (''x,y,z'') is more succinct, and &lt;math&gt;(x^{\mu})&lt;/math&gt; even more so.  But in introductory material we could use some way of making explicit that we mean a vector in the tangent space (or whichever space), not in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Perhaps we could introduce a name &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the coordinate system and write e.g. &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)_\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, to make it that element of V whose components are x,y,z relative to the coordinate basis. Do the same with the matrices that represent the linear operators. When you get to the index gymnastics, say that you are dropping the chart/basis annotation where unambiguous, to avoid clutter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">DavidCary's formula is wrong:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dz^2 + (2 r \sin\frac{\theta}{2})^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If this is for a cylinder, with the standard definitions of ''z, r, &amp;theta;'', then the metric is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dz^2 + r^2 d\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The cylinder is intrinsically flat. Hmm, this has to be reorganised - the cylinder is flat like the plane. The sphere is different.
i'm rewording a bit.

i'm removing:
''The full formula for  arbitrary (r, &amp;phi;, &amp;theta;) will be worked out later.'' 
because we are interested primarily in [[w:calculus|differentials]]. i don't see any point in distracting the reader by talking about path integrals at this point... [[User:Boud|Boud]] 12:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

Someone changed it after you.  It's pretty inaccessible right now. 1.28.09

== Contravariant and Covariant Vectors ==

The covariant and contravariant example makes no sense. With '''w''', if you increase displacement, temperature goes up. With '''v''', if you increase time, displacement goes up. The author is either not being clear, or this is vandalism.

The author references two figures at the end of the ''Contravariant and Covariant Vectors'' section, however, the figures are not available.

[[User:Rabadi|Rabadi]] 05:54, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

Can one think of Contravariant Tensors as an example of proportionality relationship while the covariant Tensors are inversly proportional.
Like &lt;math&gt;X^{a}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to something while &lt;math&gt;X_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is inversly proportional to the same thing, personally i don't know because i am trying to learn about the stuff myself.

[[User:harryortho|harryortho]] 16:49, 22/12/06 (GMT)

On the next section i wondered is it like having matrices &lt;math&gt;v = v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w = v^{*}&lt;/math&gt;which is a conjugate matrix, like &lt;math&gt;1x2.2x1&lt;/math&gt; and when you multiply them together they end up makeing a number with no units, except in Tensors there is another tensor without units like before the inverse times the original equals 1 but in a Tensor kind of way? is there any sense here?

[[User:harryortho|harryortho]] 17:04, 22/12/06 (GMT)

== Confusion ==

Last line &quot;Finally, if we define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha (\mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{\omega}) = \mathbf{\omega} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.&quot;

What is meant by that? Should it be &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;? Also, isn't the multiplication commutative by definition? If it is not too important, can we omit it? --[[User:Hirak 99|Hirak 99]] 11:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

* Yes, it should have been &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;; I corrected the error.  

It can be omitted, I suppose, but for now, I'd like to leave it there.  My reasoning is that, for beginners, commutativity may not be obvious or assumed.

'''TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES'''&lt;br /&gt;
for&lt;br /&gt;
GEORGIA'S COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PLAN
__FORCETOC__&lt;br /&gt;

===Role of TACs===
&quot;The Technical Advisory Committees are topic-specific groups of technical experts assembled to provide technical input – as needed – in discussions of specific new policy tools.&quot;  (The [[Georgia Water/Carl Vinson Institute of Government|Carl Vinson Institute of Government]] will provide discussion papers on the
range of options for the new water management policy tools.[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf])
These &quot;advisory committees are for advisory purposes only&quot; and are not decision-making in nature.  &quot;Their only role is to receive information and help evaluate that information and provide some understanding on whether or not proposals will work in target areas.&quot;  
[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf]  &quot;A technical advisory committee will be assembled to ascertain what technical questions on (a) topic must be asked and answered.&quot;

===Membership===
&quot;The Technical Advisory Committees are topic-specific groups of technical experts assembled to provide technical input – as needed – in discussions of specific new policy tools.  These technical advisors have extensive expertise and are actively participating and/or researching the topic being addressed.  TAC members represent diverse abilities and bring a broad range of scientific/technical experience and regional knowledge to EPD in this planning process.&quot; [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/Target_Flow_Regime_TAC.pdf]

===Public Participation===
&quot;... in additional to the formal advisory bodies, there will also need to be a series of town hall type meetings throughout the state in the later stages of the planning process.&quot;[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Functions==
===Notation===
Here is the notation that is used when dealing with mapping questions.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lbrace  \ldots \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; means a set of ...&lt;p&gt;
E.g. &lt;math&gt;\lbrace  x : x \ge 2\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; means a set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is bigger than or equal to 2.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; means the function f maps the set X is mapped into the set Y. Another way to write this is &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)=x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; - Natural Numbers – e.g. {1,2,3,. ..}&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; - Integers – e.g. {...−2,−1,0,1,2,. ..}&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; - Fractions (of rational numbers)&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; - Real Numbers, including rational and irrational numbers but not complex
numbers such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Irrational numbers have no general symbol – their notation is specific - e.g. {&lt;math&gt;\pi\ e\ \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;}

===Definitions===
'''Mapping''': a rule connecting two sets of items.&lt;p&gt;
'''Object/Input''': an item in the starting set.&lt;p&gt;
'''Image/Output''': an item in the finishing set.&lt;p&gt;
'''Domain''': the set of all objects.&lt;p&gt;
'''Co-domain''': set of all possible finishing values.&lt;p&gt;
'''Range''': elements from the co-domain that are actually used.&lt;p&gt;

===Different Mappings===

1) unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; unique &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(1:1 or ''injective'' mapping)&lt;p&gt;
2) several &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; unique &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(many:one mapping)&lt;p&gt;
3) unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; several &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(one:many mapping)&lt;p&gt;
4) several &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; several &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(many:many mapping)&lt;p&gt;

'''NB: A function can ''only'' be a 1:1 (injective) or many:one mapping.'''

===Basic Properties===
A function relates each of its inputs to exactly one output. If there are ever two outputs the formula it is not a function. For example  &lt;math&gt;y = x^2\,&lt;/math&gt; is a function because every x has only one output, but &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x \,&lt;/math&gt; is not a function because every x can have two values, for example 4 = &lt;math&gt;-2^2  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^2 &lt;/math&gt; so x can be 2 or -2. Graphs of circles (and similar shapes) represent many:many mappings and so they are not functions. You can determine if a graph is a function by using the vertical line test. This test states that a graph is a function if and only if any vertical line drawn will intersect the graph only once.
There are four ways to represent a function:&lt;p&gt;
1)A Formula&lt;p&gt;
2)A Graph&lt;p&gt;
3)A Table&lt;p&gt;
4)Verbally&lt;p&gt;

===Domain and Range===
Every function has a domain and range. The domain is the set of the input values. The range is the set of the output values. ''Remember if there is a reflection or translation in the function, there will be a reflection or translation in either one or both the domain and range.'' In example:&lt;p&gt;
The domain of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = +\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the range is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; but the domain of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = -\sqrt{x + 6}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left[-6,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the range is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,-\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;. See [[../../C1/Coordinate_Geometry_and_Graphs#Stretching|Reflection Rule 1 and Translation Rule 2]]. 
====Domain====
The domain of a function is generally all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;  with these three notable exceptions:
1) If x is in the denominator, the point at which the denominator is zero is not in the domain, E.g&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x}{x - 1}\,&lt;/math&gt; the domain will be all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;except for 1.&lt;p&gt;
2) If the exponent is less than zero and an even quantity, the domain will be &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, E.g&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; the domain will be &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt; will be all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
3) In a piecewise function the domain will be restricted by the definition, E.g&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} x, &amp; if\ x\le 5 \\ x^2, &amp; if\ 5&lt;x&lt;10 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; The domain of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; will be (5,10).

====Range====
There is one simple rule to remember for range. All even functions have a range of &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt; and odd functions have a range of all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Piecewise Functions===
[[Image:Upper_semi.svg|right]]A piecewise function is a function that is given by different expressions on different intervals.  The graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2, &amp; \mbox{if}\ x&lt; 2 \\ - \left(x - 3\right)^2 +9, &amp; \mbox{if}\ x\ge2 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; is shown on the right. The open circle indicates that the point is not included on the graph and the closed circle indicates that the point is included on the graph. So &lt;math&gt;f(2)&lt;/math&gt; = 8 not 4.

===One-One Function===
A one-one function must have a unique output for every input. In example &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; will not be one-one because the inputs -2 and 2 will both produce the output 4, but &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3&lt;/math&gt; will be one-one because every input will produce a unique output, f(-2)= -8 and f(2)=8. You can determine if a graph is one-one by using the horizontal line test. This test states that a function is one-one if and only if any horizontal line drawn will intersect the graph only once.

===Inverse Function===
The inverse of the function will produce the input value for the output value of the function. A function must be one-one in order for the inverse of the function to exist. To illustrate this mathematically: &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(y\right)= x&lt;/math&gt;. Also the composition of the inverse and the function will produce x: &lt;math&gt;ff^{-1}\left(x\right) = f^{-1}f\left(x\right) = x&lt;/math&gt;. An illustration involving apples and lemons can be found below. The original functions turns apples into lemons and the inverse function turns lemons into apples.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Fruit_function_and_inverse.PNG]]&lt;p&gt;
To find the inverse of a function.&lt;p&gt;
1)Solve the equation in terms of x&lt;p&gt;
2)Switch y with x.&lt;p&gt;
3)Write in the notation &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In Example find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = \frac{x - 1}{x + 2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
1) &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x - 1}{x + 2} \iff yx + 2y = x - 1 \iff yx - x = -2y -1 \iff x = \frac{-2y - 1}{y -1}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:11Inverse.png|right|300px]]
2)&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{-2x - 1}{x -1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3)&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(x\right) = \frac{-2x - 1}{x -1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can test this out now &lt;math&gt;f\left(2\right) = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Graphical Representation of One-One Functions===
When we graph an inverse of a one-one function we simply have to switch the x and y co-ordinates:(x,y) becomes (y,x). The co-ordinate (5,7) will be (7,5) on the inverse graph. The graph will be a reflection through the line y=x. In the example on the right the red line is the graph of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = x^3&lt;/math&gt; and the green line is the graph of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(x\right) = \sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Composition of Functions==
The mathematical symbol for composition of a function is &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively a composition can be written as &lt;math&gt;f\left[g\left(x\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt; When you compose two functions you replace all instances of the variable with the second function. You can tell the order of the function by the order that the composition is written in &lt;math&gt;F \circ G&lt;/math&gt;, means F is composed of G. If the domain or range is restricted in some way in the original function it will be restricted in the same way in the composite function.In example &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = 2x^2 + 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\left(x\right) = \sqrt{5x}&lt;/math&gt; find &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;. Then find the domain and range&lt;p&gt;
1) Replace all instances of x in f with &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{5x}&lt;/math&gt; giving &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = 2\sqrt{5x}^2 + 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
2) Now simplify. &lt;math&gt;f\circ g\left(x\right) = 10x + 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
3) The domain will be &lt;math&gt;x\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; because g(x) can never have a negative x value, and the range will be &lt;math&gt;fg \left(x\right)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; because g(x) can never be negative.

well at least i am watching  it at the moment.First of all it is for doctors,and among them those who take USMLE exam of USA. so esoteric of course it is. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:202.125.143.67|202.125.143.67]] ([[User talk:202.125.143.67|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.125.143.67|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

::USMLE is the [[Wikipedia:United_States_Medical_Licensure_Examination|'''US''' '''M'''edical '''L'''icensing '''E'''xamination]], which is actually a series of exams (&quot;Steps&quot;) taken by medical students and physicians in the US. [[Wikipedia:USMLE_Step_1|Step 1]] is usually taken in the second year of medical school, before students begin clinical rotations; it is an eight-hour-long (!) test that covers all the medical, biological, biochemical and other pre-clinical study up to that point. The strange, occasionally foul mnemonics are a traditional device; they're useful for passing tests, but even more important for remembering things 'in the field'. The Wikipedia entry on [[Wikipedia:Cranial nerves|cranial nerves]] includes several examples of these. --[[User:Randomfloop|Randomfloop]] 11:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've come across this riddle several times in my life.  But why have I never seen a single explanation of the &quot;I can't operate on him&quot; bit of the story? -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)\

Discussion moved from [[Puzzles:Lateral puzzles:8:Solution]]:

Nobody seems to know a good explanation of the &quot;I cannot operate on this boy&quot; bit of the story.

* It's not that the doctor physically cannot, but his child is the boy boilogically. His legal father died in the car, who the boy considered a better father.
* It is not uncommon for doctors to refuse to treat family members as it may compromise professional objectivity.  In emergencies, doctors may treat family members until another doctor becomes available.
** Is it likely that this particular doctor meant &quot;refuse to&quot; when she said &quot;can't&quot;?  Besides, I don't at the moment see how this doesn't qualify as an emergency.  Anyway, my point is that the common answer is incomplete - we certainly should provide an explanation of this part in a suitable form. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 13:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

No original research (adapted from Wikipedia):


{{shortcut|[[WB:NOR]]}}

[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|Wikibooks is not]] the place for original research. [[Wikibooks:Cite sources|Citing sources]] and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to [[Wikibooks:Verifiability|verify]] that you are not doing original research is to cite sources who discuss material that is '''directly related''' to the module, and to stick closely to what the sources say.

[[Wikibooks:No original research]] is one of three content policies. The other two are [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]] and [[Wikibooks:Verifiability]]. The three policies are complementary, jointly determining the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespace]]. They should therefore not be interpreted in isolation from each other, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three.

==What is original research?==

'''Original research''' refers to original research by editors of Wikibooks. It does not refer to original research that is published or available elsewhere (although such research may be excluded if editors consider the source to be disreputable or inappropriate).

The phrase &quot;original research&quot; in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts or ideas that, in the words of Wikibooks's founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a &quot;novel narrative or historical interpretation&quot;.

===Primary and secondary sources===
*'''Primary sources''' present information or data, such as archeological artifacts; photographs (but see below); historical documents such as a diary, census, transcript of a public hearing, trial, or interview; tabulated results of surveys or questionnaires, records of laboratory assays or observations; records of field observations. 
*'''Secondary sources''' present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data. 

Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all modules on Wikibooks should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not &quot;original research,&quot; it is &quot;source-based research,&quot; and it is fundamental to writing a textbook.

In some cases, where a module (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikibooks article may be based entirely on primary sources, but these are exceptions. 

In most cases, Wikibooks modules include material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. That is, we report what other reliable secondary sources have published, whether or not we regard the material as accurate. In order to avoid doing original research, and in order to help improve the quality of Wikibooks modules, it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data has been published by a third-party reputable publication (that is, not self-published) that is available to readers either from a website (other than Wikibooks) or through a public library. It is very important to [[Wikibooks:Cite sources|cite sources]] appropriately, so that readers can find your source and can satisfy themselves that Wikibooks has used the source correctly.

In some cases, there may be controversy or debate over what constitutes a legitimate or reputable authority or source. Where no agreement can be reached about this, the module should provide an account of the controversy and of the different authorities or sources. Such an account also helps ensure the article’s [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]].

&quot;No original research&quot; does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikibooks. Indeed, Wikibooks welcomes experts and academics. However, such experts do not occupy a privileged position within Wikibooks. They should refer to themselves and their publications in the third person and write from a neutral point of view (NPOV). They must also cite ''publications'', and may not use their ''unpublished knowledge'' as a source of information (which would be impossible to verify).

===Why do we exclude original research?===

# It's an obligation of Wikibooks to its readers that the information they read here be reliable and reputable, and so we rely only on credible or reputable published sources. See [[Wikibooks:No original research#What counts as a reputable_publication?]] for a discussion on how to judge whether a source is reliable. 
# Credible sources provide readers with resources they may consult to pursue their own research. After all, there are people who turn to textbooks as a first step in research, not as a last step.
# Relying on citable sources helps clarify what points of view are represented in a module, and thus helps us comply with our [[Wikibooks: Neutral point of view|NPOV]] policy.
# Relying on credible sources also may encourage new contributors.  For example, if someone knows of an important source that the module has ''not'' drawn on, he or she may feel more confident in adding important material to the module.

==Specific applications==
===The role of expert editors===
&quot;No original research&quot; does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikibooks. On the contrary, Wikibooks welcomes experts. We assume, however, that someone is an expert not only because of their personal and direct knowledge of a topic, but because of their knowledge of published sources on a topic. This policy prohibits expert editors from drawing on their personal and direct knowledge ''if'' such knowledge is [[Wikibooks:Verifiability|unverifiable]]. If an expert editor has published the results of his or her research elsewhere, in a reputable publication, the editor can [[Wikibooks:Cite sources|cite that source]] while writing in the third person and complying with our [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV policy]]. Otherwise, we hope expert editors will draw on their knowledge of other published sources to enrich our modules.  

===What is excluded from articles?===
A Wikibooks entry (including any part of a module) counts as original research if it '''proposes''' ideas; that is:

* it introduces a theory or method of solution; or
* it introduces original ideas; or
* it defines new terms; or
* it provides new definitions of pre-existing terms; or
* it introduces an argument without citing a reputable source, which purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; or
* it introduces or uses neologisms.

All of the above may be acceptable content once it has become a permanent feature of the public landscape. For example:

* the ideas have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal; or
* the ideas have become newsworthy: they have been independently reported in newspapers or news stories.

If you have an idea that you think should become part of the corpus of knowledge that is Wikibooks, the best approach is to arrange to have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet, and then document your work in an appropriately [[WB:NPOV|non-partisan]] manner.

The fact that we exclude something does ''not'' necessarily mean that material is ''bad'' -- Wikibooks is simply '''not the proper venue for it'''. We would have to turn away even Pulitzer Prize-level journalism and Nobel Prize-level science if its authors tried to publish it first on Wikibooks.

===How to deal with Wikibooks entries about theories===
For theories:
# state the key concepts;
# state the known and popular ideas and identify general &quot;''consensus''&quot;, making clear which is which, and bearing in mind that extreme-minority theories or views need not be included.

Unstable neologisms, and ideas stemming from one individual who is not an authority, or from a small group of such individuals, should either go to &quot;votes for deletion&quot; (because they &quot;fail the test of confirmability&quot;, not because they are necessarily false), or should be copyedited out.

===What counts as a reputable publication?===

Reputable publications include peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house or university press, and divisions of a general publisher which have a good reputation for scholarly publications.

For non-academic subjects, it is impossible to pin down a clear definition of &quot;reputable&quot;. In general, most of us have a good intuition about the meaning of the word. A magazine or press release self-published by a very extreme political or religious group would often not be regarded as &quot;reputable&quot;. For example, Wikibooks would not rely only on an article in the Socialist Workers' Party newspaper, ''The Militant'', to publish a statement about President Bush being gay. However, if that same claim was in ''The New York Times'', then Wikibooks could refer to the article (and to the sources quoted in the article). The political magazine could, however, be used as a source of information about the party itself.

Ask yourself some questions when you are evaluating a publication. Is it openly partisan? Does it have a large or very small readership? Is it a vanity publisher? Is it run principally by a single person, or does it have a large, permanent staff? Does it seem to have any system of peer review, or do you get the feeling that it shoots from the hip? If you heard that the publication you are about to use as a source was considering publishing a very negative article about you, would you (a) be terrified because you suspect they are irresponsible and do not fact-check; or (b) feel somewhat reassured because the publication employs several layers of editing staff, fact-checkers, lawyers, an editor-in-chief, and a publisher, and will usually correct its mistakes? If it is (a), do not use it as a source. If it is (b), it is what Wikibooks calls &quot;reputable&quot;. 

When dispute arises regarding whether a publication is reputable, you can attempt to get more editors involved and work toward a consensus. There is no clear definition, but don't ignore your intuition.

===Original pictures===
Pictures have enjoyed a broad exception from the NOR policy. Wikibooks editors have always been encouraged to take photos or draw pictures and upload them, releasing them under the [[GFDL]] or another free licence, to illustrate modules. There are several reasons this is welcomed:
*Pictures are generally used for illustration and do not ''propose unpublished ideas or arguments'', the core reason behind the NOR policy.
*Due to copyright law in a number of countries and its relationship to the work of building free textbooks, there are relatively few publicly available images we can take and use. Wikibooks editors' pictures fill a needed role.

A known disadvantage of allowing original photographs to be uploaded is the possibility of editors using photo manipulation to distort the facts or position being illustrated by the photo. Manipulated images should be prominently noted as such and, if they are not, should be posted to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. Even noted as having been manipulated, they should not be used to illustrate modules in the main namespace, although editors are free to make use of them on user pages.

Images that constitute original research in any other way are not allowed, such as a diagram of a hydrogen atom showing extra particles in the nucleus as theorized by the uploader. All uploaded pictures are subject to Wikibooks's other policies and guidelines, notably [[Wikibooks:Verifiability]], and [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]].

==Related policies and guidelines==
===[[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]===
The prohibition against original research limits the possibility of an editor presenting his or her own point of view in a module. Moreover, by reinforcing the importance of including verifiable research produced by others, this policy promotes the inclusion of multiple points of view in a module.  Consequently, this policy reinforces our '''neutral point of view''' policy.

In many cases, there are multiple established views of any given topic. In such cases, no single position, no matter how well researched, is authoritative. It is not the responsibility of any one editor to research ''all'' points of view.  But when incorporating research into an module, it is important that editors situate the research; that is, provide contextual information about the point of view, indicating how prevalent the position is, and whether it is held by a majority or minority.

===[[Wikibooks:Verifiability]]===
The quality of a textbook depends on its accuracy and reliability. Our [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]] policy acknowledges that people may disagree as to what &quot;the truth&quot; is.  People can, however, agree that certain points of view exist.  By relying on the research of others, and by presenting facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have been published by a reputable publisher, the no-original-research policy and our '''verifiability''' policy reinforce one another.

The threshold for inclusion in Wikibooks is '''verifiability''', not truth.

See [[Wikibooks:Verifiability]] for more detailed information.

===[[Wikibooks:Cite sources]]===
In order for people to be able to verify the research represented in a Wikibooks module, they must know where they can find the sources outside Wikibooks. Since this policy encourages editors to draw on previously published sources, it reinforces our '''cite sources''' policy.

See [[Wikibooks:Cite sources]] for more details and rationales, as well as an example of citation style (although formatting is of secondary importance).

==Origin of this policy: the opinion of Wikibooks's founder==

Wikibooks's founder, Jimmy Wales, has described original research as follows (although referencing Wikipedia, the same holds true here):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The phrase &quot;original research&quot; originated primarily as a practical means to deal with physics cranks, of which of course there are a number on the Web. The basic concept is as follows: It can be quite difficult for us to make any valid judgment as to whether a particular thing is ''true'' or not.  It isn't appropriate for us to try to determine whether someone's novel theory of physics is valid; we aren't really equipped to do that. But what we ''can'' do is check whether or not it actually has been published in reputable journals or by reputable publishers. So it's quite convenient to avoid judging the credibility of things by simply sticking to things that have been judged credible by people much better equipped to decide. The exact same principle will hold true for history&quot; (WikiEN-l, December 3, 2004).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An article that makes no new low-level claims, but nonetheless synthesizes work in a non-standard way, is effectively original research that I think we ought not to publish. This comes up most often in history, where there is a tendency by some Wikipedians to produce novel narratives and historical interpretations with citation to primary sources to back up their interpretation of events. Even if their citations are accurate, Wikipedia's poorly equipped to judge whether their particular synthesis of the available information is a reasonable one. ... I think in part this is just a symptom of an unfortunate tendency of disrespect for history as a professional discipline.  Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history&quot; (WikiEN-l, December 6, 2004).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==On talk pages and project pages==

Like most Wikibooks policies, ''No original research'' applies to modules, not to talk pages or project pages, although it may be regarded as poor taste to discuss personal theories on talk pages.

==Other options==
*[[meta:Main_Page|Meta-Wiki]] allows original research, see for instance [[m:research]], [[m:Wikiresearch]], [[m:Wikimedia Research Network]], [[m:wikiversity]], [[m:category:research]], and [[m:statistics]].

{{wikipedia|Binomial theorem}}
The notation ' &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; ' is defined as '''n factorial'''.

:&lt;math&gt;n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times (n-3) \times (n-4) \times...... 3 \times 2 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''0 factorial''' is equal to 1.'''
:&lt;math&gt;0! = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof of 0 factorial = 1'''
:&lt;math&gt;n!= n \times (n-1)!&lt;/math&gt;
:When n = 1,
:&lt;math&gt;1!= 1 \times (1-1)!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1=1 \times 0!&lt;/math&gt;
:And thus,
:&lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;

The binomial thereom gives the coefficients of the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^n &lt;/math&gt; .

We may consider without loss of generality the polynomial, of order n,
of a single variable z.
Assuming
&lt;math&gt; x \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;
set ''z = y / x''

:&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^n = x^n (1 + z)^n &lt;/math&gt; .

The expansion coefficients of &lt;math&gt; (1 + z)^n &lt;/math&gt; are known as the
binomial coefficients, and are denoted

:&lt;math&gt; (1 + z)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k &lt;/math&gt; .

Noting that

:&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} x^{n - k} y^k&lt;/math&gt;

is symmetric in ''x'' and ''y'', the identity

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n - k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

may be shown by replacing ''k'' by ''n - k'' and reversing the order of summation.

A recursive relationship between the &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
may be established by considering

:&lt;math&gt; (1 + z)^{n+1} = (1 + z)(1 + z)^n
= \sum_{k=0}^{n + 1} \begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k
= (1 + z) \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^{n + 1} \begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k
= \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k + \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^{k + 1}
= \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k + \sum_{k=1}^{n + 1} \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k - 1 \end{pmatrix} z^k
&lt;/math&gt; .

Since this must hold for all values of ''z'', the coefficients of &lt;math&gt; z^k &lt;/math&gt; on both sides of the equation must
be equal

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k - 1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

for k ranging from 1 through n, and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ n + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!n!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{(n-0)!0!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1
&lt;/math&gt; .

Pascal's Triangle is a schematic representation of the above recursion relation ...

Show
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

(proof by induction on ''n'').

A useful identity results by setting &lt;math&gt; z = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix}  = 2^n &lt;/math&gt; .

==The visual way to do the binomial theorem ==
{{wikipedia|Pascal's triangle}}
(this section is from difference triangles)

Lets look at the results for (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where n ranges from 0 to 3. 
 
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; =          1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;           =                1         
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; =        1x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;         =              1   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =      1x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;       =            1   2   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; =    1x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+3x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;     =          1   3   3   1

This new triangle is Pascal’s Triangle. 

It follows a counting method different from difference triangles.

 The sum of the x-th number in the n-th difference  and 
 the (x+1)-th number in the n-th difference yields the
 (x+1)-th number in the (n-1)-th difference.

It would take a lot of adding if we were to use the difference triangles in the X-gon to compute (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. However, using the Pascal’s Triangle which we have derived from it, the task becomes much simpler. Let’s expand Pascal’s Triangle.

 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;                                    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;                                  1   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;                                1   2   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;                             1    3   3    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;                           1    4   6   4    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;                         1   5   10   10   5   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;                      1   6   15   20   15   6   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;                   1   7   21   35   35   21   7    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;                1   8   28   56   70   56   28   8    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;              1   9   36   84   126  126  84   36   9    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;          1   10  45   120  210  252  210  120  45   10    1 

The final line of the triangle tells us that

(x+1)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1x&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; + 10x&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; + 45x&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; + 120x&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; + 210x&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; + 252x&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 210x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 120x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 45x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.

A '''template''' is simply a page designed for inclusion on other pages. If a template is changed, this is usually reflected on every page that uses the template. As you might begin to imagine, templates are a powerful tool that when put to good use, can reduce work and increase maintainability. On this page you will learn how to use templates and how to make your own templates.

[[File:Transclusion-multiple-foo.svg|frame|center|Template B can be included on pages A, P, and Q to display its content.  Updating the template will change what is shown on the pages that make use of it.]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

== General ==
Templates may contain any desired wikitext, including calls to other templates. They have some limited programming capacities: customizable values (called [[#Parameters|parameters]]), calculation and branching (using [[#Parser functions|parser functions]]), and access to wiki-specific [[#Variables|variables]], such as dates, times, and page names.

To use a template in a page, a template tag (in the form &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template&amp;nbsp;name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, which is the name of the template enclosed in doubled curled brackets) is added where you want the template to appear.  When a reader wants to view the page, the servers fetch the contents of the template page, process any variables relevant to the page, and display the result in place of the template tag.

Templates are useful for any text for which one wants a copy in two or more pages, and there is no need for  each copy to be edited independently, to adapt it to the page it is in. Since parameters can be used, versions may to that extent even be different, and parameter values can be edited independently for each. Templates are not only convenient, but they can also “force” a useful uniformity, e.g., a certain “style”. 

Typical applications are:
*[[Wikibooks:Templates/Maintenance|Messages]] for displaying information ({{tl|split}})
*[[Wikibooks:Templates/Navigation|Navigation]] between a book's pages or chapters for easier reading online ({{tl|chapter navigation}})
*Placeholders for displaying visual information. Like tables, figures, diagrams, illustrations, etc.
*Composites composed of a table of simple images which display more complex ideas ({{tl|chess diagram}}

===Template pages and namespaces===
Templates have their own [[WB:NS|namespace]] which uses the prefix &quot;Template:&quot; (similar to the familiar &quot;User:&quot;, &quot;Help:&quot;, and &quot;Talk:&quot; namespaces).

Most templates exist in the [[Wikibooks:Templates|template namespace]], and can therefore be found on pages titled &quot;Template:''Template name''&quot;. Sometimes, however, users create templates in other namespaces, such as the User: namespace.  The normal use of a template (called ''transclusion'') is possible from any namespace, but the advantage of the template namespace is that the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix is not needed when transcluding. By contrast, in order to transclude content from any other namespace excepting the main namespace (where books reside), the full name is needed, including the namespace prefix. If transcluding from the mainspace (which is rarely done) a colon must be prefixed inside the template syntax, or the software treats the code as an uncreated template. Thus:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Namespaces !! Coding example !! Result 
|-
| Template: ||&lt;nowiki&gt; {{Name of template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || Transclusion of template content 
|-
| Outside template and mainspace  || &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikibooks talk:name of page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || Transclusion of page content 
|-
| Mainspace || &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Book title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || Transclusion of book content 
|-
| Mainspace without colon || &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Help:Glossary#red link|Red-link]] to uncreated template
|}

Template names are exactly like other [[WB:CREATE|page names]]: case-sensitive except for the first letter, with spaces indistinguishable from underscores. If the symbol # (normally used to link to a [[WB:SECTION|section]] of a page) appears within the curly brackets, then it and any characters that follow it are ignored.

Template pages, like most other pages, have talk pages associated with them, where editors can discuss any issues relating to the template. (For this reason, templates should not be placed in &quot;Talk:&quot; namespace, even if they are intended for use on talk pages; since talk pages do not have talk pages of their own, there would be no page for discussing the template.)

===Template usage===
To transclude a template into another page, use the following syntax (called a '''template tag'''):
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''template name | parameter | parameter | ...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This consists of the template name and various parameters that are passed to the template, where each parameter is separated by a vertical bar (or ''pipe''), and the entirety is surrounded by doubled curly braces, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The template tag should be placed in a page wherever the template is intended to appear.  The &quot;Template:&quot; prefix is never needed for transclusion, only for finding and editing the template itself (though if the template is created in a different namespace that prefix ''is'' needed).  Not all templates have parameters, and not all templates that have parameters need to have values provided, so sometimes &lt;nowiki&gt;{{template name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is sufficient to use a template.  If a parameter is needed, but a value is not provided by the user, the template may render with something like {{mw-arg|...}} in the text, where the '...' might be a number or a parameter name.  This is to inform the user that a named or unnamed parameter is missing, and can be avoided by using [[#Parameter defaults|default values]] for the parameter.

Parameters come in two basic forms:
*unnamed parameters (sometimes called 'positional' parameters): values that are put into the template in the order they appear
*:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name|parameter1|parameter2|...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*named parameters: values associated with a particular named key in the template
*:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name| parametername1 = parameter1 | parametername2 = parameter2 | ...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
These may be mixed:
::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name|parameter1|parameter2| parametername1 = parameter3 | parametername2 = parameter4 | ...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

By convention named parameters are listed last, though that is not a requirement. Whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, returns) are stripped from the beginnings and ends of ''named'' parameter values (unnamed parameters are unaffected), but not from the middle: thus &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ ... | myparam = this is a test }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will be treated as though the user had typed &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ ... |myparam=this is a test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Template pages themselves may include material that is ''not'' transcluded with the template (such as documentation or categories that the template itself belongs to), or material that is ''only'' used when the page is transcluded (such as [[Help:Categories|categories]] that apply to the transclusion page, but not the template).  See the discussion of the [[#Noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude|''includeonly'' and ''noinclude'']] tags, below.

Attempting to transclude a template that does not exist produces a redlink, just like linking to any other nonexistent page.  Following the link allows one to create that particular template.

===Basic template usage examples===
If you wish to experiment with any of these, please use the [[Template:Template sandbox|template sandbox]].

====Templates with no parameters====
To see an example of a very simple template, look at [[Template:Tc]].  This template does nothing more than tranclude the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' into other pages.  For instance, editing the following phrases into any page will yield the associated results:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|+Using the template {{tl|tc}}
! Description  !! Text Entered !! Result after Processing
|-
| {{tl|Tc}} by itself
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{tc}}
|-
|Single use of {{tl|tc}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settling into the White House, we find the beginning of...&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settling into the White House, we find the beginning of...
|-
|Multiple uses of {{tl|tc}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settl{{tc}}g {{tc}}to the White House, we f{{tc}}d the beg{{tc}}n{{tc}}g of...&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settl{{tc}}g {{tc}}to the White House, we f{{tc}}d the beg{{tc}}n{{tc}}g of...
|}
You'll notice that the template includes only the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' when transcluded, despite the explanatory text on the template page (&quot;This template is used...&quot; click on the template link above to see).  If you edit the template page, (click [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Tc&amp;action=edit this link]), you'll see that everything except the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' is enclosed in '[[#noinclude|noinclude]]' tags, discussed later.

====Templates with unnamed parameters====
Transclusion with parameters is only slightly more complicated. For a quick example, the famous [[w:dead man's hand|dead man's hand]] can be reproduced by the following templates, using unnamed parameters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|+ Making the Dead Man's Hand
! Description  !! Text Entered !! Result after Processing
|-
|Using three templates ([[Template:Clubs]], [[Template:Diamonds]], and [[Template:Spades]])
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{clubs|A}} {{clubs|8}} {{spades|A}} {{spades|8}} {{diamonds|9}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|style=&quot;width:30%&quot;|{{clubs|A}} {{clubs|8}} {{spades|A}} {{spades|8}} {{diamonds|9}}
|-
|Using ([[Template:BridgeHandInline]]); not quite as pretty, but just one template, with four parameters.
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BridgeHandInline|A8||9|A8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{nowrap|{{BridgeHandInline|A8||9|A8}}}}
|-
|Using ([[Template:BridgeHandInline]]), but with a missing ''pipe'' separator
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BridgeHandInline|A8|9|A8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{nowrap|{{BridgeHandInline|A8|9|A8}}}}
|}

In the second example, the position of the parameter in the template tag determines which suit it belongs to. Thus, the first A8 (first slot) goes to spades, the empty position (second slot) goes to hearts, the 9 (third slot) goes to diamonds, the second A8 (fourth slot) goes to clubs.  Note that the empty parameter position is counted; if the extra pipe is forgotten, as in the third example, the result is that the cards end up in the wrong positions, and a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{4}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; appears, meaning that the template was expecting a value for the fourth positional parameter but none was provided.  See the [[#Parameters|section on parameters and default values]], below.

====Templates with named parameters====
Using named parameters is similar to using unnamed parameters.  For example, [[Template:Payoff matrix]] (which is used in some books on [[w:game theory|game theory]]) gives a simple 2-by-2 grid with adjustable values, using the names UL, UR, DL, and DR to refer to Up Left, Up Right, Down Left and Down Right, and a Name parameter to add a name to the bottom of the matrix.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! Description !! Code !! Result
|-
|Payoff matrix
| class=&quot;&quot; | &lt;nowiki&gt;{{payoff matrix | UL = 5 | UR = 7 | DL = 2 | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{payoff matrix | UL = 5 | UR = 7 | DL = 2 | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage }}
|-
|Payoff matrix showing a default value for a missing parameter, and different ordering for the others
| class=&quot;&quot; | &lt;nowiki&gt;{{payoff matrix | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage | DL = 2 | UR = 7 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{payoff matrix | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage | DL = 2 | UR = 7 }}
|}

In the second case, the order of the parameters has been altered without changing the result - one of the advantages that named parameters have over unnamed parameters - and one of the values (UL) has been removed entirely, allowing the template to insert the default value of &quot;0, 0&quot;.

Parameter names are case sensitive, even in the first character.  for example, using ''&quot;dr = 9&quot;'',''&quot;Dr = 9&quot;'' or ''&quot;dR = 9&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;DR = 9&quot;''  will cause the Down Right cell to display the default &quot;0, 0&quot;.  The alternate case versions are treated as different parameters and ignored by the template.

===Substitution===
{{shortcut|WB:SUBST}}
Generally, templates are processed into readable text when a user browses a page.  This is the normal intention of a template: since the template is reevaluated each time it's used, changes to the template can propagate across many pages quickly and effortlessly.  Occasionally, however, this is not appropriate.  For instance, a user may want a template which returns a date or time that remains fixed, rather than changing each time the page is browsed.  For those cases there is substitution, which is done by adding ''subst:'' before the template name in the template tag.  Substitution does exactly what its name suggests: rather than processing the template each time the page is browsed, substitution processes the template at the time the edit is saved, and replaces the template tag with the processed results.

For example, the template {{tl|tc}} (as shown above) adds the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' wherever it is placed.  Thus, the wikitext ''&lt;nowiki&gt;bra{{tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' will produce the word ''bra{{tc}}''. The wikitext will always remain as ''&lt;nowiki&gt;bra{{tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', however, so if {{tl|tc}} is changed so that it adds the letters ''&quot;wn&quot;'', the wikitext will produce ''brawn'' instead of ''brain''.  Substituting like so - ''&lt;nowiki&gt;bra{{subst:tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - will permanently change the wikitext to read ''brain'', and later changes to the template {{tl|tc}} will have no effect on the substituted text.

===Common mistakes===
'''URL problems'''

URLs can contain equals signs (=) e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://some.page.org?key=value&amp;key2=value2&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  However, the first equals sign in a template parameter listing is always treated as though it sets off a named template parameter.  thus &lt;nowiki&gt;{{some template|http://some.page.org?key=value&amp;key2=value2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will act as though ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://some.page.org?key&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is a parameter name, not the start of a URL.  There are two workarounds for this problem:
*Use an explicit positional parameter reference: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{some template|1=http://some.page.org?key=value&amp;key2=value2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  the '1=' refers to the first positional parameter explicitly and will obviate the subsequent equals signs
*Use the special template {{tl|{{=}}}}: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{some template|http://some.page.org?key{{=}}value&amp;key{{=}}value2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This template returns an equals sign that is not parsed or interpreted by the wiki software.

'''Whitespace problems'''

''Named'' parameters will automatically strip whitespace - spaces, tabs, carriage returns and line feeds, or other non-visible characters from a parameter.  ''Unnamed'' parameters will retain all whitespace.  This can cause odd formatting issues where the wrong behavior is expected.

'''Vertical pipe problems'''

The vertical pipe character (|) is used in templates (and parser functions) to separate parameters.  If you need to provide a pipe character to a template parameter, then use the special template '''{{tl|!}}''' which returns an unparsed pipe character, or use the [[w:List of XML and HTML character entity references|HTML entity]] '''&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/tt&gt;''' for the pipe character.

== Creating and editing templates==
Templates are created and edited in much the same way as any other page: choose an appropriate name, navigate to that page, then click the ''Edit'' tab or create a new page as needed.  The only real difference is that templates will normally be placed in the &quot;Template:&quot; namespace rather than the (unprefixed) main namespace.  Anything that can be included on a normal page can be included on a template, including other templates.  Beyond that, templates have access to programming features—[[#Parameters|parameters]], [[#Parser functions|parser functions]], and [[#Variables|variables]]—which allow for context-dependent use, and special tags that help control which information is transcluded and which is not.

When creating templates, it's best to follow a few simple principles:
*Choose a short, descriptive name.  Some people suggest that generic template names be entirely in lowercase letters, and those for a specific book use the form ''Template:Book Name/Template Name'', but there is currently no hard guideline.
*Make a quick [[WB:SEARCH|search]] of template space or [[Wikibooks:Templates|browse templates]] to make sure that the template you're creating hasn't already been done.  It is sometimes easier and better to enhance an already existing template than to create a new template from scratch.
*Make sure your template is properly documented and included in the correct categories. (see below)
*Try to make your template modular: i.e. capable of standing on its own and in a variety of different page contexts, without breaking, producing poor output, or messing up a page's layout.  In general, you want your template to be transparently useful to other editors—the more effort they have to put into understanding how your template is used, the less they will be willing to use it.

===Template documentation===
Categorizing your template and documenting it will make it easier for other editors to find and use.
*To add documentation, put the {{tl|documentation}} template inside '[[#noinclude|noinclude]]' tags on the template page.  This will create a documentation subpage that you can edit
*Categories that apply to the template itself should be added to the template page (inside 'noinclude' tags, with the {{tl|documentation}} template).  Categories that are to be transcluded to the transclusion page should be placed on the template page inside '[[#includeonly|includeonly]]' tags.

===Parameters===
Parameters are special codes that allow wikitext to be fed to a template; the template can be constructed to produce different outcomes depending on the values of the parameters it receives.  Parameters may have names, or may be referenced by the position of values provided in the template tag (the order of the parameters in the template code is irrelevant).  Parameters in a template take the form {{mw-arg|...}}, where the tripled curled-braces surround the name of a named parameter or the number of a positional parameter. Values entered for parameters can be quite long, and if needed the transclusion of an entire page may be used as the value for a parameter.

To see how parameters work, consider this example. Assume there is a template called 'peoplepets' that produces some text about people and their pets.  A template tag for this template might look like the following:

:A. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small | kind = dog }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:B. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | Bill | Susan | age = 7 | Queenie | fat | kind = cat }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The contents of the template itself, on the page [[Template:Peoplepets]], looks as follows:

:{{mw-arg|1}} and {{mw-arg|2}} own a {{mw-arg|4}} {{mw-arg|kind}} named {{mw-arg|3}} who is {{mw-arg|age}} years old.

Thus, the two template tags above will transclude the following text, respectively:

:A. {{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small | kind = dog }}&lt;br/&gt;
:B. {{ peoplepets | Bill | Susan | age = 7 | Queenie | fat | kind = cat }}

Things to note:
*The numbering of positional parameters skips over named parameters (as with 'age' above)
*The leading and trailing spaces around the values of ''named'' parameters in the template tags are stripped by the template.
**This is not true for unnamed parameters, which preserve trailing and leading whitespace.  However, browsers render multiple whitespace characters as a single space, so the extra spaces around 'Fido', 'fat' and the other unnamed parameter values aren't immediately visible.  This can be confusing if unnamed parameters are used for something other than display, such as links.
*The order in which named parameter values are used in the template doesn't matter.
*The number of a positional parameter is treated as though it were a name: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; could have been written &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | 1 =  John | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This is useful when positional parameters need to be entered out of order, or when a position parameter value contains an equals sign.
*Values may be empty.  Here the second positional parameter and the 'age' parameter have empty values:
*:Template tag:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John || age = | Fido | small | kind = dog }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:Produces (note the missing words):  {{ peoplepets | John || age = | Fido | small | kind = dog }}
*Values can remain unprovided.  Here the 'kind' parameter has been omitted:
*:Template tag: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:Produces (this displays the missing parameter):  {{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small }}

====Parameter defaults====
Default values can be specified for parameters using the vertical pipe character: |.   The above example template could be rewritten as follows (in which 'friend' is the default value for positional parameter 2, the 4th positional parameter defaults to emptiness, and the 'kind' of the pet defaults to 'dog'—see [[Template:Peoplepetsd]]):

:{{mw-arg|1}} and {{mw-arg|2{{!}}friend}} own a {{mw-arg|4{{!}}}} {{mw-arg|kind{{!}}dog}} named {{mw-arg|3}} who is {{mw-arg|age}} years old.

A template tag like the following: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepetsd | Bill | age = 7 | 3=Queenie }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will then produce the phrase ''{{peoplepetsd|Bill|age=7|3=Queenie}}''.

Note that the '3=' before the name of the dog is required, since the second positional parameter is not specified.  

An empty value for a parameter will override a default value, producing an empty space.  in other words &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepetsd | Bill || kind=| age = 7 | 3=Queenie }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will then produce the phrase ''{{ peoplepetsd | Bill || kind=| age = 7 | 3=Queenie }}''

====Dummy parameters and tag layout====
Parameters that are not used in the template are ignored if they are provided by the template tag.  This was intended to prevent transclusions from breaking if a template is changed in a way that removes a parameter; there's no need to go to every page a template is transcluded onto and change the tags.  This has an added benefit, however, of making some template tags more readable, through spacing, or by adding comments.  Using {{Tl|t3d}}:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;&quot;
|+ Dummy parameters
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Description
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:40%;&quot; | Text Entered
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Result
|-
| Adding comments using template {{Tl|t3d}}
|&lt;pre&gt;
{{t3d |a|b|c| row 1
      |d|e|f| row 2
      |g|h|i| row 3
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|{{t3d |a|b|c| row 1
      |d|e|f| row 2
      |g|h|i| row 3
}}
|}

Since {{Tl|t3d}} does not use parameters {{mw-arg|4}}, {{mw-arg|8}}, or {{mw-arg|12}} the 'row #' values have no effect on the produced wikitext.  Dummy named parameters can be used in any template tag; simply choose an unused parameter name and add it into the tag as 'unusedname = value'.  One special case of a named dummy parameter is to use an empty string as the parameter name.  

====Restrictions on parameters and parameter values====
*Unnamed parameters cannot be assigned a value containing an equals sign (=); the parser will treat the equals sign as the assignment of a named parameter.  There are several indirect means around this limitation:
**In the template, write the value as the default of an undefined parameter:
***{{mw-arg|...{{!}} a=b }}, where the ellipsis can be number of an unused positional parameter, or can be a blank string (a null parameter).
**In the page, assign the values to the template parameters with one of the following methods:
***&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''templatename''| 1= a=b }}, where the '1=' notation explicitly names the first unnamed parameter.
***Use the special template {{tl|{{=}}}}, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name''| &lt;nowiki&gt;a{{=}}b&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}
***Use the [[w:HTML entity|HTML entity]]  for an equals sign: &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;#x3d;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is only useful for text representation; If the equals sign needs to be processed as an ''actual'' equals sign (as in another template) this approach won't work.
*Parameter values cannot contain vertical pipe (|) characters; the parser will treat the pipe character as a separator rather than as text. Pipes are possible within wikilinks (&lt;nowiki&gt;country=[[United States|USA]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or nested templates (e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;volume= {{convert|30|acre.ft|m3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Indirect means around this limitation are as follows:
**Use the special template {{tl|!}}, which returns a valid pipe character.  Use this method if you need something that will be read as an ''actual'' pipe character (for instance, if you're using the parameter to modify the structure of a wikitext table)
**Use the HTML entity  for a vertical pipe: &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is only useful for text representation; If the pipe needs to be processed as an ''actual'' pipe this approach won't work.
*Parameter values cannot contain unmatched sequential curled brackets - &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The parser will try to parse them as the beginning or ending of a template tag or parameter, and will throw errors somewhere.  Parameters can, however, contain other parameters, magic words, or template tags.
**again, this can be circumvented using 'nowiki' tags or HTML entities.

===Nesting templates===
Templates may contain other templates – usually called 'nesting'.  As the template is processed, the wikitext produced by any nested templates is transcluded into the nesting template, so that the final product is essentially processed from the most deeply nested template out.  While fairly straight-forward in application, it involves some noteworthy quirks and tricks.

To pass a parameter value to a nested template, place a parameter tag as the value of one of the nested template's parameters.

*Examples:
**Template:A contains &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;the quick brown {{B|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{mw-arg|3}} &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; jumped over...&quot;. This takes the value passed to the third positional parameter of Template:A and passes it as the first positional parameter of Template:B, then returns the wikitext produced by B as part of the phrase.
**Template:A contains &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;the quick brown {{B|waldo=&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{mw-arg|3}} jumped over...&quot;.  As above, except  the third positional parameter of Template:A is passed to the named parameter 'waldo' of Template:B.

A template can call itself, but will stop after one iteration to prevent an infinite loop.

===Noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude===
Several tags are available to control what does and doesn't get transcluded from a template.  The three tags are noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude. 

====noinclude====
The 'noinclude' tag is used to prevent text on the template page from being transcluded onto other pages.  This is often used for:
*documentation
*categories that apply to the template itself
*[[Help:Editing#Interwiki links|interwiki links]] to related templates on other wikis.

Its use is straightforward:
:&lt;tt&gt;If this text were in a template page, this part would be transcluded
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;but this text would not be transcluded&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

====includeonly====
The 'includeonly' tag is the opposite of the 'noinclude' tag. Text within an includeonly block is ''only'' included when the page is transcluded, it does not appear on the template page itself.  This is frequently used for:
*categories that apply to the transcluding page
*hiding messy text or error messages that occur on the template page itself (often because parameters that need a value are undefined)

Its use is straightforward:
:&lt;tt&gt;If this text were in a template page, this part would appear on the template page and on the transclusion page
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;but this text would only appear on the transclusion page&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

====onlyinclude====
The 'onlyinclude' tag literally only includes the material that is between the tags; anything else on the page - even text within 'includeonly' tags, will appear on the template page but will not be included.  This is not frequently used, but might be useful when only a small bit of text in the middle of an otherwise large page is to be transcluded.

It is used like this:
:&lt;tt&gt;If this text were in a template page, this part would be visible there, but would not be transcluded
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;This text would not be visible on the template page, nor would it be transcluded&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;this text is all that would be transcluded&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

===Variables===
{{main|Help:Variables}}
System variables take the format {{mw-var|...}} where the enclosed text is always entirely capitalized.  These provide information directly from the system itself: local dates and times, information about the current page, and even information about the wiki itself.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; width:80%;&quot;
|+Examples of System Variables
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Description 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:40%;&quot; | Text Entered
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Result (for this help page)

|{{PAGENAME}}&lt;br /&gt;{{FULLPAGENAME}}

|-
| Number of registered users
|{{mw-var|NUMBEROFUSERS}}
|{{NUMBEROFUSERS}}
|-
|Timestamp of last revision
|{{mw-var|REVISIONTIMESTAMP}}
|{{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}}
|}

The PAGENAME and NAMESPACE variables are particularly useful, and frequently used, to change template behavior based on context.  For example, if the template includes a [[Help:Categories|category]] (e.g. cleanup templates, which categorize the page as a page which needs cleanup), it will often check the NAMESPACE variable to make sure that talk pages, user pages, or anywhere else the tag might incidentally be placed do not themselves get categorized as pages needing cleanup.

===Parser functions===
{{further|mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|l1=at the MediaWiki website}}

Parser functions are the tools for performing simple branchings, calculations, text manipulations, and the like.  As a group, they take one or more parameters and return a wikitext value based on the parameters.  There are two basic forms for parser functions (distinguished by whether a pound sign follows the opening brackets):

*Core parser functions, of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;{{functionName: parameter | parameter | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  
*Parser functions from an extension to the software, of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#functionName: parameter | parameter | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Parser functions are primarily used for the evaluation of [[#Parameters|parameters]] or [[#Variables|variables]], in order to produce different results in different contexts.

Core parser functions generally deal with text manipulation and specific project tasks.

===Other editing information===
*If the first included character of a template is one of the Wiki markup characters '''&lt;tt&gt;:;*#&lt;/tt&gt;''', then it is processed as though it is at the beginning of a line (even when the template tag is not).  This allows the creation of various kinds of lists in templates where the template may not always be in the correct place for a list.  To avoid this effect use &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;#&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or an [[w:HTML entity|HTML entity]] such as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#58;&lt;/tt&gt; for a colon. This is also useful in conjunction with definition [[WB:LIST|lists]].
*When a page called for transclusion is a redirect page, the redirect target is included instead.

== Revision history of pages containing templates ==
Pages in the stored [[WB:PH|page history]] consist of wikitext with possible ''references'' to templates and images. When viewing an old version of a page, these refer to the current versions of the templates and images, if these still exist. Thus the former composite page is not reconstructed.

'''Beef Stroganoff''', in its simplest form, is simply tender beef with a mushroom and sour cream sauce served over rice or [[Cookbook:Noodle|noodles]].

The current accepted history of this dish dates back to the 1890s when a chef* working for Count Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov (the famous Russian general) invented the recipe for a cooking competition in St. Petersburg. After the fall of Imperial [[cookbook:cuisine of Russia|Russia]], the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of [[cookbook:cuisine of China|China]] before the start of the Second World War. Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as U.S. servicemen stationed in China, brought several variants of the dish to the [[cookbook:cuisine of the United States|United States]], which may account for its popularity during the 1950s.  It is commonly served with noodles or rice.

It is also very popular in [[cookbook:cuisine of Brazil|Brazil]] (where it is better known as &quot;strogonoff&quot; or &quot;estrogonofe&quot;), but the recipe is slightly different there.

Note * Despite the allusion of the name &quot;stroganoff&quot; to Count Paul Stroganoff, a 19th century Russian diplomat, the origins of the dish have never been confirmed. Larousse Gastronomique notes that similar dishes were known since the 18th century but insists the dish by this specific name was the creation of chef '''Charles Briere''' who was working in St. Petersburg when he submitted the recipe to '''L 'Art Culinaire''' in 1891, but the dish seems much older. It did not appear in English cookbooks until 1932, and it was not until the 1940s that beef stroganoff became popular for elegant dinner parties in America.

== Traditional ==

=== Ingredients ===
* 2 pounds (900 g) [[cookbook:beef|beef]] chuck roast
* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) [[cookbook:salt|salt]] 
* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) ground [[cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] 
* 8 Tablespoons (110 g) [[cookbook:butter|butter]] 
* 4 [[cookbook:green onion|green onion]]s, sliced (white parts only) 
* 4 tablespoons (60 mL) [[cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]] 
* 10.5 ounces (300 g) condensed [[cookbook:broth|beef broth]] 
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) prepared [[cookbook:mustard|mustard]] 
* 6 ounce (150 g) sliced canned [[cookbook:mushroom|mushrooms]], drained 
* 1/3 cup (160 mL) [[cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]] 
* 1/3 cup (160 mL) [[cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] 
* [[cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste 
* ground black pepper to taste

=== Procedure ===
#Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper. 
#In a large [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]] over medium heat, melt the butter and [[cookbook:browning|brown]] the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips. 
#Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. 
#Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender. 
#Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste. 

Also very popular as a basic food service dish as it is very easy to produce it in large quantities.

== Quick and Easy ==

=== Ingredients ===
* 2 pkg (around 1.5 - 2.0 pounds) Bit Size [[cookbook:beef|beef]] (I prefer pre-cut stew meat. Left-over steaks cut into pieces works well. Ground beef browned in a skillet can also work if you have it around.)
* 1 can (8oz) [[cookbook:Mushroom Soup|cream of mushroom soup]]
* 1/2 can (4oz) [[cookbook:broth|beef broth]]
* 1 Tub (8oz) [[cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
* 1 bag (16oz) [[cookbook:egg noodles|egg noodles]]
* [[cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

=== Procedure ===
# Cook egg noodles in a large pot according to directions.
# While egg noodles cook, season the beef with salt and pepper and [[cookbook:brown|brown]] the meat in a [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]] unless it is already cooked. Low and slow makes a tender product. If meat is already cooked, heat the meat in the [[cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] or in a skillet.
# Drain egg noodles.
# Mix cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, and sour cream in the pot used for the egg noodles. Season the sauce with salt and pepper keeping in mind that many of the ingredients contain plenty of salt.
# Add noodle mixture with beef and serve.

This meal makes great left-overs.

&lt;h2&gt;Zen in the Art of Stuttering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Eugen_Herrigel|Eugen Herrigel]] taught philosophy at the University of Tokyo in the 1920s and 1930s. To learn the Japanese philosophy of Zen Buddhism he studied archery for six years with a Zen master. In 1953 he wrote [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0375705090&amp;tag=softlogic&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325 Zen in the Art of Archery] about his experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Daisetz_Teitaro_Suzuki|Daisetz T. Suzuki]] wrote in the introduction to Herrigel's book: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zen is the &amp;quot;everyday mind,&amp;quot; as was proclaimed by Baso (died 788); this &amp;quot;everyday mind&amp;quot; is no more than &amp;quot;sleeping when tired, eating when hungry.&amp;quot; As soon as we reflect, deliberate, and conceptualize, the original unconsciousness is lost and a thought interferes. We no longer eat while eating, we no longer sleep while sleeping. The arrow is off the string but does not fly straight to the target&amp;#133;Calculation which is miscalculation sets in&amp;#133;The archer's confused mind betrays itself in every direction and every field of activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Wendell_Johnson|Wendell Johnson]] said, &amp;quot;Stuttering is what you do trying not to stutter again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Fraser (founder of NAPA Auto Parts and the [http://www.stutteringhelp.org/ Stuttering Foundation of America] said, &amp;quot;Stuttering is largely what the stutterer does trying not to stutter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of stuttering therapy is spontaneous fluent speech. The goal of Zen is to do life activities without self-conscious calculating and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-stutterers usually talk without self-conscious calculating and thinking. But sometimes they are self-conscious about their speech. Fear of public speaking is common. And non-stutterers are self-conscious about asking the boss for a raise, or asking someone out on a date, or when discussing a difficult subject. Speech pathologists call this [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Stuttering Reduces Stress#Pragmatic Speech|pragmatics]]&amp;#151;the mental effort of calculating the listener's reaction to your speech. In the Zen framework, pragmatics is the calculation that is miscalculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of stuttering therapy should be to become a &amp;quot;Zen master of speech,&amp;quot; just as other Zen masters are archers or swordsmen or calligraphers. To make an analogy to Baso, you sleep when tired, eat when hungry, and talk when you need to communicate. You don't worry about the listener's reaction. You don't fear embarrassment. If the listener doesn't do what you want or expect, you don't get upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also talk fluently&amp;#151;but let's define fluency as if we're learning a foreign language. You need vocabulary to express your thoughts, grammar so your meaning isn't misconstrued, and accent and articulation to be understood. Mild stuttering may be OK, if your listener understands you, and you don't fear or avoid speaking. Van Riper called this &amp;quot;fluent stuttering,&amp;quot; and a Zen master might call it &amp;quot;fluency which is not fluency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like speech, archery is a combination of motor skills. You tense and relax certain muscles, with split-second timing. Like fluency for a stutterer, these motor skills are not easy or obvious. Like many stutterers working on their speech, Herrigel worked six years before he considered himself an archer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Herrigel study archery to learn Zen philosophy? Most Zen students read books, take classes, and talk with Zen masters. How could learning a set of motor skills teach you a philosophy? Herrigel was told that to learn Zen he must begin &amp;quot;by learning one of the Japanese arts associated with Zen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master Kenzo Awa's first lesson was drawing the bow, letting &amp;quot;only your two hands do the work, while your arm and shoulder muscles remain relaxed, as though they looked on impassively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is like stuttering therapy, with the goal of speaking while keeping your speech-production muscles relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel couldn't do this first step. He would &amp;quot;start trembling after a few moments, and my breathing became more and more labored.&amp;quot; Sounds like stuttering!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was trying to draw a six-foot bow held above his head, which requires great strength. But somehow the Master did this effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#133;he called out to me to &amp;quot;Relax! Relax!&amp;quot;&amp;#133;the day came when&amp;#133;I lost patience and brought myself to admit that I absolutely could not draw the bow in the manner prescribed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;You cannot do it,&amp;quot; explained the Master, &amp;quot;because you do not breathe right.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like stuttering therapy! The Master continued,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Press your breath down gently after breathing in, so that the abdominal wall is tightly stretched, and hold it there for a while. Then breathe out as slowly and evenly as possible, and after a short pause, draw a quick breath of air again&amp;#151;out and in continually, in a rhythm, that will gradually settle itself. If it is done properly, you will feel the shooting becoming easier every day. For through this breathing you will not only discover the source of all spiritual strength but will also cause this source to flow more abundantly, and to pour more easily through your limbs the more relaxed you are.&amp;quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And as if to prove it, he drew his strong bow and invited me to step behind him and feel his arm muscles. They were indeed quite relaxed, as though they were doing no work at all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The new way of breathing was practiced, without bow and arrow at first, until it came naturally. The slight feeling of discomfort noticeable in the beginning was quickly overcome. The Master attached so much importance to breathing out as slowly and steadily as possible to the very end, that, for better practice and control, he made us combine it with a humming note.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First relaxed breathing, and now vocal fold vibration! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I cannot think back to those days without recalling, over and over again, how difficult I found it, in the beginning, to get my breathing to work out right&amp;#133;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When, to excuse myself, I once remarked that I was conscientiously making an effort to keep relaxed, he replied: &amp;quot;That's just the trouble, you make an effort to think about it. Concentrate entirely on your breathing, as if you had nothing else to do!&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard stuttering therapists say the same thing&amp;#133;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It took me considerable time before I succeeded in doing what the Master wanted. But&amp;#151;I succeeded. I learned to lose myself so effortlessly in the breathing that I sometimes had the feeling that I myself was not breathing but&amp;#151;strange as this may sound&amp;#151;being breathed. And even when, in hours of thoughtful reflection, I struggled against this bold idea, I could no longer doubt that the breathing held out all that the Master had promised.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to draw the bow took a year. Perhaps stuttering therapies are unsuccessful because we expect results too quickly. Stuttering therapy could start with a year of breathing exercises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Herrigel learned to loose the arrow. This was even more difficult than drawing the bow. Herrigel kept jerking his hand at the moment of release, resulting in &amp;quot;visible shaking of my whole body and affected the bow and arrow as well.&amp;quot; This caused the arrow to &amp;quot;wobble.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master told Herrigel, &amp;quot;Don't think of what you have to do, don't consider how to carry it out! You mustn't open the right hand on purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel told the Master that after drawing the bow, &amp;quot;unless the shot comes at once I shan't be able to endure the tension&amp;#133;I can't wait any longer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master replied that Herrigel's inability to wait was because, &amp;quot;You do not wait for fulfillment, but brace yourself for failure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel spent three years learning to release the arrow. The Master kept saying to release the arrow without tension, like a bamboo leaf holding snow, bending lower and lower until the snow slips off. The bamboo leaf waits without effort until the snow falls off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stuttering therapy, the first word of a phrase should be without effort, rolling off your vocal folds like the snow sliding off the bamboo leaf. You shouldn't intend to say the first word, as the archer doesn't open his hand on purpose. The word should say itself, without your planning or calculating or trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel's three years practice releasing the arrow suggests that learning to release the first word of a phrase may also take three years, and be the hardest part of stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel was dedicated to his practice, but he couldn't release the arrow smoothly. The Master kept telling Herrigel to become &amp;quot;truly egoless.&amp;quot; Herrigel became dejected, and planned to discontinue the archery lessons, concluding that, &amp;quot;all my efforts of the last few years had become meaningless.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then, one day, after a shot, the Master made a deep bow and broke off the lesson. &amp;quot;Just then 'It' shot!&amp;quot; he cried.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;quot; meant that Herrigel had loosed a shot without loosing the shot. &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; had loosed the shot, not Herrigel. The Master could not say anymore what &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; was, just that &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; can only be known through experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only after considerable time did more right shots occasionally come off, which the Master signalized by a deep bow. How it happened that they loosed themselves without my doing anything, how it came about that my tightly closed right hand suddenly flew back wide open, I could not explain then and I cannot explain today&amp;#133;I got to the point of being able to distinguish, on my own, the right shots from the failures. The qualitative difference is so great that it cannot be overlooked once it has been experienced.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stuttering therapy, the difference between your relaxed, fluent voice and your tense, stuttering voice is as obvious as night and day&amp;#151;after you learn relaxed, fluent speech. Until then it seems impossible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master then began training Herrigel to shoot at a target, adding, &amp;quot;He who has a hundred miles to walk should reckon ninety as half the journey.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master refused to teach Herrigel to aim, insisting that the target was not the goal, and the goal cannot be aimed at, and that the goal doesn't have a name, except maybe &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though the Master did not aim, all of his shots lodged in the black center of the target, from sixty feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first Herrigel tried to shoot without caring if the arrows hit the target. But he couldn't do this, and &amp;quot;I confessed to him that I was at the end of my tether.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You worry yourself unnecessarily. Put the thought of hitting right out of your mind! You can be a Master even if every shot does not hit.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be a Zen master of speech even if you still stutter. Mild disfluencies don't matter, if you communicate well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Master said he sees &amp;quot;the goal as though I don't see it,&amp;quot; Herrigel replied that the Master should then be able to shoot blindfolded. The Master then had Herrigel set up the target in darkness, except for one candle. Herrigel could not see the target at all, but the Master shot two arrows. When Herrigel turned on the lights, he saw that not only had both arrows hit the bulls-eye, but the second arrow had hit the first and splintered it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel describes the following months as the hardest yet, of trying to hit the target yet not trying to hit the target. He gradually came to see the value of this training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It destroyed the last traces of any preoccupation with myself and the fluctuations of my mood.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Master had Herrigel shoot in front of spectators, and awarded him a diploma, &amp;quot;inscribed with the degree of mastery.&amp;quot; Before Herrigel returned to Europe, the Master added, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I must only warn you of one thing. You have become a different person in the course of these years. For this is what the art of archery means: a profound and far-reaching contest of the archer with himself. Perhaps you have hardly noticed it yet, but you will feel it very strongly when you meet your friends and acquaintances again&amp;#133;You will see with other eyes and measure with other measures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is at least one other method of making pipe fittings available on the internet, and the methods posted
there make a wider variety of fittings.  This is another approach.

Okay, we are going to make three different types of pipe fittings with this technique.

A 90% elbow joint.

A pipe &quot;Tee&quot;

And a four way fitting.

The &quot;Tee&quot; is made from the elbow joint, and the four way is made from the &quot;Tee&quot;.


== STEP 1 ==


Start with a basic cylinder.  Select it with the body tool (the all red pyramid in the group of four at the top of the W3D screen), it should all turn red, like the image in Step 2.

[[Image:step001.jpg]]

== STEPs 2 &amp; 3: ROTATE==

Right click to bring up the body menu.  Select '''ROTATE'''.  It will ask you what axis you want to rotate about.  Select the &quot;'''X'''&quot; axis.  BUT DO NOT MOVE YOUR MOUSE.  Instead, hit the '''&lt;tab&gt;''' key.  A menu will pop up asking you for a numeric value for the rotation in degrees.  Input 90.  The cylinder should now be laying on its side.  DON'T hit your space bar to deselect it, instead, right click again and select rotate once more.  This time pick the &quot;Y&quot; axis.  Again, DON'T move the mouse. Hit &lt;tab&gt; and put in the value of '''-45''' ('''minus 45''', not plus)  Make sure you are in orthographic view (that is the rightmost of the two pyramids in the upper left corner of your screen).  The top image is an orthographic view, which means you are looking at it from a 45 degree angle to start, so when you do the second rotation, it appears sideways on to your point of view (POV).

[[Image:step002.jpg]][[Image:step003.jpg]]

== STEP 4 ==

Use your mouse to drag a box around the vertices at the right edge of the cylinder.  (Alternatively, you could also use face select and use flatten in the face menu)  You should now have all the vertices at one end selected.  Leaving them selected, right click to bring up the vertices menu and choose '''FLATTEN &gt; X'''.  This will make all those vertices flatten into a plane perpendicular to the X axis.  If you hit your '''&lt;x&gt;''' key so you are looking down the &quot;X&quot; axis, you should see an oval shape.

[[Image:step004a.jpg]]
[[Image:step004.jpg]][[Image:step005.jpg]]

== STEP 5 ==

Hit the spacebar to deselect the vertices (if you used face select, just leave things as they are) Go into face mode and select the face created by the vertices you just flattened.  Right click to bring up the face menu.  Do '''EXTRACT REGION &gt; X''' to make a copy of just that face.  Drag it away from the cylinder.  Hit your spacebar to deselect everything.

[[Image:step006.jpg]][[Image:step007.jpg]]

== STEP 6 ==

Now go into body mode and select the now deformed cylinder.  Hit '''&lt;backspace&gt;''' to delete it.

[[Image:step008a.jpg]]
[[Image:step009.jpg]]

== STEP 7 ==

Select the region you just extracted.  On the menu across the top of the screen click on '''TOOLS &gt; CENTER &gt; ALL'''.  The oval shape should now be centered at the origin of the workplane.

[[Image:step010.jpg]]

== STEP 8: MORE ROTATION==

With it still selected, right click and select '''ROTATE &gt; X'''.  Don't move the mouse.  Hit '''&lt;tab&gt;''' and enter 90 in the pop up box.  Leave the oval selected.  You will get this:

[[Image:step011.jpg]]

Below is the view looking straight down the &quot;X&quot; axis.

[[Image:step012.jpg]]

== STEP 8 ==

Right click and pick rotate again.  This time choose &quot;Y&quot;.  Don't use the mouse.  Hit '''&lt;tab&gt;''' and enter the value '''45'''.  (we are going a '''POSITIVE 45''' degrees this time...) Your oval will rotate to a 45 degree angle.

TWO VIEWS: ORTHO AND STRAIGHT DOWN THE &quot;X&quot; AXIS AFTER ROTATION.

[[Image:step013.jpg]]
[[Image:step014.jpg]]

== STEP 9 ==

Go into face mode and select '''ONE SIDE ONLY''' of the oval.  Right click.  Do '''EXTRUDE REGION &gt; X'''.  Don't move the mouse.  &lt;tab&gt; and enter the value 3.

[[Image:step015.jpg]]

== STEP 10 ==

The face you just extruded should still be selected.  Right click.  Select '''FLATTEN &gt; X'''.  Now you have a cylinder that is flat on one face and at 45 degress on the other

[[Image:step016.jpg]]

You now have one half of a 90 degree pipe elbow with one end mitered at a 45 degree angle.

== STEP 11 ==

Hit space to deselect everything.  In face mode, rotate your model and select the '''45''' degree angled face.

Do '''TOOLS &gt; VIRTUAL MIRROR &gt; CREATE'''.

Now do '''TOOLS &gt; VIRTUAL MIRROR &gt; FREEZE'''.  Now you have a 90 degree elbow!  All you have to do is make it hollow, which we do in the next step.

[[Image:step018.jpg]]
[[Image:step018a.jpg]]

== STEP 12 ==

In face mode, select the two &quot;ends&quot; of your elbow and right click.  Select '''INTRUDE''' from the menu.  Move your mouse until you achieve your desired degree of wall thickness and left click.  You will now have a completed 90 degree pipe elbow.  This is the foundation for the pipe &quot;Tee&quot; and the four way connection.

[[Image:90-elbow-pre-intrude.jpg]][[Image:after-intrude.jpg]][[Image:after-intrude2.jpg]]

In the next steps, we will make the pipe &quot;Tee&quot;, which involves cutting away portions of an &quot;un-intruded&quot; 90 degree elbow and then doing another VIRTUAL MIRROR/FREEZE MIRROR.  We will also do a four way connection by cutting up a pipe &quot;Tee&quot; and re-joining it.

|description=These books deal with the '''[[w:C++|C++ programming language]]''': a general-purpose programming language. It is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. You may also be interested on the [[v:C++|material regarding this subject at Wikiversity]]. C++ originally began as an extension of the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]].
}}&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{Robox|theme=3|title=}}
&lt;big&gt;'''[[C++ Programming]]'''&lt;/big&gt;:  this book covers the history and characteristics of the programming language as it may be taught in an introductory to advanced course or as a reference book, including information on what is a programming language or how to install a compiler to the most used external libraries, GUI frameworks, design patterns, RAII, Multi-Threading and other information needed for real world programming in C++.

'''Geared towards:''' anyone interested in the C++ programming language.
----
&lt;big&gt;'''[[More C++ Idioms]]'''&lt;/big&gt;: the objective of this open book is to help elevate the knowledge of programmers who have moderate level of familiarity with C++ to a level where they feel much friendlier with C++. It provides an exhaustive catalog of modern reusable C++ idioms based on what expert programmers often use while programming/designing using C++.  It is an effort to capture their vocabulary and concepts into a single work.

'''Geared towards:''' anyone with an intermediate level of knowledge in C++ and programming language paradigms.
----
&lt;big&gt;'''[[Optimizing C++]]'''&lt;/big&gt;: platform-independent guidelines to develop efficient software using C++. 

'''Geared towards:''' C++ programmers who need to improve the performance of the software they develop.
----
&lt;big&gt;'''[[Understanding C++]]'''&lt;/big&gt;: book covering only the core C++ language and its standard library and focuses on writing clean portable code. This book assumes you already have a C++ compiler installed and have read how to compile programs with it.

'''Geared towards''': anyone with a moderate knowledge of how to use a computer and an interest in understanding the C++ standard.
----
&lt;big&gt;'''[[C++ Programming As A Set Of Problems]]'''&lt;/big&gt;: a book covering the C++ language from the practical side. This book assumes you already have a C++ compiler installed and have read how to compile programs with it. 
	
'''Geared towards:''' anyone with a moderate knowledge of how to use a computer and an interest in programming with C++. 
----
&lt;big&gt;'''[[Intro To C++]]'''&lt;/big&gt;: Do you want to learn C++, and have ways to actually remember how? Check this book out then!

'''Geared towards:''' someone who wants to get into computer programming and start off with C++.

{{TOC right}}

Combustion type engines are limited in temperature, and thus gas exhaust velocity, either by the chemical energy of the fuel, or the melting point of the engine materials.  Ion and plasma type engines bypass these limits and reach much higher velocities by one or more of: using external energy sources, lower energy density to limit engine heating, or using non-material containment such as magnetic fields to direct the flow.  These methods also tend to make ion and plasma engines heavy compared to combustion engines, so they are not used for launch from high gravity bodies.  Rather they operate where there is already a low-g environment in orbit or away from gravity wells.

The ion and plasma types both involve high energy particles.  The distinction is one of density.  In the former the particles act individually, while in the latter they are dense enough to require treating them as a flowing medium.


==Ion Engines==

====48 Electrostatic Ion Engine====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Electrostatic ion thrusters generally work by first ionizing the propellant, then using a voltage gradient to accelerate the ions.  They are capable of high exhaust velocities (30-50 km/s), but relatively low energy density and thrust in order to prevent overheating and erosion of the screens creating the voltage difference.  Since the voltage gradient is uniform between two flat screens, the ion beam is well directed without a nozzle.  Ejecting only positive ions would produce a net charge on the engine, so ion engines also have an electron gun to balance the charges emitted.

All ion engines require an external power source.  A number of variations for the power source have been proposed, but only Solar-Electric has actually been used.  Since ionization merely removes an electron, but does not accelerate the ion, it represents an efficiency loss for the engine.  Therefore ion engines tend to prefer fuels with high atomic weight relative to ionization energy.  Since most high atomic weight elements are solids, Mercury and Xenon have often been chosen, and sometimes Argon if operating in a cold environment or reaching a very high exhaust velocity is desired.

'''Status:''' Ion thrusters have been used in recent years on some communications satellites and interplanetary spacecraft.

'''Variations:''' 
:* '''48a Solar-Electric Ion''' - Sunlight is converted to electricity by a photovoltaic array. The electricity is used to ionize and accelerate the propellant by electrostatic voltage.
:* '''48b Thermoelectric Ion''' - Radioactive isotope decay produces heat. Heat is converted to electricity by semiconductors. Electricity ionizes and accelerates atoms in the engine. 
:* '''48c Laser-Electric Ion''' - A laser tuned to the optimum absorption wavelength of photovoltaic cells supplies power. The cells convert laser light to electricity, which is used to power the ion engine. The ion engine then ionizes and accelerates the propellant. The reason for using a laser is to get higher power levels than natural sunlight provides.
:* '''48d Microwave-Electric Ion''' - A microwave receiving antenna, or '''Rectenna''', on the spacecraft converts microwaves to electricity.  Electricity is used to ionize and accelerate atoms.  Microwave antennas can be low mass, but the operating distance is limited by the ability to focus the long wavelength. 
:* '''48e Nuclear-Electric Ion''' -  A nuclear reactor generates heat, which is converted to electricity in thermoelectric or turbine/generator cycles. Electricity is used to ionize propellant and accelerate it by electrostatic voltage.  This is more suited to high power applications, and outer Solar System locations where sunlight is weak.
:* '''48f Electrospray Thruster''' - An ionic liquid is emitted from a capillary nozzle similar to an inkjet printer.  A high voltage electrode then accelerates the charged droplets.  This is suited to very small thrust levels for small spacecraft, or for steering, since lithography can be used to create microscopic nozzles.
:* '''48g Colloid Thruster''' - Rather than individual ions, this method accelerates relatively massive colloidal charged particles.

==Plasma Engines==

====49 Arc Jet Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Sunlight is converted to electricity by a photovoltaic array. The electricity is arced through a propellant stream, heating it to a plasma. The propellant is then expanded through a nozzle. No specific protection from heating is used in the nozzle.  The arc jet method uses relatively low energy density and thrust levels, and a thick-walled refractory metal for the chamber and nozzle.  Exhaust velocities of about 6-8 km/s are reached with liquid fuels like Hydrazine or Ammonia.

'''Status:''' Arc Jets have been used on spacecraft, and are commonly used on Earth as plasma torches for cutting metals.

'''Variations:''' 
:* '''Pulsed Plasma Thruster''' - operates by ablating Teflon material between two electrodes by means of an electric arc. The Lorentz force accelerates the material out as thrust.
:* '''Vacuum Arc Thruster''' - operates by vaporizing and ionizing cathode material by means of a vacuum arc. The plasma accelerates outward as thrust.
:* '''Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster''' - operates via electric arc between central cathode and shell anode.  Flowing gas between them is ionized and accelerated by the Lorentz force from current and field interactions.

====50 Electron Beam Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A high voltage (hundreds of keV) electron beam is injected axially into a propellant flow. The electron beam heats the flow to plasma temperatures, which produces high specific impulse. Cool gas is injected along the chamber walls to provide film cooling and protect the chamber from the very high temperature plasma. 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 
  
====51 Microwave Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Electron-Cyclotron Absorption Rocket, Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR), Helicon plasma thruster 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Partially ionized gas directly absorbs microwaves, becoming hot, then expands through rocket nozzle.  To keep the hot plasma from damaging the engine, a magnetic field is used for confinement, often using superconductors for efficiency.  Current versions use Argon as propellant, but other gases should function with tuning.  It may be possible to use unprocessed rock as fuel.

'''Status:''' VASIMR is in ground testing

'''Variations:'''

====52 Fusion Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The exhaust of a pure fusion rocket is a thin, extremely hot plasma which gives very high performance. If higher thrust is needed, Hydrogen can be mixed with the plasma. This increases thrust at the expense of performance.  By varying the mixture ratio, the performance vs thrust can be adjusted as needed during a mission. 

'''Status:''' Fusion engines await practical fusion reactors, which are still in the research stage as of 2012. 

'''Variations:'''

:* '''Reactor Leakage Mixed''' - Some of the fusion reaction plasma leaks past the containment fields.  This may be a mix of reacted particles, and un-reacted fuel.  The leakage can be directly used as engine exhaust, or further mixed with additional material for higher mass flow/thrust at lower performance.
:* '''Plasma Kernel Mixed''' - The fusion core plasma may be intentionally seeded with non-reacting material, which gets heated as part of the reaction.  A certain percentage is directed out of the core for thrust, balanced by new fuel added to the core.  The possible advantage of this method is eliminating the mixing problem of adding mass after the reactor.  Fusion engines produce very high exhaust velocities, so trying to mix more matter into the stream may require very large engine components.  Otherwise the stream may simply be gone before it has a chance to mix.

'''References:''' 


====53 Antimatter-Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The exhaust of a pure antimatter rocket is charged particles and gamma rays. This gives an extraordinarily high exhaust velocity, but relatively low thrust.  If higher thrust is needed, hydrogen can be mixed with the plasma, at at the expense of performance. This likely requires a large magnetic bottle to contain the particles and Hydrogen ions (protons) long enough to mix.

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:'''

My programming career thus far includes a small list of unfinished example attempts written in GameMaker Language which is a high-level programming language written in Delphi (I think).

A programming career is usually launched in several stages, let me explain them. First a person must either learn a programming language or choose to do something that requires programming knowledge. In this case, I chose to make computer games.

Many people would not say that the decision is part of the process to starting your career because none of them remember how they decided to be what they are. In this I am included since as far as I can remember I have always wanted to make computer games, or some kind of electronic game. In addition, my tastes started out at the top of the computer game technology list as well (3D games).

Secondly, a person will usually either go to school or become a hacker. Of course I put it simply enough, but it is more complicated than that. I am a hacker at heart, but I am also a very moral person, so I influenced myself away from hacking and spent my youth simply playing computer games all day every day.

Of course there is another component to the second step, that is guidance. Most people will tell you a story of their hero or someone who influenced their choices. I however am completely self-guided.

The journey to the third step is a long one. This may not be so long depending on your time spent and your typing speed. This step is usually marked by joining a team of programmers. You are on a nearly direct path to making a program that you can call your own (or at least your group can).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Thermodynamics/Entropy|next=Thermodynamics/The Second Law of Thermodynamics}}

The ''First Law of Thermodynamics'' is simply a restatement of the '''Law of Conservation of Energy'''.  There are a few ways of stating it, but they all mean the same thing:

{{TextBox|1=
* &quot;Energy is neither created nor destroyed.  It can only change form.&quot;
* &quot;The change in the system's thermal energy is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system.&quot;}}

The first definition is self-explanatory.  As an example, a propane grill does not &quot;create&quot; energy when it cooks food.  The energy stored within propane molecules and oxygen atoms is released in the form of heat and light when the propane molecules reassemble themselves into carbon dioxide and water (the combustion reaction).  Energy has not been created or destroyed.  It has simply changed from chemical potential energy into light and thermal energy.

The second explanation comes from a physics point of view.  It means that adding heat to a system increases its internal energy, and a system that does work (like breaking bonds or assembling large molecules from small ones) decreases its internal energy.  Overall, the total amount of heat, work, and energy remains constant.  This should make sense because heat is energy and work is energy being applied, so based on the first definition, all forms of energy must be accounted for.

{{Info|The First Law is much more useful in [[Subject:Physics|Physics]] than it is in General Chemistry.}}

I remove the notice. As a book the title is Ok. For me as an administrator it is somtimes difficult to distinquish between small books and chapters of larger books violating the naming convention. In this instance I was hunting down chapters which may or may not belong to the [[Dance]] book which is in a pretty bad shape. I am not even shure if the contributers of [[Dance]] head for a book or a bookshelf - currently there is the [[List of dances]] which is neither fish nor meat.

However [[Rueda de Casino]] seems large enough to be a book of it's own in any case. Please accept my appologies. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Garbage Collector */ grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Introduction==
All computer programs use up memory, whether that is a variable in memory, opening a file or connecting to a database. The question is how can the runtime environment reclaim any memory when it is not being used? There are three answers to this question:

*If you are using a ''managed'' resource, this is automatically released by the Garbage Collector
*If you are using an ''unmanaged'' resource, you must use the IDisposable interface to assist with the cleanup
*If you are calling the Garbage Collector directly, by using {{C sharp|System.GC.Collect()}} method, it will be forced to tidy up resources immediately.

Before discussing managed and unmanaged resources, it would be interesting to know what the garbage collector actually does.
===Garbage Collector===

The garbage collector is a background process running within your program. It is always present within all .NET applications. Its job is to look for objects (i.e. reference types) which are no longer being used by your program. If the object is assigned to null, or the object goes out of scope, the garbage collector will mark the object be cleaned up at some point in the future, and not necessarily have its resources released immediately! 

Why? The garbage collector will have a hard time keeping up with every de-allocation you make, especially at the speed the program runs and therefore only runs when resources become limited. Therefore, the garbage collector has three &quot;generations&quot;.

* Generation 0 - the most recently created objects
* Generation 1 - the mid-life objects
* Generation 2 - the long term objects.

All reference types will exist in one of these three generations. They will firstly be allocated to Gen 0, then moved to Gen 1 and Gen 2 depending on their lifetime. The garbage collector works by removing only what is needed and so will only scan Gen 0 for a quick-fix solution. This is because most, if not all, local variables are placed in this area.

For more in-depth information, visit the [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f144e03t.aspx MSDN Article] for a better explanation. 

Now you know about the garbage collector, let's discuss the resources that it is managing.

=== Managed Resources ===

Managed resources are objects which run totally within the .NET framework. All memory is reclaimed for you automatically, all resources closed and you are in most cases guaranteed to have all the memory released after the application closes, or when the garbage collector runs.

You do not have to do anything with them with regards to closing connections or anything, it is a self-tidying object.

=== Unmanaged Resources ===

There are circumstances where the .NET framework world will not release resources. This may be because the object references resources outside of the .NET framework, like the operating system, or internally references another unmanaged component, or that the resources accesses a component that uses COM, COM+ or DCOM. 

Whatever the reason, if you are using an object that implements the {{C sharp|IDisposable}} interface at a class level, then you too need to implement the {{C sharp|IDisposable}} interface too. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public interface IDisposable
{
     void Dispose();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface exposes a method called {{C sharp|Dispose()}}. This alone will ''not'' help tidy up resources, as it is only an interface, so the developer must use it correctly in order to ensure the resources are released. The two steps are:

# Always call Dispose() on any object that implements IDisposable as soon as you are finished using it. (This can be made easier with the {{C sharp/kw|using}} keyword)
# Use the finalizer method to call Dispose(), so that if anyone has not closed your resources, your code will do it for them.

==== Dispose pattern ====
Often, what you want to clean up varies depending on whether your object is being finalized. For example, you would not want to clean up managed resources in a finalizer since the managed resources could have been reclaimed by the garbage collector already. The '''dispose pattern''' can help you implement resource management properly in this situation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class MyResource : IDisposable
{
    private IntPtr _someUnmanagedResource;
    private List&lt;long&gt; _someManagedResource = new List&lt;long&gt;();
    
    public MyResource()
    {
        _someUnmanagedResource = AllocateSomeMemory();
        
        for (long i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++)
            _someManagedResource.Add(i);
        ...
    }
    
    // The finalizer will call the internal dispose method, telling it not to free managed resources.
    ~MyResource()
    {
        this.Dispose(false);
    }
    
    // The internal dispose method.
    private void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            // Clean up managed resources
            _someManagedResource.Clear();
        }
        
        // Clean up unmanaged resources
        FreeSomeMemory(_someUnmanagedResource);
    }
    
    // The public dispose method will call the internal dispose method, telling it to free managed resources.
    public void Dispose()
    {
        this.Dispose(true);
        // Tell the garbage collector to not call the finalizer because we have already freed resources.
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Applications ===

If you are coming to C# from [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic|Visual Basic Classic]] you will have seen code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;VB&quot;&gt;
  Public Function Read(ByRef FileName) As String
  
    Dim oFSO As FileSystemObject
    Set oFSO = New FileSystemObject
  
    Dim oFile As TextStream
    Set oFile = oFSO.OpenTextFile(FileName, ForReading, False)
    Read = oFile.ReadLine
    
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that neither ''oFSO'' nor ''oFile'' are explicitly disposed of. In Visual Basic Classic this is not necessary because both objects are declared locally. This means that the reference count goes to zero as soon as the function ends which results in calls to the ''Terminate'' event handlers of both objects. Those event handlers close the file and release the associated resources.

In C# this doesn't happen because the objects are not reference counted. The finalizers will not be called until the garbage collector decides to dispose of the objects. If the program uses very little memory this could be a long time. 

This causes a problem because the file is held open which might prevent other processes from accessing it.

In many languages the solution is to explicitly close the file and dispose of the objects and many C# programmers do just that. However, there is a better way: use the ''using'' statement:

  {{C sharp/kw|public}} read({{C sharp/kw|string}} fileName)
  {
     {{C sharp/kw|using}} (TextReader textReader = {{C sharp/kw|new}} StreamReader(filename))
     {
        {{C sharp/kw|return}} textReader.ReadLine();
     }
  }
 
Behind the scenes the compiler turns the using statement into
''{{C sharp/kw|try}} ... {{C sharp/kw|finally}}'' and produces this intermediate language (''IL'')
code:
  
  .method public hidebysig static string  Read(string FileName) cil managed
  {
    // Code size       39 (0x27)
    .maxstack  5
    .locals init (class [mscorlib]System.IO.TextReader V_0,
             string V_1)
    IL_0000:  ldarg.0
    IL_0001:  newobj     instance void [mscorlib]System.IO.StreamReader::.ctor(string)
    IL_0006:  stloc.0
    .try
    {
      IL_0007:  ldloc.0
      IL_0008:  callvirt   instance string [mscorlib]System.IO.TextReader::ReadLine()
      IL_000d:  stloc.1
      IL_000e:  leave      IL_0025
      IL_0013:  leave      IL_0025
    }  // end .try
    finally
    {
      IL_0018:  ldloc.0
      IL_0019:  brfalse    IL_0024
      IL_001e:  ldloc.0
      IL_001f:  callvirt   instance void [mscorlib]System.IDisposable::Dispose()
      IL_0024:  endfinally
    }  // end handler
    IL_0025:  ldloc.1
    IL_0026:  ret
  } // end of method Using::Read

Notice that the body of the ''Read'' function has been split into
three parts: initialisation, try, and finally. The ''finally'' block
includes code that was never explicitly specified in the original C#
source code, namely a call to the ''destructor'' of the
''Streamreader'' instance.

See [http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/tinguusingstatement.asp Understanding the 'using' statement in C# By TiNgZ aBrAhAm].

See the following sections for more applications of this technique.

===Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation===
The application of the ''using'' statement in the introduction is an example of an idiom called ''Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation'' (RAII).

RAII is a natural technique in languages like Visual Basic Classic and C++ that have deterministic finalization, but usually requires extra work to include in programs written in garbage collected languages like C# and VB.NET. The ''using'' statement makes it just as easy. Of course you could write the ''try..finally'' code out explicitly and in some cases that will still be necessary. For a thorough discussion of the RAII technique see [http://www.hackcraft.net/raii/ HackCraft: The RAII Programming Idiom]. Wikipedia has a brief note on the subject as well: [[w:Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|Resource Acquisition Is Initialization]].

Work in progress:  add C# versions showing incorrect and correct methods with and without using. Add notes on RAII, memoization and cacheing (see OOP wikibook).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Luthinya was born in Xi'an, China in 1993 and currently studies in St Paul's Girls' School of Hammersmith, London. Previously she has lived in China for nine years where she committed most of her primary education. As her parents believed in a preferable and freer education in England she came over the sea to that country in 2003 and plans to remain until when she could matriculate into university. She has a deep interest in modern theoretical physics despite also cherishing a love for famous works of literature and philosophy, the most prominent among which being The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien and Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant. The coming to the West has profoundly influenced her character into a freer form of thought and expression, besides also considerably widening her channels of interests and knowledge into more distant and esoteric fields. Luthinya also personally feels that she owes most of her abilities in creative and 'against- the- tide' thinking to the encouragement of individuality prevailing in Western schools, instead of the reducing of students to a mindless and faceless mass by means of the helplessly lacklustre exams, as is the tide of modern China enforced indirectly by Mao Zedong himself. Certainly her love for modern physics would not have bloomed so bright had it been left to wait and whither in the Chinese classroom Newtonian physics.

A rather profound quotation from Fritjof Capra would ascribe to her current character very well: ''Physicists have no need of Mysticism and Mystics have no need of Physics, but humanity needs both.''

Welcome to Wikibooks.  We are a group of people working together to write textbooks and other useful original non-fiction literature, and we are glad that you have chosen to spend some time here.

There are a few things that you should be aware of here, and most important, please read some of these pages on this project:

*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]
*[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers]]
*[[Help:How to start a book]]
*[[Meta:Help:Editing]] (about how to use the Wiki markup language here)
*[[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] (a collection of useful links to various pages on the project)

I would also ask you to please look at the following discussion pages if you have any questions:

*[[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]] (general Wikibooks discussions)
*[[Wikibooks:Study help desk]] (Q &amp; A list for general help on Wikibooks... especially for new users)

I wanted to add that the new Wikibook that you created, [[Tao te Ching]], is likely to be deleted unless you add some details about what you plan to accomplish here.  If you want to experiment, please consider editing on [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] where you can make a number of changes without worrying about damaging what anybody else may be doing.  The content there is regularly deleted, as it is only supposed to be for experiments for people new to this project.

If you are looking for more specific help and want a more personal touch, please consider cotacting one of the active [[Wikibooks:Administrators|project administrators]] here.  All of them have shown substantial interest in this project, and are familiar enough with how things work around here that they can generally help you out when you just can't figure things out.  Good luck and I hope to be seeing more of you soon.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:33, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks very much for contacting me. I am serious in my plans for the Tao te Ching - which I hope is within the catogories stated- but I would like to state that this book is not 'original' in the normal sense of the word. It is an ancient scripture concerning the 'Tao' as a Way and the virtues and powers for following such a Way, written by the Taoist sage Lao Tzu around two thousand and five hundred years ago. Many translations have been made available in English but I would like to make yet another translation available for the use of Wikibooks, along with several small sections of interpretation aids found within the books for those who did not know Taoism well. Please tell me if this does not fit the general scheme of Wikibooks- I only made sure that it was not fiction but it is still a mystical and religious text, and as I repeat a new translation is probably not conventionally 'original'. Also I am not quite certain I understood you correctly when you said about 'adding some details' about what I plan to accomplish there- to where am I supposed to add such details, or do you mean that the page I created was simply a manifesto for the book I am about to write? This bring me to another question- Where exactly am I meant to be able to creat my book free and proper? So far all the pages I have known were article pages wholly unlike to that of proper books where one may flip at will. Where exactly are the paper, as they were, upon which I can properly write my book? I thought I would use the page I just found for the time being, but as you contacted me I think you might be able to solve my problem. And many thanks for your attention!

If you are interested in doing a translation or simply a transcription of an existing manuscript, there is another project that is a much better place for material like this.  You should consider [[s:|Wikisource]], which is a Wikimedia sister project to Wikibooks.  On Wikisource they have more of a collaborative effort to make sure the content is added correctly, and groups in place that can help you out to verify the content you are adding, including a slightly stronger multi-lingual atmosphere than exists here on Wikibooks.  If you are planning to do the translation yourself, that is certainly an admirable task and something I've attempted to do myself for some documents.

As far as adding details about what your plans on a Wikibook or similar Wikimedia page, make sure you are using the discussion pages to let other contributors know where you are going to go with a similar kind of project.  This can be a simple sentance saying &quot;I'm new here and can use some help&quot; to a full manifesto about the book or article.

Once you have the content of the book down and would like some help to turn it into something that is more like a physical paper book like a typical textbook, make a comment on [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]] for more assistance.  This has been done to a few books here already, although for the most part we are busy trying to improve the content first and simply trying to get the thoughts organized.  Adding the written content down in the first place is by far the most difficult part of the whole task, and once that has been added trying to make a physcial book is considerably easier.

As far as making an annotated text or study aids for a classic text, that is something that can be done on either Wikibooks or Wikisource.  If it involves mainly source material, it would be worthwhile to keep most of it on Wikisource, while if the source material is minor compared to the study materials it may be used on Wikibooks.  That is a judgement call you would have to make but I would recommend that the source text itself (even a translation) be kept on Wikisource if possible.  The two projects are easily linked between each other and have similar policies and philosophies.

I hope that this answers some of your questions.  Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:27, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

General info:

RMB = Right Mouse Button (Single click of the...)

MMB = Middle Mouse Button.

LMB = Left Mouse Button.

So, for example, an RMB option refers to that option (of a tool) available by R clicking on it.

Default hotkeys are shown in bold. eg '''C''' for Connect.

Please check the main info line as this contains very useful information about the command / tool you're using.




'''Using Edge | Intersect to create a pipe joint of any angle.'''.....(Advanced Menus required - Edit &gt; Prefs &gt; Adv.)

[[Image:ISbend.gif]]

1.Create cylinder and select all axial edges

2.Edge | '''C'''onnect to form a new edgeloop.

3.Select end face

4.Rotate face around relevant axis – I used X &gt; 23.36 deg..&lt;br&gt;
Use Tab input for entering weird angles that aren't easily obtained by using Shift (15 deg) or Cntrl (1 deg) constraints.&lt;br&gt;
(See 'comments' for how to work out this 'rotate angle')

5.Select edges around lower (undistorted) part of cylinder (select one edge, press '''G''') and apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick plane) – Select the newly angled face.

6.Execute Intersect – the upper ends of the selected axial edges will now alter in length, until they ‘intersect’ the specified plane.

7.Situation at the top of the cylinder – essentially showing the distortion caused by the original rotate op in (4) – we need to make this one face – select large central face.

8.Press '''F''' (or '''+''') to grow the selection. (17 faces selected)

9.Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to get rid of all the separate faces and form a single face.

10.Face | Mirror to get required bend / joint etc.



'''Comments.'''

(2) is done to create axial edges that will stay undistorted during the rotate op. Use any system you prefer to achieve this (reference) geometry (Extruding the end face &gt; -Y is useful if you forget (2) prior to rotate op)
Whilst the above method will work for any angle, you may have to adjust the position (-Y) of the edgeloop formed in (2) to get it out of the way (of the Intersect plane) if rotating the face thro’ a large angle. (Could also move the rotated face +Y).

Select appropriate faces and use Face | Intrude to 'hollow out' this object to create a 'pipe'.




The expression needed to work out the included angle – for precise, non-eyeball stuff is :

Wings rotate angle = [90 – half the (included) angle required].

Eg for a 130 deg bend

Rotate Angle = [90 – 130/2] &gt;&gt; [90 - 65]  &gt;&gt; 25 degrees

So, for a 130 deg bend you’d have to rotate the top face (4) by 25 degrees.










''' Using Edge | Intersect to create a pipe T joint of any angle.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

'''Overview:'''

Change cylinder end face &gt; 2 semicircular faces.

Rotate (vector) one (face) thro’ half the required included angle for the joint.

Rotate the other (face) thro’ [90 – first angle], to form two faces at right angles to each other.

Use Edge | Intersect to correct distortion issues.

Tidy up faces, mirror and extrude to get required object.

[[Image:ISTjointangled1.gif]]

Using Edge | Intersect to create a pipe T joint of any angle.

1.Create default cylinder, select bottom face and Face | Extrude &gt; Y (or normal) a little – amount unimportant (provided you can see it :) )&lt;br&gt;
Select a pair of verts on the ends of a diagonal and apply Vert | Connect ('''C''') to create a diameter edge across the end face (mine’s parallel to the Z axis). Select one of the semicircular faces – either is ok.

2.Apply Face | Rotate &gt; Z &gt; RMB (Pick point for axis to pass thro’) Select either an end vert of this 'diameter edge' (as shown) or the diameter edge itself to specify the origin for the local rotate axis.

3.Execute op, by dragging the appropriate angle – which is half the included angle of the joint.&lt;br&gt;
I wanted a 66 deg joint, so I dragged 33 deg – holding cntrl to constrain to 1 deg steps. Use Tab input and enter the appropriate amount if it’s a nasty figure.

4.Select the other semicircular face and basically repeat what you’ve just done with the first face (press D to repeat last (rotate) op – as it’s using the same axis)

5.This pic is redundant if you use '''D''' to repeat the op – if you repeat the whole op from the start, use the same ‘anchor’ point (as shown). Drag to [90 - first angle] in this case, [90 - 33] = 57 deg (or use Tab as before).

6.With both semicircular end faces now at their correct angles, it’s time to correct the cylinder distortion caused by the rotate ops.&lt;br&gt; 
Select the (7) axial edges shown (some hidden) that are equi-spaced around the X axis.&lt;br&gt; 
(One on X axis, 3 either side, for this setup with a 16 sided default cylinder – eyeball info at top left to check you’ve only got 7 edges selected)

7.Apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick Plane) and select the semicircular end face on the same side as the selected axial edges.

8.Execute Intersect op – and the upper verts of the selected edges will now lie on the plane specified by the end face.

9.Repeat the whole Intersect op. for the other set of edges. Press '''Cntrl D''' to repeat last op – but offering the facility of using different elements. Note that 9 edges are selected this time.

10.Select appropriate end face to specify plane (for Intersect).

11.Execute Intersect – all selected edges now adjusted.



Continued...



[[Image:ISTjointangled2.gif]]


12.Select all end faces as shown on one side (either side is ok) – you should have 9 faces selected (with def. cyl.) – be sure you’ve got the little s**s adjacent to the diameter edge – depending on what angles the end faces have been rotated, these small, thin faces can be quite small and difficult to select.&lt;br&gt; 
Be wary of using certain selection ‘spreading / growing’ techniques as it’s possible to select the similar faces on the other side. Just eyeball info and check you’ve only got 9 :).

13.Apply Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to form a single face – keep this selected.

14.Apply Face | Mirror to form the major part of the joint. (all downhill from here).

15.Select all (18) faces shown and use Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') again to form a single face.

16.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; Y and drag to as required.

17.Apply Face | Flatten &gt; Y to sort out the end face.

18.Finished object – If you want to check the angle, select any pair of relevant edges (say, on a centreline) and eyeball ‘Angle’ info, top left display.










'''Using Edge | Intersect and remote reference to create a pipe T joint of any angle.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

Overview:

Create a cube and rotate it half the required included angle.

Create cylinder and change one end face &gt; 2 semicircular faces.

Use Edge | Intersect to extend cylinder Axial edges to the remote reference faces.

Tidy up faces, mirror and extrude to get required object.


An alternative to the previous method which might be worth considering if joint construction is taking place at the origin – rather than ‘in situ’ – somewhere on the model, away from the origin.

[[Image:ISTjointangledcube.gif]]

1.Create cube and apply Object | Move &gt; X &gt; 1 unit (hold shift to constrain).

2.Apply Object | Rotate &gt; Z &gt; RMB option (Pick point for axis to pass thro’) Select the upper edge immediately above the Z axis or either end vert) &gt; Execute op. by dragging half the required included angle of the joint. I wanted a 66 deg joint, so dragged (holding cntrl for 1 deg steps) thro’ 33 deg.&lt;br&gt;
This image (View '''Z''', '''O'''rtho) shows situation after rotate op – Important – note that upper (pivot / hinge) edge is exactly on the YZ plane, ie above the origin.

3.Create a cylinder (default here), Apply Object | Move &gt; -Y (enough to ‘clear’ the cube) and use Vert | Connect ('''C''') to form the diameter edge across the upper end face (as shown).
Select the 9 axial edges (centre one on X axis and 4 either side) and Apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick plane) &gt; select the cube face above these selected edges (as shown).

4.Execute the Intersect op – upper ends of selected edges extend to the selected reference plane.

5.Select the remaining (7) edges around the cylinder and re-apply the same Intersect op. Use '''Cntrl D''' to repeat this op, but letting you choose a different plane (as shown). (Or repeat the op from scratch – your choice).

6.Situation after the op’s been completed.

7.Cylinder with its 2 end faces formed as needed. Hide / dump cube.

8.Select either angled face and apply Face | Mirror. Select the 2 faces shown and Dissolve ('''Bksp''').

9.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; Y to create the remaining stub and use Face | Flatten &gt; Y to tidy end face.

10.Finished object.

'''
Comments:'''

In the above description, I used a cube and moved &gt; X &gt;1 unit. There’s no doubt many other ways of achieving the same result (eg,select all X edges, connect, loopcut, dump other half – for one) – use whatever approach fits your workflow (and hkeys?) best.

This (cube) move and the consequent vector rotate op isn’t absolutely necessary – you could just Rotate &gt; Z in the cube’s default position. Doing this, however will entail 2 different Intersect ops (first RMB, second MMB) as the planes are at the correct angle but not intersecting at the same point as the main description. (It would also remove the possibility of using '''Cntrl D''' for repeating the RMB option)

  








'''Using Edge | Intersect to create a 90 deg T joint.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

[[Image:ISTjoint.gif]]

Using Edge | Intersect to create a T joint.

1.Create cylinder, Scale Y &gt; (anything positive … I used 200%). Select all axial edges and apply Edge | Connect to form a new edgeloop.

2.Select a vert and move Y &gt; -1 unit (any vert will do, I used the one opposite the +X axis to keep things tidy.

3.Select the 3 edges (if using a def. cyl.) either side of the edge where the vert has just been moved.

4.Apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick plane) Select the 3 verts shown. The left and right ones in this image both lie on the Z axis. These 3 verts describe a plane at 45 deg to the Y axis.

5.A different view ( View '''Z''', '''O'''rtho), showing the vector (normal) associated with the required plane. 

6.Execute the Intersect op – the lower ends of all the selected edges now lie on the required plane.

7.Select all the faces on the upper part of the object and apply Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to create a single face. (Could also have used LoopCut to chop the thing in half etc.

8.Select the 2 relevant verts and use Vert | Connect ('''C''') to create the new edge shown. This forms the necessary mirror face.

9.Select face shown and apply Face | Mirror.

10.Select both faces shown, apply Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to form a single one.

11.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; X &gt; and drag to suit. Tidy the end by using Face | Flatten &gt; X.



'''Comments:'''

In (1) I only scaled Y to provide ‘room’ for the new pipe diameter – as a def. cyl is also 2 units long – same as the diameter.&lt;br&gt;
In (2) I moved the vert 1 unit. This, of course will only work (for a 90 deg T joint) if you’re using a default cylinder with a radius of 1 unit. If you’re using a different diameter cylinder – measure the radius (diameter) and use the appropriate figure.&lt;br&gt;
In general, you could have connected the verts of a def. cylinder (same verts as used in (8)) and then used a similar intersect procedure on one of the semicircular faces of this ‘block’ – ie no need to dump the upper half as I’ve done here.










'''Using Vector scale op to correct distortion / form a joint.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

[[Image:VSjoint.gif]]

Using Vector scale for a pipe joint

1.Create cylinder, select end face.

2.Face | Rotate &gt; X &gt; 45 degree (hold shift to constrain to 3 x 15 deg steps).

3.Apply Face | Scale Axis &gt; RMB option (Pick axis to scale along) select the 2 verts shown – this is to correct the projected view of the end face when viewed along the Y and Z axes.

4.Start dragging, press Tab, enter 141.42% in the data entry box. (141.42 = square root 2 x 100% - a figure that (together with its derivatives [70.71, 29.29] etc) is extremely useful and well worth remembering – imo.

5.Use Face | Mirror to get required object.


'''Comments:'''

In (3) – for a general situation,  it should be fairly clear (hopefully) which 2 verts you have to select to re-size (rmb axial scale) the end face, as the face essentially needs to be ‘stretched’ along one axis only.
 
Use 115.47% scaling factor if you rotate thro’ 30 deg.

Use 200% scaling factor if you rotate thro’ 60 deg.


To get a 90 deg T joint.&lt;br&gt; 
Vector flatten the outer (semicircular) edges of the joint.&lt;br&gt;
Use Edge | loopcut to remove unwanted geometry.&lt;br&gt;
Mirror

Similar for a 4 way joint – after connecting relevant verticies for a centre line.










'''Making a 90 deg  corner joint from a sphere.'''

[[Image:Spherejoint.gif]]

1.Create default sphere and select whole object.

2.Object | Scale Radial &gt; Y &gt; 141.42% (drag slightly, press '''Tab''' to get data entry box, enter 141.42 and accept)

3.All (8) cross-sectional edgeloops of the sphere are now ellipses of the correct ratio (major / minor axes) for the purpose in hand.&lt;br&gt;Whilst a 90deg joint could be made from any of these loops, selecting either the one shown, or the one at right angles to it make the job easier (no vector extrude op required).

4.View '''X''' '''O'''rtho, showing the projected shape of the ellipse as a circle – exactly what’s needed. (View '''Z''' would be similar)

5.Apply Edge | LoopCut to selected edgeloop and delete unwanted half – select elliptical face.

6.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; Z (or X), drag to suit.

7.Apply Face | Flatten &gt; Z (or X, if extrude X used)

8.Apply Face | Mirror to get required object.










'''Making a 90 deg  corner joint from a torus.'''

[[Image:Torusjoint.gif]]

1.Get primitives menu and open data entry box for the Torus (click on small box or RMB on listing if using Advanced Menus)  Enter the data shown. Three fields need changing from the default settings:

Sections &gt; 4

Slices &gt; 16

Minor Radius &gt; 0.7071 

(can enter 0.707107 – half the figure above in Major Radius field – if you’re really keen and after even more precision – but it’s hardly worth it imo :) ) 
You’ll get the figure shown – 4 joints, in essence.

2.To get rid of unwanted junk, create the 2 new edgeloops shown. Select an axial edge on each portion, press '''G''' (edge rin'''G''') to get the rest, '''C''' (Edge | '''C'''onnect) to connect them.

3.Apply Edge | LoopCut and delete the unwanted portion. This looks ok – but it’s not – because it needs to be scaled (Y).

4.Shows why it needs scaling – unless you want elliptical pipes.

5.Select whole object and apply Object | Scale &gt; Y &gt; 70.71% (use Tab entry box as described earlier).

6.Finished item.



'''Comments:'''

The figures I’ve used above will produce an object with 16 sides, having a (pipe) diameter of 1 unit (or very nearly so, anyway) – if you want other sizes you’ll have to use other figures.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to change the absolute minimum number of fields – then don’t bother with the last (min Rad) – the absolute essential one to change is the Sections &gt; 4 (assuming you want a 90 deg joint – other figs will produce joints with different included angles)

===Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control===

The [http://gaswcc.georgia.gov/00/article/0,2086,28110777_28115483_40115865,00.html Technical Advisory Planning Committee] was established to &quot;develop policies and procedures for use in updating and maintaining the information included in the [[Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission]]'s [http://www.dnr.state.ga.us/dnr/environ/techguide_files/wpb/esc_manual.pdf Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control]. The ultimate objective of the Committee is to provide information on best management practices based on sound scientific principles, that will best help Georgians to control erosion and sedimentation.&quot;


== Organizations ==

The goal of this section is to provide, for each major organization (EPD, SWCC, DCA, EPA, USDA, NRCS)  or organization category (such as county sediment control programs, Soil and Water Conservation Districts, citizen environmental groups, lake property owner associations, etc.), a brief summary of the organization’s legal responsibility, concerns, capabilities and funding; with copies of relevant statutes, rules and regulations, forms, and procedures used in their sediment related programs; and with ideas from people working in the organization for improving sediment and erosion control and for increasing their organization’s capabilities and potential.

====New EPD Procedures====

In January, 2006, the [[Georgia Environmental Protection Division|Georgia EPD]] published new procedures regarding role of EPD and the local issuing authorities:
* Recognizing that the Georgia Environmental Protection Division does not have staff or funds to replace local erosion control programs, the agency will try to support local programs through education and guidance. 
* Local governments are the first line of authority, and EPD will serve as a &quot;backstop.&quot; 
* However, if EPD investigates a site and finds violations, it must seek enforcement actions that could include penalties. 
* EPD can issue stop-work orders even in areas where a local government program is in effect. 
* Complaints to EPD in areas with local programs will be referred to local authorities, who must respond to EPD in writing as to how the complaint was resolved. 
* Failure to respond can trigger EPD enforcement actions against the violator and could result in suspension of the local government program.
* In situations where a local government issues permits for activities EPD deems inappropriate, EPD will not punish the developer but will require the local government to correct its procedures for future permits.
* Local governments can be decertified to issue development permits if their programs are inadequate, but they will be given time to correct their problems.

==Setup Instructions==
#Install subversion client software from:&lt;br&gt; http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/
#Download the m-file [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/files/DownloadPsychtoolbox.m DownloadPsychtoolbox.m]
#This file is the Psychtoolbox-Installer.
## Save the installer into your Psychtoolbox path.
## Change Matlab working directory to a folder were you want to download the latest release of PTB.
## Enter either DownloadPsychtoolbox('beta') or DownloadPsychtoolbox('stable') , depending which flavor of Psychtoolbox you want to use.

==Description of Stable and Beta==
'beta' gives you the equivalent of my past pre-releases: Early access to
bug-fixes, enhancements and new features. Tested and found to be
working properly on our own machines, but not yet sufficiently tested
by real users in real applications.

'stable' consists of former 'beta' releases that have received additional real-
world testing by end-users, so it is considered final code that will be
released in the next upcoming official release.

Obviously, 'stable' releases will have a much longer delay, until
features are added or bugs are fixed -- it's your choice.

As of today, 'beta' contains an improved DrawText function and
experimental support for Quicktime movie playback, as well as
new functions for transformations like scaling, translation
and rotation. MacOS-X 10.3.9 or later + Quicktime-7 is required for
'beta' to work. MacOS-X 10.2 and earlier are not supported anymore.

'stable' is identical to the 1.0.6 release and will stay that
way for a while, until all the new features in beta have received
sufficient testing by real users and more refinements and polishing by us.

What else? You need to perform this procedure only once. After
that, you can simply use the new command 'UpdatePsychtoolbox'
to keep your copy of PTB up to date with the latest changes in the
'beta' or 'stable' release whenever you want.

Cantonese roast duck/goose (烧鸭\烧鹅)

== Ingredients ==
* Duck or goose  3-6 pounds (1.3kg - 2.6kg)
* 3 green onions or 1 onion

=== Marinade ===
* 2 tbsps light soy sauce
* 2 tbsps dark soy sauce (option, can use light soy sauce instead)
* 2 cups (450ml) of white wine, sherry or Chinese cooking wine
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Five Spice Powder|Chinese five spice powder]]

=== Glaze ===
* 2 tbsps [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|Hoisin sauce]]
* 2 tbsps dark soy sauce

== Procedure ==

=== Preparation ===
# Mix all marinade ingredients together.
# Mix all glaze ingredients together.
# Wipe the mixture all over the duck/goose, inside and outside.
# Wipe the glaze mixture inside the duck/goose
# Sit duck in breast up, in an open container and on a rack
# Put in the refrigerator to chill over night.

=== Cooking ===
# Preheat oven to 450°F (220°C)
# Put 1 to 1/2 inch (2.5cm) of water in the roasting pan (so to catch the grease come out from the  duck/goose while roasting and prevent smoking of the grease in the oven)
# Place onion inside duck/goose, put duck/goose in the roasting pan, on a roasting rack,  
# Place duck/goose in the oven, back up, for 15 minutes
# Turn duck/goose to breast up, roast for another 15 minutes
# Turn oven heat to 375°F (190°C), roast the duck/goose until internal temperature reach a minimum of 180F (test between the thigh, the thickest part of the duck/goose, be careful not to touch the bone)
# Glaze the duck/goose, turn oven up to 450°F (200°C) and roast again for about 10 minutes

Carve and serve!

'''Hoisin''' or '''Hoi Sin''' sauce is a sweet bean sauce made from fermented soy beans. It can be found in most Asian supermarkets. It is one of the most widely known of the sauces, liked for its balance of sweetness, saltiness, garlic and five-spice powder. It is a staple of many Asian cuisines such as Chinese, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Headings ===

This would allow for a nice-looking one-page version. I will do that anyways with the exising modules (of course, I'll wait on the -/- -/- modules), but I'd like to have it in here for future authors --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:20, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Web Link Policy ===

Try to add relevant WEB links to the text in a way that it facilitates the transformation of the book into &lt;code&gt;.TXT&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII) format without the loss of that &quot;relevant&quot; information, also enabling copy-paste operations from the readers.

Proposed: 18 Sept 2005

=== Authors Section ===

Every person making non-trivial changes may add themselves to the [[C++ Programming/Authors|Authors]] section. Please add your full name. You may add zero or one of each: 
* link to your wikimedia page
* link to your web-page
* email address

Proposed: 19 Sept 2005

----
The proposal as stated above is just my idea. I am very open to and changes, but I do belive that we should agree on a format. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 23:07, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Humm should, couldn't it  be changed to -may- or -if the author wishes to...- as no one is obliged to do it, as for the information we should limit what is acceptable but not ask for particular info to be added (as for other works for what I understand of the GFDL)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:10, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
----
changed should to may. As for the info: I did not mean to ask the people for it, but rather to allow them to add that info, but not more. Maybe i need to re-word that? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:25, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

I propose adding this info to the mainpage since all this wikibooks do relate to C++ in some way or another and it provides a quick way to move from book to book .

I see so reason not to do that. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 16:35, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:It's redundant with our bookshelves. Perhaps we could link to the programming bookshelf, but such a large banner is going too far. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:47, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

----
It only to facilitate the aggregation of similar readers/editors if (as there existed) every similar or related book links to each other it's easier to port/use similar content and give the reader a broader view of the possibilities...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:57, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
----
I we are going the way of moving contents to different books (e.g. a whole book on STl, a whole book on boost, etc.) then we should definitely link these from the main page. Otherwiese people will be asking: Where is such-and-such content? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 20:19, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:We could put those links in a further reading section that's either on the main page or a subpage. While we want to provide links to other useful resources, we don't need to make an extra effort to draw attention to them. (I was also opposed to this linkbar being spammed on other books, partially because it only promoted the C -/- -/- fork (and not the original book) and partially because it's just too distracting of a banner.)  --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:56, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Navigation ===

To support a good navigational scheme, the actual content should be on a page with the name Pagename_Content and included from the actual pagename. This allows including the same content from the one-page version and from a chapter version of this book.

Proposed: 18 Sept 2005

Replaced by:

To support navigation, each page should link to the previous and next page, using the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. A navigational template will follow

Proposed: 21 Sept 2005

:Given this idea I've tried &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the Algorithms book to great effect. The (marginal) nav bar I had no longer shows up in the full text view (and thus I've included I link to it now). I suppose the only reason I missed using it before was because it wasn't an option before. :-) As for generating the &quot;next&quot; and &quot;prevous&quot; arguments for each use of the template it could either be done by hand, or by a bot that reads in the order of the all chapters view. I haven't tried out bots yet, but it could save time and avoid errors. Until then, prev and next could be done manually, unless there's another trick I don't know about. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]]

:One other note: I don't have much time available lately, so if there are any high-level issues, like renaming a locked page, just leave a note on my user page. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]]

=== Navigation ===

Pro:
 
* Chapter-to-chapter naviagtion makes it easier --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Con:

* TOC would have to be maintaned in 3 places --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

* Selecting &quot;edit&quot; on a content does not open the right page (is this true? please verify) --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
*:If you select &quot;edit&quot; on a h2, h3, etc heading you get the right page. That includes if you click on the first h2, which should be the chapter name, effectively giving you the whole page. For the [[Computer Science:Data Structures]] chapters there is also a link at the bottom that says &quot;edit this chapter.&quot; I assume that for most editors they will either make minor modifcations and use the heading edit buttons, or they will contribute a lot and already have the _content pages on their watch lists. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:33, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Comments:

If my last argument is false, i'd vote to do it --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:See above. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:33, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

----
Replaced by: I just found out that MediaWiki supports the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. Put in a page things inside will not show up when the page is included (such as from the all_chapters page). So here's the idea:
* Create a navigational template with forward and back
* have a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{:Template|prev chapter name|next chapter name}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on every page. Either on the top, the bottom or both.

Comments? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 04:40, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

==== Common Programming Errors ====

Comments:

[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] said &quot;&lt;code&gt;It would be nice to point out some common programming errors, pitfalls and the like by highlighting it.&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, proposed to look into [[w:infobox|Infoboxes]]
; NOTE : [[user:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] agreed but proposed a different book ( Programming:Improving programming skills ), didn't start one and doesn't seem to be a &quot;major&quot; contributor to CPP and never replied if she misunderstood the proposal.
:[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] did not advance the idea further.
'''P1 - Last action -&gt; 17 Oct 2004'''
:[[user:Panic2k4|Panic]] implemented a limited reference note on possible errors/styles.
* There are now some limited references on errors/styles so the proposal is dead (will add this to the conventions and remove proposal as adopted, I do think that it can be improved maybe [[user:Paddu|Paddu]] takes on the idea again)

belongs into every book. There should be a template with a nice icon :). Right now the template should just be panics old one, since it worked. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

==== Reduce the page size more ====

30k is still awfully large. Pages should actually be much smaller.

Proposed: 18 Sept 2005
----
This isn't signed, I don't think 30K is a problem should a vote be made on this point (readers should be allowed to vote)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:48, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

==== TODO Boxes ====
Pro:

* People see imediately what is missing --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Con:

* May scare readers (this book is not done yet) --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Comments:

If not used too often, i'd go with it. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Its like stubs there are no defined rules on how to use them, and I think of the book as never-ending work, there will be always things to add to it...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:01, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

==== Links to wikipedia ====

Links to wikipedia should be sparse. The should only be uses like other references, e.g. at the end of a chapter: &quot;For further reading, see ...&quot;

Proposed: 18 Sept 2005
----
This isn't signed, I do agree with the use of space references but not in aggregating them at the end of the book, references should be used to let readers explore some concepts,etc... that do not relate directly with the book topic, or used in a TODO box for future content mining...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:56, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
== Rename Book + Namespace for this page ==
I think that we should follow the Wikipedia naming conventions and rename this article to &quot;C Plus Plus&quot; as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Plus_Plus Wikipedia:C Plus Plus]. Suggestions? --[[User:Dionyziz|Dionyziz]] 16:05, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC).
----
Hy Dionyziz...

Herr, There is already a C plus plus book (I have forked it to build this one) with another filosofy on its order and content, so a rename/merge isn't workable at least at this time... 
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]]
----
Perhaps calling it &quot;CPP&quot; (as in Programming:CPP) then, since that's technically a correct way to name C++? &quot;C -/- -/-&quot; just seems funny/weird.&amp;hellip; &amp;mdash;[[User:Qrc|qrc]] July 9, 2005 17:41 (UTC)
----
You are free to try to centralize the C++ books with a front page and link and try to merge every work (into a new) structure. (that would/should be done in the future)... 
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:58, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
----
Prehaps you should read the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. The current name is running under [[WB:NP#Historical_conventions]]. So if at all a new name should be somthing like:

* Cpp Programming
* How-To programm in C plus plus
* Programming in C -/- -/-

Otherwise you end up being not a book but only chapter in a very very big [[Programming]] book. 

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 17:57, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

PS: with a good browser/internet connection you can rename about a 100 pages per hour.
----
Grummbll, it's hard to fallow all the policies as they get changed / created all the time (even if you really don't care about it, my main problem is content not reformatting the books every 4 months because some new order of the bookshelf was adopted, that is real annoying, it's the 3rd time I have to pass that ordeal first in C Plus Plus) I will comply with:

 '''The hyphen convention''': &lt;tt&gt;Bookname - Chaptername&lt;/tt&gt;

if no one objects, I'll do the renames as I go along editing stuff (if n1 helps that would be great, but check the dependencies and remember that templates  seem to notice page name changes), as for the name I do like the -/- -/- it's the closes to ++ one can get... the problem is with wikimedia not the name in itself, as for CPP (I really don't like it, not even as a file extension for C++ source files) and C Plus Plus only sounds better because it's the name adopted by Wikipedia... so the best option available seems Programming in C -/- -/-

Since I read the page I've noticed '''The colon convention''' I'll use that on the Index also...

The suggestion was only for the case that there is an actual rename. You are always free to leave erverything as it is - after all: content is more important.

This page even if it relates to the C plus plus book is only Wikibooks related and should not be in the same namespace of the book, it should be on the talk: --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:14, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:Really? Could you list that policy? I think you're mistaken. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 08:58, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Hm. I would have liked one page in the main namespace (with the adopted and proposed issues) and one in the talk: namespace with the discussion. I guess we'll have to find the right policy on this one (could you please link it). --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 03:12, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

I think I saw it, I've looked again and couldn't, but ok let's look at it logically.

What is the difference in the normal namespace or root if you prefer and the Talk: ?

If contributing to the Talk: does it make you an author of the book (and benefit from the rights and obligations of the GFDL ?)

Why are pages that only deal with the structure and local framework of a given work included on an that same book?
They can be easily considered off topic, and do not contribute content to the book in itself.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:33, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

:Contributing to the talk does not make you an author, nor would I say would making minor spelling or grammatical fixes make you an author. But that's beside the point. Wikimedia projects are free form, there are no hard and fast rules that claim any page under a given name ''must'' be part of the book. This free form nature gives great freedom to contributors. For example, the whole vote for deletion process on wikipedia is just people editing a file, there's no formal voting buttons or things like that. Life changes too much to encode things in the software like that. But even if there ''were'' a policy like that, the need for a style-guide would be enough evidence that the policy should change. But this is all moot, considering that (1) style guides are entirely appropriate, (2) it does not matter in any sense if they are or are not part of the book, and (3) many other books do this already. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:45, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

I think this discussion belongs into the main wikibooks discussions, until some common policy, ideally for all wikibooks, is reaching.  Just the fact that everyone of us three has a different option on what is meant &quot;unspokenly&quot; means that it'll finally have to be spoken. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 20:32, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Done, please check if I've missed any of the related points--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:24, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

The discussion is in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]
----
First, the Programming namespace should be dropped as it is unnecessary and not a real namespace. We don’t have '''Games:Chess''' or '''Languages:Japanese''' so why '''Programming:C plus plus'''?

Second, the + character is now valid for names and should be used for the title of this book.

I also agree and it's on the naming proposal or guides, but I had some troubles last time defending this view point...&lt;br&gt;
I don't agree in calling the book only &quot;C++&quot; --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

: I agree with you here. It should be a book name and not the name of a programming language. See: [[Ada Programming]], [[C Sharp Programming|C# Programming]], [[Java Programming]]. Off corse you don't have to follow that lead and can invent your own name. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:I don't get you, C++ is fine for [[w:C++|Wikipedia]] and for the Main Page, why not this book? C++ is what people are naturally going to type into the search box. What do you think if should be called? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 00:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:: Look again: those books which have allready moved out of Progamming: use there full name on the Main page.

----
C++ is a reference to the language object, it's like calling a C++ compiler &quot;C++ &quot; and justify it's name with a similar logic that you are applying to a book name, a variation of the name should be fine, like &quot;Programming C++&quot; or &quot;C++ Programming&quot; a simple addition to the language name would not only clarify immediately that we are not referring to the C++ Language in itself but to something related (an action or a view point) for example;&lt;br&gt;
I'm also contributing to the wikibook &quot;The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)&quot; I could have named it &quot;P2P&quot; or &quot;Peer-to-Peer&quot; but I was limiting the usefulness of the book name, adding something to the subject matter will provide a simple extension to the object/objective of the book and give a reader some more info...&lt;br&gt;
That said, I don't object to the &quot;C++&quot; name but find it to be limited in itself, and can generate some confusion in the reader...
You could check the book covers already submitted for this book for example, the change of the plus for the &quot;+&quot; is a battle I have been having for some time, heck, I have already moved the book 2 or 3 times the last one I was using &quot;-/-&quot; :)... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

I think avery effort to clarify the content use and protect authors is welcome, I know that this isn't required by the GFDL (I never said it was), but since the framework of the Wikibooks can make it difficult for a newcomer to obtain the info,  the access to it should  facilitated... 
[[User:Maxberger|Max]], yes the idea is to keep it on the conventions, it could be more elaborated with the proper references to the Wikipolicies so to facilitate discussion of this and future conventions.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:27, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

=== New presentation ===
What about changing the look of the book to have something like this [[fr:Programmation C]] or [[fr:Programmation C++ (debutant)]] in french sorry. [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 19:52, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
----
Looks great, I think you can do it with no need for a vote on the subject, just add the link to the new display/order on the top next to the single page version of the book or make a selection/entry point menu to the dif. ways a user can access the content and substitute the &quot;cover&quot; page with it. As of using a single finished &quot;look&quot; as the main entry to the book that is another thing (and will probably be voted on as soon as the book &quot;seems&quot; complete, still, we have to remember that this is an ever evolving framework), every reader is a potential contributor to the book, &quot;hiding&quot; the structure/modules and working pages may do more harm than good, the final objective is to have the GFDL content, the visualization or order can have many implementations as we make the content more modular.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:15, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
: I have done a new version of the look of this book see '''Programming:C plus plus/V2''' What's your opinion about this (the previous content is automatically include). (Sorry I can not speak english very well) [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 15:57, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

I notice pages still in the old namespace. I've moved them and fixed links accordingly. Everything should now reside under '''C++ Programming/V2''' and '''C++ Programming/V3''' including the templates that were specific to this book and there should be no pages that refer to the old page names. I've also managed to reduce the number of templates needed for '''C++ Programming/V3''' to just one for the header and chapter listing sidebar. I've also requested speedy deletion of all the old pages since none are needed. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 12:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
----
Is this dead... ?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
----
It would appear so. As you know I just fixed them up some. I only did it in case they were being used still. I wouldn't have any objections to them being removed. Merrheim hasn't contributed any changes since March 20th from the looks of things, so I think its safe to say that Merrheim is probably not going to be contributing any more work to them. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 14:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
----
'''There is a proposal to add a new look for this book :''' see [[C++ Programming/V2|V2]] or this one [[C++ Programming/V3|V3]]

I've removed this from the main page as the statement that this would auto-update is not correct and I don't intend on maintaining more that one TOC, it's sad as some users liked the setup. If no one takes charge of it, I'm moving for a deletion.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:27, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
-----
I don't intend on maintaining it either. I'm game for requesting its deletion if you are. If nobody wants to maintain it there really is no need to keep it. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Lets give it more 7 days if no one speaks up we can proceed with the deletion. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Almost time. There is also a [[Special:Prefixindex/C++_Programming/GUI|GUI]] one that was being worked on, I think by the same person, that seems to have not been mentioned and is in the same boat as V2 and V3. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Ok [[User:Darklama|darklama]] will you do it or do you want me to clear them out (there are a set of templates also), the marking for deletion list will include v2, v3 and GUI frameworks, and will include removing references from other pages. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:20, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
----
I think they are only self referencing so it should only be a matter of marking the templates for deletion to have them all be so. I'm just wondering if we should mark them for speedy deletion due to general agreement or for Votes for Deletion to give people one last chance to offer to maintain it. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Ops, to late, just removed tagged them all for {{tl|delete}}...
Propose a policy to only accept auto maintainable visualizations of the book, or dictate that the maintaining user must be reached within a limited time frame or the view/bookframework will be marked to speedy deletion. Comments.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
----
I don't think its compleatly possible to have auto maintainable visualizations. I think the best we can do is try to limit complexity of different views to ones that are more easly maintained. Such as the two table of contents and print views we got now, but I don't think this is currently going to be a problem since there aren't that many people contributing to this book right now to make this worth having some book convention on. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
----
v2, v3 and GUI have all been deleted along with most of what was left of '''Programming:C plus plus''', '''Programming: C plus plus''', '''Programming:C -/- -/-''' and '''Programming in C plus plus''' after merging in edit histories for pages that had been copy-pasted. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When I render my objects, I'm getting the colors okay, but there is no texture being used.  The preview display shows color and texture, but the view window, and the render window do not show texture.

== Yafray and Yafaray ==

This tutorial is out of date because Ya''fr''ay has been replaced with Ya'''far'''ay (note additional 'a' after the 'f').  Unfortunately whilst Ya'''fr'''ay could be integrated with Blender as an alternative rendering engine, the only way I have found to get Ya'''far'''ay working with Blender 2.48a on Windows Vista was:

1. to download Ya'''far'''ay and the QT libs from the Ya'''far'''ay site,

2. ensuring Python 2.5.2 (and no other version) and MSVC++ 2005 SP1 were installed (as per instructions on Ya'''far'''ay page),

3. load the Ya'''far'''ay render script using the menu: Scripts-&gt;Render-&gt;YafaRay 0.0.3 Export (also installed in the Render menu according to instructions), and clicking on the big render button in the scripts window,

Unfortunately to render with Ya'''far'''ay the scene materials need to be modified using the YafaRay 0.0.3 Export script settings - it will not use Blender materials.  This puts the use of Ya'''far'''ay outside the scope of tutorials at this level.

In short - use the Extra Practice tutorial at the bottom of the page instead.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ITunes 7 diagram.png|center|thumb|700px|This diagram shows the location of the interface elements of iTunes.]]
The best way to start learning a new application is to take a quick look at its interface. This sub-chapter tells you what's what in the iTunes window.

==Toolbar==
Like almost every other Mac program, iTunes has a toolbar right under its title bar. It includes some of the most important controls you'll use.

*'''Playback Controls''' - The three circular buttons on the left-hand side of the toolbar control the playback of music and video files.  Directly to their right is a volume slider for adjusting the sound volume. 

*'''Display''' - iTunes has a pale yellow &quot;display&quot; smack in the middle of the toolbar. This display can show the currently playing song, a level meter, or the status of ongoing tasks such as updating an iPod. To cycle through the availible things to display, click the small right-arrow button on the left side of the display. More information about this display

*'''View Controls''' - These three conjoined buttons let you select a view for your media. You'll learn about views later on.

*'''Search Field''' - This Spotlight search field lets you find your media fast.

==Status Bar==
iTunes has a status bar running along the bottom of its window. In the middle, iTunes puts a bit of text telling you just what you're viewing: how many files, how long it would take to listen or watch them all, and how much space they're taking up on your hard drive. Buttons appear at either end of the status bar. The ones on the left side are always there, and the ones on the right come and go depending on what you're doing. We'll tell you about the buttons here as we go.

==Source list==
The source list is to the left of the screen, right under the playback controls. The source list is divided into several sections that keep the various sources organized. The headings disappear if there are no sources of that type, so you might not see all of them. The following sections are organized to mimic iTunes' organization.

==Library==
Every media file on your computer that iTunes knows abou shows up in the library. Depending on what type of media it is, it will show up in different sources. These include: movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Audiobooks, iPod Games, Radio, and Party Shuffle. You can use the iTunes Preferences (under the &quot;General&quot; tab) to hide sources you aren't using. The libraries for each media type have all of that type of file in them.

==Store==
The icons in this section are all green for easy identification. The first icon is a link to the iTunes Store, just like it says. The second icon is a playlist of all the files purchased from the iTunes Store, though it can be rearranged just like any other playlist. The third icon is the download menu, which appears only if your computer is downloading a file from the the iTunes Store. It can be used to stop, restart, and organize downloads.

==Devices==
This section holds the controls for all of the devices currently hooked up to your computer that iTunes recognizes. This includes iPods, and also [[w:Apple TV|Apple TV]] and [[w:iPhone|iPhone]], two upcoming Apple products. Each device can be managed individually.

==Shared==
Your computer can connect to other computers connect to yours on a wired or wireless network and listen to music from their library. This music is ''streamed'' from their hard drive to yours. It is not permanently stored on your computer. Each shared library appears as a different icon.

==Playlists==
While most of the other sources are generated automatically, Playlists are customizable lists of media that will play sequentially. You can have as many or as few Playlists as you like; iTunes gives you a starter set. You can even put different Playlists into folder trees (folders can be created in the File menu), and these folders transfer to iPods they are synced to.

Smart Playlists are special Playlists that you cannot edit directly. They are similar to the Finder's Smart Folders, in both function and icon. They contain all songs that meet one (or all) of criterion set by you. Smart Playlists can also be based on albums, genre, ratings, play count, or utter randomness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you can organize and listen to your digital music, you'll need to get it into your iTunes library. The steps you  must follow vary depending on where your music is currently stored.

==From Music CDs==
If you're like most people, you've already accumulated a large collection of music on CDs. It would be a real shame if a new way to store music came along, rendering your CDs useless. The next way to store music has arrived...but keep your CDs! iTunes lets you take existing CD collection and copy the songs right to your computer with the push of a button. Follow the two steps below and you'll be up-to-date in no time.

===Step 1: Setting Up===
Before you &quot;import&quot; (copy) your collection into your Mac, you should take a moment to set up. Choose iTunes &gt; Preferences, click the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab (labeled with a gear), and then choose the &quot;Importing&quot; tab underneath.

====Picking an Encoder====
First of all, you must choose which encoder iTunes should use when importing a CD. An encoder is a set of instructions the computer uses to make a certain type of file out of a song on a CD. We recommend that you use the AAC encoder, which generates a kind of music file called... an AAC file! These files take up very little hard drive space, but have impressive sound quality. You may also prefer the more popular but less high-tech MP3 encoder, which generates MP3 files. MP3 files take up more room than similar AAC files, but you'll find that more programs support them.

{{Mac Note Box|You may think of an iPod as an &quot;MP3 Player&quot;... but it can also play all of the other file types listed here.}}

====Picking a Quality Setting====
Next you must set the quality you wish to use to import your music. The AIFF, Apple Lossless, and WAV encoders do not let you choose a quality setting, but the MP3 and AAC encoders discussed above do. It is strongly reccomended that you keep quality at or above the &quot;High Quality&quot; setting. Below this, flaws in the sound quality become apparent even without close inspection.

The &quot;Custom&quot; option is for audiophiles only, and lets you mess with variable bit rate settings, frequency filtering, etc.

===Step 2: Importing the Music===
{{Mac Trick Box|If you're about to go on an importing binge (where you will import '''all''' songs on '''every''' CD you put in your Mac's drive), there's a setting in Importing Preferences that will come in handy. It lets you choose what iTunes does when you put in a CD. The one you want to pick is &quot;Import and Eject&quot;. Now you don't have to worry about any of the instructions in the section below; simply insert a disc, and iTunes will import it and spit it right out!}}

{{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' ''Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet when you import music!'' iTunes will connect to a special website called the Gracenote CD Database, find out all of the information about your CD, and input it automatically. If you aren't connected, songs will have generic names such as &quot;Track 1&quot;, &quot;Track 2&quot;, etc, and you will have to input every title, artist, album, etc. manually.}}

Now that you have your encoder set up to your liking, it's time to do the actual importing. Insert a CD, and it will appear in the &quot;Devices&quot; section of the source list. Select it, and you should see a list of songs. If you see generic &quot;Track 1, Track 2...&quot; names, read the warning above.

You can preview any song simply by double-clicking its title. Check the little boxes next to the songs you wish to import, and make sure the songs you ''don't'' want to import ''aren't'' checked. Now press the button labeled &quot;import&quot; in the lower-righthand corner and iTunes will go through and copy the songs to your computer. This might take a few minutes.

When all the songs you picked are done importing, your CD has been successfully imported! The songs are now in your library. Please refer to the next chapter to find out what to do next!

==From your Hard Drive==
If you already have digital music files lying around your hard drive, you can add them to iTunes very easily. Simply select &quot;Music&quot;  in the Library section of the Source List. Then drag and drop files into the contents pane. Done! The file is now in your library. Note that you ''will'' have to enter the information for the file manually, because the Gracenote CD Database, as the name implies, works only for CDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organizing your Media==
iTunes was the first application to introduce Apple's famous &quot;Library/Collections&quot; method for organizing items. All music you add to iTunes is stored in a central storage area called your &quot;Library&quot;. You can then create lists of music called playlists, which include only ''links'' to songs that live in your library.

===Playlists===
To create a new blank playlist, press the + button below the sidebar.

===Smart Playlists===

==Folders==
Folders are a convenient way of keeping playlists organized. They also act like playlists themselves, becoming a sort of playlist of playlists. Selecting a folder in the sidebar will display every song in every playlist contained within it in the contents pane. With a little imagination this can prove to be a powerful feature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:5G_iPod_line.jpg|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 1 - The latest iPod models handle not only music but also photos, music videos, audiobooks, podcasts, TV shows, full-length movies, video games, and more.]]
You probably know that the iPod is Apple's uber-Popular portable digital music player. These days, you can spot the signature white earbuds everywhere you go, and you've probably know that the latest models can play movies and photos in addition to music. But can you handle using an iPod, or should you let the technically inclined have all the fun? One of the reasons the iPod is so succesful is that it's very easy to use. If you ever feel uncertain, just use this chapter.

==Determining your iPod's model==
There are six different models of Apple's flagship iPod. While their branding refers to them all simply as &quot;iPod&quot;, Apple's support team refers to them by most important new trait in each new model:

*iPod with Scroll Wheel - This iPod's wheel actually moves under your finger. It is white.
*iPod with Touch Wheel - This iPod's wheel is white and touch sensitive, but its buttons are not. It is white.
*iPod with Dock Connector - This iPod has four touch-sensitive buttons lined up above the wheel. It is white.
*iPod with Click Wheel - This iPod has its buttons ''inside'' the wheel, which is grey. It has a black and white screen. It is white (except U2 edition, see below).
*iPod with Color Display - This iPod is identical to the iPod with Click Wheel, but has a color screen. It is white (except U2 edition, see below)
*iPod with Video Playback (current) - This iPod supports video playback, and has a large color screen. It comes in black or white (plus U2 edition, see below),

{{Mac Note Box|The iPod with Video Playback, iPod with Click Wheel, and iPod with Color Display have all had special &quot;iPod U2 Special Edition&quot; models produced. These special iPods are black with a red wheel, and have the signatures of U2's members on the back, but are otherwise identical to their standard counterparts. The iPod with Video Playback also comes in black with a black wheel, but this is a standard color, and not a U2 iPod. Also note that the iPod with Color Display was at one point sold as the &quot;iPod photo&quot;.}}

In addition, Apple has produced three spin-off iPods:

*iPod mini - This iPod is made of silver, blue, pink, green, or gold-colored aluminum. It has a black-and white screen.
*iPod shuffle (current) - This iPod does not have a screen.
**First Generation - White, and about the size of a stick of gum.
**Second Generation (current) - Made of silver, blue, pink, green, or orange-colored aluminum. It has a built-in clip.
*iPod nano (current) - This iPod is as thin as a pencil and has a color screen.
**First Generation - White or black front with a mirror-like back.
**Second Generation (current) - Made of silver, blue, pink, green, or black-colored aluminum.

It is important to know your iPod's model when setting it up or using it with iTunes.

==iPods with a Screen==
The iPods With A Screen Are The iPod, iPod Video And The iPod Nano
The Very First iPod Was Released In 2003
You NEED A Computer To Use An iPod
(if you have an ipod but no software you can download iTunes Now At http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==
I suggest renaming like this:
* [[Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)]] -&gt; &quot;Microsoft Certified Professional Developer&quot;
* [[Exam 70-536]] -&gt; &quot;Microsoft Certified Professional Developer/Exam 70-536&quot;
* [[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist/Exam 70-536/Value types]] -&gt; &quot;Microsoft Certified Professional Developer/Exam 70-536/Value types&quot;

See '''[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]'''. The problem with [[Exam 70-536]] is that the module name does not start with the name of its book. Modules like [[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist/Exam 70-536/Value types]] have a different problem: now the module starts with the name of a nonexistant book, &quot;Study Guides&quot;, further it mixes colons with backslashes.

Using '''forward slashes''' like/these/will allow easier linking, for example you will be able to write &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Value types/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the Exam 70-536 page to link to the Value types page, if the names are as I suggested above.

I think that the &quot;(MCPD)&quot; is redundant, so my suggestions removed it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Language compilers are adept at pointing out most of the erroneous code in a program, however there are some errors that only become apparent when the program is executed. Consider the [[#code-listing-1|code listing 6.1]]; here, the program defines a method '''divide''' that does a simple division operation taking two integers as parameter arguments and returning the result of their division. It can safely be assumed that when the '''divide(4, 2)''' statement is called, it would return the number '''2'''. However, consider the next statement, where the program relies upon the provided command line arguments to generate a division operation. What if the user provides the number zero ('''0''') as the second argument? We all know that division  by zero is impossible, but the compiler couldn't possibly have anticipated the user providing zero as an argument.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 6.1: SimpleDivisionOperation.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleDivisionOperation {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(divide(4, 2));
    if (args.length &gt; 1) {
      int arg0 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      int arg1 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
      System.out.println(divide(arg0, arg1));
    }
  }

  public static int divide(int a, int b) {
    return a / b;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code listing 6.1'''

&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Such ''exceptional code'' that results in erroneous interpretations at program runtime usually results in errors that are called ''exceptions'' in Java. When the Java interpreter encounters an exceptional code, it halts execution and displays information about the error that occurs. This information is known as a ''stack trace''. The [[Java Programming/Stack trace|stack trace]] in the above example tells us more about the error, such as the thread &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; where the exception occurred, the type of exception &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt;, a comprehensible display message &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;/ by zero&lt;/code&gt;, and the exact methods and the line numbers where the exception may have occurred.

==Exception object==
The preceding exception could have been created explicitly by the developer as it is the case in the following code:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-2&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 6.2: SimpleDivisionOperation.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;13-14&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleDivisionOperation {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(divide(4, 2));
    if (args.length &gt; 1) {
      int arg0 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      int arg1 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
      System.out.println(divide(arg0, arg1));
    }
  }

  public static int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
      Exception myException = new ArithmeticException(&quot;You can't divide by zero!&quot;);
      throw myException;
    } else {
      return a / b;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code listing 6.2'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;
$ java SimpleDivisionOperation 1 0
2
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArithmeticException: You can't divide by zero!
at SimpleDivisionOperation.divide(SimpleDivisionOperation.java:14)
at SimpleDivisionOperation.main(SimpleDivisionOperation.java:7)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Note that when &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; equals zero, there is no return value. Instead of a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt; generated by the Java interpreter itself, it is an exception created by the coder. The result is the same. It shows you that an exception is an object. Its main particularity is that it can be thrown. A exception object must inherit from &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt;. Standard exceptions have two constructors:
# The default constructor; and,
# A constructor taking a string argument so that you can place pertinent information in the exception.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.1: Instance of an exception object with the default constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
new Exception();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-2&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.2: Instance of an &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; object by passing string in constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
new Exception(&quot;Something unexpected happened&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
This string can later be extracted using various methods, as you can see in the [[#code-listing-2|code listing 6.2]].

You can throw any type of '''Throwable''' object using the keyword {{Java:throw}}. It interrupts the method. Anything after the '''throw''' statement would not be executed, unless the ''thrown'' exception is [[#Exception handlers|handled]]. The exception object is not ''returned'' from the method, it is ''thrown'' from the method. That means that the exception object is not the return value of the method and the calling method can be interrupted too and so on and so on...

Typically, you'll throw a different class of exception for each different type of error. The information about the error is represented both inside the exception object and implicitly in the name of the exception class, so someone in the bigger context can figure out what to do with your exception. Often, the only information is the type of exception, and nothing meaningful is stored within the exception object.

=== Oracle standard exception classes ===
The box 6.1 below talks about the various exception classes within the &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt; package.
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #2a7fff; background-color:#fdfdfd;&quot;

'''Box 6.1: The Java exception classes'''

; Throwable : The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or can be thrown by the Java throw statement.
: A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message string that gives more information about the error. Finally, it can contain a cause: another throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown. The cause facility was added in release 1.4. It is also known as the chained exception facility, as the cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a &quot;chain&quot; of exceptions, each caused by another.
; Error : An Error indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to handle. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
; Exception : The class Exception and its subclasses are a form of Throwable that indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to handle. Also this is the class that a programmer may want to extend when adding business logic exceptions.
; RuntimeException : RuntimeException is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine. A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught.
| style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot; | &lt;span style=&quot;color:#2a7fff;&quot;&gt;'''Figure 6.2:''' The exception classes and their inheritance model in the JCL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Java exception classes.svg|center]]

== &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement ==
By default, when an exception is thrown, the current method is interrupted, the calling method is interrupted too and so on till the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method. A thrown exception can also be caught using a
&lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement. Below is how a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement works:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-3&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.3: Division into a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5-6, 10&quot;&gt;
int a = 4;
int b = 2;
int result = 0;
try {
  int c = a / b;
  result = c;
} catch(ArithmeticException ex) {
  result = 0;
}
return result;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The executed code lines have been highlighted. When no exception is thrown, the method flow executes the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; statement and not the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-4&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.4: Catching 'division by zero' errors.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5, 8, 10&quot;&gt;
int a = 4;
int b = 0;
int result = 0;
try {
  int c = a / b;
  result = c;
} catch(ArithmeticException ex) {
  result = 0;
}
return result;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

As there is a thrown exception at line 5, the line 6 is not executed, but the exception is caught by the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement so the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block is executed. The following code is also executed. Note that the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement takes an exception as parameter. There is a third case: when the exception is not from the same class as the parameter:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-5&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.5: Uncaught exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5&quot;&gt;
int a = 4;
int b = 0;
int result = 0;
try {
  int c = a / b;
  result = c;
} catch(NullPointerException ex) {
  result = 0;
}
return result;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It is as if there is no &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement. The exception is thrown to the calling method.

== &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks ==
A &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement can contain several &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks, to handle different exceptions in different ways. Each &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block must take a parameter of a different throwable class. A thrown object may match several &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block but only the first &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block that matches the object will be executed. A catch-block will catch a thrown exception if and only if:
* the thrown exception object is the same as the exception object specified by the catch-block.
* the thrown exception object is the subtype of the exception object specified by the catch-block.
This means that the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block order is important. As a consequence, you can't put a &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block that catches all the exception (which take a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt; as parameter) before a &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block that catches a more specific exception as the second block could never be executed.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-6&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.6: Exception handling with catch blocks.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;7, 14-16&quot;&gt;
try {
  // Suppose the code here throws any exceptions,
  // then each is handled in a separate catch block.

  int[] tooSmallArray = new int[2];
  int outOfBoundsIndex = 10000;
  tooSmallArray[outOfBoundsIndex] = 1;

  System.out.println(&quot;No exception thrown.&quot;);
} catch(NullPointerException ex) {
  System.out.println(&quot;Exception handling code for the NullPointerException.&quot;);
} catch(NumberFormatException ex) {
  System.out.println(&quot;Exception handling code for the NumberFormatException.&quot;);
} catch(ArithmeticException | IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {
  System.out.println(&quot;Exception handling code for ArithmeticException&quot;
    + &quot; or IndexOutOfBoundsException.&quot;);
} catch(Exception ex) {
  System.out.println(&quot;Exception handling code for any other Exception.&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code section 6.6'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;}}

At line 14, we use a '''multi-catch''' clause. It is available since the JDK 7. This is a combination of several '''catch''' clauses and let's you handle exceptions in a single handler while also maintaining their types. So, instead of being boxed into a parent Exception super-class, they retain their individual types.

You can also use the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Throwable&lt;/code&gt; class here, since '''Throwable''' is the parent class for the ''application-specific'' '''Exception''' classes. However, this is discouraged in Java programming circles. This is because '''Throwable''' happens to also be the parent class for the ''non-application specific'' '''Error''' classes which are not meant to be handled explicitly as they are catered for by the JVM itself.

== &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block ==

A {{Java:finally}} block can be added after the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks. A &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block is always executed, even no exception is thrown, an exception is thrown and caught or an exception is thrown and not caught. It's a place to put a code that should always be executed after an unsafe operation like a file close or a database disconnection. You can define a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block without &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block, however, in this case, it must be followed by a &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block.

== Example of handling exceptions==
Let's examine the following code:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-7&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.7: Handling exceptions.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;10, 11&quot;&gt;
public void methodA() throws SomeException {
    // Method body
}

public void methodB() throws CustomException, AnotherException {
    // Method body
}

public void methodC() {
    methodB();
    methodA();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-section-7|code section 6.7]], &lt;code&gt;methodC&lt;/code&gt; is invalid.  Because &lt;code&gt;methodA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;methodB&lt;/code&gt; pass (or throw) exceptions, &lt;code&gt;methodC&lt;/code&gt; must be prepared to handle them.  This can be handled in two ways: a {{java:try}}-{{java:catch}} block, which will handle the exception within the method and a {{java:throws}} clause which would in turn throw the exception to the caller to handle.  The above example will cause a compilation error, as Java is very strict about exception handling. So the programmer is forced to handle any possible error condition at some point.

A method can do two things with an exception: ask the calling method to handle it by the {{java:throws}} declaration or handle the exception inside the method by the {{java:try}}-{{java:catch}} block.

To work correctly, the original code can be modified in multiple ways.  For example, the following:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-8&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.8: Catching and throwing exceptions.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 2, 4-6&quot;&gt;
public void methodC() throws CustomException, SomeException {
  try {
    methodB();
  } catch(AnotherException e) {
    // Handle caught exceptions.
  }
  methodA();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
 
The &lt;code&gt;AnotherException&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;methodB&lt;/code&gt; will be handled locally, while &lt;code&gt;CustomException&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SomeException&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown to the caller to handle it. Most of the developers are embarrassed when they have to choose between the two options. This type of decision should not be taken at development time. If you are a development team, it should be discussed between all the developers in order to have a common exception handling policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Random PHP Code at Bottom of Page==
There was a random non-formatted line of PHP at the bottom of the page within the more info section. I deleted it. 



== Using AND and OR in examples ==

In my years of doing PHP programming, I have not seen anyone using the long forms 'and' and 'or'; rather, developers seem to prefer using &amp;&amp; and || (I know I do).  I think the short forms should be substituted, though both work.  Thoughts? --[[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 04:23, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

== Discussion on logic ==
Does this belong here or elsewhere? I don't think a discussion on logic pertains only to if statements; it's more of a discussion on boolean logic, which also relates to whiles, do whiles, and the boolean type. [[User:63.194.85.39|63.194.85.39]] 02:45, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

== Printing alphabet example ==
I removed the following example, since it demonstrates an example of how to use while(), not if(). [[User:217.211.181.209|217.211.181.209]] 22:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Naming Ions and Ionic Compounds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GeneralChemTOC}}
== Naming Ions and Ionic Compounds==
&lt;br&gt;Ionic compounds consist of cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions).
&lt;br&gt;The nomenclature, or naming, of ionic compounds is based on the names of the component ions. &lt;br&gt;Here are the principal naming conventions for ionic compounds, along with examples to show how they are used: 

&lt;br&gt;'''Roman Numerals'''
&lt;br&gt;A Roman numeral in parentheses, followed by the name of the element, is used for elements that can form more than one positive ion.

This is usually seen with metals.
&lt;br&gt;Fe 2+ Iron (II)
&lt;br&gt;Fe 3+ Iron (III)
&lt;br&gt;Cu + Copper (I)
&lt;br&gt;Cu 2+ Copper (II)

&lt;br&gt;'''-ous and -ic'''
&lt;br&gt;Although Roman numerals are used to denote the ionic charge of cations, it is still common to see and use the endings -ous or -ic. These endings are added to the Latin name of the element (e.g., stannous/stannic for tin) to represent the ions with lesser or greater charge, respectively.&lt;br&gt;The Roman numeral naming convention has wider appeal because many ions have more than two valences.
&lt;br&gt;Fe 2+ Ferrous
&lt;br&gt;Fe 3+ Ferric
&lt;br&gt;Cu + Cuprous
&lt;br&gt;Cu 2+ Cupric

&lt;br&gt;'''-ide'''
&lt;br&gt;The -ide ending is added to the name of a monoatomic anion of an element.
&lt;br&gt;H - Hydride
&lt;br&gt;F - Fluoride
&lt;br&gt;O 2- Oxide
&lt;br&gt;S 2- Sulphide
&lt;br&gt;N 3- Nitride
&lt;br&gt;P 3- Phosphide

&lt;br&gt;'''-ite and -ate'''
&lt;br&gt;Some polyatomic anions contain oxygen. These anions are called oxyanions. When an element forms two oxyanions, the one with less oxygen is given a name ending in -ite and the one with more oxgyen is given a name that ends in -ate.
&lt;br&gt;NO2 - Nitrite
&lt;br&gt;NO3 - Nitrate
&lt;br&gt;SO3 2- Sulphite
&lt;br&gt;SO4 2- Sulphate

&lt;br&gt;'''hypo- and per-'''
&lt;br&gt;In the case where there is a series of four oxyanions, the hypo- and per- prefixes are used in conjunction with the -ite and -ate suffixes. The hypo- and per- prefixes indicate less oxygen and more oxygen, respectively.
&lt;br&gt;ClO - Hypochlorite
&lt;br&gt;ClO2 - Chlorite
&lt;br&gt;ClO3 - Chlorate
&lt;br&gt;ClO4 - Perchlorate

&lt;br&gt;'''bi- and di- hydrogen'''
&lt;br&gt;Polyatomic anions sometimes gain one or more H+ ions to form anions of a lower charge. These ions are named by adding the word hydrogen or dihydrogen in front of the name of the anion. It is still common to see and use the older naming convention in which the prefix bi- is used to indicate the addition of a single hydrogen ion.
&lt;br&gt;HCO3 - Hydrogen carbonate or bicarbonate
&lt;br&gt;HSO4 - Hydrogen sulfate or bisulfate
&lt;br&gt;H2PO4 - Dihydrogen phosphate

== Naming Binary Acids ==
Binary acids are compounds containing Hydrogen and an anion (non-metal ion). 
&lt;p&gt;When these compounds are in solution in water, oxonium ions (H3O+) are formed giving rise to the properties that we associate with 'acids'.
&lt;p&gt;In general, when the binary acid is not in solution the name is as follows:
'Hydrogen' followed by the anion name ending in '-ide'.
&lt;p&gt;e.g. Hydrogen chloride

&lt;p&gt;When the binary acid is in solution (aq) the name is as follows:
'Hydro-' followed by the anion name ending in '-ic' then add the word 'acid' to the end.
&lt;p&gt;e.g. Hydrochloric acid

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
An '''array''' is similar to a table of objects or primitive types, keyed by index. You may have noticed the strange parameter of the default &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method (&lt;code&gt;String[] args&lt;/code&gt;) since the beginning of the book. It is an array. Let's handle this parameter:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-15&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.15: The default array parameter.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
public class ArrayExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; ++i) {
      System.out.println(&quot;Argument #&quot; + (i + 1) + &quot;: &quot; + args[i]);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Console for Code listing 3.15'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java ArrayExample This is a test
Argument #1 This
Argument #2 is
Argument #3 a
Argument #4 test
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

In the [[#code-listing-15|code listing 3.15]], the array is &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;. It is an array of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; objects (here those objects are the words that have been typed by the user at the program launching). At line 4, One contained object is accessed using its index in the array. You can see that its value is printed on the standard output. Note that the strings have been put in the array with the right order.

== Fundamentals ==

In Java, an array is an object. This object has a given type for the contained primitive types or objects (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, ...). An array can be declared in several ways:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-52&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.52: Array declarations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int[] array1 = null;
int array2[] = null;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Those syntaxes are identical but the first one is recommended. It can also be instantiated in several ways:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-53&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.53: Array instantiations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
array1 = new int[10];
array1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
At line 1, we instantiate an array of 10 items with non-initialized items. At line 2, we instantiate an array of 10 given items. It will each be given an index according to its order. We can know the size of the array using the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; attribute:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-54&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.54: The array size.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
int nbItems = 10;
Object[] array3 = new Object[nbItems];
System.out.println(array3.length);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for Code section 3.54'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
10
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Arrays are allocated at runtime, so the specified size in an array creation expression may be a variable (rather than a constant expression as in C). However, the size of an instantiated array never changes. If you need to change the size, you have to create a new instance. Items can be accessed by their index. Beware! The first index is 0:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-55&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.55: The array indexes.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-4&quot;&gt;
char[] array4 = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
System.out.println(array4[2]);
array4[4] = 'z';
System.out.println(array4[4]);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for Code section 3.55'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
c
z
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

If you attempt to access to a too high index or negative index, you will get an &lt;code&gt;ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Question 3.20''': Consider the following code:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-20&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.20: Question20.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Question20 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[] listOfWord = {&quot;beggars&quot;, &quot;can't&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;choosers&quot;};
    System.out.println(listOfWord[1]);
    System.out.println(listOfWord[listOfWord.length-1]);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

What will be printed in the standard output?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XCode|1='''Output for Question 3.20'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
can't
choosers
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
Indexes start at 0. So the index 1 point at the second string (&lt;code&gt;can't&lt;/code&gt;). There are 4 items so the size of the array is 4. Hence the item pointed by the index 3 is the last one (&lt;code&gt;choosers&lt;/code&gt;).
{{Hidden end}}
{{Hidden end}}

==Two-Dimensional Arrays==
Actually, there is no two-dimensional arrays in Java. However, an array can contain any class of object, including an array:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-56&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.56: Two-dimensional arrays.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[][] twoDimArray = {{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;},
                          {&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;},
                          {&quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;o&quot;}};

int[][] twoDimIntArray = {{ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4},
                          {10, 11, 12, 13, 14},
                          {20, 21, 22, 23, 24}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
It's not exactly equivalent to two-dimensional arrays because the size of the sub-arrays may vary. The sub-array reference can even be null. Consider:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-57&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.57: Weird two-dimensional array.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[][] weirdTwoDimArray = {{&quot;10&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;},
                               null,
                               {&quot;20&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;24&quot;}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Note that the length of a two-dimensional array is the number of one-dimensional arrays it contains. In the above example, &lt;code&gt;weirdTwoDimArray.length&lt;/code&gt; is 3, whereas &lt;code&gt;weirdTwoDimArray[2].length&lt;/code&gt; is 5.

In the [[#code-section-58|code section 3.58]], we defined an array that has three elements, each element contains an array having 5 elements. We could create the array having the 5 elements first and use that one in the initialize block.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-58&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.58: Included array.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[] oneDimArray = {&quot;00&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;02&quot;, &quot;03&quot;, &quot;04&quot;};
String[][] twoDimArray = {oneDimArray,
                          {&quot;10&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, &quot;14&quot;},
                          {&quot;20&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;24&quot;}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.21''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-21&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.21: The alphabet.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[][] alphabet = {{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;},
                          {&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;},
                          {&quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;o&quot;},
                          {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;},
                          {&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;},
                          {&quot;z&quot;}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Print the whole alphabet in the standard output.
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-21&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.21: Answer21.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;10-14&quot;&gt;
public class Answer21 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[][] alphabet = {{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;},
                          {&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;},
                          {&quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;o&quot;},
                          {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;},
                          {&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;},
                          {&quot;z&quot;}};

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; alphabet.length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j &lt; alphabet[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.println(alphabet[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will be the indexes of the main array and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; will be the indexes of all the sub-arrays. We have to first iterate on the main array. We have to read the size of the array. Then we iterate on each sub-array. We have to read the size of each array as it may vary. Doing so, we iterate on all the sub-array items using the indexes. All the items will be read in the right order.

&lt;h1&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/h1&gt;
::''For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only born Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not be subject to death but have eternal Life''.

==Life==
'''Jesus Christ''', the founder of Christianity and prophet of Islam, was born in Bethlehem, Judea, according to the generally accepted chronology in the year of Rome 750, that is, 4 BC. This apparent discrepancy in date is due to an error that was made when the Christian calendar originated with Dionysius in 556 AD. He fixed upon the year of Rome 754 as that in which Christ was born. Later information proved beyond a doubt that this date should have been 750, which gives the birth of Christ four years before the beginning of the Christian era according to the calendar of Dionysius. The mother of Jesus was Mary, who was probably a descendant of David. Her husband, Joseph, was also a descendant of the same family. The birth of the holy child occurred in a manger at a public inn in Bethlehem, where Joseph had gone to be registered in his place of origin in accordance with the Roman census and Jewish law relating to taxation. The miraculous conditions connected with his birth to the Virgin Mary prove to the satisfaction of most followers of Christianity that Jesus was of divine origin. His parents remained at Bethlehem for some time. The infant Savior was circumcised on the eighth day, and at the end of the fortieth day he was presented in the Temple, and his mother, according to the Jewish law, made the customary offers for her purification. Soon after this he was visited by wise men, or Magi, from the East, who claimed to have been guided to the spot where he was by the miraculous appearance of a star. Inquiries of these men as to where the child who was to be king of the Jews was born, led Herod (at that time ruler of Judea under Rome) to cause all the male children in Bethlehem under three years of age to be put to death. Joseph, however, was warned by an angel, and he fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, where he remained an uncertain length of time, until after Herod's death, when the holy family returned and took up their residence at Nazareth. There, Jesus lived and grew to maturity, and because of that connection he is frequently called the Nazarene.

Of the boyhood and youth of Jesus almost nothing is known. The only authentic account given is that of his appearance in the Temple when twelve years of age (Luke 2: 46-50). All legends concerning his life previous to his public ministry are without foundation, but it is probable that he remained with the family at Nazareth and engaged in the same work as his father, who was a carpenter. The public ministry of Jesus was preceded by the preaching of John the Baptist, his cousin, who proclaimed the coming of the kingdom of God and called men to repentance. Jesus was pointed out by John as the Son of God, and two of John's disciples from that time became his followers. He was baptized by John, when his divine nature was manifested by the miraculous appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove and by a voice from heaven saying, &quot;This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot; After the initial meeting, his new followers declared Jesus, the Christ, or the expected Jewish Messiah. Following the baptism, Jesus retired into the wilderness of Judea, where he was subjected to various temptations. His first public appearance was at the marriage in Cana of Galilee, where he performed the miracle of turning water into wine. He then visited Capernaum, affirmed the apostles Andrew, Peter, James and John nearby and later appeared in Jerusalem at the time of the Passover to reveal his majesty and power by cleansing the Temple of those who were changing money and selling animals for sacrifice. He received an inquisitive teacher of Israel at night by the name of Nicodemus and pointed out the way to everlasting life. His works and teachings immediately aroused the opposition of the leaders of the Jews because the news was spreading over Judea that Jesus' disciples were baptizing even more new adherents than John the Baptist and, finding that this work in Judea was to be rejected, he departed into Galilee. During the remainder of the first year of his ministry he preached at Nazareth, where his own townspeople attempted to cast him over a precipice because of his teachings; then at Capernaum again. After the calling of his disciples he began his first circuit through Galilee. During this time occurred the Sermon on the Mount; also the Sermon in the Boat, which was followed by the miraculous draught of fishes. Near the close of this year he called Levi, or Matthew, who became one of his most devoted followers.

The second year's ministry began with the attendance upon the Passover at Jerusalem and the healing of the lame man at the Pool of Bethesda. Following this were several other miracles, followed by discussions with the Pharisees and other leaders of the Jews, in which Jesus continued (Matthew 9: 12-13) to set forth his gospel, or good news, calling for repentance and the forgiveness of sins, and showed clearly the difference between this new dispensation and the underlying principles of the Jewish law and the ceremonials largely practiced at that time. This increased the already growing opposition and was followed by the sending out of the twelve disciples to promulgate his teaching concerning entry into the kingdom of heaven. After the visit to Jerusalem, Jesus began his second general circuit through Galilee. This circuit was characterized by the performing of a number of miracles and the relating of some of the most important parables in the Gospels, among them those of the sower, of the tares, of the mustard seed, of the leaven and of the hid treasure. This was followed by the third general circuit, during which occurred the death of John the Baptist, the feeding of the five thousand and the walking on water.

The third and last year of Jesus' ministry was by far the most important with many discourses, parables, and miracles recorded, the year which saw the Transfiguration, curing of an epileptic boy, his appearance at the Feast of Tabernacles, sending out the seventy to prepare the way with all power over demons and disease, his calling the fallen Prince of this world to account, and the raising of Lazarus which so aroused the envy of the Jews that they resolved upon putting him to death, while just before the events of the last week leading up to the crucifixion, generally known as the Passion Week, he stopped everything to welcome the little children into his presence, for such is the kingdom of God. After which he warned about the dangers of the accumulation of wealth, and then gave a prediction of his own death and resurrection for the third time. As his passion drew near, Jesus prepared to eat the last Passover with his disciples. On the first day of the week, which is still remembered as Palm Sunday, he made his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem as the long awaited but unique Son of David. During the next two days he spent his time in and around the city, cursing a barren fig-tree, cleansing the Temple, predicting the destruction of Jerusalem and the nation, sealing the judgment to come with separation of the sheep from the goats and delivering discourses in which he used a number of parables, in particular, those conveyed in private to his disciples to answer the ultimate questions concerning his mission. These things accomplished, he retired to Bethany. On Wednesday he gave a warning of the betrayal by one of his own, and on the following day in a specially prepared upper room in the holy city he ate the last Passover with his disciples assuring them that after his departure he would come again to usher in his kingdom and during the discourse proclaimed the wine and the bread a lasting remembrance of the new covenant established that evening, additionally, a new commandment was directed to his disciples: that you love one another as I have loved you, for greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. After the Passover meal, having been betrayed by Judas, he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, brought before the high priest Caiaphas, condemned by the Jewish Sanhedrin for claims of divinity (Mark 14: 62) and early on Friday morning sent before Pilate, the Roman governor of Jerusalem, in order that the sentence of death might be legally confirmed, which led to the requisite punishment of flagellation and further humiliation. By Pilate he was released to the Jews, by whose compliance he was crucified on that day. Late in the afternoon, Jesus cried out, “It is finished,” and yielded up the spirit. The Sabbath approached demanding his body be taken down from the cross and prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. The tomb was one belonging to this same Joseph, a member of the Sanhedrin, a man of considerable means, and there the body of Jesus was buried that same day in a garden close to Golgotha, the place of the skull, the site of the crucifixion.

==Resurrection==
On the morning of the first day of the week, or the third day after his death, Mary Magdalene and other women in charge of the spices hastened to the tomb in order to complete the work of embalming the body, but they found the stone rolled away from the door of the tomb and the place where Jesus had lain occupied by an angel, who told them that Jesus had risen. After his resurrection on that Sunday which would later be celebrated as Easter Sunday, Jesus remained on earth for forty days, during which time he appeared eleven times to his disciples and followers, the instance (John 20: 27-28) of a doubting Thomas tempered all unbelief. Jesus commissioned his disciples to continue his earthly ministry and at the last gathering on the Mount of Olives he ascended into heaven and was received by a cloud out of their sight. The disciples stood there  awe-strucken with eyes skyward after the ascension, even as, heavenly messengers in attendance (Acts 1: 11) announce his return would be in like manner, evidently, at the end of the age. They returned to the upper room in Jerusalem as instructed and devoted themselves to worship and fellowship together in the common calling while planning for the future, with earnest [[../Prayer|prayer]], blessing God continually. Their numbers increased to 120 believers as they awaited the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, or Advocate, as promised by the risen Savior. 

Various attempts have been made to explain away the resurrection of Christ. There is the supposition, (1) of fraud; that, according to the statement of the Jews, the disciples stole the body and then published the story that their Lord was risen; (2) that Jesus had not really died on the cross; that His apparent death was only a swoon, from which He afterward recovered; (3) that there had been no real resurrection, but that the disciples had been deceived by visionary appearances or hallucinations; (4) that the assertion of the resurrection was originally allegorical. In Acts, chapter 5, the words of one of the most learned Jews of the time, Gamaliel, are more to the point, “put forth [the apostles] a little space... for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught: but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it.” Thus, with regard to the significance of Christ's resurrection, to Christians it is the crowning event, evidence of the divine character of His mission and His atonement for the sins of the world.


===Christianity===
The great commandment according to the gospel was love the Lord your God with all your heart and the second, similar to it, love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus reinforced his teaching by miracles and by parables. His miracles were evidently for the purpose of convincing the people of his divine origin and power. They were thirty-five in number and ranged in importance from the turning of water into wine to the raising of the dead to life. Most of them were connected with the healing of disease and a majority of those contained a demonstration of the petitioner's faith, and with few exceptions all of them were for the welfare of those upon whom or in whose favor they were wrought. The parables, forceful maxims of a metaphorical nature such as the Pearl of Great Price, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan, were thirty-three in number and contain the best illustrations of moral and religious truth to be found anywhere in literature. So broad is their application that the truths which they teach are accepted by the non-Christian as well as by the Christian world.

&lt;big&gt; '''Athuga''' &lt;/big&gt;
** When talking to or about someone, gender is an important part of Icelandic conversation and speech. For example, when greeting a man, you must say '''Komdu sæll, blessaður''' or '''sæll'''. To a woman, you would say '''Komdu sæl, blessuð,''' or '''sæl'''
** If the situation is informal, you can just say '''Hæ''' or '''Bæ''' regardless of gender
** When there is a group of people of mixed gender, you could say '''Komið þið sæl og blessuð'''
** When you want to welcome someone, you also must take into account the gender of the listener. If you are welcoming a man, you say '''Velkominn''', if a woman, you say '''Velkomin'''. If you are welcoming a group of people, you also would say '''Velkomin'''
** Although '''Allt í lagi''' means ''okay'' (Ok!), you will of course also hear '''ókei''', said the same as the English ''okay''
** As you may have noticed, '''Góða daginn''' (or '''Góðan dag''') means both ''good morning'' and ''good afternoon''. Icelanders use this greeting from the early morning hours (after midnight) until slightly before dinner time. In Iceland, since there is sunlight almost 24 hours in the summer months and about 4 hours in the winter months, using these greetings based on how it looks outside is not a good reference
** Remember that the letter &lt;big&gt;Æ&lt;/big&gt; is pronounced like the English ''i'' in ''m'''i'''ne''. Refer back to the '''[[Icelandic/Alphabet and Pronunciation|Alphabet and Pronunciation]]''' page if you are struggling with reading words in Icelandic. The phonetic pronunciation will go away after this lesson, since Icelandic words are pronounced as they are read. Therefore, it is essential that by the end of this lesson, you are comfortable with the Icelandic alphabet and how it is pronounced

== Málfræði (Grammar) ==

=== Nafnorð (Nouns) ===
A noun is a person, place, or thing. It has the same function in Icelandic. Nouns in Icelandic, unlike English, are reflected by their case, gender, and number. There are 4 grammatical cases in Icelandic (Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive) which we will talk about individually.

==== Kyn (Gender) ====
This might seem odd for an English speaker, a word in a language having gender? There are many languages that do indeed give their nouns gender. In Icelandic, we have three genders, masculine, feminine, and neutral nouns. When learning new vocabulary, it is important that you establish its gender whilst you memorise it. This will come in great importance when declining the noun and using it. There are some simple rules to determine if a noun is masculine, feminine, or neutral:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
| width=&quot;33%&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align:top; border: 2px solid #4F94CD; color: #000; background-color: #63D1F4; padding:3px 3px 3px 3px;&quot;|
&lt;big&gt;'''The word is masculine if:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''ur'''&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''i'''&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''nn'''&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''ll'''&lt;/big&gt; (although sometimes it might be neuter''
* ''the word refers to a male person, otherwise known as natural gender''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt; '''some masculine nouns:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/br&gt;maður &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; stóll &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; fáni &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; banki &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; strákur &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; bíll&lt;/center&gt;
| width=&quot;33%&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align:top; border: 2px solid #4F94CD; color: #000; background-color: #F7B3DA; padding:3px 3px 3px 3px;&quot;|
&lt;big&gt;'''The word is feminine if:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''a'''&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''ing'''&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''un'''&lt;/big&gt;''
* ''sometimes a feminine word might not even have an ending''
* ''the word refers to a female person, otherwise known as natural gender''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt; '''some feminine nouns:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/br&gt;kona &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; flugvél &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; stöð &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; spurning &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; stelpa &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; verslun &lt;/center&gt;
| width=&quot;33%&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align:top; border: 2px solid #4F94CD; color: #000; background-color: #E3E3E3; padding:3px 3px 3px 3px;&quot;|
&lt;big&gt;'''The word is neutral if:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* ''the word ends in &lt;big&gt;'''i'''&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;'''ll'''&lt;/big&gt;  (although most of the time words ending with '''i''' or '''ll''' will be masculine)''
* ''the last vowel in the word has an accent''
* ''sometimes a neutral word might not even have an ending''
* ''foreign words most of the time would become neuter when „Icelandicised“

&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt; '''some neutral nouns:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/br&gt;barn &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; land &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ball &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; herbergi &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; tré &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; bakarí &lt;/center&gt;

==== Greinir (Articles) ====
An article is a word that combines with a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun. In English, articles are ''the, a,'' and ''an''. In Icelandic, there is no indefinite article, meaning there is no way to say ''a'' or ''an'' in Icelandic. Therefore, the word '''maður''' could mean ''man'' or ''a man''. You determine the proper translation by the context, which isn't as difficult as it might seem at first. 

There is however a definite article (''the''). Unlike English though, Icelandic has postfixed definite articles, meaning the article attaches itself to the end of a word to make it definite. For example, in English, you would say ''the man'', whilst in Icelandic we say ''manthe''. This might be confusing at first, but in time you will get used to this. Let's take a look how we form the definite article in Icelandic.

* &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt; Karlkyn (Masculine) &lt;big&gt;'''-inn, -nn'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt; Kvenkyn (Feminine) &lt;big&gt;'''-in, -n'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt; Hvorukyn (Neuter) &lt;big&gt;'''-ið, -ð'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


''Examples:'' &lt;p&gt;
'''Maður → Maðurinn''' - Man → The man &lt;/br&gt;
'''Kona → Konan''' - Woman → The woman &lt;/br&gt;
'''Barn → Barnið''' - Child → The child &lt;/br&gt;
'''Barnið er strákur''' - The child is a boy &lt;p&gt;

Allt í lagi? Skilurðu? (Do you understand?). Pretty soon we will be able to construct simple sentences.

==== Nefnifall (Nominative Case) ====
The Nominative case, or '''Nefnifall''', is the first case we will talk about. This case also exists in English, though we do not think about it when we use it. This case represents a noun that acts as the subject of the sentence. It is also used in equivelent sentences, such as sentences which use the copula verb ''to be''. (For example: I am a man). The nominative form of the noun is also the dictionary form. The words you have just learnt in this chapter are all in the nominative ('''strákur, stelpa, maður, kona'''). Examine this chart and examples below:

&lt;center&gt; [[Image:Nominative case explanation.PNG]] &lt;/center&gt;



=== Fornöfn (Pronouns) ===
Pronouns are nouns which substitute other nouns in a certain phrase or sentence. For example, in English pronouns are ''I, you, he, she, it''. In Icelandic they are:

&lt;center&gt;
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Icelandic !!width=&quot;20px&quot;| !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Icelandic 
|-
| I || Ég || || We || Við
|-
| You || Þú || || You (plural) || Þið
|-
| He ||  Hann || || They (masculine) || Þeir
|-
| She || Hún || || They (feminine) || Þær
|-
| It || Það || || They (neuter) || Þau
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

* Note that when you have a group of males, you use '''Þeir''' and if you have a group of females then you would use '''Þær'''. If the group is of mixed gender, then use '''Þau'''.

=== Tengisögnin &quot;að vera&quot; (The copula &quot;to be&quot;) ===
The most important verb in any language is the verb &quot;to be&quot;. It is important to know how to say things like ''I am, you are, he is, she is'' and so on. The following table is a verb conjugation. Conjugating verbs is an important part of learning a language. We can't just say ''I to be, you to be, he to be''. We have to conjugate a verb in order to find the appropriate form for the adjective. First we will show you how it is done in English, than the Icelandic equivelent. Remember your pronouns?

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|20px]] '''TO BE''' [[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|20px]]

&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;center&gt;

|-
| Þú || ert || || Þið || eruð
|-
| Hann, Hún, Það ||  er || || Þeir, Þær, Þau|| eru
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

To make a question, you do the same as you would do in English, flip the verb and subject around. ('''Er ég?''' = ''Am I?'', '''Er hann?''' = ''Is he?''). You will also commonly see '''Ert þú''' combined into '''Ertu'''. Don't be put off by this, '''ertu''' simply means ''are you'', although '''ert þú''' is also correct and a bit more formal. 

Now that we know the simple structure to construct an Icelandic sentence, try to figure out the translations of the following. Highlight the space next to it to see if you are correct.

* '''Ég er strákur''' [ &lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt; I am a boy &lt;/span&gt; ]
* '''Hann er maður''' [ &lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt; He is a man &lt;/span&gt; ]
* '''Er hún konan?''' [ &lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt; Is she the woman? &lt;/span&gt; ]

== Menning (Culture) ==
=== Siðir (Customs) ===
[[Image:Politeness - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 16619.png|right|200px]]
In most European languages, there are two forms of ''you'', a polite form and a familiar form. In Icelandic, '''þú''' is used for informal and formal situations. Formality is more or less similar to how English speakers use formality. It tends to be in your voice and the type of language you use when addressing someone in a formal situation. Though whilst English has words such as ''Mister, Misses,'' and ''Miss'', Icelandic tends to address people by their first names. The Icelandic equivalents are '''Herra, Frú,''' and '''Ungfrú''', but these are seldom used. If you ask someone '''Hvað heitir þú?''' (''What is your name?''), they will tell you their first name, first name and middle name, or even their full name. It is perfectly all right to call them by their first name, even if the situation is formal. Icelandic schoolchildren, believe it or not, would call their teachers by their first name without including '''Herra''' or '''Frú'''. 

When meeting someone for the first time in Iceland, it is proper to shake their hand. When two women meet for the first time, they might exchange a kiss on the cheek. When meeting for the first time, it is polite to use the greeting '''Blessaður''' or '''Komdu sæll''' for a male, and '''Blessuð''' or '''Komdu sæl''' for a woman. The younger generation would tend to ignore formalities upon meeting, and might even say '''Hæ''' or '''Halló''' for an introductory meeting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==In the Beginning==

There are many theories about the beginning of the Universe as we know it. Although these theories differ in a variety of ways, but they all have some underlying fundamental truths, at least for the realm of understanding.

Each religion has its own beliefs, most of which are essentially the same. That is that some Entity created the Universe, for the Christian's it is God but there is also Buddha, Mohammad etc. Science also has had several theories on the beginning of the Universe. There are many beliefs and theories ranging from simple stories related to children, to more sophisticated theories related by philosophers and scholars. So where did the Universe come from?

&quot;In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.&quot; According to the King James Bible, the Earth was created by a supreme being known as God. This idea is present in most of the other religions of the world as well, the name is different from religion to religion, but the concept is the same. In every religion, the Universe is created, spoken, molded, sculpted, breathed etc into existence by some supreme being. It is a common theme, as all religions need a starting point, a place which man can begin to understand their surroundings. Because man has a limited capacity for thought and an even more limited capacity for understanding, it becomes quite hard for them to understand the overwhelming concepts of the Universe.

For most people to believe that the Universe has existed forever and will exit forever is a concept that they can not grasp. Science is a little easier to understand because it is based on facts and not merely beliefs. Though in many cases the facts are nothing more than beliefs that have not been proven or not proven. For example it was once thought that the Earth was flat and that if you sailed too far in any direction you would simply fall off. It was a theory that was proven incorrect. It was once thought that the Earth was the center of the Solar System, and in fact the Universe. That too was proven to be incorrect, until now. Science is no different than any religion of the world in this regard, because just as all religions are given words from the supreme being to guide them, these words are always unclear and subject to interpretation. Science too is subject to interpretations. 

With every religion in the world, the Words of God can and many times do have different meanings to different people. They are words written a long time ago to help guide the people of that day to become the people of today, and to guide the people of today into becoming the people of tomorrow. With that in mind, you must take a look at how society changes over the ages. All aspects of life change over the course of time, either because our morality has changed, or our morality has changed because of the changes in the way we dress, the way we maintain our appearance, even the way we work and play. Even our language changes as words are added through slang, and colloquial phrases are removed because they are outdated. The religious writings of long ago have all but been redefined through various translations and editing. To make the writings easier for the current reader to understand man has found it necessary to change certain aspects with respect to the beliefs of that day. As society changes so too changes what society believes is moral. With each revision and with each translation new morality is inserted into the writings to coincide with the moral beliefs of the day.

== '''What is the Universe''' ==

By definition, the Universe is Space and everything within that space. All matter, all energy, all life, and all consciousness make up the Universe as we know it. Most scientific minds see the whole of space as a series of Universe's know as a Multiverse. This is actually a logical way of thinking of the Universe, since Einstein's theory of relativity states that the laws of Physics are the same for everybody in the Universe, but that the perception of those laws are different based upon the observers relation to the Universe itself.


== '''Are there more than one Universe''' ==

Through modern technology we have been able to photograph with an electron microscope the essence of the atom. The image is not truly a photo of the atom, merely the energy emitted by the atom. Using this technology it is possible to 'photograph' the fluctuating states of the atoms and witness their relationship to other atoms and space in general. We now have proof that atoms exist simultaneously in several locations at the same instance. This startling discovery leads to the conclusion that there are an unlimited number of Universe's, known as the Multiverse. It is this theory that every atom exists in every Universe simultaneously, and more that the same atom can exist in different states in each Universe.

== '''How are Time and Space Linked''' ==

It has been said that time and space are linked. Time is difficult to describe, but is required for space to even exist. Space is a little easier to describe because we see space with our own eyes, but space can not be described properly without the use of time in the description. Everything in space occupies a specific place at a specific time. Simply put, we travel through space and time, and space and time travel through us. It is a dance that has been going on in the Universe since time and space began, and will continue for eternity. So then how are time and space linked? Can one exist without the other? Is there some other cosmic force that links time and space? Are the stars random? Does life exist because we imagine it? Are the rules of the Universe such as the speed of light, gravity, sound, etc. constant or varied by perspective.

The great minds of the past have asked these questions and many more, for centuries. The answers are not clear cut however; many times there seem to be multiple answers for the same question, seemingly contradictory answers to the questions. The biggest controversy in understanding is religion verses science. The very existence of life is apparently in controversy.

== '''Why am I the Center of the Universe?''' ==

Space is vast, very very vast. Space it is said goes on forever. That simply means that there is no boundary between space and something on the other side. This is a hard concept for most people to understand, since they are used to being in something such as a room or a building which has walls as a boundary. When we are in something there is a boundary that holds the &quot;in&quot; part, and there is always something on the other side of this boundary. Yet we are in space and there is no boundary. There can be no boundary, just by the very essence of what the Universe is. If you are in this room for example and the boundaries are the walls, ceiling and floor, then if you made a hole in them and went through the boundary, you would still be in 3 dimensional space. You would just be changing the boundary you are in, because now you are in a different room with different walls.

By definition a boundary holds something in, and separates that which is in from that which is out. To say that the Universe has a boundary is to say that something exists out side of this boundary. If that were the case, then this area outside its boundary would have its own boundary. This would continue to infinity. It is true that there are boundaries in space such as the afore mentioned rooms, but there are boundaries on other scales as well. A drop of water for example has a boundary between the water inside and the air outside. A diamond has a boundary between the compressed carbon and the silver or gold holding it, which also has a boundary between the ring and the finger that the ring is on. Even on a molecular scale, the atoms have boundaries between the nucleus and the electrons. As you increase the macroscopic view of the universe, the boundaries become fewer, but the Universe can ultimately never be contained. 

That said space continues on forever in all directions. If you could see far enough when you looked you would see infinity on your right, and infinity on your left. Since infinity equals infinity, you are directly in the center no matter where in the Universe you are standing. You are the center of the Universe, and similarly time will exist for eternity, as it already has so we are at the center of time.

It is all a matter of perspective. As Einstein developed the theory of relativity, the key to the matter (if you will pardon the pun), all matter, is perception or perspective. All of the laws of the Universe follow the same guidelines for every viewer in the Universe. To rephrase for clarity, just as we are at the center of the Universe and the center of Time, we could also say that we are on top of the world. The reason this is true is simply that we are on the surface of a sphere which by definition (of a sphere) is an object that all lines perpendicular to all of the tangent planes travel through the center of the object. Much like a circle is described as a two dimensional object whereby all of the lines perpendicular to all tangent lines travel through the center of the object. If therefore you are standing on one of these tangent planes, up would be everything on your side of the plane and down would be everything on the other, or you would be on the top side of the plane on which you are standing. Simply put, in Space there is no up or down, no left or right, and no front or back. There is only the direction you chose to call up, down, left, right, front or back. Your up could just as well be someone else’s left or right, front or back. It is merely a matter of perspective.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Statistics/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;


== Experiments ==
In a experiment the experimenter applies 'treatments' to groups of subjects.  For example the experimenter may give one drug to group 1 and a different drug or a placebo to group 2, to determine the effectiveness of the drug.  This is what differentiates an 'experiment' from an 'observational study'.

Scientists try to identify cause-and-effect relationships because this kind of knowledge is especially powerful, for example, drug A cures disease B.  Various methods exist for detecting cause-and-effect relationships.  An experiment is a method that most clearly shows cause-and-effect because it isolates and manipulates a single variable, in order to clearly show its effect.  Experiments almost always have two distinct variables: First, an independent variable (IV) is manipulated by an experimenter to exist in at least two levels (usually &quot;none&quot; and &quot;some&quot;). Then the experimenter measures the second variable, the dependent variable (DV).

A simple example:

Suppose the experimental hypothesis that concerns the scientist is that reading a Wiki will enhance knowledge. Notice that the hypothesis is really an attempt to state a causal relationship like, &quot;if you read a Wiki, then you will have enhanced knowledge.&quot; The antecedent condition (reading a Wiki) causes the consequent condition (enhanced knowledge).  Antecedent conditions are always IVs and consequent conditions are always DVs in experiments. So the experimenter would produce two levels of Wiki reading (none and some, for example) and record knowledge. If the subjects who got no Wiki exposure had less knowledge than those who were exposed to Wikis, it follows that the difference is caused by the IV.

So, the reason scientists utilize experiments is that it is the only way to determine causal relationships between variables. Experiments tend to be artificial because they try to make both groups identical with the single exception of the levels of the independent variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Statistics/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Observational Studies ==
The most primitive method of understanding the laws of nature utilizes observational studies. Basically, a researcher goes out into the world and looks for variables that are associated with one another. Notice that, unlike experiments, in an observational study the Independent Variables are not manipulated by the experimenter. The independent variable could be something like &quot;smoking&quot;.  It would be unethical and probably impossible to do an experiment where one randomly selected group is assigned to smoke and another group is assigned to the non-smoking group.  Therefore, in order do determine the health effects of smoking on humans, an observational study is more appropriate than and experiment.  The health of smokers and non-smokers would be compared without the experimenter assigning treatment.

Some of the foundations of modern scientific thought are based on observational research. Charles Darwin, for example, based his explanation of evolution entirely on observations he made. Case studies, where individuals are observed and questioned to determine possible causes of problems, are a form of observational research that continues to be popular today. In fact, every time you see a physician he or she is performing observational science.

There is a problem in observational science though --- it cannot ever identify causal relationships because even though two variables are related both might be caused by a third, unseen, variable. Since the underlying laws of nature are assumed to be causal laws, observational findings are generally regarded as less compelling than experimental findings.

The key way to identify experimental studies is that they involve an intervention such as the administration of a drug to one group of patients and a placebo to another group.  Observational studies only collect data and make comparisons. 

Medicine is an intensively studied discipline, and not all phenomenon can be studies by experimentation due to obvious ethical or logistical restrictions. 
 

*'''Case series''': These are purely observational, consisting of reports of a series of similar medical cases. For example, a series of patients might be reported to suffer from bone abnormalities as well as immunodeficiencies.  This association may not be significant, occurring purely by chance.  On the other hand, the association may point to a mutation in common pathway affecting both the skeletal system and the immune system.   
*'''Case-Control''':  This involves an observation of a disease state, compared to normal healthy controls. For example, patients with lung cancer could be compared with their otherwise healthy neighbors.  Using neighbors limits bias introduced by demographic variation.  The cancer patients and their neighbors (the control) might be asked about their exposure history (did they work in an industrial setting), or other risk factors such as smoking.  Another example of a case-control study is the testing of a diagnostic procedure against the gold standard.  The gold standard represents the control, while the new diagnostic procedure is the &quot;case.&quot;  This might seem to qualify as an &quot;intervention&quot; and thus an experiment.    
*'''Cross-sectional''':  Involves many variables collected all at the same time. Used in epidemiology to estimate prevalence, or conduct other surveys.  
*'''Cohort''': A group of subjects followed over time, prospectively.  Framingham study is classic example.  By observing exposure and then tracking outcomes, cause and effect can be better isolated. However this type of study cannot conclusively isolate a cause and effect relationship.  
*'''Historic Cohort''': This is the same as a cohort except that researchers use an historic medical record to track patients and outcomes.

=Using an XML Editor: NetBeans : Single - Entity=
&lt;center&gt;
Return to the Single Entity Chapter =&gt; [[../A single entity/]
&lt;/center&gt;

===XML document:===

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XML Document.  
#Save your file as ‘city’ 
#Select XML Schema-Constrained Document as the document type. 
#Next, specify your schema location (Go to Browse, then select the schema just created) and root element name (tourGuide).  
#Copy and paste the above code into the NetBeans editor and save.
#Check the XML document to make sure it is well-formed (ALT-F9).  
To validate an XML document: 
#Right-click the document's node and choose Validate XML. 
If the XML file, city.xml, conforms to the XML schema provided, city.xsd, your Output Window should look like the following:

[[Image:WellForm.JPG|Output Window - Validity check]] 

Open this file, city.xml, in NetBeans.
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 '''Summary: Being a file which contains XML code and syntax, the XML document is an entity of neatly organized elements and subelements.'''
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Netbeans Tips ====
The prefix &quot;xsi&quot; for attribute &quot;xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation&quot; associated with an element type &quot;Listing&quot; is not bound. 
      -Caused because line
       &quot;xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'&quot; is 
       missing from the top of the document.

cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'Listing'.
      -Caused due to lack of extension(.xsd) at the end of the schema
       name.

cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'MuseumName'. One of '{&quot;&quot;:Museum}' is expected. [5] 
      -Caused due to lack of naming at the beginning and end of the
       variable naming section.

The element type &quot;MuseumName&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/MuseumName&gt;&quot;. 
      -Could be caused by a missing &quot;/&quot; in the end tag of one of the
       variables

===XML Schema===


Any XML document, including XML schema and XML stylesheet documents, can be checked to make sure they are “well-formed”. An XML document is said to be well-formed if it adheres to the XML syntax rules, as outlined in the Chapter 1, such as there must be exactly one root element, every start tag must have an end tag.  The well-formedness of an XML documents can be checked using an XML editor software, in this case, the NetBeans.
If any errors are detected, they are listed along with the line number in the Output window.  This location is not necessarily the line where the error occurred.  By double-clicking on any error message, you can go to the line in the XML document where the error was detected. 

Use NetBeans to create a new project:
#Go to File -&gt; New Project
Use NetBeans to create the above XML schema:

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XML Schema.  
#Save your file as ‘city’ (this gives the file an extension of .xsd). 
#Copy and Paste the above schema into city.xsd and save
To check an XML document to see if it is well-formed:
#Right-click the document's node (under files, city.xsd) and choose Check XML schema or press Alt-F9.  

If the XML schema, city.xsd, is well-formed, your Output Window should look like this:
[[Image:WellForm.JPG|Well Form XML Document]]

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 '''Summary: The XML schema shows the structure and elements of an XML document.'''
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== ''' Netbeans Tips ''' ====
Element type &quot;xsd:element&quot; must be followed by either attribute specifications, &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;/&gt;&quot;.
      -Caused by lack of &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;/&gt;&quot; symbol at the end of either the 
       specified line or the line there after.
The value of attribute &quot;name&quot; associated with an element type &quot;xsd:complexType&quot; must not contain the '&lt;' character. 
      -Often caused by lack of closing quotation around the variable 
       name on either the specified line or the line there after.
src-resolve.4.2: Error resolving component 'xsd:strin'...
      -Caused by invalid &quot;type&quot;, most likely misspelled.  Can be for 
       any &quot;type&quot;, not just &quot;string.&quot;
The element type &quot;xsd:sequence&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused because &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt; is not found in order to close 
       the statement.  
      -Also caused because the closing statements are out of order as
       they at the beginning of the Schema.

===XML Stylesheet===

Use NetBeans to create the above XML stylesheet: 

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XSL Stylesheet  
#Save your file as ‘city’ 
#Copy and paste the above code into the NetBeans editor and save.
#Check the stylesheet to make sure it is well-formed (ALT-F9).

Note: The city example files (city.xsd, city.xml and city.xsl) can
be created using a text editor, and the results are displayed correctly
in a compatible web browser such as Mozilla 1.6. You will need to store
all of the files in the same directory and insert the following line
after line 1 of city.xml:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;city.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This associates the XSL Stylesheet with the XML file containing the
city data. Also, If you are using Netbeans, be sure to take off the xmlns line in the beginning which looks like xmlns='http://xml.netbeans.org/examples/targetNS', otherwise it will not display all data.


==== ''' Netbeans Tips ''' ====

The element type &quot;xsl:text&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused by either lack of end-tag or misspelling of the end-
       tag.

The element type &quot;xsl:for-each&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused due to either lack of end-tag for the specified tag or 
       end-tags placed in the wrong order.

----
I recommend a macro structure that begins by examining the Constitution Article by Article up through Article 6, a special section on the Bill of Rights, and then individual sections on the later amendments. 

Much attention must be paid to the 14th Amendment: some care must be taken to ensure lay readers get that the 14th Amendment is possibly the most important Amendment in American history, at least from the perspective of how much it has shaped American life. It is the 14th, after all, that made most of the Bill of Rights operable against the states.

If no one objects, I am going to begin editing the content of this book, shaping it into the form of a modern casebook.  This is a rough outline of what I want to add over the next several months.

''This certainly does seem relevant to many (most?) teachers, not just teachers involved in Fire and Emergency Management.

I wrote this around the fire and emergency services as this is the industry I deal with. David is right, in that, it could easily be adapted to most any academic setting.

==Working with the Navigation Side Bar==

One of the more esoteric features of MediaWiki software that is under the control of an administrator is the maintenance of the navigation side bar that appears (usually) to the left of the content on all MediaWiki pages.

==Accessing the Side Bar Template==

The main sidebar template is kept in the collection of standard MediaWiki messages that may be edited by or protected from ordinary users just like any other template.  These pages are always protected from editing, however, unless you have administrator rights.

The typical page for this in the MediaWiki software is found at [[:MediaWiki:Sidebar]], and can be found on all MediaWiki projects.

==Default Settings==

The default sidebar information for most MediaWiki installations is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
* navigation 
** mainpage|main 
** portal-url|portal 
** ict-url|ict 
** currentevents-url|currentevents 
** recentchanges-url|recentchanges 
** randompage-url|randompage 
** helppage|help 
** sitesupport-url|sitesupport
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Explaining features==

There are two sorts of links that can be added through this interface:

*Predefined project variables
*Direct project links

Both of these have advantages and disadvantages which will be explained below.

===Predefined Project Variables===

The default setup of the navigation bar is only the predefined variables, so a common misconception is that this is the only sort of item that can appear on the navigation bar.  Indeed prior to MediaWiki 1.5 this was the only way that you could make changes to the navigation bar, so it is common for people to still use this approach.

The values for these project variables must be changed from the list of [[Special:Allmessages|System messages]] directly.  For example from the default example above regarding the current events link, currentevents-url can be changed at [[:MediaWiki:Currentevents-url]] and currentevents at [[:MediaWiki:Currentevents]].  Note that if you want to change the page links or even the text of the navigation bar for this one item, you don't even need to edit the navigation bar itself directly but simply need to edit the variable link instead.

An additional description is available if you edit [[:MediaWiki:Monobook.js]] that is related to each project variable that appears as a &quot;hint text&quot; for each project variable.

====Advantages====

*Displays hint text (not available for direct project links)
*Standard translations are available for default multi-lingual configurations which include these variables

====Disadvantages====

*Additional step of trying to hunt down variable pages if you want to make changes
*Often the actual content in the variable has absolutely nothing to do with the name of the variable.  For example, portal-url may in fact be a link to a self-referential parody group of pages or to the main project discussion pages.
*Adding additional variables requires developer access/root access to the computer that is hosting the content.

===Direct Project Links===

This is a more recent feature for adding in the navigation bar, but is much easier to work with.  Specific syntax issues will be addressed in the next major section.

====Advantages====

*No need to create variables or edit outside of the main side bar template
*Context of the content is obvious
*Can be performed by somebody with sysop privileges
*Less likely to mess up whole project (such as might happen if [[:MediaWiki:Monobook.js]] is edited with the wrong syntax)

====Disadvantages====

*Lack of hint text (is it really that important?)  Note that even this may be fixed in a later version of MediaWiki software.

==Sidebar Syntax==

It is important to note that either naming convention can be used to help rearrange the order of the links on the sidebar, and both may be used simultaneously.  You are not restricted to sticking to one naming convention.

MediaWiki software uses the unordered list syntax for keeping track of items in the sidebar.  Major sections are delimited by a single asterisk (*) and individual links by two asterisks (**).  Additional levels may be added depending on the nature of the link, but only affect indentation of links on the sidebar and should be used very sparingly.

Following the asterisk, the link is added by using the format of URL (or page link) followed by the public description of that link.  There is no need to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[ or ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; brackets to form these links as the MediaWiki software will do this automatically.

Here is an example of a modified sidebar from the default:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
* navigation 
** mainpage|mainpage 
** portal-url|portal 
** currentevents-url|currentevents 
** helppage|help 
** sitesupport-url|sitesupport
** Project:Village Pump|Village Pump

* tools
** recentchanges-url|recentchanges 
** randompage-url|randompage 
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note here that Recent Changes and the Random Page links have been moved to a completely separate section.  As an example, a link to the main project discussion page has been added.

Other text or even images can be added to this sidebar, but you should be careful as it is used on every project page and has a major draw on server resources as a result.  This is something that should be kept very simple and neat as a guideline.

*'''Note:''' Keep in mind that these changes will be very visible to all participants of the project, and that experimentation with this feature is likely to confuse new users to the project.  On larger projects with many users, you should try to get a general feel for what changes need to be made from the users rather than arbitrarily make changes on a whim.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes it is necessary to hide a page rather than just fix it or redirect it elsewhere. Although this function is described as &quot;deletion&quot; it doesn't physically remove it from the underlying database. Instead the page is marked as delete and is hidden from view for normal users (that is, those without administrator privileges).

Once you have become an administrator one of the first things you will notice is a brand-new &quot;delete&quot; tab at the top of most pages in addition to the normal ones. This will take you to a deletion prompt.

Once there, fill in the explanation and click &quot;Delete page&quot;. Some versions of MediaWiki have a &quot;Yes, I really want to delete this&quot; checkbox, so tick that before clicking delete otherwise it will not work.

What should be deleted depends on the project's inclusion rules, but generally:

*Test pages
*Vandal pages
*[[A Wikimedia Administrator's Handbook/Spam and Spammers|Spam pages]]
*[[A Wikimedia Administrator's Handbook/How to Handle Copyright Violations|Copyright violations]]
*Duplicates
*Project-incompatible pages

==Deleting specific revisions==
If you wish to delete only some revisions of a page - for example someone's private contact details or a copyright violation -this can be done using the &quot;revision deletion&quot; functionality from the page history display. Select the revision you wish to delete then click the '''''show / hide selected revisions''''' button. You will be given the option of hiding the content of the revision, the account name that made the revision or the edit summary. One or more options can be selected. Enter a reason for hiding the revision then click '''''apply to selected revision''''' to complete the action.

Hidden revisions remain visible to other administrators. In some cases the revision may need to be hidden from administrators as well. This is achieved using the ''suppression'' function (called ''oversight'' in earlier versions of MediaWiki). On all Wikimedia projects the ''suppression'' function is only available to Oversighters and Stewards.

==Restoring some or all deleted revisions==
Once a page has been deleted it is invisible to normal users, but admins visiting that same &quot;no such article&quot; page will also see a line at the top saying &quot;&lt;small&gt;View or restore [[Special:Undelete|## deleted edits]]?&lt;/small&gt;&quot;. This line also appears on the revision history page if the page still exists but has had some past revisions deleted.

Regardless of its location, clicking on the link will display the revision history. MediaWiki builds from before February 16, 2006 will show the last revision before deletion above the revision history. Each of these can be viewed on its own by choosing the appropriate date and time entry. MediaWiki builds from after February 16, 2006 will display the raw wiki source for the page (with a button below which can render it as it appeared), while those before this date will show the rendered page. Regardless of what version you are using the diff view function is currently not supported for deleted pages.

If you want to restore all deleted revisions merely click &quot;Restore!&quot;, but if you want to exclude specific revisions you will need to check the boxes of every revision ''other'' than those ones before clicking Restore, at the moment there is no &quot;restore all but selected&quot; option. For pages that have had a lot of edits this can be a laborious process.

Revision restoration does not have to happen all at once however, and even multiple admins can simultaneously restore edits of the same page (although they will encounter some errors if they both select a matching revision).

==Merging page histories==
Sometimes when merging pages it is desirable to merge their edit histories together rather than simply using redirects. In this case you will need to delete the page in question, move one of the source pages over top of it, delete the page again, move the next over top, etc. etc. etc. Once completed simply restore ''all'' the revisions by clicking the history tab and going through the procedure described above.

Depending on the version of MediaWiki running the newest revision may become the current revision, so you may need to revert to an earlier revision where all the source pages had already been merged.

A step-by-step explanation is found in [[MediaWiki_Administrator's_Handbook/Edit_History|Edit History]].

==Mass page deletion==
The mass deletion function (also known as ''nuke'') can be used to remove a large number of pages quickly and easily. It is useful when combating page creation vandalism. The mass deletion function is accessed from [[Special:Nuke]]. Three options to filter the pages to be deleted are available:

* All users or by username or IP address
* All pages or by page name (using a pattern)
* Maximum number of pages 

Selecting '''''go''''' will bring up a list of pages based on your selection criteria. By default all pages are &quot;checked&quot; and will be deleted. Enter a reason in the description field then select '''''delete selected''''' to complete the mass deletion. Be careful with this function as there is no mass undelete!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes it is necessary to protect a page against vandalism or other unwanted edits.

First of all visit the page in question and click the protect tab. You will be presented with one of two boxes, depending on the version of MediaWiki your wiki is running. Both methods are presented below. For the record, Wikicities is currently running MediaWiki 1.4 while Wikimedia projects are running 1.5.
 
==Page Protection in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier==
[[Image:Page protection in MediaWiki 1.4.png|frame|left|The protection screen in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier (some very early 1.5 builds also have this style)]]&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

At this screen simply check &quot;Confirm protection&quot;. If you only want to prevent people moving the page check that box (by default the page will be protected from both). In this version of MediaWiki you cannot choose to protect solely against page moves while leaving editing access open.
&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==Page Protection in MediaWiki 1.5 and later==
[[Image:Page protection in MediaWiki 1.5.png|frame|left|The protection screen in MediaWiki 1.5 and later]]&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

By default the left and right options both move to the same place when you change the left-hand one. If you check &quot;Unlock move permissions&quot; each may be adjusted independently. You can for example decide to allow only sysops to edit the page, but for non-sysops--the &quot;(default)&quot; category--to move the page if they choose to do so. In most cases you will want to protect against both, which is why this is the default. Some wikis also have a &quot;new users&quot; option (not shown).

If the page has been protected in the past, a &quot;Protection log&quot; will be displayed beneath the prompt.
{{-}}

==Unprotecting in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier==
[[Image:Page unprotection in MediaWiki 1.4.png|frame|left|The unprotection screen in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier (also some early 1.5 builds)]]&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

Simply give a reason and tick &quot;Confirm unprotection&quot;, then click &quot;Confirm&quot;. When using MediaWiki 1.4 this results in all protection restrictions being removed from the page.

==Unprotecting in MediaWiki 1.5 and later==
For this just [[#Page Protection in MediaWiki 1.5 and later|see above]] and set the access type you're re-enabling to &quot;(default)&quot;. You can also subjectively turn the two different permissions on and off at will.

If the page has been protected in the past, a &quot;Protection log&quot; will be displayed beneath the prompt.

==Things to note==
Note that the talk page of the page you are protecting will NOT be protected along with its sibling, and vice versa. If this is necessary you will need to do it separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pangaea.png|right|250px|thumb|Map of Pangaea]]
Pangaea was a big super-continent of Earth. A super-continent means a very large area of land made up of several continents we know today. Pangea formed during the [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|Mesozoic era]] three hundred million years ago.  Nearly all the countries we have today were part of Pangaea. Many mountains today were made in this supercontinent. Pangaea was surrounded by one big ocean called Panthalassa.

Pangaea broke up during the Jurassic period 180 million years ago and it split into two continents: Gondwana in the South and Laurasia in the North. After this they split again into the continents we have today.

== Other super-continents ==

Scientists think that there were two super-continents before Pangea, one called Rodinia which was made 1,100 million years ago, then split 750 million years ago and one called Pannotia which was made 600 million years ago, then split 540 million years ago.

The Tethys Ocean has been around for millions of years; it probably was around when these super continents existed.  During the Triassic period, the Tethys Ocean was located to the east of Pangaea and Laurasia. During the Jurassic, when the supercontinent split into Gondwanaland and Laurasia, the south-eastern opening to the Tethys Ocean became tighter, thus making the Tethys Ocean more contained.  During the Cretaceous, Gondwanaland split into the continents of Africa, Australia and India. India was drifting through the Tethys Ocean; but now the Tethys Ocean is probably part of the Indian Ocean. Laurasia wasn't always part of the two Jurassic cotinents; it was also part of Pangaea. Laurasia was the northern part of Pangea. Laurasia stayed Laurasia for millions of years while Pangea split and shaped into a different continent called Gondwanaland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Extinction is the process which happens when a type of animals or plants dies out. This means that all of them die and none survive. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to get what they need to live such as food, water, or shelter. This can also happen when the weather is too hot or too cold for a long time.

As long as there has been life, extinction has happened. 99.9% of all species that ever lived on earth have become extinct! Extinction still happens today, a group of animals which scientists are afraid will become extinct are called endangered.

All the big dinosaurs became extinct at the end of Cretaceous period about 65 million years ago, but no-one knows for sure why. To find out more see [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/K-T Event]].

Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds. Many people don't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly. But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur. They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">65 million years ago, half of all the different kinds of animals on Earth died out. Large land creatures suffered the most.  All animals larger than a big dog had disappeared completely, including all the dinosaurs!

Something extraordinary must have happened to destroy so much life.  Scientists call this event the Cretaceous-Tertiary event (K-T for short).  Nobody is sure what the K-T event was, but scientists have some ideas about what might have happened. 

===Asteroid explanation===

[[Image:KT_Impact2.jpg|right|thumb|An asteroid could have hit the Earth.]]
An asteroid is a giant piece of rock moving through space.  Very rarely, these asteroids fall on Earth.  Some scientists think that an asteroid 10 kilometres wide fell on Earth 65 million years ago.  A large asteroid hitting the Earth would cause a huge fire storm, and cause a lot of dust to fly into the air. This dust would block out the sun for several months, or even for several years.

With most sunlight blocked by dust, the ground would get colder, and a long winter would come.  To make things worse, the large amount of dust in the air would cause acid rain, rain so poisonous that it can harm or even kill plants.

The combination of the cold, little sun and poisonous rain would kill many plants.  [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|Herbivore]] dinosaurs would not have enough left to eat, and would starve and without herbivores to eat, the [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|carnivores]] would starve too.

When scientists examine layers of very old rocks from 65 million years ago, they find a lot of one type of rare metal called iridium.  Because iridium is so rare on earth, it must have come from somewhere else, like an asteroid.  More evidence of this is an enormous 180 kilometre (111 miles) wide crater in Mexico, called the Chicxulub Crater.  An asteroid impact could have made such a crater.

A few scientists disagree with this explanation.  They say that all this would cause dinosaurs to die much faster than they did. There are similar big craters around the world that affected ancient life.

===Other explanations===

[[Image:Galunggung.jpg|left|thumb|There could have been many large volcano eruptions.]]
Some scientists think that volcano eruptions could have caused the K-T event.  These volcanoes would release huge amounts of ash and poisonous gases into the air.  Like the dust in the asteroid explanation, this ash would stay in the air for a long time and cause a winter and acid rain.

These gases would also destroy the protective ozone layer in the sky.  The ozone layer protects us from the Sun's harmful rays.

Scientists have found out that there have been some huge eruptions. These eruptions could have covered both the states Alaska and Texas in one kilometre of ash and lava!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Libraries Reference}}

Haskell has a rich and growing set of function libraries.  They fall into several groups:

* The Standard Prelude (often referred to as just &quot;the Prelude&quot;) is defined in the Haskell 98 standard and imported automatically to every module you write.  This defines standard types such as strings, lists and numbers and the basic functions on them, such as arithmetic, &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;foldr&lt;/tt&gt;

* The Standard Libraries are also defined in the Haskell 98 standard, but you have to import them when you need them.  The reference manuals for these libraries are at http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/

* Since 1998 the Standard Libraries have been gradually extended, and the resulting de-facto standard is known as the Base libraries.  The same set is available for both HUGS and GHC.

* Other libraries may be included with your compiler, or can be installed using the Cabal mechanism.

When Haskell 98 was standardised modules were given a flat namespace.  This has proved inadequate and a hierarchical namespace has been added by allowing dots in module names.  For backward compatibility the standard libraries can still be accessed by their non-hierarchical names, so the modules &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Data.List&lt;/tt&gt; both refer to the standard list library.

For details of how to import libraries into your program, see [[../Modules|Modules and libraries]].  For an explanation of the Cabal system for packaging Haskell software see [[../Packaging]].

== Haddock Documentation ==

Library reference documentation is generally produced using the Haddock tool.  The libraries shipped with GHC are documented using this mechanism.  You can view the documentation at http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html, and if you have installed GHC then there should also be a local copy.

Haddock produces hyperlinked documentation, so every time you see a function, type or class name you can click on it to get to the definition.  The sheer wealth of libraries available can be intimidating, so this tutorial will point out the highlights.

One thing worth noting with Haddock is that types and classes are cross-referenced by instance.  So for example in the &lt;tt&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Maybe.html Data.Maybe]&lt;/tt&gt; library the &lt;tt&gt;Maybe&lt;/tt&gt; data type is listed as an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt;:

 Ord a =&gt; Ord (Maybe a)

This means that if you declare a type &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; then the type &lt;tt&gt;Maybe Foo&lt;/tt&gt; will automatically be an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; as well.  If you click on the word &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; in the document then you will be taken to the definiton of the &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; class and its (very long) list of instances.  The instance for &lt;tt&gt;Maybe&lt;/tt&gt; will be down there as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Redundant Guide==

What if most of the &quot;Guide to Growing Up&quot; was like a bookshelf?  I think many of the topics covered could be their own separate books.  For example, there is a &quot;Becoming Healthy, Lean or Muscular&quot; section, but there is an other project on wikibooks caled [[Getting in Shape]].  I think both people who want to get in shape and people who want to know about growing up healthily are looking for the same thing.  There are some topics in the Getting in Shape section that are not covered in the Becoming Healthy, Lean or Muscular section, and vice versa.  The Becoming Healthy, Lean or Muscular section should be merged into the Getting in Shape section, and the Guide to Growing Up book should link to it.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Monads}}

Monads are very useful in Haskell, but the concept is often difficult at first. Since they have so many applications, people often explain them from a particular point of view, and that can confuse your understanding of monads in their full glory.

Historically, monads were introduced into Haskell to perform input/output. A predetermined execution order is crucial for things like reading and writing files, and monadic operations follow an inherent sequence. We discussed strict sequencing and IO back in [[../Simple input and output/]] using the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. Well, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; is actually just syntactic sugar over monads.

Monads are by no means limited to input and output. Monads support a whole range of things like exceptions, state, non-determinism, continuations, coroutines, and more. In fact, thanks to the versatility of monads, none of these constructs needed to be built into Haskell as a language; instead, they are defined by the standard libraries.


== Definition ==

A ''monad'' is defined by three things:
*a [[Haskell/More on datatypes#Parameterised Types | type constructor]] &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;;
*a function &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function has nothing to do with the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword found in imperative languages like C or Java; don't conflate these two.&lt;/ref&gt;
*an operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; which is pronounced &quot;bind&quot;. 
The function and operator are methods of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; type class and have types

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    return :: a -&gt; M a
    (&gt;&gt;=)  :: M a -&gt; ( a -&gt; M b ) -&gt; M b
&lt;/source&gt;

and are required to obey [[#Monad Laws|three laws]] that will be explained later on.

We could spell out what we know from the types above. &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; takes an argument and wraps it in an M, i.e. creates a monadic equivalent to the initial argument. &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; gets a value out of a monad in order to use in a function that evaluates back to a monad again.

For a concrete example, take the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad. The type constructor is &lt;code&gt;M = Maybe&lt;/code&gt; so that &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; are defined like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    return :: a -&gt; Maybe a
    return x  = Just x

    (&gt;&gt;=)  :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
    (&gt;&gt;=) m g = case m of
                   Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                   Just x  -&gt; g x
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's explicitly deduce what we can about the variables in the definition above. As &lt;code&gt;m :: Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; it must be either &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Just x&lt;/code&gt;, as indicated in the case statements. Because &lt;code&gt;g :: (a -&gt; Maybe b)&lt;/code&gt;, we know that &lt;code&gt;g x&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to something that is wrapped in a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;. Even when m isn't &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, it is possible for the g function to evaluate to Nothing, but otherwise we will get &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; something (the something is determined by what the g function actually does).

Again, what all this means is: both &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; involve some handling of non-monadic values and finally evaluate to monadic values. Understanding when values are monadic or not is the key first step to following the processes here.


=== Motivation: Maybe ===

To see the usefulness of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad, consider the following example: Imagine a family database that provides two functions

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    father :: Person -&gt; Maybe Person
    mother :: Person -&gt; Maybe Person
&lt;/source&gt;

These look up the name of someone's father or mother. In case our database is missing some information, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; allows us to return a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; value instead of crashing the program.

Let's combine our functions to query various grandparents. For instance, the following function looks up the maternal grandfather:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
maternalGrandfather :: Person -&gt; Maybe Person
maternalGrandfather p =
    case mother p of
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just mom -&gt; father mom
&lt;/source&gt;

Or consider a function that checks whether both grandfathers are in the database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers :: Person -&gt; Maybe (Person, Person)
    bothGrandfathers p =
        case father p of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just dad -&gt;
                case father dad of
                    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                    Just gf1 -&gt;                          -- found first grandfather
                        case mother p of
                            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                            Just mom -&gt;
                                case father mom of
                                    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                                    Just gf2 -&gt;          -- found second grandfather
                                        Just (gf1, gf2) 
&lt;/source&gt;

What a mouthful! Every single query might fail by returning &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; and the whole function must fail with &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; if that happens.

Clearly there has to be a better way to write that instead of repeating the case of &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; again and again! Indeed, that's what the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad is set out to do. For instance, the function retrieving the maternal grandfather has exactly the same structure as the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; operator, so we can rewrite it as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    maternalGrandfather p = mother p &gt;&gt;= father
&lt;/source&gt;

With the help of lambda expressions and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, we can rewrite the two grandfathers function as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers p =
       father p &gt;&gt;=
           (\dad -&gt; father dad &gt;&gt;=
               (\gf1 -&gt; mother p &gt;&gt;=     -- note that the function in this case doesn't use its argument
                   (\mom -&gt; father mom &gt;&gt;=
                       (\gf2 -&gt; return (gf1,gf2) ))))
&lt;/source&gt;

While these nested lambda expressions may look confusing to you, the thing to take away here is that &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; releases us from listing all the &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;s, shifting the focus back to the interesting part of the code.

To be a little more precise: The result of &lt;code&gt;father p&lt;/code&gt; is a monadic value (in this case, either &lt;code&gt;Just dad&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, depending on whether p's dad is in the database). As the &lt;code&gt;father&lt;/code&gt; function takes a regular (non-monadic value), the &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; provides p's &lt;code&gt;dad&lt;/code&gt; as a ''non-monadic'' value. The result of &lt;code&gt;father dad&lt;/code&gt; is then monadic again, and the process continues.

So, &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; helps us pass regular values to functions even though we are dealing overall with monads. In the case of the Maybe monad, the monadic aspect is the qualifier that we don't know with certainty whether the value will be found.

=== Type class ===

In Haskell, the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; type class is used to implement monads. It is provided by the {{Haskell lib|Control|Monad}} module and included in the Prelude. The class has the following methods:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    class Monad m where
        return :: a -&gt; m a
        (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
     
        (&gt;&gt;)   :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
        fail   :: String -&gt; m a
&lt;/source&gt;

Aside from return and bind, notice the two additional functions &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt;.

The operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; called &quot;then&quot; is a mere convenience and commonly implemented as
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    m &gt;&gt; n = m &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; n
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sequences two monadic actions when the second action does not involve the result of the first, which is common for monads like &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    printSomethingTwice :: String -&gt; IO ()
    printSomethingTwice str = putStrLn str &gt;&gt; putStrLn str
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; handles pattern match failures in [[Haskell/do Notation|&lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation]]. It's an unfortunate technical necessity and doesn't really have anything to do with monads. You are advised to not call &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; directly in your code.

== Notions of Computation ==

We've seen how &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; are very handy for removing boilerplate code that crops up when using &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, but let's consider further how they really work.

Let's write the two grandfathers function with &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers p = do
        dad &lt;- father p
        gf1 &lt;- father dad
        mom &lt;- mother p
        gf2 &lt;- father mom
        return (gf1, gf2)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation works in like an imperative language that supports ''exceptions'' : &lt;code&gt;father&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mother&lt;/code&gt; are functions that might fail to produce results (i.e. raise an exception), and when that happens, the whole &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-block will fail (i.e. terminate with an exception).

With the Maybe monad, terminating in failure means returning &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; instead of returning a &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; value. In our &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; example, as soon as any item returns &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, the whole block will stop calculating and return &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; as its overall result.

Each of the variable assignments is not itself a full monadic value, but the functions &lt;code&gt;father&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mother&lt;/code&gt; always bring us back to monadic values. If we did not get the values out of the monads each time, we could end up with nested monads like &lt;code&gt;Just (Just dad)&lt;/code&gt; (which may happen in Haskell at times but certainly is not what we want here).

The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function lifts our final non-monadic value (of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;) to a full-fledged monad again (type &lt;code&gt;M a&lt;/code&gt;). Again, if we did not finish with a monad, we could not gracefully fail and return &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, and without that safety net, our program could crash at runtime.&lt;ref&gt; Does that mean we should always use &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; for ''everything''? Well, we don't want our types to be any more general than necessary. We want to give the compiler the chance to catch any issues (including missing data). We don't want to say that missing data is ok if we don't expect that data to ever be missing. Also, any use of Maybe requires us to specify what to do if Nothing is returned, and we don't want to worry about doing that if that will never come up. In short, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; (or another appropriate monad) is used when it could be ''normal'' in the desired operating of your program for certain data to be absent or for certain functions to return no result. If you use Maybe unnecessarily and handle it correctly, your program will still run; but it is better to only use it only where really appropriate.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different monads have different semantics. The following table shows the classic selection that every Haskell programmer should know and includes comparison to well-known terms from imperative programming languages. If the idea behind monads is still unclear to you, studying each of the examples in the following subchapters will not only give you a well-rounded toolbox but also help you understand the common abstraction behind them.

These different monads do not only occur in isolation but can also be mixed and matched, giving rise to [[Haskell/Monad transformers|monad transformers]].

== Monad Laws ==
In Haskell, every instance of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; type class (and thus all implementations of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;) must obey the following three laws:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    m &gt;&gt;= return     =  m                        -- right unit
    return x &gt;&gt;= f   =  f x                      -- left unit

    (m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g  =  m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)  -- associativity
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Return as neutral element ===
The behavior of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is specified by the left and right unit laws. They state that &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; doesn't perform any computation, it just collects values. For instance,

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    maternalGrandfather p = do
            mom &lt;- mother p
            gf  &lt;- father mom
            return gf
&lt;/source&gt;

is exactly the same as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    maternalGrandfather p = do
            mom  &lt;- mother p
            father mom
&lt;/source&gt;

by virtue of the right unit law.

=== Associativity of bind ===
The law of associativity makes sure that (like the semicolon) the bind operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; only cares about the order of computations, not about their nesting; e.g. we could have written &lt;code&gt;bothGrandfathers&lt;/code&gt; like this (compare with our earliest version without &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers p =
       (father p &gt;&gt;= father) &gt;&gt;=
           (\gf1 -&gt; (mother p &gt;&gt;= father) &gt;&gt;=
               (\gf2 -&gt; return (gf1,gf2) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

The associativity of the ''then'' operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is a special case:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   (m &gt;&gt; n) &gt;&gt; o  =  m &gt;&gt; (n &gt;&gt; o)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Monadic composition ====

It is easier to picture the associativity of bind by recasting the law as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   (f &gt;=&gt; g) &gt;=&gt; h  =  f &gt;=&gt; (g &gt;=&gt; h)
&lt;/source&gt;

where '''&lt;code&gt;(&gt;=&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is the monad composition operator''', a close (but flipped order) analogue of the function composition operator &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;, defined as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   (&gt;=&gt;) :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; a -&gt; m c
   f &gt;=&gt; g = \x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also flip monad composition to go the other direction using &lt;code&gt;(&lt;=&lt;)&lt;/code&gt;. The operation order of &lt;code&gt;(f . g)&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;(f' &lt;=&lt; g')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the functions in regular function composition are non-monadic functions whereas monadic composition takes only monadic functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monads and Category Theory ==
Monads originally come from a branch of mathematics called Category Theory. Fortunately, it is entirely unnecessary to understand category theory in order to understand and use monads in Haskell. The definition of monads in Category Theory actually uses a slightly different presentation. Translated into Haskell, this presentation gives an alternative yet equivalent definition of a monad which can give us some additional insight.&lt;ref&gt;Deep into the Advanced Track, we will cover the theoretical side of the story in the [[Haskell/Category theory#Monads|chapter on Category Theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, we have defined monads in terms of &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;. The alternative definition, instead, starts with monads as functors with two additional combinators:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    fmap   :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; M a -&gt; M b  -- functor

    return :: a -&gt; M a
    join   :: M (M a) -&gt; M a
&lt;/source&gt;

(Reminder: as discussed in the [[/The Functor class|chapter on the functor class]], a functor &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as container, so that &lt;code&gt;M a&lt;/code&gt; &quot;contains&quot; values of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, with a corresponding mapping function, i.e. &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, that allows functions to be applied to values inside it.)

Under this interpretation, the functions behave as follows:
* &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; applies a given function to every element in a container
* &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; packages an element into a container,
* &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; takes a container of containers and flattens it into a single container.

With these functions, the bind combinator can be defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    m &gt;&gt;= g = join (fmap g m)
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, we could give a definition of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; in terms of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    fmap f x = x &gt;&gt;= (return . f)
    join x   = x &gt;&gt;= id
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Is my Monad a Functor? ===

At this point we might, with good reason, deduce that all monads are by definition functors as well. While according to category theory that is indeed the case, GHC does it differently because of historic accident in the designing of Haskell. While the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; classes aren't connected in current versions, GHC 7.10 will finally fix this issue so that every &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance will be connected to a matching &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instance and the corresponding &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt; defines &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt;, a function with a strangely familiar type signature...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a1 -&gt; r) -&gt; m a1 -&gt; m r
&lt;/source&gt;

As you might suspect, &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; is merely &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; implemented with &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, just as we have done above. For a properly implemented monad with a matching &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; (that is, pretty much any ''sensible'' monad) &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; are interchangeable.

* [[/Nuclear waste/]] - archives from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell/Understanding_monads&amp;oldid=933545 before the great rewrite] (see especially the last thread) 2007-08-03

== Rewrite of the page? ==
A complete rewrite of the page seems to have been initiated today. I think it's a shame, since the original version with the nuclear waste metaphor was by far the best tutorial I've ever seen.
Since I couldn't find any discussion of this huge change anywhere, I've reverted [[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]]'s changes. --[[User:Nattfodd|Nattfodd]] 14:00, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, Natt.  The discussion (confusingly) took place on [[/Nuclear waste/#Unhappy customers]].  The problem with the original version is that it gives only a superficial understanding of monads and doesn't help the reader to really &quot;get&quot; the point (I say this because I am guilty for most of it).  Reverting your revert.  Apfelmus is a well trusted member of this community.  He understands the strengths of the original version and will likely find a way to preserve them whilst overcoming the major shortcomings :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:07, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

::No the metaphor is great! I watched the WIP page, like, &quot;monad is a triplet of (M, return, &gt;==) where they satisfy ''laws'' 1, 2 and 3&quot; etc etc. I couldn't get it after staring at it for ten seconds. I'm generally opposed to the &quot;Yankee textbook&quot; style where everything is explained thrice really down-bowing like to a retard monkey, but the other extreme '''only''' works if you've got a live instructor. This book's value as a self-study material benefits hugely from such witty and well-written metaphors as in this article! --[[User:Sigmundur|Sigmundur]] ([[User talk:Sigmundur|talk]]) 18:01, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

:::Well, staring at a definition usually doesn't work, the intention was that the reader reads on :-).
:::The dilemma is the following: if there's no clear definition, some people complain that &quot;monad&quot; is just a buzzword (like &quot;cloud computing&quot; etc.). If there's a metaphor, some people complain that don't see the wood for the metaphorical trees anymore, especially if the metaphor is stretched beyond its limits. If it starts with explaining that &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt; is an &quot;action that calculates a value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (that's how the SPJ's &quot;awkward squad&quot; paper does it and which worked for me), some people complain that this is too abstract either. Hm, now what to do? :-)

== Section &quot;Motivation&quot; ==
Thanks for taking up on this somewhat stalled text.

A motivating example is a good idea, but it can easily become a demotivating example if it's too complicated/confusing. I think the core idea of &lt;code&gt;safeSqrt&lt;/code&gt; is reasonably clear, but the cursory remarks, for instance about &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &quot;openness&quot; are too much.

Moreover, I'd certainly avoid saying that monads are &quot;relatively difficult&quot;, for they are not, or rather, should not be by virtue of this text.

== Chapter notes and TODOs ==
=== Topics TODO ===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Explain monadic parser combinators! But in another chapter.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The basic triad &quot;rock, scissors, paper&quot; err, &quot;reader, writer, state&quot; is best introduced in another chapter, maybe entitled &quot;A Zoo of Monads&quot;. Reader must include the famous function &lt;code&gt;[(a-&gt;b)] -&gt; a -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt; also known as &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt;!
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;Random a&lt;/code&gt; is too cute to not elaborate it further to probabilistic functional programming. The Monty Hall problem can be solved with that. Key: the implementation can be changed, it effectively becomes the Set-Monad then. Extension: &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; and backtracking.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Exceptions are a nice way to explain monads, too. See also [http://programming.reddit.com/info/64th1/comments/c02u9mb].
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Obsolete notes ===
Move the italic inline notes here when no longer necessary.
==== What is a monad? ====
&lt;i&gt;We're bold and present the exact definition of &quot;monad&quot;. This should (hopefully) prevent common confusion about the definition and remove the buzzword status. Of course, this paragraph has to be really short since it doesn't explain why I should care about monads at all or what the intuition behind bind and return is.&lt;/i&gt;
==== Stateful Computations ====
&lt;i&gt;Example state monads, i.e. particular state types. One of them is to be treated before/in parallel to &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt;. The others may be useful for exercises!
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;random numbers. Drawbacks: &lt;math&gt;\gg&lt;/math&gt; is meaningless, using an infinite list of random numbers is a better abstraction. Highlights: the state is more an implementation detail than of individual importance, this makes explanation easier!
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;name-supply. Task: label all leaves in a tree from 1 to n.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data.Map for depth first search in a graph.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SOE, chapter 19: interactive robot language. Nice example monad to program in. But not a good example for implementation.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Of course, the problem with an example is that we need to explain the example use case before plunging into &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. But it's probably worth it. Huh, it turns out that we even have to explain the &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; (a,s)&lt;/code&gt; pattern for threading state. Seems that random numbers are easiest to explain.
&lt;/i&gt;

== Materials ==
=== Monad zoo ===
Just to point out that shapr's girlfriend had some amusing illustrations of monads... might be useful for an eventual Monad Zoo chapter -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:07, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

: Marvelous, there more amusement, the better ;-) I intend the &quot;Monad Zoo&quot; chapter to take the role of [[Haskell/Advanced monads]]. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 17:11, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

=== Need Images? ===
I could draw up some preliminary figures/images if you'd like.  I'm not familiar with Haskell, but if I can contribute while I learn... why not? :)

[[Image:monad_state_random1.jpg]]

[[Image:monad_state_random2.jpg]]

These images correspond to the first monad example, a random number generator.

:Oh, thank you! I had something along the lines of the diagrams in the [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/ awkward squad paper] in mind, though, i.e. something like [[Image:MonadState sumTwoDice.png]]. This demonstrates how &lt;code&gt;sumTwoDice&lt;/code&gt; is composed of two successive &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt;. [[:Image:monad_state_random2.jpg]] somehow misses this point :-) I'm not sure wether rectangular boxes are the way to go though, your colorful circles make me thinking.

=== Changes from 20 April 2010 ===
A helpful contributor has made some changes, recorded here: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell%2FUnderstanding_monads&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1761620&amp;oldid=1733846 Revision 1761620 compared to 1733846].

Unfortunately, I think they tend to confuse matters more than they enlighten and I chose to undo them. They are modeled on the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monads_as_Containers Monads as Containers] tutorial, but this approach is very different from the one taken here and they don't mix very well. How about putting them in an extra section?

I do agree that &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; viewpoint should be explained somewhere as well.

== Questions and Suggestions ==
=== Prelude and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ===
We should show a way to hide &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and the other monad functions while importing the Prelude.

=== How to combine Actions with a function? ===
For example,I write a function to get the nth fibonacci number.
&lt;pre&gt;
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + (fib (n-2))
&lt;/pre&gt;
And it takes long time to get the 1000th number.So I want to show the progress.When it get the 100th,200th,300th,... number,the console print 1,2,3,....How to do this? Must I modify my function or I can make a wrapper of it.

: For debugging, you can use {{Haskell lib|Debug|Trace}} to show intermediate results.
:In general, you have to change your function to &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; something.
 fib n = print n &gt;&gt; case n of
   0 -&gt; return 1
   1 -&gt; return 1
   n -&gt; liftM2 (+) (fib (n-1)) (fib (n-2))  
: Note that your algorithm needs exponential time! I estimate that &lt;code&gt;fib 1000&lt;/code&gt; will take  around &lt;math&gt;10^{190}&lt;/math&gt; years. For better algorithms, see also [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Fibonacci_sequence The Fibonacci sequence] on the Haskell Wiki.
: The [http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe Haskell Cafe Mailinglist] is probably better for asking Haskell questions than the wikibook.

=== Nomenclature: use of f as a monadic value ===
In the introductory set of three equations, and throughout, you use x for a value, and f,g,h for either monadic values, or functions. I would use either x, m or a for a monadic variable. i.e.

f &gt;&gt;= return == f

becomes:

a &gt;&gt;= return == a

f is strongly associated with function names.
-- Neil Mitchell/ndm

: Good point! How do others do it? SPJ in &quot;Tackling the awkwards squad&quot; says 

 return x &gt;&gt;= f = f x
 m &gt;&gt;= return = m
 m1 &gt;&gt;= (λx.m2 &gt;&gt;= (λy.m3)) = (m1 &gt;&gt;= (λx.m2)) &gt;&gt;= (λy.m3)

with the condition that x is not free in m3. Wadler in &quot;Monads for functional programming&quot; essentially says

 return a &gt;&gt;= λb.n = n[a/b]
 m &gt;&gt;= λa.return a = m
 m &gt;&gt;= (λa.n &gt;&gt;= λb.o)) = (m &gt;&gt;= λa.n) &gt;&gt;= λb.o

but uses &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;return&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;.

In my own Haskell code, I always use m for monadic values and g,h for functions that return monadic values. That means

 return x &gt;&gt;= g = g x
 m &gt;&gt;= return = m
 (m &gt;&gt;= g) &gt;&gt;= h = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; g x &gt;&gt;= h)

Hm, do I really do that? Oh, dear. I guess just using m for monadic values and f,g for the functions is probably best. Hm, but the other versions of the associative law are more associative.

=== Trouble with currying ===
I'm not confident enough in my Haskell knowledge to outright correct this, but something looks wrong to me.  In the section [[Haskell/Understanding monads#Threading_the_State_with_bind|Threading the State with bind]], the definition of &gt;&gt; is:

&lt;pre&gt;
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Seed -&gt; (a,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed))
(&gt;&gt;) f g seed0 = 
  let (result1, seed1) = f seed0
      (result2, seed2) = g seed1
  in (result2, seed2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It looks like the type signature and definition disagree.  In particular, the signature indicates that &gt;&gt; produces a function.  However, the definition seems to produce a pair (b, Seed).  On the other hand, this might just be Haskell magic.  --[[User:Bytecrafter|Bytecrafter]] 22:00, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

:Even more strangely, &gt;&gt; takes three parameters instead of two... Don't worry, this is just [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Currying Currying] :-) For instance, we may say that (+) is a function that takes one parameter and returns a function, i.e. &lt;code&gt;(+) :: Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Int)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(3 +) :: Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt; but we may also think of (+) as taking two parameters.
:The definition of &gt;&gt; is similar. Hm, maybe it's better to write
:&lt;code&gt; f &gt;&gt; g = \seed0 -&gt; let ... in (result2,seed2)&lt;/code&gt;,
:but the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; spans multiple lines, so I'm not sure whether this helps.

::OK, I wasn't sure if that was going on or not.  I've only ever seen currying in the invocation of functions, not the definition.  Does that imply that the following type signatures are equivalent?
::
&lt;pre&gt;
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Seed -&gt; (a,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed))
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Seed -&gt; (a,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)) -&gt; Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)

::I'm sorry to spam up this discussion page (clearly these questions belong on the currying page), but let me share my impressions.  As a reader, I came to this page out of order.  I know a bit about functional programming, but I only know enough Haskell to be able to read it.  I can't really write it.  However, I was very interested to learn more about Monads, since the little that I did know led me to believe that they were magical and cool.
::: No problem, I mean, &quot;out of order&quot; is to the default on the Internet :-) so the/any article should facilitate that. Hm, having an explicit dependency graph for the chapters would be ideal.
::  I had expected to see that (&gt;&gt;) would return a function, and was a bit surprised to see that the definition didn't seem to match the type signature.  There are probably other readers in similar situations.  It might make sense to get the type signature and the function definition to agree.
::: I changed some definitions, better that way?
::To counterbalance my criticism, let me also say that this is the single best Monad discussion that I have seen so far.

=== &quot;What is a monad&quot; missing something? ===
&lt;i&gt;A ''monad'' is a &quot;thing&quot; that can plug into the monadic plumbing system.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Think of an internet enabled appliance.  What does that mean?  It means a &quot;thing&quot; that can plug into the internet.  But the internet is basically just a giant router.  The functionality all depends on what's plugged in.  If no one ever showed you a web browser or a chat client, then you would probably have no idea what the internet is.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nevertheless, we can ''define'' what a monad is, without giving even the slightest hint of what a monad is good for.&lt;/i&gt;

:Moved Oddron's addition here because IMHO they don't fit. But they're not without point, what do you want to express, Oddron? What bugs you about the current version?
:The section intentionally does not give an explananation of what monads are good for in order to avoid making it sound like a buzzword.
:Strictly speaking, there is no &quot;monadic pumbling system&quot;. I don't like the internet example, though it does have the good point that there are many very different monads, i.e. that &quot;monad&quot; itself is a rather bare-bones concept.

=== Confused by type definition given for Map?===
&lt;pre&gt;map :: a -&gt; b -&gt; M a -&gt; M b&lt;/pre&gt;
I'm new to Wikibooks, and haven't the foggiest about monads yet. Appologies if my understanding is wrong but if it's intuitively like map then shouldn't the only difference should be in what the function operates on and what's returned. ie more like
&lt;pre&gt;map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; M a -&gt; M b&lt;/pre&gt;

::Thanks for clearing that up. Wasn't sure if it were a deliberate error or not. It's quite reassuraning that I have learnt something from previous sections of this wikibook.

As such I quite liked the map analogy, but haven't got the subtle difference with aplication. Keep up the good work, and I'll attempt to help out where I can.

=== Recent expansion of section &quot;Definition&quot; ===
Blaisorblade, I don't agree that your elaboration on the definition is a good idea. My intention was to keep it extremely short and jump right into the example. I think that someone who doesn't know what a monad is yet won't understand the additional remarks, but still waste a lot of time trying to understand them. He is better served by doing the example first and inferring his own intuition from that.

:I'm in total agreement with Apfelmus: the &quot;cut to the chase&quot; approach of the older versions of this chapter was a key factor in its effectiveness (not that my subjective POV counts much, but I speak as someone who actually learnt monads as a complete newbie starting from this article).

== Category Theory ==

Hey, I changed the intro to the Category Theory section so as not to imply that the join/map/return presentation of monads is exactly the categorical definition.  It's not. For one, Haskell is not Category Theory; it just has some operations based on concepts from C.T.  For another, Haskell monads actually correspond to so-called &quot;strong monads&quot; in C.T.  The difference is that, in a strong monad's version of bind, extra information is passed into the function passed to bind.  This corresponds exactly to the existing scope in Haskell.  In Haskell, a function passed to bind is closed over the existing scope, and so has access to all variables already in scope, as well as the bound variable.  In a categorical strong monad, this is done with a product; in Haskell, it is done with closures and scope.  (I am mkehrt on WP; I don't exist on WB).

== Broken Link ==

Link to Haskell/Understanding monads/Error is broken as it seems that section no longer exists. This should be replaced with an appropriate link, or removed.

      <comment>/* Pure Abstract Classes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Pure Abstract Classes ====
An abstract class is one in which there is a declaration but no definition for a member function. The way this concept is expressed in C++ is to have the member function declaration assigned to zero.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class PureAbstractClass 
{
public:
  virtual void AbstractMemberFunction() = 0;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

A pure Abstract class has only abstract member functions and no data or concrete member functions. In general, a pure abstract class is used to define an interface and is intended to be inherited by concrete classes. It's a way of forcing a contract between the class designer and the users of that class. The users of this class must declare a matching member function for the class to compile.

; Example of usage for a pure Abstract Class:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class DrawableObject 
 {
  public:
    virtual void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const = 0; //draw to GraphicalDrawingBoard
 };

 class Triangle : public DrawableObject
 {
 public:
   void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const; //draw a triangle
 };

 class Rectangle : public DrawableObject
 {
 public:
   void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const; //draw a rectangle
 };

 class Circle : public DrawableObject
 {
 public:
   void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const; //draw a circle
 };

 typedef std::list&lt;DrawableObject*&gt; DrawableList;

 DrawableList drawableList;
 GraphicalDrawingBoard drawingBoard;

 drawableList.pushback(new Triangle());
 drawableList.pushback(new Rectangle());
 drawableList.pushback(new Circle());

 for(DrawableList::const_iterator iter = drawableList.begin(), 
    endIter = drawableList.end();
    iter != endIter;
    ++iter)
 { 
   DrawableObject *object = *iter;
   object-&gt;Draw(drawingBoard);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this is a bit of a contrived example and that the drawable objects are not fully defined (no constructors or data) but it should give you the general idea of the power of defining an interface. Once the objects are constructed, the code that calls the interface does not know any of the implementation details of the called objects, only that of the interface. The object ''GraphicalDrawingBoard'' is a placeholder meant to represent the thing onto which the object will be drawn, i.e. the video memory, drawing buffer, printer.

Note that there is a great temptation to add concrete member functions and data to pure abstract base classes. This must be resisted, in general it is a sign that the interface is not well factored. Data and concrete member functions tend to imply a particular implementation and as such can inherit from the interface but should not be that interface. Instead if there is some commonality between concrete classes, creation of abstract class which inherits its interface from the pure abstract class and defines the common data and member functions of the concrete classes works well. Some care should be taken to decide whether inheritance or aggregation should be used. Too many layers of inheritance can make the maintenance and usage of a class difficult. Generally, the maximum accepted layers of inheritance is about 3, above that and refactoring of the classes is generally called for. A general test is the &quot;is a&quot; vs &quot;has a&quot;, as in a Square is a Rectangle, but a Square has a set of sides.

Hi there, Tommy! You know, I must admit, you've asked a really good question at the Classroom. :) In deed, how come there's no lessons?! Well, I must tell you, our School is at the very beginning of its existence. The Wikiversity's School of Magic was founded just a couple of months ago. However, by every day it's becoming bigger and more developed. Because we, its users, help it, of course. ;) This is [[w:wiki|a wiki]] school, which means that anyone is free to edit pages. You can edit all of the pages by yourself. If you wish, you can even make a lesson by yourself! However, I don't recommend that to you yet, since there should be at least some primar lessons made by [[School of Magic:School Board|the official professors]], before the others could make theirs. But don't be worry! We are writing the lessons every day, and very, very soon the lessons will be available. At this moment we have provided only the Lesson 1, which is the most important lesson, don't you think? You can see it [[School of Magic:About the Magic|here]]. And while you're taking your Lesson 1, the Lesson 2 will be ready for you. ;) I shall inform you by myself on this page if that's all right with you. (By the way, hope seeing you at my class soon! ;)) --[[User:Twinkling Wizard|Twinkling Wizard]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Twinkling Wizard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:52, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

Particle engines generally have very good performance because of the high velocity of the particles.  The high velocity also requires a lot of energy, since particle kinetic energy goes as the square of the velocity.

Particle rockets are distinguished by emitting particles from an internal source, while the next section, External Particle Interactions, covers methods that employ particles in the environment, either natural or man-made.


====54 Pulsed Fission Nuclear Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Orion 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Nuclear Detonation

'''Description:''' A series of small atomic bombs yield debris/particles which push against a plate/shock absorber arrangement. The shock absorber evens out the explosion pulses to a steady acceleration for the vehicle.  Issues with this method are not so much technical feasibility as risks of using it near Earth and having a shipload of nuclear weapons, not to mention the radiation levels for crew and cargo.  Benefits are the enormous potential payload and high acceleration.  A possible application is moving dangerous asteroids.  That would not take very many bombs, and the pusher plate/shock absorber could be made from asteroidal metals, even from the asteroid you are moving.  

Other applications might involve moving large amounts of material in the outer Solar System, or starting interstellar trips.  Far away from Earth the issue of radiation added to the environment is not as significant, since solar and cosmic radiation are already present in large amounts.

'''Status:'''  Atomic bombs are well tested (unfortunately).  A demonstration of the pusher plate technology was done in small scale with conventional explosives.

'''Variations:'''
:'''54a Antimatter Catalyzed Pulsed Nuclear''' - This speculative method uses antimatter triggered implosion of plutonium targets.  In theory this would lower the critical mass to ~ 2 grams significantly lowering the size threshold for pulsed nuclear.
:'''54b Implosion Driver Pulsed Nuclear''' - Standard fission bombs are triggered by a chemical implosion.  This method substitutes a laser, ion beam, or other external driver to collapse the fuel load.  It potentially reduces the critical mass with a stronger collapse than chemicals can achieve, or by using a different isotope.

====55 Inertial Confinement Nuclear Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Microfusion Engine

'''Type:''' Atomic particles by Fission or Fusion Reactor

'''Description:''' There are two major methods being pursued for fusion power.  Magnetic confinement holds a hot plasma in a more or less steady state long enough for fusion reactions to produce net power.  Inertial methods use lasers or particle beams to compress a fuel pellet to high pressure and temperature such that the fusion reaction happens very fast, after which it rapidly expands.  Both methods can be applied to space propulsion.  Magnetic confinement was addressed at '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Ion_and_Plasma_Engines#52_Fusion_Heated_Plasma_Engine Fusion Heated Plasma Engine]''', and this method addresses Inertial confinement.

A fuel pellet consists of a fusion core material, such as a Deuterium/Tritium mix, surrounded by a liner to optimally absorb the laser or particle beam energy.  Optionally a fission shell surrounds the fusion core. This is similar to the arrangement of a fusion atomic bomb. Alternately particle beams can consist of fissionable heavy ions or fusible light element ions, or even highly accelerated solid pellets of inert or reactive fuels.  The end result in all cases is a rapidly expanding cloud of highly energetic particles.  These are directed by a shaped magnetic field or pusher plate to produce thrust.  Thrust can be varied by how often you generate the explosions.

'''Status:''' Inertial confinement fusion is being researched for power generation.  A chemical implosion is also the method by which most nuclear bombs are set off. 

'''Variations:''' Multiple variations are possible by combining:

* Compression sources: laser, particle/ion beams, or solid pellets, 
* Type of central target: none in the case of colliding pellets, fission and/or fusion fuel ingredients, 
* Type of pellet liner: none or what material, and 
* Thrust method: physical or magnetic nozzle

====56 Alpha Particle Emitter==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Radioactive Decay

'''Description:''' A radioactive element coats one side of a thin sheet which is capable of absorbing alpha particles. The particles emitted into the sheet are absorbed, while the particles emitted in the opposite direction escape, providing net thrust. Advantages are this is a simple device, and heating of the sheet can produce power as a side effect via thermoelectric or heat engine.  Disadvantages are low thrust, and you cannot turn off radioactivity.  You would have to close two plates so they face each other to neutralize thrust, and open them like a book to turn the thrust on.

'''Status:''' Alpha emitters are well known.  Using them for propulsion is theoretical so far. 

'''Variations:''' Choice of radioactive material allows a wide range thrust levels.

====57 Fission Fragment Engine====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Fission Reactor

'''Description:''' Thin wires containing fissionable material are arranged to allow the nuclear fragments from the fission to escape. They are allowed to decay naturally for low thrust devices, or arranged in a nuclear critical arrangement for high thrust.  The fragments are aimed by electrostatic or electromagnetic fields to mostly go out the back end of the thruster. The performance is very high because of the high speed of the fragments.  The fission decay tends to damage whatever the wires are made of, so provision for replacing or reforming the wires would be needed for long term use. 

'''Status:''' Currently theoretical only.

====58 Pure Fusion Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Fusion Reactor

'''Description:''' Various thermonuclear fusion reactors have been proposed.  The results of a fusion reaction are high energy particles which can, in principle, be harnessed for propulsion.  This differs from 52 Fusion Heated Plasma Engine in that no additional fuel is added beyond the fusion reactants. Instead the high temperature plasma or escaping charged particles are used directly as rocket exhaust. Since a break even fusion reaction has not been achieved as of yet, this remains a theoretical concept. 

The actual method of containing the fusion plasma will influence the design of the rocket and its feasibility, in particular the mass of the device. A tokamak or stellarator plasma containment device would present the largest problems in siphoning off plasma for propulsion and their large weight would lead to an uninspiring thrust to mass ratio. Inertial confinement fusion using high power lasers or x-rays on small targets would probably be easier to build into a propulsion device, however the enormous size of the lasers and x-ray generators of current internal fusion projects would lead to the same problem with the thrust to mass ratio.

'''Status:''' Significant research is in progress for fusion in general.  Applications to space propulsion are theoretical. Besides the large funding for magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, there are several alternate approaches that have lower funding levels.

'''Variations:''' 

:* '''58a Magnetic Confinement''' - Plasma in a chamber similar to a tokamak fusion power reactor is intentionally leaked to a magnetic nozzle. 
:* '''58b Inertial Confinement''' - The fuel pellet is heated and compressed by lasers, electron beam, or ion beam. After fusing, the resulting plasma is directed by a magnetic nozzle.
:* '''58c Electrostatic Confinement''' - The fusion fuel is confined by a spherical potential well of order 100 kV. When the fuel reacts, the particles are ejected with energy of order 2 MeV, so escape the potential well. The potential well is at the focus of a paraboloidal shell, which reflects the fusion particles to the rear in a narrow beam (20-30 degree width).
:* '''58d Plasma Mantle Confinement''' - The fusion fuel is contained in a toroidal/poloidal current pattern, similar to a Tokamak except all the currents are in the plasma. The current pattern is surrounded by a plasma sheath which isolates the fuel from a surrounding working fluid. The fluid provides mechanical compression, which heats the fuel to fusion ignition. After the fuel burn is completed, the energy generated heats the working fluid to high temperature, which then goes out a nozzle producing thrust.
:* '''58e Dense Plasma Focus''' - A high current discharge in a radial arrangement causes the plasma to collapse to high temperature and pressure.  This is being developed by '''[http://www.lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/ Lawrenceville Plasma Physics]''' in Middlesex, New Jersey.  This device has a reported fusion energy of 0.044 Joules vs capacitor energy of 50 kJoules.  The output vs input energy ratio is a measure of how close the device is to practical operation.
:* '''58f Magnetized Target Fusion''' - Colliding plasma balls are further compressed by acoustic shock waves generated by mechanical drivers.  '''[http://www.generalfusion.com/ General Fusion]''' near Vancouver, Canada is researching this method.

'''''Abstract:''''' Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion systems, with propulsion thrust- power-input-power ratio (the thrust-power &quot;gain&quot; G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are always quite small (e.g., G(t)&lt;0.8). With these, &quot;high-thrust&quot; interplanetary flight is not possible, because system acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer &quot;high-thrust&quot; flight capability. One performance example shows a 53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in Earth/moon space.)

'''''This note is 20 years old and needs updating:''''' Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKª innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. (I strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently declared Koloc's PLASMAKª precursor, the spheromak, to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the PLASMAKª looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery)

====59 Neutral Particle Beam Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A high energy (order 50 MeV) particle accelerator generates a proton beam. This beam is neutralized (combined with electrons to make neutral atoms), then ejected. The exhaust is moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, so performance is very high. This type of machine was explored under the US missile defense program as a way of destroying missiles (with the beam). The energy required for space propulsion with this method exceeds the energy available from nuclear fusion, so it only makes sense with antimatter or external power sources such as a laser.

'''Status:'''  Particle accelerators of this energy have existed since the mid-20th century.  What limits this method is lack of a power supply, so it remains untested. 

'''Variations:'''

* '''59a Near Lightspeed Probe''' - If the particle accelerator produces very high energy protons, such that relativistic mass increase is significant, and the power source is a very powerful laser located at the origin star, and focused using the star as a gravitational lens, the rocket equation no longer constrains the final velocity.  Velocities close to the speed of light would be possible, and stopping would be possible by pointing the accelerator in the opposite direction.  Acceleration in this case is limited by the power to mass ratio of the power conversion and particle accelerator hardware.

====60 Antimatter Annihilation==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Atoms and anti-atoms (or their constituent particles) annihilate, producing pions, then muons, then gamma rays. The charged particles can be acted upon by a magnetic nozzle. The gamma rays can be absorbed by a container, and the resulting heat used to supply power. Antimatter provides the highest theoretical energy fuel (100% matter to energy conversion), although the overhead involved with storing antimatter may reduce the practical efficiency to a level comparable to other propulsion methods. 

'''Status:''' Small amounts of antimatter have been created and temporarily stored at particle accelerator labs.  At present, antimatter is not thought to exist naturally in large quantities.

===B. External Particle Interactions=== 


====61 Magsail==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The magsail operates by placing a large superconducting loop in the solar wind or planetary ion stream. The current loop produces a magnetic field that deflects the ions, producing a reaction force.  Because of the large area covered by the loop, which is mostly empty, it can develop a relatively large force for a given mass.  It is limited in direction and strength by the local solar wind or ion flow. 

'''Status:''' Magnetic field interaction with an ion stream is well understood.  Practicality of this method depends on an efficient enough design.  Has not been tested as of 2012.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 

 
====62 External Particle Beam==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A remote particle beam source aims it at a target vehicle. The particles are either absorbed or reflected to generate thrust directly, or their kinetic energy is used as a power source for some other type of propulsion.  The major issue is keeping the beam narrow enough to be a useful energy transfer method. 

'''Status:''' Untested as of 2012 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 


====63 Interstellar Ramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Bussard Ramjet 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A large funnel or inlet is used to compress interstellar gas, which is then fed to a fusion reactor for propulsion. Because of the low density of the interstellar medium, an extraordinarily large scoop is required to get any useful thrust. Performance is limited by the exhaust velocity of the fusion reaction to a few percent of the speed of light.  In other words, collecting the gas causes drag, and at the exhaust velocity of the reactor there will be no net thrust.  This makes the system an efficient decelerator by pointing the exhaust forward.  In that case the drag and reverse thrust both act to slow the vehicle.  Variable density of interstellar gas affects the viability of this method.  By running the reactor partly off of internal fuel, this type of vehicle can be brought to high enough velocity for the collector to start to function, and then to go to higher velocities.  By having the reactor use less fuel than collected, it can be self-refueling.

'''Status:''' Although the concept dates back to 1960, it is untested due to a lack of practical fusion reactors.

====64 Interstellar Scramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description''': Similar to the interstellar ramjet, the interstellar medium is compressed to fusion density and temperature. In this concept it is only compressed laterally, then re-expanded against a nozzle. Incredible vehicle sizes and lengths are required to reach fusion conditions, but since lateral compression does not cause as much drag as full compression, it is not limited by the exhaust velocity.  Thus speed may reach a substantial fraction of the speed of light. 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:'''


====65 External Fuel Supply====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description''': Any propulsion system which stores all it's fuel at the start has an exponential fuel requirement as a function of velocity.  If added fuel is delivered by a particle or pellet stream, either from behind or positioned ahead, that exponential requirement is turned into a linear one.  This is because at each point the vehicle is only accelerating itself (plus a small amount of fuel), instead of the vehicle plus all the fuel for the entire mission.  In the latter case you are using fuel early to accelerate fuel for later, which causes the exponential overhead.

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' Lots of variations are possible in terms of what fuel is delivered, and if it is formed into a particle stream, discrete pellets, or container tanks of fuel.  Incidentally this can also be used for other types of supplies than fuel, but that belongs in the Engineering Methods section.

This link is to the 1978 text version of the compiled data, known as the '''USAF DATCOM''', which is a 3134 page, 113 MB .pdf file. Since then, versions of the data and formulas have been compiled into software modules, which can be run by themselves, or linked into more comprehensive airplane design software.

The actual atmosphere varies from these standard conditions due to weather, the solar cycle, and secular changes such as increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  The reference data is still useful for doing calculations, and formulas based on this data have been incorporated into software programs and modules within programs.

==Nuclear Rockets==

===Previous US Nuclear Rocket Program===

====Solid Core NTR Development====

McDonnell Douglas has a long association with nuclear propulsion, beginning with nuclear aircraft propulsion studies in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Haloulakos, V.E., et al|title=Nuclear Propulsion: Past, Present, and Future, Fifth Symposium on Space Nuclear Power Systems, Albuquerque 11-14 January 1988|pages=329-332}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additional work includes NERVA nuclear vehicle interplanetary flight studies, and solid core vehicle integration studies under contract to NASA in the 1960s. In 1971 studies were conducted on a Shuttle-launched Nuclear Shuttle System, which used the PEEWEE reactor. 

In 1972 LANL undertook a study of a small nuclear engine using NERVA technology and based on the PEEWEE reactor design, that could be used in the newly designed NASA Space Shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bohl, R.J., and Boudreau, J.E.|title=Direct Nuclear Propulsion: A White Paper|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|date=January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This engine would have weighed 2,555 Kg, using composite UC-ZrC-C fuel, with other parameters including the following: 

* Total Operating Period hours 2 1 
* Operating Cycles 20 3 
* Specific Impulse seconds 860 875 
* Thrust kN 71.6 73.0 
* Hydrogen Flow kg/sec 8.5 8.5 
* Thermal Power MWt 354 367 

Various other NERVA-derived propulsion concepts were considered, and LANL evaluated a range of mission applications. For instance, it was concluded that a nuclear-propelled orbital transfer vehicle could significantly reduce propellant launch requirements, based on mission models that envisioned from 145 to 872 Orbital Transfer Vehicle flights. The authors concluded that developments in non-nuclear nozzle and turbo-pump technology in the Space Shuttle Main Engine program have enhanced the viability of NERVA derived engines. 

LANL mission analyses have identified significant reductions in Initial Mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO) through the use of NERVA technology:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howe, Steven|title=Assessment of the Advantages and Feasibility of a Nuclear Rocket for a Manned Mars Mission, Manned Mars Mission Workshop|publisher=Marshall Space Flight Center|location=Huntsville, AL|date= 10-14 June 1985|id=Preprint LA-UR-85-2442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs of developing a flight-ready nuclear rocket was estimated to be $4-5 billion, which included the cost of rebuilding the 1960s NERVA capability, which was estimated to include:

This analysis also considered issues associated with testing, noting that: 

&quot;The major obstacle to testing at NTS will be the reduced levels of radioactive debris which are allowed to transport into the public domain. The levels are more stringent than those present during the NERVA program. The current exposure limits of 150 m Rem to civilian personnel may restrict the tests of the NTR to low power levels and mass flows in the reactor... A simple solution to this problem may be to utilize one of the Pacific Ocean Islands owned by the United States -- namely Johnston Island... (an) ecological desert of ocean surrounds the area due to the stagnation of the return of the Japanese current...&quot; 


'''ANL Cermet Program'''

From 1961 through 1967 Argonne National Laboratory conducted a development program for nuclear rocket fuel elements independently of the Rover/NERVA program.&lt;ref name=Horman&gt;{{cite book|author=Horman, F.J., et al|title=Particle Fuels Technology for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, AIAA/NASA/OAI Conference on Advanced SEI Technologies|location=Cleveland, Ohio|date=4-6 September 1991|id=Paper AIAA 91-3457}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although no engines were fabricated or tested, extensive work was conducted on testing ceramic fuel configurations. Thermal shock tests suggested that these cermet fuels could have substantial tolerance to the effects of nuclear excursions. This program was terminated in 1967, prior to its completion.

'''Evaluation'''

Two major problems were identified during the Rover/NERVA program: 

Core disassembly due to vibration, accompanied by cracking of the fuel matrix and loss of material into the propellant flow; 

Loss of fuel matrix uranium and carbon due to coating erosion and cracking, and through diffusion through the coating. 


The first problem was resolved by changed designs which reduced vibration and matrix cracking. 

However, the second problem, of fuel element corrosion, proved less tractable:&lt;ref name=Horman/&gt;

&quot;Corrosion was most pronounced in the mid-range region, about a third of the distance from the cold end of the fuel element. Fuel operating temperatures were lower here than the fabrication temperatures, hence thermal stresses were higher than at the hot end. Also, the neutron flux was highest in this region...&quot; 

&quot;No fuel element geometry or fuel material ever totally solved the NERVA fuel element degradation problem. Mass loss of both uranium and carbon continued to limit service life by causing significant perturbation to core neutronics during the tests. Crack development in the fuel element coating was never completely eliminated.... Non-nuclear testing of coated fuel elements revealed an Arrhenius relationship between diffusion and temperature. For every 205 K increase in temperature (in the range 2400 to 2700 K), the mass loss increased by a factor of ten... resulting in loss of 20% of total uranium in approximately 5 hours of testing at 2870 K.&quot; 

A number of other program management lessons emerged from this period. One analysis notes that:&lt;ref name=Horman/&gt;

&quot;One overriding lesson from the NERVA program is that fuel and core development should not be tied simply to a series of engine tests which require expensive nuclear operation. Definitive techniques for fuel evaluation in loops or in non-nuclear heated devices should be developed early and used throughout the program...&quot;

====Solid Core NTR Tests====

The initial series of nuclear rocket tests was conducted by Los Alamos National Laboratory, under the KIWI program, which eventually cost $177 million (in then year dollars). 

Graphite was chosen as the internal structural material for these nuclear reactors for several reasons. It has excellent strength at high temperatures and its strength actually increases at higher temperatures. In addition, in contrast to metals which are strong neutron absorbers, graphite acts as a moderator, reducing the amount of enriched uranium required in the core. The great disadvantage of graphite, however, is that it quickly erodes in the presence of hot hydrogen. While this erosion cannot be eliminated, techniques are available to reduce erosion to acceptable levels over the operating lifetime of the reactor, which is measured in minutes to hours. 

Westinghouse was the prime contractor for the reactor component of the NERVA program, while Aerojet was the contractor for engine elements such as pumps and nozzles. The NERVA program resulted in an investment of $662 million (then-year dollars) for development and testing of flight engine prototypes.&lt;ref name=Horman&gt;{{cite book|author=Horman, F.J., et al|title=Particle Fuels Technology for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, AIAA/NASA/OAI Conference on Advanced SEI Technologies|location=Cleveland, Ohio|date=4-6 September 1991|id=Paper AIAA 91-3457}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first nuclear rocket test, conducted in July 1959, used uncoated UO2 plates as fuel elements. This test reached a maximum temperature of 2683 K and a power level of 70 MWt. Vibrations during operations produced significant structural damage in the reactor core. 

The first nuclear reactor tested, KIWI-A, successfully demonstrated the principle of nuclear rockets, but it used unclad fuel plates that were not representative of later tests. 

;KIWI A test :  This test, conducted in July 1959, incorporated significant modifications in the core design used in KIWI A. The fuel consisted of short cylindrical Uranium Oxide elements in graphite modules, with four axial channels coated with Niobium Carbide using chemical vapor deposition. The reactor ran for 6 minutes at power levels as high as 85 MWt. 

; KIWI-A prime : tested in 1960, replaced the fuel plates with NbC plated graphite modules with 4 micron diameter UO2 particles embedded in the graphite matrix. However, some structural damage occurred in this improved design during its 6 minute test. 

; KIWI A3 : The subsequent KIWI-A3 reactor used a higher temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition process, resulting in a thicker NbC coat with improved adherence. Some core damage occurred during the 5 minute test in October 1959, which reached power levels of 100 MWt, with some fuel elements showing blistering and corrosion. Generally this reactor test was considered successful. 

; KIWI B1A : Using the same UO2 fuel as KIWI A3, the fuel element design was changed to a 7 channel configuration 66 cm long, with niobium carbide coatings. The December 1961 test, which was intended to reach 1100 MWt, only reached 300 MWt, and was terminated after 30 seconds due to a fire caused by a hydrogen leak in the reactor exhaust nozzle. 

; KIWI B1B : This September 1962 test, which was essentially a repeat of the KIWI B1A test, achieved a power level of 900 MWT, but was terminated within a few seconds when several fuel elements were ejected from the reactor exhaust nozzle. 

; KIWI B2 : Design configuration not tested. 

;  KIWI B3 :Design configuration not tested. 

; KIWI B4A : This reactor incorporated substantial redesigns based on the failure of the KIWI B1B configuration. The fuel elements were fully extruded hexagonal graphite blocks 1.32 meters long and 19 millimetres in diameter, with 19 cooling channels, each 2.3 millimetres in diameter. However, the test run in November 1962 was terminated when bright flashes in the exhaust stream indicated vibration induced damage to the core was leading to its disintegration. 

; KIWI B4B : Design configuration not tested. 

; KIWI B4C : Design configuration not tested. 

; KIWI B4D : Although modifications in the design of this reactor eliminated the vibration which had marred previous tests, the May 1964 test was terminated after about 60 seconds at full power due to the rupture of a nozzle cooling tube. 

; KIWI B4E : This reactor was the first to use coated Uranium Carbide (UC2) fuel, in place of the Uranium Oxide (UO2) fuel previously used. To avoid oxidation of the Carbide fuel, it the uranium fuel particles were coated with a 25 micron layer of pyrolytic graphite which exuded water vapor. This pyrolytic carbon layer subsequently was also used to enhance fission product retention, though this was not initially its purpose. This reactor was operated for 12 minutes, including 8 at full power. The duration of the test was limited by the available liquid hydrogen storage capability. 

; KIWI TNT : This KIWI-B type reactor was deliberately destroyed on January 1965 by subjecting it to a fast excursion. This test was intended to confirm theoretical models of transient behaviour. 

; Phoebus 1A : This first test of a new class of reactors on June 1965 included over 10 minutes of operations at 1090 MWt, with an exhaust temperature of 2370 K. 

; Phoebus 1B : This February 1967 test built on the previous Phoebus 1A test, reaching power levels of 1500 MWt for 30 minutes, with an additional 15 minutes at lower power levels. 

; Phoebus 2A : The most powerful nuclear reactor of any type ever constructed, with a design power level of 5,000 MWt. Operations in June 1968 were limited to 4,000 MWt dur to premature overheating of of aluminium segments of pressure vessel clamps. At total of 12.5 minutes of operations at temperatures of up to 2310 K included intermediate power level operations and reactor restart. 

; PEWEE : This small reactor was intended to be a reactor testbed, incorporating Zirconium Carbide coatings on some fuel elements, instead of the Niobium Carbide used on Phoebus. With a peak operating power of 503 MWt at 2550 K, it achieved new levels of core power density (2340 MWt/m3 average and 5200 MWt/m3 peak), demonstrating a specific impulse of 845 seconds. 

; Nuclear Furnace 1 : The final phase of NERVA fuel development was the Nuclear Furnace (NF-1) reactor, a heterogeneous water-moderated beryllium-reflected reactor for high-temperature nuclear testing of fuel elements and other components. 47 of the 49 fuel elements used Uranium Carbide and Zirconium Carbide Carbon composite fuel, while the remaining 2 fuel elements used Uranium-Zirconium Carbide. Tests in 1972 of composite fuel elements with various carbide contents, thermal expansion coefficients, and thermal stress resistance demonstrated that minimizing the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient between the fuel and coating would reduce coating cracking and carbon erosion. With a peak operating power of 44 MWt at 2500 K, it achieved new levels of core power density (4500 to 5000 MWt/m3). 

The Nuclear Furnace test facility included provisions for remote controlled replacement of core elements, as well as a reactor effluent scrubber system to remove radioactive contaminants from the propellant exhaust. 

; Nuclear Furnace 2 : This reactor was built but not tested, due to the cancellation of all work in this area in 1972. The goals of this experiment included testing of a novel coated particle fuel, using a graphite fuel matrix with a coefficient of thermal expansion closely matched to that of the coating, to reduce thermal stress and cracking. 

; NRX-A1 

; NRX-A2 : This September 1964 engine test included 5 minutes of operation at half to full power levels. Duration of the test was limited by available hydrogen storage capacity. At full power of 1100 MWt the engine demonstrated a specific impulse of 760 seconds. 

; NRX-A3 : This April 1965 test operated for 8 minutes, including 3.5 minutes at full power. The first test was terminated by a spurious trip from the turbine overspeed circuit. The reactor was restarted on May 1965, and operated at full power for 13 minutes, and subsequently restarted for low to medium power operations for an additional 45 minutes. In total, 66 minutes of operations were accumulated, including 16.5 minutes at full power. 

; NRX-EST : This engine operated for a total of 110 minutes, including 28 minutes at full power of 1100-1200 MWt, on five different days in February 1966. 

; NRX-A5 : This 1100 MWt engine was operated in June 1966 for 30 minutes at full power, with the test duration limited by available hydrogen storage capacity. 

; NRX-A6 : This 1100 MWt engine was operated in December 1967 for 60 minutes at full power, exceeding the NERVA design goal. 

; XECF 

; XE' : This 1100 MWt engine was a prototype engine, the first to operated in a downward firing position. It accumulated a total of 28 start cycles in March 1968 for a total of 115 minutes of operations. Test stand coolant water storage capacity limited each full power test to about 10 minutes.

Thank you for making the [[Java Programming]] wikibook so much better.
An even bigger thank you for making Java itself better.

Often I find a &quot;module&quot; here on wikibooks that could use a better title.
The best and easiest way to change the title is to use the (oddly named) &quot;move&quot; tab,
at the top between the &quot;edit&quot; tab and the &quot;watch&quot; tab.
(Unfortunately, too many people create a new page with the better title,
then try to cut-and-paste into the new page. That's more difficult to do correctly).
See [[Help:Pages#Moving]] for details.
(I suspect you didn't know this trick when you created [[Java Programming/Overview]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rename Project ==

The project Basic Dog Training, which seems quite stalled, should be renamed to Positive Only Basic Dog Training.
It advocates a specific point of view, that of Positive Trainers.
Wiki guidelines specify a NEUTRAL, unbiased POV.
For a title such as BASIC dog training, it clearly contradicts the guidelines.

== Move and NPOV ==

I have merged this article into the main dog care book. However, it was previously a separate book advocating positive dog training, so a section on punishing dogs needs to be introduced. [[wikipedia:user:pcu123456789|PCU123456789]] ([[wikipedia:user_talk:pcu123456789|talk]]) 20:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

:Modern Behaviorists and behavior based trainers greatly dispute the meaning and need for punishment. Recent studies indicate that for basic family pets, Positive Reinforcement training is superior to other kinds of punishment based training, due to the fewer negative side effects.
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Renodogmom|Renodogmom]] ([[User talk:Renodogmom|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Renodogmom|contribs]]) 05:46, July 6, 2007.&lt;/small&gt;

::That is fine, but unless Positive Only Training is a consensus, Punishment should be covered for the sake of NPOV. The reader should then be provided with information to decide for himself/herself which approach to take. Anyway, I'd feel better if people are punishing animals in a &quot;proper&quot; way instead of deciding for themselves how to do it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What's the connection between Blender and Wings 3D ? ==

David - What particular aspect of reading about Blender is going to help a Wings user (esp. a noob) better get to grips with using Wings?

Whilst it's acknowledged that Blender is a darned good app. (I know of quite a few Wings users that also use it) - I doubt that even they would suggest there's a lot of similarity with GUI / workflow etc.

Rather than being on the front page, I'd have thought this was better located in a more general 'Useful links' type of place - or apps to try / use for features that wings doesn't have eg Animation / rendering etc?

pp

(I realise you've cross-referenced these 2 apps - and I'd suggest the same comments are valid the other way round?)

btw - if this seems a negative comment, ie what not to have here, under 'Further reading' - I'd have thought pointers to material about aspects of modelling / edgeloops / techniques etc would be more appropriate - ie stuff that might answer queries / help someone getting to grips with what it's all about ...

''If you want to rename that section &quot;useful links&quot;, that's fine with me. (Or is there another one I overlooked?)''
''As you know, the table of contents of a wikibooks links &quot;deeper&quot; to pages with more detail. But sometimes search engines send people to a page deep in the middle of a wikibook. Imagine that I stumble upon a page in the middle of the Wings 3D book and I think it's great. Do you think I would like to know about the existence of the rest of the book? Of course I would, so I find the link &quot;up&quot; to the table of contents useful.''

''I feel it is very important that every page link &quot;up&quot;.''

''Some books have heavily nested content, so I have to go &quot;up&quot; a few times to get from a page, to a section summary, to the title page. I think it's useful to keep going &quot;up&quot;, so I can find out not just about closely-related pages, but also closely related books.''
''Is there any wikibook more closely related to this Wings 3D book than the Blender book? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:03, 16 January 2006 (UTC)''

== edit link ==
#2 - What's the purpose of the link bringing the reader back to the page that they're reading the link on? (or at least the edit box for same)

''You're talking about the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[edit]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; link on the right side?''
''It's a &quot;feature&quot; of the software used by wikibooks.org .''
''It looks pretty silly on this page.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==RE: General points==
Hey TP again here!

First of all, a sincere and absolute thanks to all the people who has contributed to this book.

I know it might seem arrogant to show up out of nowhere and critisize the structure, and please take it for what it is. Just another opinion! Believe it or not, im just trying to be helpful in the spirit of the wikipeople. 

Just a short comment to your points.

1 &amp; 2 # I agree. I will time stamp this one, and future comments.

3 # I Agree.

4 # You are right about information being duplicated. But I was thinking of a set of crossreferences. I.ex: a pitching article, would apply to producers, screenwriters and directors. One could simply have the same article linked to several places. And add links under the article to whatever other areas it touches on. I believe this can be achieved using categories.

4b # Changing the structure of the book, you are right it would be a huge job. And it would'nt look very good while it was implemented and experimented forth.

What about starting with making categories for the different work fields? And inserting the appropriate articles there? It would not interfere with the rest of the book.

Kind regards

- TP

==General points==

Hi, I'm Jack - one of the people who set up the MMM.  I'd like to make some general points to the comments below:

# It's great that this book is gaining momentum - thanks loads to everyone getting involved!
# Please PLEASE sign and date-stamp your comments!
# I agree that this book should be readable by noobs.  But I also feel very strongly that this book should aim to satisfy the needs of both the noob and the practicing professional.  And I believe that _is_ possible - we just need good introductory chapters to help frame the more complex stuff.  And, to be honest, the web is already full of material that caters for noob filmmakers.
# The structure of the book aims to reflect the structure of a film production.  The problem with having &quot;for directors&quot; or &quot;for producers&quot; section is that lots of material would end up getting duplicated.  For example, pretty much everyone on a film production needs to know the basics of cinematography, for example.  Also, changing the structure of the book would be a big, BIG job - you'd have to change every single page title, every category name, every link etc.

== Structure of the whole book ==
I find the whole structure of this book somewhat confusing. And as I see it, the better the structure, it will be more useful and one would also get more input, and the better the book! So from my point of view this is very important. One has to think of the users. Probably many are beginning filmmakers like me, and it is called the '''Movie Making Manual'''.

I would like to suggest a break down of the articles along the following lines:

1. '''For directors'''. Here I would put all material concerning the artistic choices while making a film, as well as a description of the directors usual role in the process. Actors, film techiques, film theory, film language, locations etc. Ofcourse bordering subjects like stories and scriptwriting must also be here, in addition to the other categories.

2. '''For producers'''.  Description of the producers role, budgeting, organizing etc etc.

3. '''Cinematographers'''. Techiques, looks, light and cameras, etc. 

4. '''Scriptwriters'''. Scriptwriting, survinging, selling, pitching, copyrighting, organizations etc.

5. '''Sound and sound design'''. Techical and artistic information

6. '''Editing'''. Theory and practicalities.

7.''' Other functions''': need its own submenu. Lights, set design, props, AD'ing! and so forth.

8. '''Film theory''': The basis

This is the approach most film schools work from, and I personally think they might be right.
It would also be good to have colored blocks with this on the front page. I honestly think this would increase the readability and usefulness of the book. My only question is whether there is enough content yet for such a structure.

So whats your opinions?

Regards

TP.

(And what are the rules about linking to wikipedias many good articles regarding film and filmmaking? Can we simply steal them?)
(I would also wish upon a stronger emphasis on making short films, as in reality, most people who make features, or are making their first, know most of the stuff here. Through making short films!)

==Movie Making Manual Formatting==
Hi, I've got a few suggestions how to make the Movie Making Manual easier to read:
* Make the colorful banners half their current size to streamline the layout, they will still stand out enough, but currently they overwhelm the page
* Categories like [[:Category:Writing_movies]] are difficult to read because all articles start with &quot;Movie Making Manual-&quot; or &quot;MMM/&quot;. How about naming each article so that it can stand on its own (no more &quot;MMM&quot; and &quot;Movie Making Manual-&quot; in article titles), and use the top navigation and categorization features to bind them all together?
Feedback, Suggestions? [[User:Cramer|Cramer]] 10:38, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

: Hi Cramer.  Thanks loads for your feedback.  You're right, the MMM is in a bit of a mess.  To answer your two suggestions:
:* Banners: I certainly don't mind if you modify them, sounds like a good idea.  Cauri is the guy who designed the banners but I'm not sure whether or not he's got the time to contribute to the MMM at the moment.
:* Page Naming.  Yes, it's in a bit of a mess. First off, category names of the form [[:Category:Writing_movies]] are depreciated because they violate the WikiBooks naming convention... instead we're slowly switching over to category names of the form [[:Category:MMM:writing]] (i.e. prefixing the category names with MMM).  I'd love to find a way to strip away all the uglyness from the page names but I'm not sure it's allowed (unless you know of some cool new MediaWiki feature I don't know about?).  The page names of the form MMM-Page Name are now depreciated and we're slowly moving over to MMM/Chapter/Page Name.  I'm a big fan of the forward-slash system because it puts breadcrumb trails at the top of each page which helps navigation.  I'm pretty sure we're obliged by the WikiBooks naming convention to include the book name in every page title.  As far as I'm aware, the only way to have an entire book that has &quot;clean&quot; page titles like &quot;Page Title&quot; would be to install and run our own wiki.  Take a look at [[MMM/Preface/How You Can Help]] for more detailed info about our existing naming system.
: [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 17:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
::I would like to see (all of?) the modules for the Movie Making Manual be subpages of said book. We currently have several different ways of doing page naming with this book. [[User:Midnightcomm|Midnightcomm]] 19:51, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
::: Yes, I appologise for the mess.  If you have some time it would be great if you could help migrate the book naming from the old &quot;Movie Making Manual-Page Name&quot; form to the new &quot;MMM/Chapter Name/Page Name&quot; form. [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 15:16, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

== Module merge to use ==

This is a suggestion from the people who are working on this book.

The following module may be useful to merge into this Wikibook somehow:  [[VideoCodecs]]

If you choose not to use this Wikibook module, please add the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|orphaned module not needed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to that page, so we can get rid of it.  Otherwise rename the module to conform to the naming conventions here. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

: OK, thanks.  We'll adopt it.  Looks very useful.  Thanks. [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 14:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Superlatives! ==

Hi there - can i just say, what a find this wikibook is! It's really great - it looks good, it's exciting - great work! It's been my burning desire for well over ten years to make a film, and I might just be dipping in to get some tips or add my own if I can. I haven't looked at everything, but I think it would be good to have a bit more on storyboarding, ie images that actually show an extreme close-up, wide angle etc. Also, has anyone heard of the [[m:Wikimentary|Wikimentary]] idea? Basically, it is an idea for video files to be available to edit together collaboratively - how it will actually work is anyone's guess, but I thought you might be interested. And the films you mention as being in pre-production - are you developing them here as an idea/script/process, or just writing up about the experience after it's done? Anyway, keep up the good work!

== The Basic Basics ==

Hi. 

This movie making manual seems really promising. The only thing I'm wondering about is that seems a bit in-depth for people who are thinking about making their very first short movie. I mean, you don't really need to go through all the steps mentioned in the basic basics bit, if all you want to do is experiment with making a short story with a couple of actors, and editing it together on your computer. That said, I really like the idea of a movie making wiki like this, and hey, maybe I'll contribute some stuff myself in the future, if you'll allow, because I've made a few short movies myself. 

Cheers![[User:Doom jester|Doom jester]] 16:17, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== Formatting / Audience ==

In my opinion, the main target audience for this Wikibook should be people who are interested in low-budget indie filmmaking.  Most of the people who read this book will likely fall in this camp.  I don't think this site should be geared as much towards professionals, since the information is very specific (i.e. funding a feature in Canada is different than in the US, and features are different than music videos or corporate) and it's unlikely that there'd be enough knowledgeable contributors to get something going.

For people who want to get their feet wet in making films, I think the Wiki should be structured into two main areas:&lt;br&gt;
*There are course/guides which explains the general concepts.  It should provide just enough detail to produce a film, and not overwhelm the user with too much information!  There would be a bunch of modules or courses like:  My First Film 101, Lighting 101, Audio 101, etc.&lt;br&gt;
And then there could be another layer that goes more in depth... i.e. Lighting 201, Audio 201, Color Enhancement / Film Look 202, etc.

A &quot;My first film&quot; module would be the introduction for people like Doom jester, who don't want to wade through the entire wikibook and want to get their feet wet.

*A reference section, with in-depth information.  For example, there could be a section on grip equipment which lists all the various pieces of equipment, how to use it, and the applications.

==All The Steps are Necessary==

Anyone can make a motion picture.  All you have to do is learn '''all''' the steps. 

Learning only a few of the steps does NOT work.  Having a &quot;My First Film&quot; section would skip steps.  And when you skip steps, you will wonder why your movie does not look right.

It is like making a clock.  If you an eliminate some of the gears and wheels then you don't see the minutes, just the hours.

The steps of making a motion picture were developed in the mid 1930s after sound was added.  Since then, little has changed.  New technology such as digital video still requires the same steps.  The steps might be done differently now but they steps still need to be done.

'''Alternative #1''': If you do not want to learn all the steps, simply grab a camcorder and a Macintosh computer with Final Cut Express and begin.  Slowly, you will learn what filmmakers have learned 70 years ago.  Of all the ways of learning how motion pictures are made, this is the most fun way to learn.

'''Alternative #2''':  Become a PA.  Anyone can work on a motion picture by becoming a '''Production Assistant'''.  Today, you can go to the [http://www.troma.com Troma] website and look the section about volunteering to work on a movie.  Other studios are not as open about getting a job as a Production Assistant and in Hollywood, there is competition to become an unpaid Production Assistant.  Still, you can have an interesting experience and work on real motion pictures.

'''Alternative #3''': Become experienced with one step and do that for other filmmakers.  If you are extremely observant and take excellent notes, become '''script supervisor'''.   No degree is required to be a script supervisor.  One really good book and perhaps a one day class is all you need.  The job of script supervisor is the best possible vantage point for seeing everything that goes on during production of a motion picture.

'''Alternative #4''':  Learn film editing.  This is best training for anyone who wants to be a movie producer, a movie director, a film composer, a sound effects person and of course a motion picture editor.  In film editing, you control how the entire movie comes together.   In the past, this was very difficult since the only place you can edit real motion picture or television drama is inside the film studios or the post production houses of Hollywood.  However, now that every personal computer comes with an editing program, more and more companies are releasing film dailies from real motion pictures for you to edit at home.  If you cannot find any other source of unedited scenes, try the [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop].  In a few years, I think that even Apple computer will have unedited scenes from hot, new television dramas on the iTunes website for you to edit.

==Missing Steps==

There are lots of sections still missing in the book.  How do you add sections to the Table of Content for MMM?

'''Example #1''':  Animation is described as a way of creating visual effects.  The animation section of MMM does not explain that animation can be used to make entire motion pictures.   To be complete, this book should show all the steps of making an animated movie... which is in a different order than the steps for making a motion picture with a camera.

Anyone who can draw can buy a simple 2D animation program such as  [http://www.toonboom.com Toon Boom] and make their own feature film.  None of that in explained anywhere in this book so far.

Also, 3D character animation is not explained in the book.  Neither is the theory of using digital puppets which are 3D characters that you purchase off the shelf from companies such as [http://www.daz3d.com DAZ] and [http://www.e-frontier.com Poser].

All the steps of making an animated motion picture need to be explained.

'''Example #2''': The '''telecine''' section is listed last in post production.  It should also be listed first before editing.  Most telecine is done to prepare dailies for editing on personal computers.  Therefore, a new catagory should be added for '''Prep of film dailies''' or '''telecine of the dailies'''.  This seems like a trivial task but you will see that it is not once you read all that must be done to prepare a movie for editing.

Robert Purser, Editor, [http://www.digipuppet.com Digital Puppet magazine]

==Theory==

What exactly is intended to go in the theory chapter? I mean, isn't that sort of what all the other chapters cover?
[[User:Athox|Athox]] 23 September, 2006

:I think this section should be about critical theory and how film is interpreted (psychoanalytic, deconstruction, etc). If this seems appropriate, I'd love to start the page. However, I too am not 100% sure of the page's purpose. If this seems correct to everybody I could do a rough outline of the different approaches. Let me know if this approach to the page seems appropriate here or on the theory talk page.

== Deletion Request ==

Someone marked [[Movie Making Manual/Film_Academy Training]] for speedy deletion, which I changed to a votes for deletion due to my uncertainity of the situation. The reason given was it was an &quot;advertisement&quot;. Are the authors/editors aware of this and in agreement that it should be deleted?

== US Resources ==

I've noticed that a lot of the content in the MMM is directed towards the UK or applies to those only in the UK. I, for one, would like to see a lot more content that applies to the US, and other countries. Just a suggestion.

== Lets Bring MMM Back to LIFE! ==

Hi, I've recently found this wikibook, and I think it's feeling a little outdated and unorganized, (no offence) so I'm hoping we can bring this wikibook back to life with updated information and be an much more efficient read for people on the fly.
So, I have a few things I would like to add, first of all, Chapters? I saw it mentioned in the introduction, and I think it could be awesome. I like the Pre, Pro, and Post production, but in that, there are so many areas, Cinematography, being my more favoured area, there are like 4 pages, The perfect camera I have rewritten, but I think it is an orphan currently, so I'm going to try and structure what I can using the current system, but if anyone would like to help, PLEASE do.

Adjusted the IPA.  Several phonemes were posited which AFAIK do not occur.  Can't be sure about the syllable breaks between C clusters, but C.C seems the best bet for now, even in cases such as ''x'' and ''qu'' where it's easier to divide them .CC in orthography.

Hello, Magicfly. I've noticed your post on [[School of Magic:List of Participants]]. Could you tell me what's your reason to sign yourself in that list? Would you like to be a student, or would you like to participate to the School in some other way? --[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|George D. Bozovic]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:18, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

:I see, so you'll just be coming from time to time. :) Never mind, you may stay in the list of participants if you want. Well, see you sometimes! ;) --[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|George D. Bozovic]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:02, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

== Image licensing problem ==

* [[:Image:Standard.png]]
* [[:Image:Edgepalm1.png]]
* [[:Image:Hand.png]]
* [[:Image:Hand1.png]]

Recently you uploaded these four images without licensing information. (I suppose that you used the &quot;None selected (add license manually)&quot; menu item on [[Special:Upload]].) This means that other users do not know where these images are from, nor whether these images are under a free license, nor whether these images violate copyright by being at Wikibooks. Your images will be '''deleted''' if you do not provide suitable license information.

Could you please ''edit'' each image page (click the &quot;edit this page&quot; button on the image page) and provide:
* the '''source''' of the image (Did you draw these images yourself? Did you copy them from another web site?)
* the '''license''' &amp;ndash; You can replace the {{tl|no license}} tag with one from the [[WB:ICT|list of license tags]].

I suggest that you do this if possible, because the images are important for the [[Magic]] book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:06, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

Hello.  Thanks for adding some stuff to the &quot;Magic&quot; Wikibook!  Good stuff over all.  I do have one comment.  I found the &quot;What is a Magician&quot; section a bit breathless.  For example, the phrase, &quot;inspire people that may have no other realm of hope to continue clinging to.&quot; seems a bit over the top.

What do you think?

Also, from a style point of view, I'm not sure that it is necessary or appropriate to sign your contributions.  The page history will show what you added.

Thanks again,

Hiya, I was thinking of implementing [[de:Kochbuch/_Neues_Rezept/_Creator]], but noticed it got removed from the german Kochbuch. Why did that happen? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

: A new wikibooks-member removed it without explaination and I didn't noticed it. But now it is back. Sorry for beeing that late with my answer. I was quite busy. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 21:19, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

Grüß Gott,

ich schreibe hier, weil deine Seite auf de:b für IPs gesperrt ist. Man sitzt mir gewissermaßen im Nacken, weil in den WP-Artikeln zu Algorithmen tausend Implementierungen angegeben sind, die dem Artikel im Prinzip nicht nützen, aber einen eigenen Wert haben. wo stelle ich sie am besten hin? Ich möchte sie eigentlich nicht radikal umkrämpeln, ich denke, das hübsch an den listen ist, dass sie zeigen, wie versch. programmiersprachen mit standardaufgaben umgehen. ich möchte das ungern kommentierne, das schadet mehr als es nützt, denke ich. wäre so etwas auf wikibooks gut aufgehoben? Unter [[Bubblesort]] finden sich die bei weitem meisten. Richardigel [[User:217.230.137.132|217.230.137.132]] 00:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

This is a guide to becoming a good student. No matter who you are, if you try hard enough you can succeed!

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Preface|Preface]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 18, 2006}}  ==

This book is intended for those who are looking for some tips on improving their abilities, as a student and as a person. Implementing some of these ideas into academic life will surely help a student perform better in the classroom.

Hopefully everyone reading this work will learn something that they can do to become a better student and be more successful.

'''Qualities of a good student'''&lt;br&gt;
Today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders. The qualities of the student are of great impact to determine the student's bright future and career. So, who is a good student? What are the qualities of a good student? Historically, the term ‘student’ refers to anyone who learns something. However, the recent definition of a “student” is mostly used to refer to anyone who attends school, college, or university.

Again, what are the good qualities of a student? The list below shows the qualities of a good student.
# Attitude: Basically, a good student possesses the ability and willingness to learn new subjects even if the subjects are not interesting.
# Academic skills: Acquiring academic skills is the most important quality of a good student. Ability to read comprehensively, to write effectively, to speak fluently, and to communicate clearly are the key areas in which a student must be proficient. Having a good command in all these areas will make a student to shine in the class.
# Ability: A good student has the ability to apply the results of his or her learning into a creative way and achieve the goals.
# Perceptiveness: How well a student can interpret and perceive meanings from a conversation greatly determines the quality of a student. A good student always perceives right meaning from conversations, but an average student often misunderstands the original thoughts of a speaker or writer and derives a wrong conclusion.
# Self-Discipline: Discipline in managing the time is an important factor that every good student must possess. Often delaying the tasks, such as writing assignments, reading text books, etc, may negatively impact the ability of a student to achieve the goals.
# Understanding rather than memorizing concepts: Resolving any doubts by asking about them on the spot is always a good thing. Several surveys suggest students must understand the concepts rather than just memorize them. The memorized facts and theories will stay in student's memory until they leave school, college, or university. Once out of school, the students will totally forget the core concepts that they had learnt. Therefore, it is essential for a good student to understand the concepts.

{{TODO|comparison:student should have to compare with all students and read.&lt;br&gt;
behavior:student should have to know how to behave with his or her mates,teachers,parents and elders.}}

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 1 - Motivation|Chapter 1 - Motivation]]  {{stage short|25%|Jan 29, 2006}} ==

To become a good student, you need to get motivated! Motivation can come from seeing the situation of many poor children around the world who are not lucky enough to get a proper education. This is a good thing to keep in mind when you find yourself not wanting to attend class or study at home. Another reason to get motivated to study is that you will enjoy a better quality of life as an educated person.

All you need is confidence! For that, one need to feel that we are enjoying and bettering themselves, study can be looked as a competition and divided as a team task. You should avoid forcing yourself to study, as this will make learning a chore and you will not feel like even opening your books. You may have many academically good students in your courses, try becoming friends with them (or encourage your fellow students to be better), and you'll be immersed in an academic environment which will help you feel motivated!

{{NOTE|It must be pointed out that methods of evaluation may at times foster individualism and negative competition, preventing others to succeed will guarantee a greater recognition to those who do, sad but true. Life in most places is setup as a competition for scarcer opportunities. Especially in higher education, keeping the numbers and grades of competitors down has drastic implication for future opportunities. This is also one reason why some governments limit the availability of courses (how demographics and national interests influence specific fields of study) and interest groups lobby hard to increase requirements in the courses and to new entries in the job market.}}

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 2 - Concentration On Studies|Chapter 2 - Concentration On Studies]] {{stage short|50%|Jan 21, 2006}} ==

Concentration follows eagerness. This section provides you with the basics of &quot;Concentration&quot; and also provides you with advice as to how to get aroused with concentration.

You need to pay attention in a class. Don't start chatting with your peers/friends when the teacher turns their back to you. Even better, don't associate with distracting people. You should realize that the people in your class play an important role in how everybody progresses. However, if you are a good student you will do better and achieve your goals. Your friends will be there for you at that time, if they are trustful and of a good reputation. At home, study and do your homework in a place that doesn't make you sleepy. It is advisable to have a dedicated study table or desk. Don't do your study work on the bed or in front of the TV, radio, stereo, etc. That would be pointless because you are meant to be thinking about your studies. 

If you feel distracted, take a short break of 15 minutes or less; maybe try to read an unrelated story book. But don't start sticking to the book if the time limit is over. Bookmark the page and then you can read it later on. You should also have a daily routine/timetable to guide you, but you must follow it through. It might be difficult to begin with, but hard beginnings make good endings.

Avoid conflicts; this will move your attention from listening to what your teacher says! &quot;Honored zeros are better than copied hundreds&quot;. Avoid cheating. Be honest with yourself and others about what you have learned; if you don't know the answer leave it. Use it as a way to improve your knowledge of the subject. Remember, study well now, and you will have the chance to have fun after you achieve your goals!

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 3 - Behavior|Chapter 3 - Behavior ( Hardstyle Behavior)]]  {{stage short|50%|Jan 21, 2006}} ==

One of the main things that decides a person's or child's future is their behavior. Learning textbooks and achieving 100% is not enough. People should think that you are the only all-rounder that has good manners. Obey your elders, don't bully your classmates at school. Remember, try imagining yourself in the other person's situation, and you'll know how much you hurt them with your actions. Say hello to your teachers and schoolmates when you see them, people will appreciate your friendliness and be friendly in return. Use good manners in class.  Raise your hand, don't interrupt if someone is speaking, and if you don't have a nice thing to say, then don't say anything at all.

Above all, try helping your friends in any situation and you'll be remembered as one of the best friends at school! Don't just do it for a good reputation, but for a good future and for yourself. You should also know that words from your mouth are enough to break relationships (or worse) so don't utter foul, discouraging, or insulting words.  If someone is being rude, don't encourage them by laughing because that only makes them continue in their bad behavior.  

Don't take this as a lecture, but as a guideline! Behavior should be first and then comes academics. Even if you aren't good at school, you'll be famous for your behavior, and good friends are truly worth more than gold.

Your behaviour should be such in a way that it should impress others.

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 4 - Management|Chapter 4 - Management]] {{stage short|75%|Jan 22, 2006}} ==

This is one of the many questions that children ask their teachers, &quot;Ma'am, I can't study!&quot;. Let's ponder on these things : Are you devoted to studying? Are you just studying for your parents? Are you just cheating in exams for getting good grades and marks? The list goes on.

First of all, as mentioned above, study somewhere that has a basic study table. Don't study or read in dim light. If you become bored on learning one subject, study something else that interests you a lot. You must always find alternatives as you go!

We all know the saying,&quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot;. Yes, studying all night and not playing just stresses you on work and you'll forget everything the next morning. Play out for about 2 hours or so. It will be pleasant if you go out to play around in the evening, say 5 pm in the evening. This energizes you and gives you extra strength for everything you do.

Make a timetable. And that is all what this section is about. Arrange the time-table with the subjects that are tough for you in the first column. Then put a break column after every 2 subjects so you don't get strained.

Study on each subject for about 1 hour. Make small pauses of 10-15 minutes in between. You'll get refreshed. Use the time for something that takes your mind on the effort done, have a snack.

Try getting a good sleep. Humans are supposed to get 7 - 10 hours sleep (it goes down with age). If you don't get enough sleep, that will result in sluggishness, memory deficiency and your mind will be filled with the crave for the missing rest.

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 5 - Helping Others And Advising|Chapter 5 - Helping Others And Advising]]  {{stage short|25%|Jan 22, 2006}} ==

Apart from improving yourself, try spreading your skills among others. This is the section that provides you with all the things necessary in sharing your skills. Co-operation is helping each other out so everyone benefits, it's the opposite of competing, where everyone wants to win for themselves. Most learning is done with the help of others, so learning to cooperate is a valuable skill for anyone.
Study partners are a wonderful tool. They save time and they help reinforce what you have learned. Divide a reading assignment in half. Study your section using any and all note taking strategies you have (e.g., Venn diagrams, outlines, note cards, coloured highlighters). When you both have an understanding of your readings, take turns 'teaching/explaining' it to the other person. As you adjust your explanation to your partner, you will reinforce the concept for yourself. It works because as you think about how to explain the topic, you must understand it first! Teachers are like students who have a bit extra knowledge. To gain this knowledge visit libraries to read extra books.  If you are confused by a book you are reading, ask your teacher. It really helps.

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Conclusion|Conclusion]]  {{stage short|25%|Jan 22, 2006}} ==
You need to be successful in all classes and not mess about talking to friends and keep to the school rules.  You can achieve things by setting targets for yourself and working towards them.
Nobody is perfect in every subject. You have strengths and weaknesses that you have to accept. As long as you try hard every day, you will be successful. Sometimes success is just going to bed at night knowing you did the very best you could do. That's all anyone can ask of you.

Study Partners are brilliant because people all have different strengths and weaknesses. So if you are brilliant at Math but terrible at English then you can find a friend who is the opposite. And remember asking them and teachers questions doesn't make you dumb, it just means that you are keen to know the right things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&quot;Study? Sooooo boring!&quot;''' 

I am a very good student (seriously). I have seen many students in my life who do not even care about themselves or their career. They act like ''wild animals''. If I were them, I would rather change. So, let's come together and guide them to their correct path—a brighter and a happier future! Each one of us has loved to hate studies, and still managed to get through. We've always envied the so called &quot;scholars&quot; of our class, who could score twice the marks with half the study. And who will like something that he's not successful at? But as is true with every game, there are certain rules to study better. When one plays the game of study with these rules—it becomes beautifully simplified and extremely easy.


So the question is... '''''Are you with me?'''''

* This chapter needs an introduction to explain the data modeling driven approach to the first few chapters.

==post revision comments==

'''viji'''

so, I did not do the explanation of the data model driven approach, YET.  I will, I might ask you for direction.  Do you think it should go more in the introduction than in this chapter?

== It appears spaces ARE allowed in attribute values... ==

In the '''Rules to follow''' the book states:
 
&lt;pre&gt;attribute values should have quotation marks around them and no spaces&lt;/pre&gt;

Yet in the section on default and fixed values for schemas which are supposedly a well-formed XML documents, we see:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; 
    default=&quot;really cool place to visit!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

and 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; 
    fixed=&quot;you must visit this place - it is awesome!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Are not '''default''' and '''fixed''' attributes?  Do their values not contain spaces?

== Exhibit 2 - No &quot;standalone&quot; element ==

In Exhibits 2 and 3 the prologue (XML declaration) does not appear to have the standalone=&quot;yes&quot; element which the text description under exhibit 3 suggests should be present.

But the text does indicate that this is an optional element so perhaps that is fine.

== Formatting... ==

The formatting of this page is vary confusing at times.  For example, under DTD section, subheading &quot;Grouping Attributes for an Element&quot;...

Shouldn't this line:
&lt;!ATTLIST car horn CDATA #REQUIRED

Be grouped in the box with these lines:
                     seats CDATA #REQUIRED
                     steeringwheel CDATA #REQUIRED
                     price CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;

This sort of thing seems to be all over the page, which makes it hard to read.  Unfortunately, I don't know anything about XML (why I'm here) so I'm worried if I try to fix it up I will make a mistake.

== DTD (Document Type Definition) Validation - Simple Example ==

This section makes NO SENSE. There is no coherent description of what DTD is or why it's useful or when it should be used. Just throwing out an example like that is practically useless.</text>

'''Cinnamon croûtons''' are a sweet variation on the classic salad croûton, which can be used to enhance a fruit salad.  Alternately, these croûtons make a good addition to pumpkin, sweet potato or carrot soups.

==Ingredients==
*4 slices day-old [[cookbook:Baguette|French bread]], cubed
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]] [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|ground cinnamon]]

Makes enough croûtons for 4 to 6 servings of fruit salad.

==Procedure==
# Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, and set aside.
# Preheat the oven to 350°F (~180°C).
# Pour the walnut oil into a pan and fry the bread cubes in it, tossing to coat with oil.
# Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and garnish with cinnamon sugar.  Bake for 8 minutes or until crispy and dry.  Allow to cool well before handling, as the sugar will make these croûtons easier to brown, and thus hotter to handle initially.

==Four vectors==
A four vector represents a displacement in spacetime.

[[Image:relfourvector.gif]]

If the spacetime has a metric given by:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2&lt;/math&gt;

and if the space-time is flat the magnitude of the four vector is calculated from:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}^2 = A^2 - B^2 - C^2 - D^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where A, B, C, D are the projections of the vector on the corresponding coordinate axes (t,x,y,z). The magnitude of a four vector is given by:

&lt;math&gt;S = | \mathbf{S}^2 |^{1/2} = \sqrt{A^2 - B^2 - C^2 - D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product of a four vector (also known as the &quot;dot product&quot; or &quot;inner product&quot;) can be derived in the same way as the scalar product for an ordinary vector (a three vector, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special_Relativity:_mathematical_approach#Scalar_Product  scalar product]). So the scalar product of two four vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B}&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B} = A_tB_t - A_xB_x - A_yB_y - A_zB_z&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be derived easily from the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime. The scalar product of two four-vectors ''x'' and ''y'' is defined (using indicial notation) as:

:&lt;math&gt;
x \cdot y
= x^a \eta_{ab} y^b
= \left( \begin{matrix}x^0 &amp; x^1 &amp; x^2 &amp; x^3 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}y^0 \\ y^1 \\ y^2 \\ y^3 \end{matrix} \right)
= - x^0 y^0 + x^1 y^1 + x^2 y^2 + x^3 y^3
&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product of four vectors is independent of the coordinate system:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
A'_x &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( A_x - \frac{v}{c} A_t \right) 
\\ A'_y &amp; = &amp; A_y \\ A'_z &amp; = &amp; A_z \\
A'_t &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( -\frac{v}{c} A_x + A_t \right)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product in this frame is:

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A'} \cdot \underline{B'} =
 A'_x B'_x + A'_y B'_y + A'_z B'_z - A'_t B'_t &lt;/math&gt; 

Simplifying, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\underline{A'} \cdot \underline{B'} &amp; = &amp; 
\gamma^2 \left( A_x B_x -\frac{v}{c} (A_x B_t + A_t B_x) + \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; &amp; +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z &amp;\\
 &amp; &amp; - \gamma^2 \left( \frac{v^2}{c^2}A_x B_x -\frac{v}{c} (A_x B_t + A_t B_x) + A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; \left(1- \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{-1} \left( A_x B_x  + \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_t B_t \right) \\
&amp; &amp; +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z \\  
&amp; &amp; - \left(1- \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_x B_x  - A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; A_x B_x  +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z   - A_t B_t 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the same as the scalar product in the original frame of reference.

Properties:

1. Distributivity for vector addition &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}.(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt;

2. Symmetry &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B} = \mathbf{B.A}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Leibniz rule of differentiation applies ie: &lt;math&gt;d (\mathbf{A.B}) = d\mathbf{A}.\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}.d\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

4. Orthogonality &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B} = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

5. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.A} = \mathbf{A}^2&lt;/math&gt;

We now know that the dot product of two four-vectors is a &lt;i&gt;scalar&lt;/i&gt; result, i. e., its value is independent of coordinate system.  This can be used to advantage on occasion.

In the odd geometry of spacetime it is not obvious what ''perpendicular'' means.  We therefore &lt;i&gt;define&lt;/i&gt; two four-vectors &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underline{B}&lt;/math&gt; to be perpendicular if their dot product is zero, in the same way as with three-vectors.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Because the dot product is a scalar, if vectors are perpendicular in one frame, they will be perpendicular in all frames.

We can also consider the dot product of a four-vector &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; which resolves into &lt;math&gt;(A_x , A_t )&lt;/math&gt; in the unprimed frame.  Let us further suppose that the spacelike component is zero in some primed frame, so that the components in this frame are (0, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;t'&lt;/sub&gt; ) The fact that the dot product is independent of coordinate system means that 

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{A} = A_x^2 - A_t^2 = - A_t'^2&lt;/math&gt;

This constitutes an extension of the spacetime Pythagorean theorem to four-vectors other then the position four-vector. Thus, for instance, the wavenumber for some wave may be zero in the primed frame, which means that the wavenumber and frequency in the unprimed frame are related to the frequency in the primed frame by &lt;math&gt;k^2 - \omega^2 / c^2 = - \omega'^2 / c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

We indicate a four-vector by underlining and write the components in the following way: &lt;math&gt;\underline{k} = (k , \omega /c )&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\underline{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave four-vector, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is its spacelike component, and &lt;math&gt;\omega /c&lt;/math&gt; is its timelike component. For three space dimensions, where we have a wave vector rather than just a wavenumber, we write &lt;math&gt;\underline{k} = (k , \omega /c )&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example of a four-vector is simply the position vector in spacetime, &lt;math&gt;\underline{x} = ( x, ct )&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\underline{x} = ( \mathbf{x}, ct )&lt;/math&gt; in three space dimensions. The &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; ''multiplies'' the timelike component in this case, because that is what is needed to give it the same dimensions as the spacelike component.



===Proper time===

Classically, the temporal derivative, ''d''/''dt'' acts like a scalar so we can multiply a vector by it, and get another vector.

In relativity ''t'' is part of a four-vector, which means ''d''/''dt'' also is, so we can't simply differentiate vectors with respect to ''t'' and expect to get vectors.

For example, the position of a stationary particle is (0, ''ct'').

Viewed from a frame moving at ''v'' to the right, its position becomes (-''v''&amp;tau;, ''c''&amp;tau;), where &amp;tau;=&amp;gamma;''t'' is the time as measured in the moving frame.

If we differentiate with respect to &amp;tau; the velocity would be (-''v'', ''c'')

If we differentiate with respect to ''t'', we get (0, ''c'') in the stationary frame, which would be (using the Lorentz transform) (-&amp;gamma;''v'', -&amp;gamma;''c'') in the moving frame, if this were a four vector.

These two expressions differ by a factor of &amp;gamma;, when measured in the same frame, so this can not be a four vector.

However, if the moving observer divides by &amp;gamma;, which is the time dilation, they will get the same vector as the stationary observer.

Doing this is equivalent to differentiating by the time ''in the particles own rest frame''. Since this works for the position vector, we can expect it to work for all vectors.

The time measured in a particle's rest frame is called its ''proper time''.

Differentiating a vector with respect to proper time gives another vector, which is the relativistic equivalent of the temporal derivative.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is written from a Visual Basic 6.0 perspective although much of what is said is also valid for Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual Basic 4.0. It does not cover [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]], a rather different language. It covers many different techniques and topics including object oriented programming, optimization of programs and coding guidelines.

; [[/Introduction/]]: This book's sole purpose is to help people better understand Visual Basic.
; [[/History/]]: A timeline of Visual Basic's history.
; [[/Getting Started/]]: VB6 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is highly useful for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications.
; [[/Simple Arithmetic/]]: Introduction to calculating and operands with Visual Basic.
; [[/Branching|Branching]]: Branching occurs when the program makes a decision.  The flow of execution follows a particular branch like a fork in the road.
; [[/Loops/]]: Loops are control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met.
; [[/Strings/]]: Strings hold printable characters. They are very useful for communicating with human beings and for transferring data between programs and machines in text files and web pages.
; [[/Built In String Functions/]] : Strings can be manipulated using simple string functions.
; [[/Regular Expressions/]] : Complex string matching and manipulation can be achieved using a fairly sophisticated technique of regular expressions.
; [[/Arrays/]]: Arrays are used to group data items of the same type together, to make it easier to search and sort through this data.
; [[/Collections/]]: Array-like containers.
; [[/Dictionaries/]]: Sets of key, value pairs.
; [[/Data Types/]]: A datatype is a specification of the kind of information that a variable can hold, for example, a number or a piece of text.
; [[/Procedures and Functions/]]: A function is a calling procedure or small part of a program that performs some specific task and returns a result; for example the cosine function.
; [[/Error Handling/]]: Errors can be caught, handled and raised.
; [[/Files/]]: While programming, you may want to at some point save data so they may be accessible for further use. This is where file I/O comes in. Visual Basic allows us to perform most operations available in Windows Explorer and DOS command line.
; [[/User Interfaces/]]: Visual Basic supports creation of Graphical User Interfaces, which generally consists of one or more Forms that contain text boxes, labels, buttons, picture boxes, etc.
; [[/Simple Graphics/]]: Visual Basic can easily be used to draw simple graphics such as line drawings and diagrams.
; [[/Windows Dialogs/]]: Windows dialogs are useful when one requires standard interfaces, including opening files, saving files, choosing color and/or font, specifying printer settings.
; [[/Databases/]]: Visual Basic can connect to databases in many different ways.
; [[/Windows API/]]: APIs, short for &quot;application programming interface&quot;, allows you to access a wide array of functions and methods exposed by the operating system or other applications (DLLs), performing operations not normally implemented by the standard virtual machine that Visual Basic provides.
; [[/Subclassing/]]: Visual Basic hides the details of all the messages that Windows sends to an application but you can get at them if you really need to.  Then you can do things that plain Visual Basic cannot.
; [[/External Processes/]]: Sometimes you want to call another program from Visual Basic.
; [[/Object Oriented Programming/]]: There is a lot of complicated talk about Object Oriented Programming but in essence it is quite simple.
; [[/Effective Programming/]]: It isn't enough that the program work, you must be able to maintain it as well.  Effective programmers can read their code as well as write it.
; [[/Idioms/]]: An idiom is a sort of template or generic method of expressing an idea.  In the same way that idioms in a human language make life easier for the both speaker and listener good idioms in computer programming make life easier for the programmer.  Naturally what is idiomatic in one language might not be in another.
; [[/Optimizing Visual Basic/]]: It is often desirable that your program not only does what you want it to do, but it also does it fast and with low memory footprint. Optimizing aims to improve the latter two requirements.
; [[/Examples/]]: This section contains a number of ready made code examples for your use.  They vary from short snippets to complete modules and short demo applications.
:* [[/Snippets/]]
; [[/Case Studies/]]
:* [[/Regular Expression Tester/]]: A small, almost throwaway application that demonstrates that useful application do not need to be either large or complicated.
:* [[/JArithmetic/]]
; [[/The Language/]]: This section summarizes the syntax of Visual Basic and describes all the key concepts that of Visual Basic.  It also notes some features that exist in other languages but do not exist in Visual basic.
; [[/Coding Standards/]]: Consistent style in coding helps everyone to maintain a program whether the maintainer is the original author or not.
; [[/VB6 Command Reference/]]: This section serves as guide to the commands that can be used in Visual Basic.
; [[/Glossary/]]: Brief explanations of various important, difficult or otherwise interesting words and phrases with links to longer explanations in the body of the text.
; [[/Work in Progress/]]: Various unfinished pages.  Please look here for anything obscure or difficult.
; [[/Links/]]
; [[/Contributors/]]

==Related Books==
; [[Data Structures]]: Programs operate on data so knowledge of effective data structures is very important.
; [[Algorithms]]: Many algorithms were described long before computers were available and many have both naive inefficient forms and sophisticated efficient forms.  In many cases this is independent of the implementation language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to use this book==
The first page of the book is an annotated [[../|contents]] list, click the headings with the mouse to go to the page you want to read.

*You will need a copy of Visual Basic. You can see the [http://www.microsoft.com Microsoft US] or [http://www.microsoft.co.uk Microsoft UK] sites for information but [[w:Visual Basic#Legacy development and support|the language has been retired and is now unsupported by Microsoft]]. Visual studio 2005 is also available free of charge on the Microsoft website but only supports VB.net.

*You will often see Visual Basic abbreviated to '''VB''', and for the purpose of conciseness, this guide will use VB from this point onwards.

*VB code is written in US English. There are some key differences you should note, as misspelling code can cause hours of problems. Below is a list of the differences- '''when writing in VB, you should use the right-hand column's spellings''':

'''Many of these words you will not need until you progress into more complex VB'''
&lt;table border= &quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''Commonwealth English'''&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;'''US English (VB)'''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyze&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

Words which can be spelled with an 'ise' and 'ize' suffix should be spelled with 'ize' in VB.

This book will guide you step-by-step through Visual Basic. Some chapters of this book contain exercises.  The exercises are an integral part of the text and at least some should be tried or you will not get the full benefit of the book.  There are no answers to the exercises because most do not have a single ''correct'' answer.  Physical exercises are done to build muscle and stamina, intellectual exercises are the same thing for the brain.  In almost every case you should be able to think of at least two 'solutions'.  Some exercises require you to write code, please write it and execute it, others expect you to think about or describe something, please write it down even if only on a piece of scrap paper, it helps fix it in your mind.  

If you try an exercise and fail to find a solution please ask for help by adding a comment to the relevant discussion page.  It is of course entirely possible that the exercise is faulty so reports of problems will help the authors too.

Please add comments to the discussion page (click the ''discussion'' button at the top of this page).  If there are specific topics that you want covered please say so in as much detail as you can.

==Terminology==
Please refer to the [[../Glossary/]] for definitions of any unfamiliar words or any words that appear to be used in an unusual sense.

==VB Integrated Development Environment==
Visual Basic has several key components you will need to get acquainted with. The first is the tool box, usually located on the left of the screen. This is used for creating objects on your form. A form is the basic window a user will see upon running your program. What is on the form is what the user sees. Make some picture boxes and command buttons on your screen by clicking the button, then clicking and dragging where you want the object to be placed. The next key feature is the properties of objects. Captions, names, and other properties of objects may be edited here. Now, click an object, and a white window will appear. This is where your code goes. Toward the top of your screen you should see a &quot;play&quot; button, but in Visual Basic it is referred to as the &quot;Run&quot; button. This will run any programs you make. Next to it are the pause, and stop buttons, which are pretty self explanatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Watering down the bank card admonishments ==

Please '''don't'''. These were written harshly for good reason: you are much better off losing money through an American bank card than a French one. If you don't agree, perhaps you haven't had to protest transactions with cards from each country, as I have. American laws are very generous to bank card holders, for whatever reason, so we have a relaxed attitude towards the cards. It is essential that assistants from the U.S. change that attitude when they obtain a ''carte bancaire''.

For example, I know first-hand that this contributed sentence is false: &quot;Card holders cannot be held responsible for transactions done with their card number or card without the PIN or correct signature.&quot; If it were true, then three different Banque Populaire employees broke the law and should be in prison, since they told me that my not having signed a credit card receipt meant nothing.

I understand your desire to defend all things French, but in this case you are doing more harm than good. The more people who discover a French bank's indifference to bank card fraud '''through their own experience''', the worse it is for France. Let them be warned here, in advance.

[[User:Nathan Hamblen|Nathan]] 18:52, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

To the best of my knowledge it is the case that you are not held liable if the signature is missing.
This does not mean that the bank will not try and cheat you, _especially_ if you are a foreigner.
[[User:83.76.11.222|83.76.11.222]] 16:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

Dear Nathan,
I invite you to read [http://www.bnpparibas.net/banque/portail/particulier/Fiche?type=fiche&amp;identifiant=opposition_carte_20020926103601 this page from BNP/Paribas] and [http://www.rivesparis.banquepopulaire.fr/tsd/commun/index.asp?ID=secuCB this page from Banque Populaire]. Banque Populaire says that, outside of cases of use by a family member or of gross negligence, your responsibility for uses before asking for the card being blocked, without the PIN, is limited to 150€.
This 150€ limit is also given by the [ttp://www.minefi.gouv.fr/DGCCRF/04_dossiers/consommation/ficonso/b25.htm?ru=04 Ministry of Finances]' repression of frauds services (DGCCRF), which also states that no responsibility is incurred for fraudulent use of the card number without the card. They are probably a much better authority on this than you and I.

That said, it is well possible that there was a misunderstanding with the bank employees, that they would have preferred not to refund you money, etc. Note also that, even if the bank is legally bound to refund you, it may choose to &quot;drag its heels&quot;.

By the way, not every salesperson telling bullshit goes to prison. Remember, this is France, with a low carceral population. If you think that the bank has acted illegally, you should have probably contacted a  DGCCRF branch or a consumer's association such as UFC-Que choisir.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Multi-tasking ===
[[w:Computer multitasking|Multi-tasking]] is a process by which multiple tasks (also known as [[#Processes|processes]]), share common processing resources such as a [[w:Central processing unit|CPU]].

A computer with a single CPU, will only run one process at a time. By ''running'' it means that in a specific point in time, the CPU is actively executing instructions for that process. With a single CPU, systems using [[w:Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] can achieve multi-tasking, by which the time of the processor is time-shared by several processes, permitting each to advance their computations, seemingly in parallel. A process runs for some time and another waiting gets a turn.

The act of reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a [[w:context switch|context switch]]. When context switches occur frequently enough, the illusion of [[w:Parallel computing|parallelism]] is achieved.

{{NOTE|Context switching has a cost; when deciding to use multi-tasks, a programmer must be aware of trade-offs in performance.}}

Even on computers with more than one CPU, [[w:multiprocessor|multiprocessor]] machines, multi-tasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs. 

Operating systems may adopt one of many different [[w:Scheduling (computing)|scheduling strategies]], which generally fall into the following categories:
* In ''[[w:multiprogramming|multiprogramming]]'' systems, the running task keeps running until it performs an operation that requires waiting for an external event (e.g. reading from a tape) or until the computer's scheduler forcibly swaps the running task out of the CPU. Multiprogramming systems are designed to maximize CPU usage.
* In ''[[w:time-sharing|time-sharing]]'' systems, the running task is required to relinquish the CPU, either voluntarily or by an external event such as a [[w:hardware interrupt|hardware interrupt]]. Time sharing systems are designed to allow several programs to execute apparently simultaneously.  The term ''time-sharing'' used to define this behavior is no longer in use, having been replaced by the term ''multi-tasking''.
* In ''[[w:Real-time computing|real-time]]'' systems, some waiting tasks are guaranteed to be given the CPU when an external event occurs. Real time systems are designed to control mechanical devices such as industrial robots, which require timely processing.

Multi-tasking has already been successfully integrated into current Operating Systems. Most computers in use today supports running several processes at a time. This is required for systems using [[w:Symmetric multiprocessing|symmetric multiprocessor (SMP)]] in ''distributed computing'' and [[w:Multi-core processor|multi-core or chip multiprocessors (CMPs)]] computing, where processors have gone from dual-core to quad-core and core number will continue to increase. Each technology has its specific limitations and applicability, but all these technologies share the common objective of performing concurrent processing.

{{NOTE|Due to the general adoption of the new paradigm it becomes extremely important to prepare your code for it (plan for scalability), understand guarantees regarding parallelization, and select external libraries that provide the required support.}}

=== Processes ===
[[w:process (computing)|Process]]es are independent execution units that contain their own state information, use their own address spaces, and only interact with each other via [[w:Inter-process_communication|inter-process communication]] ''(IPC)'' mechanisms . A process can be said to at least contain one thread of execution (not to be confused to a complete thread construct). Processes are managed by the hosting OS in a process data structure. The maximum number of processes that can run concurrently, depend on the OS and on the available resources of that system.

==== Child Process ====
A '''child process''' (also [[w:spawn process|spawn process]]), is a process that was created by another process (the [[w:parent process|parent process]]), inheriting most of the parent attributes, such as opened files. Each process may create many child processes but will have at most one parent process; if a process does not have a parent this usually indicates that it was created directly by the [[w:kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

In [[w:Unix|UNIX]], a child process is in fact created (using [[w:fork (operating system)|fork]]) as a copy of the parent. The child process can then [[w:overlay (operating system)|overlay]] itself with a different program (using &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/tt&gt;) as required. The very first process, called [[w:init|init]], is started by the kernel at booting time and never terminates; other parentless processes may be launched to carry out various [[w:daemon (computing)|daemon]] tasks in [[w:userspace|userspace]]. Another way for a process to end up without a parent is, if its parent dies leaving an [[w:orphan process|orphan process]]; but in this case it will shortly be adopted by init.

==== Inter-Process Communication (IPC) ====
IPC is generally managed by the operating system.

===== Shared Memory =====
Most of more recent OSs provide some sort of memory protection. In a Unix system, each process is given its own virtual address space, and the system, in turn, guarantees that no process can access the memory area of another. If an error occurs on a process, only that process memory's contents can be corrupted. 

With shared memory, the need of enabling random-access to shared data between different processes is addressed. But declaring a given section of memory as simultaneously accessible by several processes raises the need for control and synchronization, since several processes might try to alter this memory area at the same time.

=== Multi-Threading ===
Until recently, the C++ standard did not include any specification or built-in support for multi-threading. Therefore, [[w:Thread (computer science)|Threading]] had to be implemented using special threading libraries, which are often platform dependent, as an extension to the C++ standard.

{{NOTE|The new C++0x standard supports multi-threading, reducing the need to know multiple APIs and increasing the portability of code.}} 

Some popular C++ threads libraries include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(This list is not intended to be complete.)&lt;/small&gt;

* [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost]] - This package includes several libraries, one of which is threads (concurrent programming). the boost threads library is not very full featured, but is complete, portable, robust and in the flavor of the C++ standard. Uses the boost license that is similar to the BSD license.
* [[w:Intel_Threading_Building_Blocks|Intel® Threading Building Blocks]]  [http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org ''(TBB)''] offers a rich approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. The library helps you take advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. Threading Building Blocks is not just a threads-replacement library. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanism for performance and scalability and performance. It is an open source project under the GNU General Public License version two (GPLv2) with the runtime exception.
* [[w:Intel_Cilk_Plus|Intel® Cilk™ Plus]]  [http://www.cilkplus.org ''(Intel® Cilk™ Plus)''] adds simple language extensions to the C and C++languages to express task and data parallelism. These language extensions are powerful, yet easy to apply and use in a wide range of applications.
* [[w:Adaptive Communication Environment|Adaptive Communication Environment]] (often referred to as ''ACE'') - Another toolkit which includes a portable threads abstraction along with many many other facilities, all rolled into one library. Open source released under a nonstandard but nonrestrictive license.
* [[w:ZThreads|Zthreads]] - A portable thread abstraction library. This library is feature rich, deals only with concurrency and is open source licensed under the MIT license. 

Of course, you can access the full POSIX and the C language threads interface from C++ and on Windows the API. So why bother with a library on top of that?

The reason is that things like locks are resources that are allocated, and C++ provides abstractions to make managing these things easier. For instance, &lt;code&gt;boost::scoped_lock&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses object construction/destruction to insure that a mutex is unlocked when leaving the lexical scope of the object. Classes like this can be very helpful in preventing deadlock, race conditions, and other problems unique to threaded programs. Also, these libraries enable you to write cross-platform multi-threading code, while using platform-specific function cannot.

In any case when using ''threading methodology'', dictates that you must identify '''hotspots''', the segments of code that take the most execution time. To determine the best chance at achieving the maximum performance possible, the task can be approached from ''bottom-up'' and ''top-down'' to determine those code segments that can run in parallel.

In the ''bottom-up'' approach, one focus solely on the hotspots in the code. This requires a deep analysis of the call stack of the application to determine the sections of code that can be run in parallel and reduce hotspots. In hotspot sections that employ concurrency, it is still required to move that concurrency at a point higher up in the call stack as to increase the [[#Computation_granularity|granularity]] of each thread execution.

Using the ''top-down'' approach, the focus is on all the parts of the application, in determining what computations can be coded to run in parallel, at a higher level of abstraction. Reducing the level of abstraction until the overall performance gains are sufficient to reach the necessary goals, the benefit being speed of implementation and code re-usability. This is also the best method for archiving a optimal level of [[#Computation_granularity|granularity]] for all computations.

;'''Threads vs. Processes'''
Both threads and processes are methods of parallelizing an application, its implementation may differ from one [[w:operating system|operating system]] to another. A process has always one thread of execution, also known as the '''primary thread'''. In general, a thread is contained inside a process (in the address space of the process) and different threads of the same process share some resources while different processes do not.

==== Atomicity ====
Atomicity refers to '''atomic''' operations that are '''indivisible''' and/or '''uninterruptible'''. Even on a single core, you cannot assume that an operation will be atomic. In that regard only when using assembler can one guarantee the atomicity of an operation. Therefore, the C++ standard provides some guarantees as do operating systems and external libraries.

An '''atomic operation''' can also be seen as any given set of [[w:Instruction (computer science)|operation]]s that can be combined so that they appear to the rest of the system to be a single operation with only two possible outcomes: success or failure. This all depends on the level of abstraction and underling guarantees.

All modern processors provide basic '''atomic primitives''' which are then used to build more complex atomic objects. In addition to atomic read and write operations, most platforms provide an atomic read-and-update operation like [[w:test-and-set|test-and-set]] or [[w:compare-and-swap|compare-and-swap]], or a pair of operations like [[w:Load-Link/Store-Conditional|load-link/store-conditional]] that only have an effect if they occur atomically (that is, with no intervening, conflicting update). These can be used to implement [[w:Lock (software engineering)|locks]], a vital mechanism for multi-threaded programming, allowing invariants and atomicity to be enforced across groups of operations.

Many [[w:central processing unit|processors]], especially [[w:32-bit|32-bit]] ones with [[w:64-bit|64-bit]] [[w:floating point|floating point]] support, provide some read and write operations that are not atomic: one [[w:Thread (computer science)|thread]] reading a 64-bit register while another thread is writing to it may see a combination of both &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; values, a combination that may never actually have been written to the register. Further, only single operations are guaranteed to be atomic; threads arbitrarily performing groups of reads and writes will also observe a mixture of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; values. Clearly, invariants cannot be relied on when such effects are possible.

If not dealing with known guaranteed atomic operations, one should rely on the synchronization primitives at the level of abstraction that one is coding to.

;'''Example''' - One process
For example, imagine a single process is running on a computer incrementing a value in a given [[w:memory location|memory location]]. To increment the value in that memory location:
:# the process reads the value in the memory location;
:# the process adds one to the value;
:# the process writes the new value back into the memory location.

;'''Example''' - Two processes
Now, imagine two processes are running incrementing a single, shared memory location:
# the first process reads the value in memory location;
# the first process adds one to the value;
but before it can write the new value back to the memory location it is suspended, and the second process is allowed to run:
# the second process reads the value in memory location, the ''same'' value that the first process read;
# the second process adds one to the value;
# the second process writes the new value into the memory location.
The second process is suspended and the first process allowed to run again:
# the first process writes a now-wrong value into the memory location, unaware that the other process has already updated the value in the memory location.

This is a trivial example. In a real system, the operations can be more complex and the errors introduced extremely subtle. For example, reading a 64-bit value from memory may actually be implemented as two [[w:sequence|sequential]] reads of two 32-bit memory locations. If a process has only read the first 32-bits, and before it reads the second 32-bits the value in memory gets changed, it will have neither the original value nor the new value but a mixed-up [[w:garbage (computer science)|garbage]] value.

Furthermore, the specific order in which the processes run can change the results, making such an error difficult to detect and debug.

;'''OS and portability'''
Considerations are not only necessary with regard to the underling hardware but also in dealing with the different OS APIs. When porting code across different OSs one should consider what guarantees are provided. Similar considerations are necessary when dealing with external libraries. 

{{NOTE|For instance on the Macintosh, the set file position call is atomic, whereas on Windows, it's a pair of calls.}}

==== Race condition ====
A '''[[w:Race_condition#Computing|race condition]]''' (''data race'', or simply ''race''), occurs when data is accessed concurrently from multiple execution paths. It happens for instance when multiple threads have shared access to the same resource such as a file or a block of memory, and at least one of the accesses is a write. This can lead to interference with one another.

Threaded programming is built around predicates and shared data. It is necessary to identify all possible execution paths and identify truly independent computations. To avoid problems it is best to implement concurrency at the highest level possible.

Most ''race conditions'' occur due to an erroneous assumption about the order in which threads will run. When dealing with shared variables, never assume that a threaded write operation will precede a threaded read operation. If you need guarantees you should see if synchronization primitives are available, and if not, you should implement your own. 

===== Locking =====
[[w:Lock_(computer_science)|Locking]] temporarily prevents un-shareable resources from being used simultaneously. Locking can be achieved by using a synchronization object.

One of the biggest problems with threading is that locking requires analysis and understanding of the data and code relationships. This complicates software development--especially when targeting multiple operating systems. This makes multi-threaded programming more like art than science.

The number of locks (depending on the synchronization object) may be limited by the OS. A lock can be set to protect more than one resource, if always accessed in the same critical region.

===== Critical section =====
A [[w:Critical_section|critical section]] is a region defined as critical to the parallelization of code execution. The term is used to define code  sections that need to be executed in isolation with respect to other code in the program.

This is a common fundamental concept. These sections of code need to be protected by a synchronization technique as they can create  ''race conditions''.

===== Deadlock =====
A [[w:Deadlock|deadlock]] is said to happen whenever there is a lock operation that results in a never-ending waiting cycle among concurrent threads.

==== Synchronization ====
Except when used to guarantee the correct execution of a parallel computation, synchronization is an overhead. Attempt to keep it to a minimum by taking advantage of the [[#Thread local storage (TLS)|thread's local storage]] or by using exclusive memory locations.

===== Computation granularity =====
''Computation granularity'' is loosely defined as the amount of computation performed before any synchronization is needed. The longer the time between synchronizations, the less granularity the computation will have. When dealing with the requirements for parallelism, it will mean being easier to scale to an increased number of threads and having lower overhead costs. A high level of granularity can mean that any benefit from using threads will be lost due to the requirements of synchronization and general thread overhead.

===== Mutex =====
[[w:Mutual exclusion|Mutex]] is an abbreviation for ''mutual exclusion''. It relies on a synchronization facility supplied by the operating system (not the CPU). Since this system objects can only be owned by a single thread at any given time, the mutex object facilitates protection against data races and allows for thread-safe synchronization of data between threads. By calling one of the lock functions, the thread obtains ownership of a mutex object, it then relinquishes ownership by calling the corresponding unlock function. Mutexes can be either recursive or non-recursive, and may grant simultaneous ownership to one or many threads.

===== Semaphore =====
A [[w:Semaphore_(programming)|semaphore]] is a ''yielding'' synchronization object that can be used to synchronize several threads. This is the most commonly used method for synchronization

===== Spinlock =====
[[w:Spinlock|Spinlocks]] are ''busy-wait'' synchronization objects, used as a substitute for Mutexes. They are an implementation of inter-thread locking using machine dependent assembly instructions (such as test-and-set) where a thread simply waits (''spins'') in a loop that repeatedly checks if the lock becomes available (''busy wait''). This is why spinlocks perform better if locked for a short period of time. They are never used on single-CPU machines.

==== Threads ====
Threads are by definition a coding construct and part of a [[w:computer program|program]] that enable it to [[w:Fork_(operating_system)|fork]] (or split) itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running [[w:task (computers)|task]]s. Threads use [[w:pre-emptive multitasking|pre-emptive multi-tasking]]. 

The thread is the basic unit (the smallest piece of code) to which the operating system can allocate a distinct processor time (schedule) for execution. This means that, threads in reality, don't run concurrently but in sequence on any single core system.  Threads often depend on the OS thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread.

The thread today is not only a key concurrency model supported by most if not all modern computers, programming languages, and operating systems but is itself at the core of hardware evolution, such as symmetric multi-processors, understanding threads is now a necessity to all programmers.

The order of execution of the threads is controlled by the process scheduler of the OS, it is non-deterministic. The only control available to the programmer is in attributing a priority to the thread but never assume a particular order of execution.

{{TODO|Thread quantum}}

===== User Interface Thread =====
This type of distinction is reserved to indicate that the particular thread implements a message map to respond to events and messages generated by user inputs as he interacts with the application. This is especially common when working with the Windows platform (Win32 API) because of the way it implements message pumps.

===== Worker Thread =====
This distinction serves to specify threads that do not directly depend or are part of the graphical user interface of the application, and run concurrently with the main execution thread.

===== Thread local storage (TLS) =====
The residence of thread local variables, a thread dedicated section of the global [[w:Computer storage|memory]]. Each thread (or fiber) will receive its own stack space, residing in a different memory location. This will consist of both reserved and initially committed memory. That is freed when the thread exits but will not be freed if the thread is terminated by other means.

Since all threads in a [[w:Process (computing)|process]] share the same [[w:address space|address space]], it makes data in a static or [[w:global variable|global variable]] to be normally located at the same memory location, when referred to by threads from the same process. It is important for software to take in consideration hardware cache coherence. For instance in multiprocessor environments, each processor has a local cache. If threads on different processors modify variables residing on the same cache line, this will invalidate that cache line, forcing a cache update, hurting performance. This is referred to as '''false sharing'''.

This type of storage is indicated for variables that store temporary or even partial results, since condensing the needed synchronization of the partial results in as fewer and infrequent instances possible will contribute to the reduction of synchronization overhead.

===== Thread Synchronization =====
The synchronization can be defined in several steps the first is the process lock, where a process is made to halt execution due to find a protected resource locked, there is a cost for locking especially if the lock lasts for too long.

Obviously there is a performance hit if any synchronization mechanism is heavily used. Because they are an expensive operation, in certain cases, increasing the use of TLSs instead of relying only on shared data structures will reduce the need for synchronization.

[[Image:Thread pool.svg|390px|right|thumb|A simple thread pool. The task queue has many waiting tasks (blue circles). When a thread opens up in the queue (green box with dotted circle) a task comes off the queue and the open thread executes it (red circles in green boxes). The completed task then &quot;leaves&quot; the thread pool and joins the completed tasks list (yellow circles)..]]

==== Fibers ====
A [[w:Fiber_(computer_science)|fiber]] is a particularly lightweight [[w:thread of execution|thread of execution]]. Like threads, fibers share [[w:address space|address space]]. However, fibers use [[w:Computer multitasking#Cooperative multitasking/time-sharing|co-operative multi-tasking]], fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing.

;Operating system support
Less support from the [[w:operating system|operating system]] is needed for fibers than for threads. They can be implemented in modern [[w:Unix|Unix]] systems using the library functions [[w:setcontext|&lt;code&gt;''getcontext''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;''setcontext''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''swapcontext''&lt;/code&gt;]] in &lt;code&gt;ucontext.h&lt;/code&gt;, as in [[w:GNU Portable Threads|GNU Portable Threads]].

On [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]], fibers are created using the &lt;code&gt;''ConvertThreadToFiber''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''CreateFiber''&lt;/code&gt; calls; a fiber that is currently suspended may be resumed in any thread. Fiber-local storage, analogous to [[w:thread-local storage|thread-local storage]], may be used to create unique copies of variables.

[[w:Symbian OS|Symbian OS]] uses a similar concept to fibers in its Active Scheduler. An [[w:Active object (Symbian OS)|Active object (Symbian OS)]] contains one fiber to be executed by the Active Scheduler when one of several outstanding asynchronous calls complete. Several Active objects can be waiting to execute (based on priority) and each one must restrict is own execution time.

=== Exploiting parallelism ===
Most of the parallel architecture research was done in the 1960s and 1970s, providing solutions for problems that only today are reaching general awareness. As the need of concurrent programming increases, mostly due to today's hardware evolution, we as programmers are pressed to implement programming models that ease the complicated process of dealing with the old thread model in a way it preserves development time by abstracting the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Believe it or not, global warming is not a modern event. Throughout the Earth's history, climate graphs have shown that the temperature has increased and decreased continuously, the difference today being the speed at which the warming is happening. However, what we need to focus on for the GCSE is the rapid global warming that is happening today (often incorrectly referred to as '''Climate Change'''), its causes, consequences and ways in which it can be minimised.

==Causes==

Okay, so you've heard about in the news millions of times. But what is actually causing global warming? 

Well, global warming is caused by an increasing amount of '''Greenhouse gases''' in the atmosphere - which are Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrogen Dioxide (Nitrous Oxide) and Water Vapour are greenhouse gases which cause the '''Greenhouse effect'''. Be careful when mentioning these gases, as you may be tricked into using the names of other gases. 

Sulphur Dioxide is '''not''' a greenhouse gas as it does not absorb the sun's heat, but it causes acid rain. Aerosols cause depletion of the Ozone layer, and, whilst contributing to Global Warming, are of no relation to the Greenhouse Effect.

You will not need to explain why the greenhouse gases absorb the sun's heat. However you WILL need to explain that human activity is responsible for adding extra quantities of these gases to the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapour are the most common greenhouse gases, as they are released from car exhausts, power stations and pretty much every other combustion reaction there is. Methane is released from rice paddies and, of course, from passing wind.

==Consequences==

The consequences of global warming are not fully understood, however there is significant scientific evidence that it is causing '''Climatic Change'''. Be careful here, as Global Warming is the increase in the Earth's average temperature, whereas Climatic Change is when the weather changes in a certain place, so try to avoid mixing the two phrases. 

In the Sahel region in Sub-Saharan Africa, over the past decade, there has been a significant decrease in rainfall and droughts are becoming commonplace. The decrease in rainfall here causes an increase elsewhere, which can increase the problem of flooding in other areas.

Another effect of global warming is the melting of the polar ice caps - the North and South Pole. A hotter termperature obviously causes the ice to melt, which will add to the level of water in the oceans - and a higher level of water means a greater risk of flooding. Throughout the world, there are many flat and low-lying countries and cities that are at considerable risk from flooding. Bangladesh is one of the most flood prone countries in the world and there will be a higher chance of floods striking the country, causing death and damage to thousands of people.

A '''filet knife''' is a thin, flexible knife, usually around 6 inches (150 mm) in length.  The blade is is usually much more shallow than the tang.  These characteristics give the filet knife excellent mobility when being used to filet cuts of meat or fish, allowing it to manoeuvre around bones. This also aids in removing the skin from fish by allowing the user to flex the blade along the countertop.  Filet knives are typically kept very sharp in order to minimize the amount of damage the edge does.

It is important that any knives are kept sharp, as blunt knives require more force to use, actually increasing the likelihood of injury (cuts from a sharp knife heal more quickly than those from a blunt one). A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|knife sharpener]] can be used to sharpen knives.</text>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Viji (1/16/06) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Subject: Editorial Board: meeting notes

(add to this things I forgot and left out)

&lt;b&gt;Presentation of Editorial Board guidelines, monday 1/23&lt;/b&gt;

- Dr. Watson: 
* history of XML wikibook
* future of XML wikibook
* XML books he has that can be borrowed

- Viji: 
* schedule [actual due dates for chapter revisions; planning begins one month ahead; use of discussion tab in documenting revision recommendations; order and timeline of revision list (student, board, Dr. Watson); content due on given date; further revision may be recommended by board]
* concept capsules and breathing room [analyze content - break down into component pieces; leave whitespace for room to breath and digest]
* contact the board [author guidelines link; editorial board will periodically make announcements in class - then add the info to the author guidlines page]

- Moussa: 
* code examples [uniform color (black); keep comments in code; leave space above and below comments; copy and paste into editor to see differences - mention this in the first few chapters; keep all example code on the same topic - tourGuide]
* NetBeans [remove from chapter =&gt; go to 'XML Editor' page (see contents table) =&gt; create link for your chapter =&gt; insert netbeans info]; put a link in chapter to the page that has that chapter's netbeans contents - at the spot(s) that there were netbeans contents; currently no need to edit this - may edit in future]

- Christina:
* references and citations [no plagarism; citation page in appendix (chapter name - citations)]
* wiki how to [help link on left navigation bar; sandbox for experimenting; author guidelines] 
* layout [learning objectives / sponsor banner; &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; new words and jargon; exercises and answers links and pages (remove the link in the table of contents once you are done); use wiki format (ex: table) info in help page; make edit mode of page easy to follow so future edits are smooth]


&lt;b&gt;other&lt;/b&gt;
* list and document ideas for book restructuring (see entry below)
* divide contents page into parts - organize the appendix, nice presentation (viji)
* create cover page - nice presentation - include sponsor(currently UGA, Terry, MIS) (Christina, Moussa)
* look for ways of decoupling (XML editor/NetBeans page)
* document agreement to manage expectations

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Viji (1/16/06) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Subject: Topical Links

As you think of topical suggestions please submit here =&gt; 

*  [[XML: Managing Data Exchange/Restructuring Plans|Restructuring Plans]]
*  [[XML: Managing Data Exchange/Contents Page|Contents Page]] demos

feel free to make links to topics that we each may want to contribute to or have samples to show each other and Dr. Watson.  We can have all those contributions in one place under one topic heading --- be sure to always link from this Editorial Board communications page entry.

Thank You

      <comment>/* Do not use reflection (thus cheating to create an array full of null pointers) */ I agree.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the majority of these suggestions are fairly worthless.  
*Sometimes it is necessary to create an object outside of a block and it must be initilaized.  The most efficient way is to use a null.
*Making all fields final does nothing.  A final field means it cannot be changed and an object often needs to be mutable.  A good programmer will always check if something is null if he is unsure
*Using the {...} constructor for arrays is only useful if you are filling it as it is defined.  Again, the new Object[...] syntax is fine if the programmer is smart enough not to check for null data before using it.

----

I think you mean to declare a variable outside a block, e.g., in the following code I want to find a String that starts with a b.

 String[] strings={&quot;banana&quot;,&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;pear&quot;};
 String found=null;
 
 for (int a=0;a&lt;strings.length &amp;&amp; found==null;a++)
    if (strings[a].startsWith(&quot;b&quot;))
       found=strings[a];
 
 System.out.println(found);

This would be simpler without null:

 String[] strings={&quot;banana&quot;,&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;pear&quot;};
 
 for (int a=0;a&lt;strings.length;a++)
    if (strings[a].startsWith(&quot;b&quot;))
       System.out.println(found);

If this doesn't clarify things, please provide a code example where null is preferable.

Yes, an object often needs to be mutable.  But often an object doesn't need to be mutable, and where that is true, final may be useful.  Note that the rules are not intended to be applied to ALL code.

Using {...} for arrays is only useful if you are filling it as it is defined.  I absolutely agree.  If you are not filling it as it is defined, then you should be using a Collection, which will grow as you fill it.  Again, provide a code example.

I think assuming that programmers are smart is a bad idea.  Even good programmers have bad days.

Most of the case you want to initialize object references to null, when you have try block, you want to create the object in the try block, and also you need the object in the catch block for logging porposes.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 23:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

== Make all fields final ==

The final keyword will convert the variables to constants, but what if I need a variable.
I'd like to delete that whole section 'Make all fields final', is nothing to do with preventing NullPointerExceptions. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 03:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Do not use reflection (thus cheating to create an array full of null pointers) ==

I'd like to delete this one also, because usually we would use reflection only when that is needed. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 03:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
:I agree with you. It should not appear here. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 18:46, 9 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
An XHTML DTD describes the allowed syntax and grammar of XHTML markup. Every XHTML document ''must start'' with a DTD declaration and a line of code that declares that you are starting to write XHTML code.

This is the mandatory minimum way to start an XHTML document:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org
/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


== The Three Document Type Definitions ==
There are currently three XHTML 1.0 document types:
*Strict
*Transitional
*Frameset

== XHTML 1.0 Strict ==
This is used when the user wants a clean markup, free of presentational clutter. Use this in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org
/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 1.0 Transitional ==
Use this when taking advantage of XHTML's presentational features and when you want to support browsers that do not understand Cascading Style Sheets. This is the one that is favoured to use amongst developers and is used commonly.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org
/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 1.0 Frameset ==
Use this when you want to use XHTML Frames to partition the browser window into two or more frames.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org /TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 1.1 ==
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 2.0 ==
XHTML was a working draft, but its development was halted in favour of HTML 5.0.  Even though the specification will not be completed, its doctype is: 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 2.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml2.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several kinds of functions that use or create lists. These functions are found in the LIST menus. The LIST menus are accessed by the 2nd function of the STAT key. It is just below the DEL key. There are a variety of mathematical operations that can be done on lists.  These are found in the LIST MATH menu.  These functions result in a single number answer.

=== min( and max( ===

The minimum function ('''2nd LIST MATH 1''') results in the smallest number in the list.  The maximum function ('''2nd LIST MATH 2''') gives the largest number in the list.

:{4,7,2,5} STO&gt; L1
::::{4 7 2 5}
:min(L1)
::::2
:max(L1)
::::7
:min({-3,-8,-1,-4})
::::-8
:max({-3,-8,-1,-4})
::::-1

=== mean( ===

The averaging function ('''2nd LIST MATH 3''') calculates the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the list by adding them up and dividing by the number of items added.

:{2,3,5,6,14} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 3 5 6 14}
:mean(L1)
::::6
:mean({40,23,64,14,51})
::::38.4


=== median( ===

The median function ('''2nd LIST MATH 4''') finds an average in a different way from the mean.  If the list of numbers were listed in order from smallest to largest, the median is the middle number.

:{2,3,5,6,14} STO&gt; L1 
::::{2 3 5 6 14} 
:median(L1) 
::::5 
:median({40,23,64,14,51}) 
::::40 

If there are an even number of numbers, there is no single middle number.  The median in this case if the mean of the two middle numbers.  (Add them and divide by 2.)

:median({1.3,1.8,1.1,1.6})
::::1.45

The result, 1.45, is half way between 1.3 and 1.6.

=== sum( and prod( ===

The sum function ('''2nd LIST MATH 5''') adds up all the items in a list.  The product function ('''2nd LIST MATH 6''') multiplies all the items in a list together.  

:sum({3,5,6})
::::14
:prod({3,5,6})
::::90
:sum({-4,-2,5,10})
::::9
:prod({-4,-2,5,10})
::::400
:prod({4,3,2,1,0,-1})
::::0


=== stdDev( and variance( ===

The standard deviation function ('''2nd LIST MATH 7''') and the variance function ('''2nd LIST MATH 8''') give the results of their statistical calulations.

:stdDev({4,5,6,8,11})
::::2.77
:variance({4,5,6,8,11})
::::7.7

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is to identify and detail the differences between the TI-83 and the TI-86 graphing calculators.  The sections below will detail the differences in keyboard layout, differences in keystrokes, and differences in functionality.

== Menus ==

=== List menu ===
The LIST menu is the 2nd function on the subtraction key.

=== Stat menu ===
The Stat menu is the 2nd function on the addition key.

=== List Edit menu ===
The List Edit menu can be accessed by two different routes.  From the [[#List menu|List menu]] it is at F4.  From the [[#Stat menu|Stat menu]] it is at F2.  The lists originally displayed are the ones that are used for the statistical calculations:  xStat, yStat, and fStat.

== Key locations ==

=== Curly Brackets ===
The curly brackets are in the [[#LIST menu|LIST menu]].

=== Comma ===
The comma key is left of the 4 key.

== Functionality ==

=== Saving values in a variable ===
Pressing the STO&gt; key on the TI-86 puts the calculator into Caps Lock mode.  Since most variable names are made up of letters, this is considered handy by most TI-86 users.

=== List variable names ===
Any variable name can be used for a list.  Most people avoid single letter names, for they are mostly used for numeric varables.  Press the STO&gt; key and type in the list name.

}}

Everyone who starts a new career or hobby in 3D Modeling also seems to look around their immediate environment for things to model.  Things like your computer monitor, your keyboard, and even the desktop which they are resting are all common &quot;first models.&quot;  Developing an eye for geometry takes time and this is a great chance to practice.

For this tips and techniques discussion, I'll start with the concepts of furniture and walls, but the ideas really extend to anything and everything you can model in Blender, from spaceships to fantasy demon-women, from your barbecue deck blueprints to biologically accurate squids.

== Assemble Things, Don't Chisel Them ==

Let's start with the furniture around you.

You may think it's easy to model your desk using a couple of boolean operations on cubes.  But it rarely comes out looking quite right.  It seems like such a good idea at first.  Then you find that the drawers won't open realistically.  The corners are all amazingly sharp and crisp.  The writing surface seems to be at the wrong scale for thickness.  The woodgrain goes in the same direction everywhere.  You then realize it will be hard to bevel just the few edges that need beveling.  The more you look at it, even with good render settings, the more it looks like dollhouse furniture instead of a real life, full size desk.

Real furniture is not chiseled out of a half-ton cube of mahogany, because trees don't grow that thick, and it's a real waste to chip out the spaces for drawers.  Instead, cabinetmakers tend to assemble a piece of furniture from many component parts.  Think of those &quot;self-assembly&quot; kits from the local superstore, or even the showroom examples from a nearby unfinished knotty pine store.

Model several kinds of boards and fittings, then copy and assemble them appropriately.  You don't need to model every nail and dowel, and you don't even need to know what a [[w:dovetail joint|dovetail joint]] is.  But you can make realistic furniture when you build things from their natural components.

* Cut lumber in a variety of sizes and thicknesses.
* Measure real example furniture and take note of the construction details.
* Choose varying woodgrains by duplicating materials and adjusting them to be more individual.
* Align those woodgrains or other materials in an appropriate direction and scale for the model.
* Bevel just the parts or edges which are naturally worn or intentionally beveled.
* Any cloth, glass or metal fittings are separate components using their own materials.
* Create an &quot;Empty&quot; type object, give it a descriptive name, and parent all of the pieces to it.

There are a couple more benefits to this form of component modeling:

* Working with things made from multiple real materials is easier:  one object, one material.
* The model is more flexible, because they can be reconfigured to other styles more easily.
* Components come in handy for other models:  adapt a desk's drawers in kitchen cabinets and bedroom furniture.

== Separate Objects for each Material ==

[[image:skateboard-example.jpg|right|thumb|300px|skateboards, modeled in parts]]

A common question for new modelers is how to make one mesh that uses more than one material.  For example, a skateboard with metal trucks, rubber tires, and a wooden deck.  While Blender does provide an interface to allow such a combination, it is not usually the best approach for modeling realistically.

If you model the skateboard as separate parts, based on the way different real parts are assembled, then you have a lot more control over the final model.  You can replace the wheels or use trucks of different styles later.  You can adjust the mesh that defines the shape of the deck, without having to re-assign the areas that should be one material or the other.  And lastly, you can choose to use subsurface tricks on the various parts, while avoiding them on other parts.  Even if the whole model needs subsurfaces, it becomes a bit hard to control where one material starts, and another material ends.

== Removing the Fourth Wall ==

Just as with furniture, you may model your first building interior as a hollowed-out cube.  It seems straightforward to make a big cube, turn it inside out, and call it a living room.  There are a lot of drawbacks to working with a room that was carved out of a single chunk of solid rock.

Buildings and rooms are assembled from parts.  Just like the furniture modeling tip, design your rooms as a collection of separate pieces.

* You don't need to measure out the internal beams and joists, but remember they're there.
* Each interior or exterior wall should be its own object or assembly.
* Take care to note the correct dimensions and placement of doorways, windows, ceiling.

The benefits of a component-modeled interior include:

* Easier to see inside, just hide some walls on a different layer.
* Walls are much easier to move around to reconfigure the room layout.
* The same modeling work on one area can be copied to other rooms more easily.
* A more realistic architecture with consistent scaling is achieved quickly.

== Proportions and Measurements ==

For realism, it's vitally important to get the right proportions for familiar objects.  If your audience sees a bookshelf with 5&quot; thick shelves, or a human hand which has a 5&quot; long thumb, their brain is going to tell them that something is wrong.  They might not be able to decide why, but they'll tell you it looks fake.

Even when you're animating fantasy characters, you should develop an understanding for proportion.  Many cartoon characters have very large heads when compared to their bodies;  this allows room for greater expression and makes the characters seem younger.  Deciding how many &quot;heads high&quot; each character should appear will ensure that your figures all maintain proper proportions to each other and to their environment.

[[image:soda-can-example.jpg|right|thumb|300px|soda cans and glass, modeled in parts]]

To get good proportions, you need to think about measurements.

* Grab a ruler or find some existing blueprints.
* Think in terms of those measurements for the duration of the project.
* Choose a base scale that will let you work comfortably within a 500x500x500 unit volume.
* Blender limits cameras to 1000 unit distances, for better numerical accuracy.

You can mix and match base units, by using Empty objects as parents.  For example, you can model your furniture in inches or centimeters, and model your house in feet or meters.  Then when you append your bed.blend's objects, just parent that bed to a new Empty object, and scale the Empty.  This will conveniently scale all of the separate component pieces of the object together.

There's only one big wrinkle with working with multiple scales:  materials should be designed with a certain base scale in mind.  Many material surface properties are scaled according to the units you choose for a given object, or the world units.  Just consider this as you design, and check your work critically.

These memory aids aren't true! They're nonsense made up to help you remember the meanings of Russian words.

	&lt;td&gt;Tsvyet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Plural is цвета (colors). Note that цветы means flowers and is a plural form of цветок.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russia is too cold to take off your shirt, so Russians have &lt;i&gt;white bellies&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Chyornyj&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Picture scrubbing a floor on your knees. This &lt;i&gt;chore&lt;/i&gt; will make your &lt;i&gt;knees&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;black&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Krásnyj&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;When Russians sit with &lt;i&gt;crossed knees&lt;/i&gt; you can see their &lt;i&gt;red&lt;/i&gt; socks.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Pink&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Rózovyj&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russians love roses and love to call people so &lt;i&gt;zovy&lt;/i&gt; your &lt;i&gt;roses&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Dark Blue&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Sínij&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;You never see Russians' knees because they wear dark blue pants.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Golubój&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Голубой also means &quot;gay.&quot; Be careful what you describe as &lt;i&gt;galoo boy&lt;/i&gt;! &lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Syéryj&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Gray is a &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt; color.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Zhóltyj&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;In Russia, caffeinated soft drinks always come in yellow cans, and they have  twice the caffeine of American soft drinks, so anything you drink out of a yellow can will make you &lt;i&gt;jolty&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russians love green jello. But they don't call it &quot;jello,&quot; rather they call it &quot;zello,&quot; at least when it's green.&lt;/td&gt;

These memory aids are not true! They are nonsense made up to help you remember the meanings of Russian words.

==Rooms and Furniture==

Russian rooms usually end in ''ная''. Think of the 1994 movie &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; as if it were a room on 42nd Street.

&lt;table cols=4 border=0&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; 
	&lt;td&gt;крыша&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Roof&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Krýsha&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;In Russia they make roof shingles by krishing aluminum cans.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; 
	&lt;td&gt;чердак&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Attic&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Chyerdák&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russians put their old chairs in the attic, and a dock is where ships are tied up when not in use, so a Russian attic is a &lt;i&gt;chair dock&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; 
	&lt;td&gt;спальня&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Bedroom&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Spál'nya&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russian bedrooms have a below-ground hot tub or spa. Also, waking up is &quot;la juice spot,&quot; so &quot;spat&quot; and &quot;spal&quot; go together.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Corridor&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Koridór&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;A cognate (same word in Russian and English).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;лестница&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Stairs&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Léstnitsa&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;American stairways are hard on your knees. Russian stairways are designed to demand &lt;i&gt;less knee&lt;/i&gt; effort.  Also &quot;forest&quot; is лесно́й so a staircase is a forest of stairs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Dining room&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Stolóvayah&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Стол means &quot;table&quot; so Столовая is &quot;table room&quot; (or where Russians keep their stolen tables).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Kitchen&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Kúkhnya&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russian kitchens are warmy and kootchy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Bathroom&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Vánnaya&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Ваня (Vanya) is a Russian man's name. Don't confuse Ванная and Ваня. You might ask for directions to the bathroom, and instead get introduced to Vanya. Or you might introduce your friend Vanya as &quot;bathroom.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Office&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Kabinét&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;The President's Cabinet includes the Vice President and the heads of 15 executive departments. These are highest &lt;i&gt;offices&lt;/i&gt; in the American government. Or, Russian offices always have a &lt;i&gt;cabinet&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Living room&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Gostínaya&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;The living room is for entertaining &lt;i&gt;guests&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Basement&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Podvál&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&quot;pod&quot; means &quot;under,&quot; &quot;val&quot; means &quot;heel,&quot; so a basement is &quot;under heel.&quot; Russians store bags of pea pods in their basements, next to their bags of spuds. For entertainment and exercise they &lt;i&gt;pole vault&lt;/i&gt; over the bags of &lt;i&gt;pods&lt;/i&gt;.  The call this &lt;i&gt;pod vauting&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Kholodíl'nik&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Plitá&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Please, we're pleading for you to cook food. Don't forget, the plural of плита́ is пли́ты.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;писа́ть (don't say пи́сать) is writing and стол is table, so пи́сьменный стол is a writing table.&lt;/td&gt;

These memory aids aren't true! They're nonsense made up to help you remember the meanings of Russian words.

==Days of the Week==
 
Russians don't capitalize days of the week.

      <comment>/* What gender is for */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page explains the concept of gender in language. If you have studied another language that has gender, such as French or Spanish, and so are familiar with grammatical gender, feel free to skip this section.

== What gender is ==
'Gender' is a way of categorising nouns in a language. In most languages, words are described as being 'masculine' or 'feminine', and a lot of languages, including Russian, also have words described as 'neuter' (i.e., neutral, or no gender). In languages like French, the gender of a particular word is mostly arbitrary: there's nothing in the word ''peau'' ('skin') that tells us it's a ''feminine'' word, and so a word's gender is largely just something you have to learn. Fortunately, in Russian, gender ''can'' be predicted. Like most other things in Russian, the gender of a noun is denoted by what letters are on the end of the word:
: Masculine nouns end in a consonant: '''б, в, г, д, ж, з, й к, л, м, н, п, р, с, т, ф, х, ч, ц, ш''', or '''щ'''. Notice that '''й''' is a consonant. For example, '''кролик''' (''&lt;small&gt;KRO&lt;/small&gt;-leek'', 'rabbit') ends in a consonant, '''-к''', so it is a ''masculine'' word.
: Feminine nouns end in '''а''' or '''я'''. For example, '''собака''' (''so-&lt;small&gt;BA&lt;/small&gt;-ka'', 'dog') ends in an '''-a''', so it is a ''feminine'' word.
: Neuter nouns end in '''о''' or '''е'''. For example, '''письмо''' (''pees-&lt;small&gt;MO&lt;/small&gt;'', 'letter') ends in an '''-o''', so it is grammatically ''neuter''.
: Nouns ending in '''-ь''' can be either masculine or feminine. These just have to be memorised.
So, in Russian, nouns have an intrinsic property called 'gender', which comes in three types: masculine, feminine, and neuter. But why is this important?

== What gender is for ==
To learn Russian, you have to be able to know the gender of a noun when you use it. When you modify a noun with an [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives|adjective]] ('nice dog', 'Red Square', 'old door'), the adjective changes its ending to match the gender of the word its modifying. So although adjectives don't have an intrinsic gender, they have a number of different endings they can use to match the gender of their noun. The same is true for [[Russian/Possessive_Pronouns|possessive pronouns]]: the 'my' in 'my dog' ('''моя собака''') and 'my table' ('''мой стол''') are different, as the gender of 'dog' ('''собака''', ''f'') and 'table' ('''стол''', ''m'') are different. [[Russian/Personal Pronouns|Personal pronouns]] (I, we, they, etc) don't usually have any inherent gender, instead taking on the gender of the thing they're referring to - though third-person singular pronouns ''do'' have specific genders: '''он''' ('he'), '''она''' ('she'), and '''оно''' ('it'). Gender also influences how you form the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]] of [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs|verbs]]: The 'wrote' in 'He wrote' ('''он написал''') and 'she wrote' ('''она написала''') are different, as the genders of the subject of the verb, 'he' and 'she', are different.

So, gender affects a lot of different parts of Russian grammar, and so is an important part of learning Russian. Fortunately, it's easy to learn, and easy to use.

== Plurals ==
Russian uses plurals in much the same way as English. The rules for forming the plural depend on which [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|grammatical case]] the word is in. However, the important thing here is that the rules are largely the same for all nouns, regardless of gender. This carries over into adjectives too: the endings they take on when their noun is plural, are independent  of gender. There's no 'masculine plural' and 'feminine plural' - there's just, 'plural'.

As such, it is perhaps easiest to think of plurals as a 'fourth gender', and this is the way summary tables in this Wikibook will be presented.

      <comment>/* Dative adjectives */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Adjectives in Russian are simply words that modify nouns. The endings of adjectives change according to the gender, number, and case of the nouns they modify. The rules for changing adjectives is often a lot easier than the rules for changing nouns themselves. There are six cases, and so six main ways of conjugating adjectives to fit the noun they modify. Finally, there are the ''short adjectives'', detailed at the end.

[[File:Red_Square_Security.jpg|thumb|Red Square - Красная Площадь - &lt;br&gt;''&lt;small&gt;KRA&lt;/small&gt;-sna-ya &lt;small&gt;PLO&lt;/small&gt;-chshad'' ]]

== Nominative adjectives ==
The default form of an adjective is its nominative, masculine, singular form, and this is the form given in dictionaries. All Russian adjectives in their default form end in either '''-ый''', '''-ий''', or '''-ой''', and conjugating them is as simple as removing this default ending and adding the new one.

=== Hard endings ===
Most Russian adjectives have a hard ending. In fact, all three endings ('''-ый''', '''-ий''', and '''-ой''') are 'hard'. The only exception is those adjectives ending in '''-ний''', which we'll discuss in a moment. For now, we only need to know that an adjective can have four different endings in the nominative case: masculine, feminine, neuter, and plural.

# When adjectives modify a masculine noun, they use their default ending. Most adjectives have the '''-ый''' ending, pronounced 'ee', less common is '''-ий''', also pronounced 'ee', and less common still is '''-ой''', pronounced 'oy'. For example, &quot;new pencil&quot; is '''новый карандаш''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vee ka-ran-&lt;small&gt;DASH&lt;/small&gt;''). As a memory aid, remember that masculine nouns end in a consonant or й, and the masculine ending for adjectives end in й.
#With feminine nouns, the adjective ends in '''-ая'''. An easy way to remember this is to remember that '''a''' and '''я''' are what go on the end of feminine nouns. For example, &quot;new car&quot; is '''новая машина''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vah-yah ma-&lt;small&gt;SHEE&lt;/small&gt;-na''&quot;).
#With neuter nouns, the adjective ends in '''-ое'''. Like with feminine nouns, you can remember this as the two letters that go on the end of neuter nouns, '''o''' and '''e'''. For example, &quot;new dress&quot; is '''новое платье''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vo-yeh &lt;small&gt;PLAT&lt;/small&gt;-ye'').
#With plural nouns, regardless of gender, the adjective replaces '''-ый''' or '''-ой''' with '''-ые''' ('ee-ye'), or it replaces '''-ий''' with '''-ие''' ('ee-ye'). For example, &quot;these good new students&quot; is '''эти хорошие новые студенты''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;EH&lt;/small&gt;-tee kha-&lt;small&gt;RO&lt;/small&gt;-shee-ye &lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vih-yeh stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;-ee''). As a memory aid, think of plural as one masculine and one neuter object. Take the first letter from the masculine ending ('''ы''') and the second letter from the neuter ending ('''e''') and you get '''ые'''.

===Soft endings===
One rather rare exception to the above rules is if the adjective ends in the so-called 'soft' ending, '''-ний''', such as '''синий''' (dark blue). This doesn't conjugate like usual '''-ий''' endings, and instead has the following rules:
# The ending is '''-ний''' when modifying a masculine noun. For example, the dark blue table - '''синий стол.'''
# The ending is '''-няя''' ('nya-ah') when modifying feminine nouns. For example, the dark blue book - '''синяя книга'''
# The ending is '''-нee''' ('nye-eh') when modifying neuter nouns. For example, the dark blue letter - '''синее письмо'''
# The plural ending is '''-ние''' ('nee-ye'), as per usual. For example, the dark blue books - '''синие книги'''

===5- and 7-letter spelling rules===
When forming the nominative plural of nouns, recall that if the stem ends in '''г, ж, к, х, ч, ш''', or '''щ''', you add '''и''', not '''ы'''. This 7-letter spelling rule also applies to adjectives. As a memory aid, these letters include the non-English-looking 'hushes' ('''ч, ш, щ, ж''') and three letters pronounced at the back of the throat ('''г, к, х'''). This is why adjectives whose stem ends in one of these seven letters have the '''-ий''' ending instead of '''-ый'''.

Four of these letters are also in the 5-letter spelling rule. This states that, if the stem ends in '''ж, ц, ч, ш''', or '''щ''', any unstressed '''o''' in an ending is instead written as '''e'''. For example, 'the good letter' is written '''хорошее письмо''' (and ''not'' '''хорошое письмо''').

== Accusative adjectives ==
Adjectival endings in the accusative case are similar to noun endings, in that they all use endings from other cases, with the exception of feminine nouns.

Masculine adjectives take the nominative form if their noun is inanimate, and neuter adjectives always take their nominative form. For example, I want a new chair and a new letter - '''Я хочу новый стул и новое письмо'''. However, if the modified masculine noun is a person or animal, then both it and its adjectives take the genitive form. For example, I want a new rabbit - '''Я хочу нового кролика.'''

Feminine adjectives simply have '''-ую''' in the accusative. As a memory aid, this is the two letters that feminine nouns take on in the accusative case. For example, My Russian cat likes my new dog - '''Моя русская кошка любит мою новую собаку'''. One exception is adjectives with the soft ending: they take '''-юю''' in the accusative instead.

Plural adjectives, regardless of gender, are also split according to animation: inanimate plural adjectives take their nominative form, while animate ones take their genitive form.

|}

== Genitive adjectives ==
The genitive case is relatively easy, especially compared with how nouns decline in this case. Adjectives use the same ending for both masculine and neuter nouns: '''-ого'''. If the adjective has the soft ending or ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''), it ends in '''-его'''. Note that with these genitive endings there's a new pronunciation rule: '''-ого''' is pronounced 'oh-vo', not 'oh-goh', and '''-его''' is pronounced 'ye-vo', not 'ye-goh'. This unusual pronunciation is only on genitive (and accusative) endings; '''мно́го''', 'much/many', is pronounced 'mno-ga'.

Like masculine and neuter adjectives, the feminine form has two endings: '''-ой''' ('oy'), or '''-ей''' ('yay') for soft adjectives and those ending in the 5-letter rule.

The plural form also has two endings: '''-ых''', or '''-их''', if the adjective's stem ends in one of the ''7-letter-rule'' letters ('''х, г, к, ш, щ, ч, ж''').

|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ого'''&lt;br&gt;'''его''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ых'''&lt;br&gt;'''их'''
|}

Examples:
:My new husband has many friends - '''У моего нового мужа есть много друзе́й'''
:Three kilograms of fresh new cheeses - '''Три килогра́мма свежих новых сыров'''
:A kilogram of beautiful American apples - '''Килогра́мм краси́вых америка́нских я́блок'''
:I arrived from my old house - '''Я пришёл из моего старого дома'''

== Instrumental adjectives ==
The instrumental case is used to denote nouns which are the means by which a verb is carried out, such as, &quot;I am writing ''with a pen''&quot; ('''Я пишу́ ''ру́чкой''''').

To form masculine and neuter adjectives, the ending is '''-ым'''. If the adjective ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц''') or the soft ending ('''-ний'''), then the instrumental ending is '''-им'''. For example, 'I wrote with a good new pencil' - '''Я написал хорошим новым карандашом'''.

Feminine adjectives end in '''-ой'''. For adjectives ending in the 5-letter rule or soft ending, the instrumental ending is '''ей'''. These are the same as the feminine singular endings for the genitive, dative, and prepositional cases. For example, 'I want a meeting with an interesting Russian woman' - '''Я хочу встречу с интересной русской женщиной'''.

To form the instrumental plural, all adjectives have '''-ыми'''. Those which end in '''-ий''' have '''-ими'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ым'''&lt;br&gt;'''им''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ыми'''&lt;br&gt;'''ими'''
|}

Examples:
:I live between two new houses - '''Я живу́ ме́жду двумя но́выми дома́ми'''
:It's under the good books - '''Оно́ под хоро́шими кни́гами'''
:I am studying Russian - '''Я занима́юсь ру́сским языко́м'''

== Dative adjectives ==
The dative case denotes the secondary object of a verb. For example, 'I wrote a letter to him' would place 'letter' in the accusative case as it's the direct object of the verb, while 'to him' would be the word 'him' placed in the dative case. Thus, it translates to '''Я написал письмо ему'''. Adjectives in the dative case conjugate as follows:

Masculine and neuter adjectives end in '''-ому'''. If the adjective ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц''') or the soft ending ('''-ний'''), they end in '''-ему'''. If you already know the prepositional form, you will see this is prepositional form, with an '''у''' attached. This can be a useful memory aid, as most dative masculine and neuter nouns end in '''-у'''.

Similarly, feminine adjectives in the dative actually ''are'' identical to their prepositional form (and their instrumental and genitive forms as well): '''-ой''', unless the stem ends in the 5-letter rule, or the adjective ends in the soft ending, in which case '''-ей'''.

Plural adjectives are like plural nouns in the dative form, in that they're the same as their instrumental cousins, only without the end '''и'''. This also means that they're the same as their instrumental singular forms. In other words, dative plural adjectives end in '''-ым''', unless they end in the 7-letter rule ('''г, к, х, ш, щ, ж, ч'''), in which case the ending is '''-им'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ому'''&lt;br&gt;'''ему''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ым'''&lt;br&gt;'''им'''
|}

Examples:
:She wants to speak to your young cousin - '''Она́ хо́чет поговори́ть с ва́шей молодо́й двою́родной сестро́й'''
:He walked along the new street - '''Он шёл по но́вой у́лице'''
:I gave five pounds to the nice old lady - '''Я дал пять фу́нтов симпати́чной ста́рой же́нщине'''

==Prepositional adjectives==
The final case is the [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional case]]. This is only used after four prepositions ('''в, на, о(б)''', and '''при'''), as discussed more thoroughly on it's dedicated page. As you may guess by now, there is an ending for masculine and neuter adjectives, an ending for feminine adjectives, and an ending for plural adjectives, and they all have alternatives if the adjectival stem ends in the 5- or 7- letter rule.

The ending for masculine and neuter endings is the same as that for dative adjectives, minus the end vowel: '''-ом'''. If the stem ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''), or the adjective has the soft ending '''-ний''', the ending is '''-ем'''. For example, 'They were talking about a good new cinema' - '''Они говорили о хорошем новом кино''' (note that '''кино''', 'cinema', is indeclinable).

Feminine adjectives have the same ending as in the genitive, dative, and instrumental cases: '''-ой''', or, if the adjective ends in the 5-letter rule or the soft ending, '''-ей'''. For example, 'They were in the old Russian school' - '''Они были в старой русской школе'''.

Plural adjectives in the prepositional end in '''-ых'''. If the stem ends in the 7-letter rule ('''г, к, х, ш, щ, ж, ч''') or the adjective has the soft ending, the plural prepositional ending is '''-их'''. For example, 'They like to live in big red houses' - '''Они любят жить в больших красных домах'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;

| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ом'''&lt;br&gt;'''ем''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ых'''&lt;br&gt;'''их'''

Examples:
:I want to live in a clean new city - '''Я хочу́ жить в чи́стом но́вом го́роде'''
:She's in the blue apartment, not the white apartment - '''Она́ в си́ней кварти́ре, не в бе́лой кварти́ре''' - ''note the soft ending of '''си́ний/си́ней'''''
:Let's talk about my beautiful young Russian wife! - '''Давайте говорить о мое́й краси́вой молодо́й ру́сской жене́!'''

The masculine and plural accusative endings are split between inanimate endings on the left, and animate endings on the right. Most other endings come in pairs. For singular endings, only use the right-hand one (with an '''e''' in it) after adjectival stems that end in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''). For plural endings, only use the right-hand one (with an '''и''')  after the 7-letter rule ('''г, к, х, ш, щ, ж, ч'''; that is, any adjective whose default ending is '''-ий'''). For adjectives that have the soft ending ('''-ний'''), always use the right-hand ending. Finally, notice that for the latter four cases, the neuter ending is the same as the masculine, and the feminine endings are all the same.

== Short adjectives ==
=== Usage ===
When an adjective describes something permanent, fixed, or unchanging, we use the 'long-form', which is given in the above sections. By contrast, short adjectives describe something transient, fleeting, or temporary. For instance, 'I'm happy!' could be written in Russian using the usual, 'long-form' adjecitve: '''Я счастли́вый!''' (for a boy) or '''Я счастли́вая!''' (for a girl). However, since the quality of 'being happy' might be a temporary one (compare &quot;I'm always happy&quot; with &quot;I was happy yesterday morning&quot;), we can describe this state using the short form of the adjective to emphasise its temporary nature.  Conversational Russian prefers constructions that use long-form adjectives, though the short form is still used for this important distinction.

Every adjective has both long and short forms; which you use depends on the finer details of what you're trying to say. If in doubt, use the long form. The short form is used in sentences like 'The house is clean', rather than 'The clean house'; though both are broadly conveying the same idea, the temporary nature of the adjective is emphasised by being in the short form, ''and'' by being at the end of the sentence, just like in English.

=== Formation ===
To make the short form of any adjective, just remove the ending. The feminine then has the suffix '''-а''', the neuter has '''-о''', and all plurals have '''-ы'''. The short form doesn't change according to the case of the noun it modifies, only gender and number, making it very easy to remeber. The masculine form is usually just the bare stem, but if it ends in awkward consonant clusters, we add an '''o''' or '''e''' to smooth things out. Specifically, we add '''-o-''' before a final '''-к''', and '''-e-''' before a final '''-н'''. For example, '''ни́зкий''' ('low') would have the short form '''низк''', but since this is hard to pronounce, the masculine short form is instead '''ни́зок'''.

If you have a good grasp of gender and number, you'll find these suffixes very easy to remember. So, the short forms of '''счастли́вый''' is '''сча́стлив, сча́стливa, сча́стливo''', and '''сча́стливы''', and to say &quot;I'm happy&quot; with emphasis on the temporary nature of this happiness, we would say '''Я сча́стлив!'''.

=== Exceptions ===
There are two adjectives with exceptional short forms, '''большо́й''' ('big') and '''маленький''' ('small'), as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Gender !! '''Большой''' !! '''Маленький'''
|-
! Masculine
| вели́к || мал
|-
! Feminine
| велика́ || мала́
|-
! Neuter
| велико́ || мало́
|-
! Plural
| велики́ || малы́
|}

Some adjectives have no short form, and tend to be those that are derived from nouns. These have endings like '''-ский''', '''-овой''', and '''-ной''' (e.g., '''братский'''). There is also a short-form adjective, '''рад''' ('glad'), which has no long form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''[[w:Grammatical_case|case]]''' is a grammatical concept that tells you what a word is doing in a sentence. For example, the thing performing a verb is denoted as such with a case, while something being counted or enumerated has a different case. This page gives brief overviews of what each of the six cases are used for, with a table summarising how to put a word in that case.

== What is a case? ==
Russian has six cases, and the case of a word is denoted by suffixes (word endings) that tell you the context of the word. English has few cases, favouring grammatical constructions over implicit case endings: compare the sentences, &quot;I like apples&quot; and &quot;apples like me&quot;; the first-person pronoun is 'I' when it's the subject of the verb, but it's 'me' when it's the object of the verb. These cases in English are called ''subjective'' and ''objective'', and convey the same information as the Russian [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|''nominative'']] and [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|''accusative'']] cases. Russian sentences are more heavily based on cases than English, so they make up the bulk of mastering basic Russian.

Cases in Russian affect nouns, [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives|adjectives]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Pronouns|pronouns]] ('I', 'me', 'my', 'your', etc). Adjectives modify a noun, and take the case ending that corresponds with whatever case the noun is in. This is true of possessive pronouns as well. So, in the phrase &quot;My cute dog licked your big hands&quot;, 'hands' is the object of the verb, so is in the ''accusative'' case - and therefore 'your' and 'big' would also be in the accusative. Nouns and adjectives also change according to [[Russian/Grammar/Gender|gender]] (masculine/feminine/neuter) and number (singular/plural), but more on that later.

Cases are 'called' in two main ways: when you want to use a noun in the main function of the case, or when a preposition specifically calls it. For instance, if you wanted to say, &quot;Under the rug&quot;, Russians say '''под''' (pod) and then the word 'rug' in its ''instrumental'' form, since the preposition '''под''' calls the instrumental case when it means 'under'. In Russian this is, &quot;'''Под ковриком'''&quot; (''pod &lt;small&gt;KOV&lt;/small&gt;-ree-kom''), where '''ковриком''' is the instrumental form of '''коврик''' (''&lt;small&gt;KOV&lt;/small&gt;-reek''), 'rug'.

The following subsections give an overview of what each case does, with summary tables of conjugation The format for these will be &quot;X,Y --&gt; Z&quot;, meaning if the word ends in X or Y, you remove the X or Y and replace it with Z. &quot;+X&quot; means you append X to the end of the word. Generally speaking, these tables should be used for revision of rules already learned, not learning cases themselves. For that, see the pages on each case, where declination is explained more thoroughly, and exceptions and caveats to these general rules will be given.

===[[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|Nominative case]]===
'''Имени́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''eem-een-&lt;small&gt;EET&lt;/small&gt;-eel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The nominative case is the default case of a word, as found in dictionaries and when no other case is specifically used. It is also used for the subject of a sentence: in &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot;, Bob is the subject of the sentence, so would be in its default nominative form. The gender of a word can be deduced by its nominative form. As you don't need to decline a noun in the nominative singular (you just use its default, undeclined form), for the nominative singular cells in the following declination tables, the letters that define gender will be used instead.

'''Роди́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''ruh-&lt;small&gt;DEE&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The genitive case has four main uses:

*'''Counting''' - When counting objects (&quot;I have six sheep&quot;), the thing being enumerated is usually put in the genitive case.
*'''Possession''' - If something is owned by something else, the owner is in the genitive case. This is similar to the 's' in English: &quot;my brother's car&quot;. &quot;Brother's&quot;, in Russian, would be the singular word &quot;brother&quot;, '''брат''', in its genitive form, '''брата'''. This also corresponds with the English 'of', as in 'car of my brother'.
*'''Negation''' - To say something is there, we generally use the nominative case. If it isn't there, we use '''нет''' followed by the genitive.
*'''Prepositions''' - A number of common prepositions call the genitive case. The most common is '''у''', which means 'by' or 'near'. It's also used to say &quot;I have...&quot;: '''У''' + ''gen'' '''есть''' + ''nom''.

'''Да́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''&lt;small&gt;DA&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The dative case is used to denote indirect objects, which are objects that indicate &quot;to whom&quot;, or &quot;to what&quot; an action is done. So in the sentence, &quot;I am writing a letter to you&quot;, &quot;(a) letter&quot; is the direct object of the verb, while '(to) you' is the indirect object. In Russian, direct objects go in the accusative case, and indirect objects go in the dative case. As in English, sentences do not always have indirect objects.

=== [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|Accusative case]] ===
'''Вини́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''vee-&lt;small&gt;NEE&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The accusative case is used for the direct object of a verb. In &quot;Bob eats lunch,&quot; &quot;lunch&quot; is the direct object. In English, the object of a sentence is indicated by context and word order, with a strict subject-verb-object (SVO) system. In English, &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot; and &quot;Lunch eats Bob&quot; have different meanings. But in Russian, since the two cases are distinguished by suffixes, we can change the order of words and still know who's the object and who's the subject. If English indicated the direct object by adding &quot;oo&quot;, we could say &quot;Bob eats lunchoo&quot; or &quot;Lunchoo eats Bob&quot;, and either way it would clear that Bob was doing the eating.

One nuance of the accusative case is that it makes a distinction of animacy. That is, masculine nouns denoting people or animals (i.e., ''animate'' nouns) take their genitive form, while neuter nouns and inanimate masculine nouns take their nominative form. Plural nouns of any gender take their nominative plural form if inanimate, or their genitive plural form if animate.

'''Твори́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''tvuh-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The instrumental case is used to denote the object by which something is done. In the sentence, &quot;I am writing with a pencil&quot;, the phrase 'with a pencil' in Russian is simply the word 'pencil' ('''карандаш''') put into its instrumental form ('''карандашом''').  In this way, it corresponds to one of the two meanings of the word 'with' in English: 'with', as in 'by means of'. The other meaning, 'in the company of', such as &quot;I rode with Jane&quot;, is also commanded by the instrumental case, though this requires a preposition: '''с''' + ''inst''.

There are five other common prepositions that command the instrumental: '''под''' (pod, 'under') '''над''' (nad, 'above'/'on top of') '''за''' (za, 'behind') '''между''' (mezh-doo, 'between'), and '''перед''' (pye-red, 'before'/'in front of').

'''Предло́жный паде́ж''' - '''''preed-&lt;small&gt;LOZH&lt;/small&gt;-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The prepositional case is also called the ''locative'' case, as it was commonly used to denote a sentence's object's location or an activity. Nowadays, however, it's only ever called after a few prepositions, hence its name. It's not rare, though, and the prepositions that call it are the most common of all Russian prepositions. They are '''в''' (in), '''на''' (on), and '''о/обо''' (about; it's '''обо''' in the phrase &quot;about me&quot; or &quot;about my&quot;). However, these prepositions can also call other cases, in which case their meaning changes. For instance, '''в''' + ''prep'' means 'in', as in, &quot;I live in England&quot;. '''в''' + ''acc'', however, means 'into' or 'to', as in, &quot;I'm flying to New York&quot;.

Note that entries for the nominative singular don't describe declination rules, but rather describe gender. So the feminine entry, 'а or я', says that feminine nouns are those that end in either '''-а''' or '''-я''' in the nominative singular. For a more complete description of gender in Russian, see [[Russian/Grammar/Gender]].

Unlike nouns, adjectives have no intrinsic gender, instead taking on the gender of the noun they modify. However, by default, they end in either '''ый''', '''ий''', or '''ой''', and they keep these forms when modifying masculine singular nouns in the nominative case.

{{recipesummary|Dessert recipes|1 full 12-ounce jar |15 - 20 minutes|2}}


Lemon curd is a custard-like dessert sauce made with eggs, lemon juice and zest, sugar, and butter.

This recipe will produce one full 12-ounce (330g) jar of lemon curd (similar to but not the same as lemon pie filling), plus a little left over so you can lick the bowl.  Lemon curd keeps for up to a week in the refrigerator.  It is excellent on short bread, biscuits, scones, and English muffins. 

This dish goes well with scones, short breads, and muffins.

==Equipment==

* 1-quart saucepan
* whisk
* measuring cup
* grater or zester
* medium to large strainer of fine-to-medium mesh
* rubber spatula
* 1-quart kitchen bowl
* 12-ounce (about 330g) jar with sealable lid

===Ingredients===

* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120ml) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] freshly grated lemon zest
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1\4 cup unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (60 ml)
* Pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional, to bring out sweetness and flavor of finished product)

===Procedure===
# Grate the lemon rinds to produce two tablespoons of zest.  Grate only the yellow zest, avoid the inner white pith which is bitter.
# Extract the juice from the lemons to produce 1/2 cup (120ml) of juice.
# Cut the butter into small chunks.
# Put eggs, zest, sugar, and salt into cooled sauce pan.
# Whisk ingredients in pan till frothy and light in color (a minute or two).
# Add lemon juice and whisk 30 seconds.
# Add butter chunks.
# Set pan on stove burner, turn on heat to medium-to-low, and start whisking contents so they don't coagulate or stick to bottom of pan.
# Whisk constantly till butter melts and mixture thickens, then whisk another two minutes, but do not let mixture boil - it should be quite steamy (185°F, 85°C).
# Optional: Remove zest with the strainer over a mixing bowl and pouring the mixture through.  Then work the mixture through the strainer with the spatula to strain out the zest and any egg lumps; rake mixture off bottom of strainer into bowl.
# Pour mixture from bowl into jar to within 1/4 inch (0.75cm) from top, taking care not to get mixture on rim, then seal jar with lid.
# Refrigerate to thicken the product further.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The below decks may be moved around between the tiers as new cards, trends, discoveries and interactions make certain strategies more or less competitive than they were previously. Please add to these primers any information or strategies that you have to offer.
=Tier One Strategies=

==Threshold Primer==
Threshold is an evolution of Extended Miracle Gro/Super Gro lists. With the low amount of lands and high density of control, it uses Cantrips to find land early game and more cantrips and control midgame-lategame. This deck wins by using Threshold creatures, such as Nimble Mongoose and Werebear. More recently, Tarmogoyf has also been adopted due to its efficiency. This deck has many variations. ÐIt ranges from 3-4 colors, and each of those colors give it a different form of control or win conditions. White which happens to the most popular, is splashed for Swords to Plowshares, Meddling Mage, and Mystic Enforcer. As for the Sideboard, it is splashed for Tivadar's Crusade, Armageddon, Jotun Grunt, Worship, and at times, Nantuko Monastery. Red is splashed for maindeck Burn (Lightning Bolt, Fire // Ice, and/or Magma Jet/Chain Lightning) and Fledgling Dragon, and Pyroclasm for the Sideboard. Black is splashed for Dark Confidant and Ghastly Demise, and Pernicious Deed, Duress, Darkblast, and Diabolic Edict for the Sideboard.

==Goblins Primer==

Goblins is a pure aggro build that usually uses Aether Vial and Goblin Lackey to speed large numbers of goblins into play to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Goblin Piledriver, Goblin Warchief, Goblin Matron, and Goblin Ringleader are staple cards used towards this effect with many maindecked or toolbox goblins for specific removals and damage sources. Some common cards are Gempalm Incinerators, Mogg Fanatic, Goblin Sharpshooter, Siege-Gang Commander, and Kiki-Jiki Mirror Breaker.  Goblins usually runs a touch of direct damage aside from these in the form of Lightning Bolt or Tarfire, and some land based land destruction in the form of Dust Bowl or Wasteland. Goblins is generally mono-red but has been known to spash white for sideboarded disenchants or black for Patriarch's Bidding.

=Tier Two Strategies=
==Survival Primer==
Survival decks involve using Survival of the fittest combined with early mana acceleration to search through a toolbox deck of well chosen creatures such as Anger, Genesis, Squee Goblin Nabob, Rofellos. There are several sub-versions of this deck that all play very different. 

ATS (Angry Tradewind Survival) splashes blue in for Tradewind Rider and more control oriented cards (counterspell, force of will, mystic snake) and plays a slower paced game that involves using survival to find answers in creature form and Tradewind riders to lock the board. This build usually performs poorly against heavy aggro, such as goblins. 

Survival combo. The original incarnations of this deck involved using recurring nightmare to reanimate fatties that were tossed in the graveyard with survival. The main creature focus of this deck were ones with come in to play effects such as Nekrataal, Uktabi Orangutan, Cloudchaser Eagle, Avalanche Riders etc.  This deck is more aggressive than ATS, and in its time was THE survival deck. Also popular for quite some time now is to have a Volrath's Shapeshifter in play then toss multiple fatties or utility creatures with survival (such as morphling and krosan cloudscraper).These deck styles do not do well against decks with any type of disruption or control so they are currently not seeing much play.

Currently many players are working with R/G survival which focuses on using aggressive, efficient creatures to maintain board position, while survival guarantees finding answers in the early game and a finisher in the mid to late game. This has an advantage over previous builds which fall apart if the player can't resolve and keep a survival on the table. most versions agree on using burning wish to pull in key cards in poor match ups, namely against combo decks.

While this is a very fun deck to play; it can be rather expensive to build, and every incarnation seems to perform poorly against one of the main 3 archetypes(being combo, control/disruption , aggro).

==Pikula &amp; Variants Primer==
Bw Pikula is a deck created by Chris Pikula, which happens to be a spin-off of Pikula's favorite decks from 96; Necropotence.

By replacing the Necropotence with Dark Confidant, and splashing White in for Vindicate, Swords to Plowshares, and Gerrald's Verdict, it created a perfect monster for the format. By mana screwing the opponent, and heavy discard, as well as Dark Confidants to keep the engine going, disruption and threats come constant.

Some other versions replace Red for Terminate and Blazing Specter, and Green for Pernicious Deed.

==Faerie Stompy Primer==
Faerie Stompy is a monoblue aggressive deck. This deck uses blue flying creatures such as Cloud of Faeries, Mulldrifter, Sea Drake, Serendib Efreet, and Sower of Temptation. This deck also uses Trinket Mage to search for Relic of Progenitus, Sigil of Distinction, Engineered Explosives, and Seat of the Synod. If a player controls a Chrome Mox and Ancient Tomb or City of Traitors but no other lands in play, Sea Drake's &quot;comes into play effect&quot; will not trigger. 

Mana Sources:
* 4 Chrome Mox
* 4 City of Traitors
* 4 Ancient Tomb
* 9 Island
* 1 Seat of the Synod

Creatures:
* 4 Sea Drake
* 4 Serendib Efreet
* 3-4 Mulldrifter
* 3-4 Cloud of Faeries

Instants:
*4 Force of Will

Artifacts:
* 4 Chalice of the Void
* 0-2 Umezawa's Jitte
* Sword of Fire and Ice
* Sword of Light and Shadow

=Tier Three Strategies=
==Angel Stompy Primer==
Angel Stompy is an accelerated White Weenie evolution that uses Turbo Accelerants, such as Ancient Tomb, Chrome Mox, and/or City of Traitors. The deck uses Equipment as Draw Engines and Removal such as Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte, while using utility creatures and beaters to abuse the Equipment. The deck was created by Zilla from the Source.

It's most famous moves are...

Turn 1: Ancient Tomb, Chrome Mox, and Facedown Exalted Angel.
Turn 2: Play Plains, Tap Plains, Chrome Mox, and Ancient Tomb, Flip Exalted Angel, and attack.

Some versions of Angel Stompy splash Blue and/or Black for Spectral Lynx, Meddling Mage, Duress, Srendib Efreet, and Brainstorm.

==Stax Primer==
Stax is a Prison deck ported from Type 1.

It uses Trinisphere, Crucible of Worlds, Tangle Wire, Uba Mask, Chalice of the Void, Sphere of Resistance, and Smokestack to create a board lock, and restrict the number of spells being played.

This deck uses a mana base of Ancient Tomb, Crystal Vein, and City of Traitors with Mox Diamond for extra speed.  These land are very synergistic with Crucible of World because discarded land to Mox Dimonds can be replayed as well as replaying sacrificed Crystal Vein or City of Traitors. Crucible also allows the Stax player to replay sacrificed lands from Smokestack.  Although the deck is much less powerful than the flame vault stax deck it is still a strong rogue deck seen with a top 16 place at worlds by Brandon Adams.

Flame Vault Stax is a Stax deck utilizing Flame Fusillade and Time Vault to inflict infinite damage.  Also Time Vault could combo with Stasis and Smokestacks skipping infinite turns winning by decking. Time Vault was errataed to fix the combo and any power Time Vault had to create a prison lock.


Newer versions of the deck are designed by Chris Coppola and Brandon Adams.

==Red Burn Primer==
===List &amp; Explanation===
The best burn decks runs a base with only the fastest most efficient burn spells available and very few if any nonland permanents. Thus these decks make up for their inability to draw cards by making all of the removal and bounce in your opponents hand worthless. Magma Jet also serves a similar goal in making sure that the cards you draw are indeed cards that help you win.
Spells:
* 4 Lava Spike
* 4 Chain Lightning
* 4 Lightning Bolt
* 4 Mogg Fanatic or Thunderbolt
* 4 Rift Bolt
* 4 Magma Jet
* 4 Incinerate
* 4 Flame Rift
* 4 Flamebreak
* 4 Fireblast

Lands:
* 4 Mountain
* 4 Snow Covered Mountain
* 4 Plateau or Mountain
* 4 Bloodstained Mire or Barbarian Ring
* 4 Wooded Foothills

'''Explanation of the Alternatives'''

Lighning Helix/Plateau - There are two types of metagames, those where nonbasics and Wastelands run rampant, and those where nonbasics are few and far between. In the former, while the life gain and the ability to sideboard Disenchant are great reasons to splash white, the added versatility of Disenchant is offset by the added vulnerability to Wasteland. And the life gained by running Lightning Helix is offset by the life lost from Plateau since running a playset of Price of Progress is a must in such metagames. Thus, Lightning Helix is best thought off as an alternative to Price of Progress in those precisely those metagames where nonbasic lands and Wastelands are few and far between. In such metagames, Lightning Helix compensates for the life loss associated with the incredibly effective Flame Rift and Flamebreak.

Price of Progress - This card can be an absolute bomb against those decks that run multiple nonbasic lands. While many of the current decks fit this mold, a few decks run no such nonbasic lands and thus it is debatable if this card should be maindecked or sideboarded. If you choose not to run it, splash white and run Lightning Helix.

Barbarian Ring - This land has the slight disadvantage of not being saccable to Fireblast. It's a tough call. On one hand, it is very effective against Blue based control strategies and thus warrants consideration in decks running Lightning Helix. But on the same token, in mono Red builds running Price of Progress, the added vulnerability to both Wastelands and your own Price of Progress is just not worthwhile.

Mogg Fanatic - This is an excellent one drop creature that finds its way into most burn decks. Though it violates the no nonland permanent rule that burn decks live by, the fact that it can be sacrificed to deal damage compensates for this. The only reason not to run this would be in an almost entirely creature dominated environment where it will never get through to deal even as much damage as a Shock. But even then, it still warrants consideration.

Thunderbolt - This is an excellent alternative burn spells that replaces Mogg Fanatic in high toughness creature dominated metagames. It can also be used in burn decks that can't afford the Plateaus for the white splash though they play in areas where running Price of Progress is not worthwhile. It can even replace Flame Rift in environments where such life loss unacceptable.

Flame Rift - The main reason that Flame Rift is used is because that one extra damage lets you win the game a full turn faster a third of the matches you play. But it can replaced in metagames where you often find yourself being outraced.

Chain of Plasma - This serves the same purpose as Thunderbolt, as an alternative burn spell. But Thunderbolt is almost certainly the superior option. Chain of Plasma has the small but still relevant liability of being bounced back in situations where you don't have any cards to discard or simply don't want to discard (when you are holding a Fireblast for example). A good opponent would never bounce back Chain of Plasma unless it is advantageous to them. Thunderbolt on the other hand has no real drawback since there are so many other burn spells in the deck that can deal with creatures when necessary. In addition, the ability of Thunderbolt to destroy four toughness flying creatures when necessary is actually a positive.

Flamebreak - Burn wants to aim everything for the dome without caring about the creatures that your opponent is casting. This card lets it do that by clearing the board of opposing creatures while still dealing damage to the dome. Leaving this card out of the deck is not an option.

'''Popular Cards That Shouldn't Be Run'''

Volcanic Hammer - This is yet another alternative to Thunderbolt and Chain of Plasma. It shouldn't be run, simply because the sorcery speed is a bigger drawback than the drawbacks of either of the other cards. Playing your cards at the end of your opponents turn is a critical component of playing burn decks, and this interferes with that plan. Incinerate in just a much better card.

Grim Lavamancer - While a few people feel that this card is ultimately too efficient not to run, it clearly violates the no nonland permanent rule and also is a bit too slow. These are the same reason that a number of other nonland permanants such as Ankh of Mishra, Sulfuric Vortex and Cursed Scroll are not utilized in this deck.

Ball Lightning - While the main reason this card fell into disuse, Mana Drain, no longer exists in Legacy, it's high casting cost makes it only usable as a finisher. And the fact that this a creature that can be targeted by removal or blocked makes it an unreliable finisher at that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The below decks may be moved around between the tiers as new cards, trends, discoveries and interactions make certain strategies more or less competitive than they were previously. Please add to this page but do not modify existing decklists without making note of the changes.


=Tier One Strategies=
These are the cream of the crop, these strategies are the ones that are consistently winning tournaments and have no significant weaknesses or matchups that can't be won.
==Oath Primer==
This deck wins by playing and activating Oath of Druids, often taking advantage of Forbidden Orchard to ensure that the opponent has at least one creature in play.
===Mana Drain Variant===

Team White Lotus (TWL) Oath 

Article at Star City Games [http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/9815.html here].

===GWS Oath===
This is the variant that has recently became very popular and has placed high in numerous tournaments. It too runs no Mana Drains in favor of Impulse and a black splash for additional Tutors and Duress. As a result, this variant can be built on a budget without losing any cards when one utilizes the ten proxies that most American tournaments now allow. 
====List &amp; Explanation====

 Oath of Druids

Maindeck:

Artifacts

* 1 Black Lotus (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Mox Emerald (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Mox Jet (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Mox Pearl (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Mox Ruby (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Mox Sapphire (Restricted in Vintage)
* 2 Sensei's Divining Top

Enchantments

*4 Oath Of Druids

Instants

* 1 Ancestral Recall (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Brainstorm (*now Restricted in Vintage, like Ponder)
* 1 Crop Rotation (Now Unrestricted in Vintage)
* 4 Force Of Will
* 4 Impulse
* 4 Mana Leak
* 1 Vampiric Tutor (Restricted in Vintage)

Legendary Creatures

* 1 Emrakul, the Aeons Torn
* 1 Griselbrand

Sorceries
* 1 Ponder
* 2 Preordain
* 1 Demonic Tutor (Restricted in Vintage)
* 4 Duress
* 1 Gaea's Blessing
* 1 Imperial Seal
* 1 Time Walk (Restricted in Vintage)

Basic Lands

*2 Island

Lands

* 2 City Of Brass
* 1 Flooded Strand
* 4 Forbidden Orchard
* 3 Polluted Delta
* 1 Strip Mine (Restricted in Vintage)
* 1 Tropical Island
* 1 Underground Sea
* 4 Wasteland

Sideboard:
* 1 Darksteel Colossus
* 2 Triskelion
* 2 Choke
* 3 Ground Seal
* 3 Annul
* 3 Oxidize
* 1 Tinker (Restricted in Vintage)

Variations of this build, popularized by team GWS, have placed in the top 8 of the GenCon Vintage Championships and several Starcity Power 9 events.  This has become the most popular form of Oath of Druids decks.  Tinker-Darksteel Colossus can be run maindeck.  It does have the advantage of getting around Meddling Mage and Chalice of the Void, however is bad if the opponent controls a Goblin Welder.  Razia is starting to take the place of Spirit of the Night as the deck's second large hasted flier.  The deck plays as an aggro-control deck disrupting the opponent until it finds Forbidden Orchard and Oath of Druids to win.  Other cards commonly played are Mystical Tutor, Misdirection and Chalice of the Void.

===Drainless Tinker Variant===

This variant runs no Mana Drains in favor of Impulse and a black splash for additional Tutors and possibly Duress. As a result, this variant can be build on a budget without losing any cards when one utilizes the ten proxies that most tournaments now allow. In addition, it runs Tinker as an additional way to combo out.
====List &amp; Explanation====

Search:
* 4 Brainstorm (*Restricted in Vintage)
* 4 Impulse
* 2 Sensei's Divining Top (This was a new addition to the list.)
* 1 Ancestral Recall
* 1 Time Walk
* 1 Imperial Seal
* 1 Vampiric Tutor
* 1 Mystical Tutor
* 1 Personal Tutor
* 1 Demonic Tutor

Disruption:
* 4 Duress
* 4 Mana Leak or Daze
* 4 Force of Will
* 1 Misdirection 

Combo:
* 4 Oath of Druids
* 1 Tinker
* 1 Akroma, Angel of Wrath
* 1 Razia (edited)
* 1 Gaea's Blessing

Mana: (Had been tweaked since then.)
* 1 Black Lotus
* 1 Mox Emerald
* 1 Mox Jet
* 1 Mox Pearl
* 1 Mox Ruby
* 1 Mox Sapphire
* 1 Strip Mine
* 1 Island
* 1 Underground Sea
* 2 Tropical Island
* 2 Wasteland
* 2 Flooded Strand
* 3 Polluted Delta
* 4 Forbidden Orchard

Some of the Drainless Oath builds including the first such build (listed above) run Tinker and Darksteel Colossus as an additional way to combo out quickly. This gives the additional advantage of an alternative win condition in situations when Oath of Druids is neutralized by cards such as Meddling Mage, Forbidden Orchard, Goblin Bombardment, or Wasteland targeting Forbidden Orchard. Such variations sometimes run Imperial Seal, Mystical Tutor and Personal Tutor to help grab Tinker, Ancestral Recall, Time Walk, or disruption. Other Drainless Oath builds such as the one above do not run either Tinker or Darksteel Colossus and instead run Razia, Boros Archangel. 

Other variations on the deck include running cards such as [b]Muddle in the Mixture, Crop Rotation, Chalice of the Void, Pithing Needle, Regrowth, Library of Alexandria, City of Brass, more Sensei's Divining Top and on occasion running three creatures rather than two[/b] in order to significantly decrease the probability of being slowed down by an active Goblin Welder. Some rarely even run cards such as Yawgmoth's Will, Enlightened Tutor, Engineered Explosives and Balance.

==Stax Primer==

The Stax deck in Vintage wins through a board-lock created by cards like Trinisphere, Smokestack, Tangle Wire and lots of other cards that restrict the number of spells being played.

The advantage of Stax is that it has a lot of permanents, so it does not care about Tangle Wire or Smokestacks.

The win conditions are Karn, Silver Golem, Sundering Titan or Triskelion who could be reanimated with Goblin Welder, also a quite important part of the deck.
Even 2 Goblin Welders could create a Tangle Wire of fading 4 permanently which makes playing impossible for your opponent.

==Belcher Primer==
==The Mountains Win Again Primer==
==Everything Wins Again Primer==

Everything Wins Again is a metagame hate deck designed to have a 50/50 matchup against any deck in the metagame preboard,
and a 51/49 matchup postboard.

This is done by completely sacrificing manabase immunity to Wasteland for the support of all five colors.
Sometimes this element is forgone in favor of a four color manabase depending on the metagame.

The first and only top 8 of this deck was recorded [http://morphling.de/top8decks.php?id=480 here].

6. Andrew Fox
&quot;Everything Wins Again&quot;

Maindeck (60 cards):

* 1 Mox Emerald
* 1 Mox Jet
* 1 Mox Pearl
* 1 Mox Ruby
* 1 Mox Sapphire
* 4 Dark Confidant
* 1 Demonic Consultation
* 1  Duress
* 1 Ancestral Recall
* 2 Brainstorm
* 1 Curiosity
* 1 Daze
* 1 Disrupt
* 1 Memory Lapse
* 1 Ninja of the Deep Hours
* 1 Seal of Removal
* 1 Spell Snare
* 1 Time Walk
* 2 Fire/Ice
* 3 Hide/Seek
* 3 Meddling Mage
* 1 Call of the Herd
* 1 Sylvan Safekeeper
* 1 Gorilla Shaman
* 1 Pyroblast
* 4 Swords to Plowshares
* 1 Children of Korlis
* 3 Jotun Grunt

Lands (18):
* 2 Bloodstained Mire
* 4 City of Brass
* 2 Flooded Strand
* 2 Mishra's Factory
* 1 Island
* 1 Plains
* 1 Plateau
* 1 Scrubland
* 1 Swamp
* 1 Taiga
* 1 Underground Sea
* 1 Volcanic Island

Sideboard: (15 cards)

* 1 Artifact Mutation
* 1 Darkblast
* 1 Flametongue Kavu
* 1 Gifts Ungiven
* 1 Hide and Seek
* 1 Meddling Mage
* 1 Pyrokinesis
* 3 Pyrostatic Pillar
* 4 Serenity
* 1 Spell Snare

Everything Wins Again builds up incremental card advantage over the course of the game
by confusing the opponent and causing them to misplay.
This is done by playing almost no repeating cards in a given game so that the opponent cannot
correctly find the 'optimal' play in any given situation.

=Tier Two Strategies=
==Dragon Primer==
==Fish Primer==

Fish is a tier two Vintage Deck that tries to win throug little creatures like &quot;Isamaru&quot;, &quot;Kataki, War´s Wage&quot; and &quot;Meddling Mage&quot;.
Secondly Fish includes a lot of hate-cards and counters like Force of Will and Stifle or Trickbind.
As an answer for creatures it has 4 Swords to Plowshares, the best Spot-Removal ever printed.

It´s a nice opportunity to start with playing Vintage and a so called Budget-Deck, the most valuable cards are Force of Will and probably Meddling Mage.

At a high player-skill it could even reach the Top 8 of a T1 tournament.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Installing_the_developer_tools|Next Page: Installing the developer tools]]

'''[[w:Cocoa_(API)|Cocoa]]''' is possibly one of the most rewarding, fun and productive ways to program a modern computer yet devised. If you own a Mac running Mac OS X, you already have Cocoa, and all the tools needed to program your Mac are available for free from Apple. Anyone who has an interest in programming can use Cocoa to write Mac applications, yet it is not just for beginners; many of the best OS X software titles available are written using Cocoa. You are able to harness the full power of the machine from Cocoa.

Programming using Cocoa involves both using a graphical user interface (GUI -- pronounced &quot;gooey&quot;) tool to build your user interfaces, and an integrated development environment (IDE).  Cocoa consists of literally hundreds of ready-built classes, which are pre-programmed modules of reusable code, that you can simply include in your own work. Since these classes are well designed, powerful and fully debugged, using them saves you literally hundreds of hours in building in complex functionality.

Cocoa is the name given to the complete set of classes, functions and constants, grouped together into an Application Programming Interface, or [[w:API_(software)|API]].  For building Mac applications Cocoa is the only API that is really used anymore.  (The other APIs that used to be provided by Apple, the [[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS#.22Classic.22_Mac_OS_.281984.E2.80.932001.29|Classic API]] and the [[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_API|Carbon API]] have been deprecated.)

To get the most out of this text, you will need to be running Mac OS X 10.3 or later. If you have 10.2, most of what is here will work OK, but the tools as described will be different, and a little harder to use. The coding examples avoid Cocoa features that only exist on 10.3 or 10.4, but later chapters will explain them.

Significant parts of this text describe older versions of Interface Builder. Some of what is described will not work with version 3.0.

Above all, this text aims to get you started in the smoothest way possible, so that you can begin to see not just how powerful Cocoa can be, but also how much fun it is to work with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../What_is_Cocoa%3F|Previous Page: What is Cocoa?]] | [[../Getting_around_in_Xcode_and_Interface_Builder|Next Page: Getting around in Xcode and Interface Builder]]

Before you can begin, you need to install the developer tools. These are supplied on a separate CD or DVD with your OS X install discs. Find the CD and insert it. Because Apple works on the principle that developers need less hand-holding than the average user, the installer will not run automatically. Instead, you need to find the &quot;devtools.mpkg&quot; icon, and double-click it to run the installer.

Follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Make sure you have enough disk space available. At this stage, do not be tempted to customise the installation, just do a standard install which will give you everything you need (and more, but you may need it later).

Once the installer has run its course, you will find a new folder at the top level of your machine's disk, called Developer. Note&amp;nbsp;— this is at the root level of the hard disk, ''not'' in your Home folder. To find it, you may need to open a Finder window and navigate to the disk itself, depending on how your Finder is configured.

Within Developer→Applications you will find a variety of folders, plus two applications, called Xcode and Interface Builder. These are the two main applications you will be working with throughout this text. You can ignore any others for now.

Double-click Xcode to launch it.

When Xcode starts, it defaults to multi-window mode which is not how this tutorial expects you to use it. In general, single-window mode is easier to use and avoids a confusing proliferation of windows as you work. To change it, before doing anything else, open the Preferences. Under General, choose &quot;All-in-One&quot; layout. In the same place, check the four boxes on the right - &quot;Open counterparts in same editor&quot;, &quot;Automatically open/close attached editor&quot;, &quot;Automatically Clear Log&quot;, &quot;Save Window State&quot;. Click OK.

It's also a good idea to make a folder for all the coding work you will do. This should be somewhere in your own Home area&amp;nbsp;— you could make it directly under the Home folder, or perhaps within &quot;Documents&quot;. It's up to you. Create the folder in the Finder wherever you want it, and name it &quot;Projects&quot;. Xcode will make new folders inside this one for each new application we build.

Now we are ready to begin.

If you plan to work through this text, a good idea is to add the Xcode icon to the Dock for easy access. To do this, simply drag the Xcode icon in the Finder to the Dock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Installing_the_developer_tools|Previous Page: Installing the developer tools]] | [[../First_Cocoa_program_-_Hello_World|Next Page: First Cocoa program - Hello World]]

We will shortly write our first Mac application in Cocoa, good old &quot;Hello World!&quot;. While not very useful, this will give you confidence that your developer installation is working as it should.

==XCode 3 and Earlier==

[[image:newproject1.png|right|thumb|350px|XCode 3 New Project assistant - select &quot;Cocoa Application&quot;]]

When Xcode first starts, it may not create any windows but it will have a menu bar and you can create a project and open its window by choosing: File→New Project...

An assistant opens with all the types of projects that Xcode can build. We want to make a simple Cocoa application, so scroll down the list to find &quot;Cocoa Application&quot;, select it and click Next.

[[image:newproject2.png|right|thumb|350px|XCode 3 New Project assistant - enter the name and path of the project]]

In the upper field, type the name of the project. We will call it &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. In the lower field, Xcode wants the path to the Projects folder. You could type it, but it's safer to use the &quot;Choose...&quot; button to navigate to it. Find wherever you put it, and click Choose. The path will be filled in. Click Finish.

[[image:HWXcodegen.png|right|thumb|350px|XCode 3 Xcode in single window mode]]

Xcode opens a window with the title of your project&amp;nbsp;— in this case &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. Down the left hand side of the window is a hierarchical list which lists all of the various elements that make up the program. The first item is selected, called &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. The main part of the window lists a number of files, such as 'Cocoa.framework', but they are not important right now. The top part of the window is the toolbar with a number of buttons, such as &quot;Build&quot;, &quot;Info&quot;, etc.

Let's build and run the project, to see what it does. Click the &quot;Build and Run&quot; (&quot;Build and Go&quot; on older versons of Xcode) button. Xcode will churn away for a minute, compiling various files. Shortly it will finish, the toolbar will change to the running state, and the application will be launched. A new window with the title &quot;Window&quot; will open with nothing in it, and the menu bar will show the name of the application, HelloWorld.

You will see that while this isn't a very useful application, it does exhibit much of the basic behaviour that any Mac application would be expected to. You can drag the window around, resize it, choose items from the menu, and so forth. It even has an &quot;about box&quot;! Not bad for not even writing any code yet. When you're done, choose &quot;Quit&quot; and control will return to Xcode. If you want to run it again, you can click the &quot;Run&quot; button.

On returning to Xcode, you are in the &quot;build&quot; view. To return to the original project view, click the leftmost button at the top left of the toolbar, below the window close button.

==Interface Builder==

We'll now jump into Interface Builder (IB) to make our application do something. While you could launch Interface Builder from the Finder, Xcode works hand in hand with it, so it's usually easier to let Xcode handle this. To start IB then, find the item &quot;NIB Files&quot; at the bottom of the list on the left. Open it, and double-click 'MainMenu.nib'. IB will launch and open that file in one go.

[[image:IBBasic.png|thumb|right|350px|XCode 3 MainMenu.nib in Interface Builder]]
MainMenu.nib contains the resources for the basic application. This includes the default menu bar and the simple window we already saw. The main view of a file in IB is a graphical list of the objects it contains, just like files in the Finder. Thus there is the MainMenu object, the Window object, and a couple of others, such as 'File's Owner' and 'First Responder' which will be explained in detail much later. Double-click on the icon for Window. The actual window will open. The size and position of this window is exactly what will show up in the finished app, so put it where you want it.

Let's add some text to the window. You should see a palette called Cocoa-Controls. Click the Text button which is third from the left. The window title will now be Cocoa-Text, and you will see various examples of text. Find the 'System Font Text' item in the pallete. (Note: In newer versions of Xcode and Interface Builder, the Cocoa-Control palette has been replaced with a content library, and 'System Font Text' items have been replaced with 'labels'.  In Xcode 3.2.6, for example, in Tools→Library→Objects, indented under 'Library' and 'Views &amp; Cells' select 'Inputs &amp; Values', then below choose 'Label'.) Drag the 'System Font Text' item from the palette (or 'Label' item from the library) into the window and drop it there. It will appear with a set of selection 'handles' around it. Double-click on the text to select it, and change the text to &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Click outside of the text to deselect it.

Choose File→Save and return to Xcode. Click &quot;Build and Run&quot;. When your application launches, it now includes the text you just added.

Well, so far not so very impressive, but it means that at this stage, everything is working as it should. We can now proceed to more interesting and challenging things with confidence in our tools.

==Documentation==

Xcode comes with the complete Apple Developer Reference Library locally installed. It is fully integrated into the Xcode editor&amp;nbsp;— to look up any method or class within Cocoa, simply option-double-click the class or method name anywhere in any text editor, or you can command-click on the identifier in the source-code and be taken to the declaration of that identifier in the .h file. Remember, all Cocoa classes start with 'NS...' (this stands for NextStep, the predecessor to Mac OS X where the Cocoa API first appeared as the programming environment itself.  Because of this, avoid the temptation to call your own classes 'NS...' anything. 

There are other APIs available to use to develop software that runs on Mac OS X include Carbon, Toolbox for the Classic environment, POSIX, and Java), making them easy to spot.  Though, Carbon and Classic aren't really supported by Apple anymore.  They were for providing developers with an upgrade path from old version of Classic Mac OS (before Cocoa).  You can still use Java, but Apple has lessened its support of Java.  Java is good for cross-platform work where you want to develop apps that will run on Mac or Windows.  The problem with Java is it reduces the application software to the &quot;least common denominator&quot; disallowing the use of many APIs in Cocoa and Mac OS X.  The Mac App Store will not accept applications written in Java.

Although there are a number of APIs available to program the Mac, Cocoa and Objective-C are &quot;native&quot; allowing you to develop apps that are truly &quot;Mac-like&quot;.

You can open the documentation window at any time using Help→Documentation.  This will take you to the documentation that was installed when you installed XCode, etc. on your computer.

The documentation library can also be updated by going to the Xcode Preferences (Xcode→Preferences), and choosing the Documentation option.

As well as complete descriptions of all Cocoa classes and methods, it also has a number of extended discussions about particular aspects of Cocoa programming. These are well worth reading once you have picked up the basics, perhaps from here.

      <comment>replaced PRE tags with SOURCE LANG=&quot;LISP&quot; to improve formatting, added a link to Wikipedia on residue theorem</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Problem''': given a function '''f''' defined on complex numbers and a square area that contains only one root of the function, find this root.

We will use [[:w:residue theorem|residue theorem]] for the function 1/f(x). First we need to be able to calculate integrals on a square path.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun integrate-square-path (f start length precision)
  &quot;f is the function to integrate.
   Start is a complex number: the lower left corner of the square.
   Length is the length of the side of square.
   Precision is the distance between two points that we consider acceptable.&quot;
  (let* ((sum 0) ;;The result would be summed there
         (n (ceiling (/ length precision))) ;;How many points on each side
         (step (float (/ length n))) ;;Distance between points
         (j 0) ;;index
         (side 0) ;;The number of side: from 0 to 3
         (d (complex step 0)) ;;Complex difference between two points
         (cur start)) ;;Current position 
    (loop (incf sum (* (funcall f cur) d)) ;;Increment the sum
          (incf cur d) ;;Change the position
          (incf j) ;;Increment the index
          (when (= j n) ;;Time to change the side
            (setf j 0)  
            (incf side)
            (setf d (case side  ;;Change the direction
                      (1 (complex 0 step))
                      (2 (complex (- step) 0))
                      (3 (complex 0 (- step)))
                      (4 (return sum))))))))
&lt;/source&gt;

The main loop could be made more concise with the use of extended '''loop''' syntax. The above function is very procedural in nature. You would use the same algorithm in C-like programming languages. Still, Lisp has a little advantage due to its native complex number support and the fact that '''case''' returns value, unlike '''switch''' in C.

Note the use of '''float''' function that converts the result of division to float. Without it, Lisp would operate with rational numbers, and the result won't be pretty (unless you find rationals with 1000-digit denominators pretty). As soon as the function is loaded into Lisp, you can test it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 CL-USER&gt; (integrate-square-path (lambda (x) (/ 1 x)) #C(-1 -1) 2 0.001)
 #C(-0.0019999794 6.2832413)
&lt;/source&gt;

This correlates with the theory that predicts 2πi being the result.  

Now, the corollary of the residue theorem states that there is a pole in the area iff the path integral that goes around that area is not zero. We can write a simple function on top of the previous one that provides what we need:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun pole-p (f start length precision)
  &quot;Tests, whether the given square contains a pole of f and
returns the center of the square if there is a pole after all&quot;
  (when (&gt; (abs (integrate-square-path f start length precision)) (sqrt precision))
    (+ start (/ (complex length length) 2))))
&lt;/source&gt;

The return value would be useful in the recursion-terminating case of the next function, which divides a square into 4 smaller squares and uses indirect recursion to complete its task.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;            
(defun find-pole (f start length precision)
  &quot;Finds a pole of the function in the square area&quot;
  (when (&gt; (* precision 10) length) 
    (return-from find-pole (pole-p f start length precision)))
  (let ((h (float (/ length 2))))
    (flet ((check-pole (start)
             (when (pole-p f start h precision)
               (find-pole f start h precision))))
      (or (check-pole start)
          (check-pole (+ start (complex 0 h)))
          (check-pole (+ start (complex h 0)))
          (check-pole (+ start (complex h h)))))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, this is an example how functional programming can save lines of code. We define a small helper function that uses its ''lexical environment'' to know the values of '''f''', '''start''', '''h''' and '''precision''', so the only thing we need to pass to it is the upper-right corner of the square.  The power of '''or''' macro saved some superfluous branching as well. This function, while elegant, is quite hard to understand. It's a good exercise to work out what do check-pole and find-pole return in different situations and how their return values affect the control flow.

Finally, to find a root of function f we need to find a pole of 1/f. This is quite easy to do.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun find-root (f start length precision)
  &quot;Finds a root of the function in the square area&quot;
  (find-pole (lambda (x) (/ 1 (funcall f x))) start length precision))      
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's test it. f(x)=x²+2 has two complex roots: ±sqrt(2)*i. Let's see if our program can find the upper one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 CL-USER&gt; (find-root (lambda (x) (+ (* x x) 2)) #C(-1 0) 5 0.0001) 
 #C(-5.493164E-4 1.4138794)
&lt;/source&gt;

Looks like the right answer!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Introspection, in psychology, means to examine experience for its constituents, or elements. It was utilized by the first psychologist (Wilhelm Wundt) as a method of discovering the elements of conscious experience. Basically, Wundt showed visual stimuli to well-trained subjects and asked them what elements they were experiencing. The method proved to be unreliable as other researchers, using other subjects, discovered other elements than Wundt. Wundt's first student in America, Bradford Titchner, had just such a long-running disagreement with Wundt.

The common use of &quot;introspection&quot; today is to look inward in an effort toward self-understanding. While both the present-day and the historical uses of the term utilize observations of unknown veracity, it is important to note that psychology, historically, used the method to examine sensory phenomena to deduce elements of mental experience, not explanations for individual behavior.

{{quotes|Liberty without learning is always in peril; learning without liberty is always in vain.|John F. Kennedy}}

== Concentration Is Like Salt Used For Food ==

After eagerness comes concentration on studies. One may think that motivation is all that one requires to become a good student, but it is not this easy. Remember: the journey never has a quick end. Education is what schools, colleges and universities are all made for. Concentration isn't something which is always required, but when it is, it must be done whether it is difficult or easy. It can take a long time for some people to learn how to properly concentrate in a given environment, but like in meditation or prayer, it will come with time and practice.

Concentration can be made easier following these steps:
#Arouse Concentration By Increasing Its Consciousness In Your Mind
#:One can arouse concentration by spending extra time with some good educational chores, or spending time on the Internet searching for good articles at Wikipedia. ''Yeah! Wiki Rules!''
#:You can also try chewing thick pieces of gum. The deep muscle exercising of your jaws can help you focus on the task at hand. Some people find bouncing on a big ball while studying will also move those muscles in much the same way. 
#Reading Books
#:Reading good books can arouse concentration towards studies ''sometimes''. Try reading books related to your favorite hobbies, subjects, role models, etc.
#Good Hobbies
#:Reading books can actually belong in this category. Like other good hobbies, it not only arouses concentration for studies, it also arouses concentration for lifetime processes.
#Discussion On Projects
#:Discussion on certain good subjects (e.g., physics phenomena) also leads to concentration automatically. It can also help you to remember important information in those subjects, as discussing things will often embed concepts and key facts deeper into your mind.
#Environment
#:Make sure there is nothing to distract you. You should have a working surface such as a desk in front of you, but some people may prefer to work on the floor. Remember that the optimum goal is to achieve comfort so that you can focus on your work. Clear everything off your desk or other surface so that you only have what you need on it. Nothing can make work harder than continuously looking for space to put your books, so put things you don't need on a shelf or somewhere else where they will not distract you. On top of that, make sure that there is nothing which may divert your attention away from your work such as a game, or even any books and papers which you don't need. Some people will be surprised at how much their mind can wander when they are trying to do work! Make sure you have done your dishes, cleaned the sink, and that you have done all the other things you suddenly 'want' or 'need' to do when you should start studying. Another option is to do your work in the library. Many libraries will provide a room which is specially designed for studying in. They may even go so far as to provide some light music to listen to while you work!
#:One major thing that you want to avoid is doing your homework on your bed, in the kitchen or in the lounge room. Your mind is conditioned to performing different activities in these rooms which do not require the same level of concentration as when you are studying. For example, if you try doing work on your bed, you may suddenly feel tired! This is because your body is used to sleeping on a bed, not doing work. Another negative effect is that you may find it harder to sleep at night, as your body becomes confused as to whether it should be concentrating or relaxing.
#:For the same reasons, try to avoid the following:
#:*Eating heavy meals at your designated work area. (Light snacks might be acceptable for some people)
#:*If you are able, try not to do your work on your computer desk if you use it mostly for playing games. That's why many houses have a 'study' room.
#:With time, your body will become used to concentrating at your work area, and you may find studying much easier after a while!
# Time
#:Time is important in two ways. First, think about when you are most able to study, when you are most awake. Is it in the morning, the afternoon or in the evening? Study at that time.&lt;br/&gt;Second, don't try to study for a whole day, or even a whole afternoon. Study for 45 minutes or an hour and take a break of about 15 minutes.
#:Students can increase their concentration by doing exercises and yoga in the morning. One of the best tips being tried by many Indian students to increase their concentration is  '''Brahmari''' pranayam.
#:To practice it:
#:*Sit in a relaxed posture
#:*Take a deep breath inside
#:*Close both of your eyes using your index and middle finger
#:*Close your nose with your third finger
#:*Close your ears with your thumbs
#:*Exhale slowly

Use your creativity
One effective way of developing deeper level of understanding is to use creative skills to think on the subject. One can do that by trying to arrive at the conclusion from a different point of view, or by trying to make original questions. This technique is [http://thinkingbuddy.uni.cc/wiki/?title=How+to+improve+concentration+in+studies elaborated here].
Following these can help your concentration and increase your comfort so that you can focus on the work at hand.

That's it for here. Let's learn manners next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{quotes|Etiquette is behaving yourself a little better than is absolutely essential.|Will Cuppy}}

== Manners, The One Behind Your True Reputation ==

Whether you are a president at a conference or a normal guy in the street, your reputation is what your respect determines it all and the one behind your reputation is &quot;Manners&quot;. Manners is almost everything you can represent at a meeting or anywhere in the world other than your contributions. Excellent behavior leads to excellent results. Behavior also determines the quality &amp; dignity a person has. Behavior is developed easily in students, though it takes time.

== Ways To Behave ==

Good behavior should become a way of life, not just something that is shown or talked about. The ways to behave differs from situation to situation, for example.

If a man talks to you by saying &quot;Hello!&quot; or &quot;Good Evening!&quot; or &quot;Good Afternoon!&quot;, your reply will absolutely be positive like &quot; Hello! Nice to meet you!&quot;

Situations can be of two types:-

1.) Positive Situations - As illustrated in the example given above

2.) Negative Situations - 

Example:- If someone teases you, you'll probably say a negative reply like &quot;Stop teasing me, you idiot!!!&quot;

Although someone can arise you to say a negative reply, you can say a reply which is not rude but still negative.

Example:- Watch &quot;MTV's Boiling Points&quot;. In a situation, you'll see that the one who passes the time of the ''Boiling Point'' always/probably uses negative replies which aren't rude.

== Behaving At School/University ==

So how does all this behavior fit into your education? Well first of all you may find it much easier  to deal with pressure, and you won't take it out on the people you love, but you can also use it to win the favour of your teacher. Giving out a pleasant, positive atmosphere is sure to make you stand out in your classes, and your teachers may be more willing to help you succeed.

So always try your best to be on your best behavior, no matter wherever you are, because it determines your respect in the world. Let's move onto management.

In the last chapter, we made a version of &quot;Hello World&quot; just by adding the text to a window in Interface Builder. You may have felt that this was cheating a little, as we haven't even written a line of code yet. We'll now revisit &quot;Hello World&quot;, but this time do it in code.

First, we need to know a little bit about writing code for Cocoa. Cocoa is programmed in Objective-C, a small extension to the C language. If you know C, Objective-C is very easy to learn. If you know C++, it's far simpler while embodying many of the same basic concepts, and more. If you know another language, you should be able to pick it up easily enough.

Objective-C, is, as its name might suggest, a version of C that supports Objects, or Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Some people that have come from a traditional procedural language background find object-oriented a bit alien at first, but those with no programming experience at all often do better, because OOP is much closer to how we deal with things in the real world.

Most objects in the real world have a defined purpose, a set of properties, and a particular way that they are best used. Think of the everyday task of making a cup of tea. Several objects are involved, each with their particular role in the overall task. A tap provides water; a kettle raises its temperature to boiling point; a cup provides a container for the tea, and so on. The kettle for example, has particular ''properties''&amp;nbsp;— how much water it can contain, its operating voltage, the material it is made from. It also has one main job&amp;nbsp;— to boil the water. In OOP terms, the boiling operation is a ''method'' of the kettle object, as is the pour into cup operation. All objects are described in terms of their properties and their behaviours (methods). It is the same in an OOP programming language.

A collection of methods and properties is defined in the idea of an object which we call a class. The class 'kettle' is just the idea of a kettle, it is not any particular kettle. When we want an actual kettle, we are then talking about a concrete example of a kettle, which in OOP programming we call an ''instance'' of the class 'kettle'. This distinction is important&amp;nbsp;— we will occasionally define a class of object, but this on its own will do nothing until we make an actual concrete example of that class, or ''instantiate'' it. A class definition describes the properties and methods of the object, but only the instance actually has those properties, and is able to carry out the methods. Usually, when we are casually talking about &quot;objects&quot; within the program, we are talking about instances of objects.

In Objective-C, an instance of an object is referenced by a pointer variable:

 NSString* myString;

This references an NSString object with the variable name 'myString'. Note: all Cocoa's built-in classes start with 'NS'. Your own classes should probably adopt a naming convention of your own device&amp;nbsp;— perhaps your initials. This is just to make sure that there is no ambiguity between the classes Cocoa provides and any you create. Another example:

 GCKettle* teasMaidK2;

One of the key goals of OOP programming is to hide implementation details from the user of an object&amp;nbsp;— for example, we don't care whether a kettle boils the water using a resistive element or an exotic molecular jiggler device, we only care that the water boils when we press the 'boil' switch, or some short time after. Similarly, users of objects in a program should generally be designed to not care about how objects work, only that they give the expected results on demand. This means that in order to examine the properties of an object, we should not rudely peek directly at the innards of the object, but instead ask the object politely to tell us the value of a particular property. Some properties of an object are fixed, others changeable. In OOP-speak, we call this 'immutable' and 'mutable' respectively. Since we can ask for properties, or change them, or set a method going such as 'boil', all of these things are achieved in the same way, which is by ''sending a message'' to the object. Because we are hiding the implementation details of the object, all properties are in fact accessed via methods, so the distinction between them is fairly blurred.

In Objective-C, we send a message to an object by using a square bracket notation:

 [teasMaidK2 boil];

This sends the message 'boil' to the kettle object 'teasMaidK2'.

We can also obtain information about properties in the same way:

 NSColor* kettleColor = [teasMaidK2 color];

This sends the message 'color' to the kettle object. It responds by returning the value of the 'color' property and assigns it to 'kettleColor'.

Very often, we need to supply additional information to a method so it knows what we want. This extra information is called the method's ''parameters''. Objective-C has a very interesting way of passing parameters, one that might look strange at first, but which has some great advantages. Suppose we have a kettle that can operate on either 220V ac or 110V ac, and we can change it using a method called setVoltage. We need to tell it what voltage to use, and it's as simple as:

 [teasMaidK2 setVoltage:110];

We simply put a colon and the value of the parameter.

Where it gets interesting is when there is more than one parameter to a method. C and C++ programmers (and most others) are used to using commas to separate a list of parameters, such as:

 object-&gt;setColor( 255, 128, 0 );

Looking at this, you have no idea what the three parameters actually are&amp;nbsp;— you would have to look it up in the header to find the original definition, hoping that the programmer actually included the information (some languages such as C don't require parameter names here, so you could still be in the dark):

 void setColor(int green, int red, int blue);

Note that if you assumed it was in order red, green, blue you'd have been wrong!

Objective-C takes a different approach, one that saves you the trouble of looking up the header to simply read the code, and it makes it much more self-documenting. For example:

 [teasMaidK2 setColorWithRed:128 green:255 blue:0];

In Objective-C, the parameter names are part of the overall method name; they can't be missed out. The actual method is called &quot;setColorWithRed:green:blue:&quot; The colons are also part of the unique method name, so setVoltage and setVoltage: are two distinct methods. This often catches out beginners, so make a note of it.

Method calls in Objective-C can be nested as required, e.g.

 [teasMaidK2 setVoltage:[mainsSupply outputVoltage]];


Note that the square brackets as used for array indices in C are still available without ambiguity:

 [teasMaidK2 setVoltage:supply[2]];

==Don't call us, we'll call you==

When should you call a method? Whenever you want information or action from another object. However, very often, it's not you that wants to know&amp;nbsp;— it's Cocoa itself, and you are expected to provide the answer. In practice, writing applications with Cocoa needs both, but there are many places where you will simply be expected to provide answers on demand. Again, classically-oriented programmers often have trouble with this idea; they are used to having complete control, and asking the operating system to do things ''for them''. OOP tends to turn things on their heads a bit&amp;nbsp;— make the right object, put it in the right place and wait for it to be called upon. Again, this is more like real life, where you as an employee have a particular role&amp;nbsp;— your boss will give you tasks, you carry them out. It's not your job to run the whole company, just to do your little bit. You might delegate part of your task to others, or request information from others to get the job done, but your boss doesn't care as long as he gets his results.

In this exercise, we will in fact be doing just this&amp;nbsp;— creating an object that will be called upon by Cocoa to perform a little task for it. What is the task? It's to draw the famous words &quot;Hello World&quot; to the screen when needed.

To do this, we need to make an object that we can be sure will be called upon whenever a window's contents needs to be drawn. Later in this text, we will go into this in much more detail, but for now we'll just gloss over the basics. In Cocoa, stuff that is drawn in windows is actually drawn by objects called ''views''. A button that you can click is a view, for example, as is the &quot;Hello World&quot; text that we added in the first part. Views can contain other views, so a complex hierarchy of them can exist. Here though, we will keep it simple.

We'll need a custom view that 'knows' how to write &quot;Hello World&quot;; that is, it contains code that will accomplish this when called upon by Cocoa.

In all OOP frameworks such as Cocoa, another main goal is to make coding as efficient as possible by maximizing ''reuse'' of code. The idea is to solve a typical kind of problem once, then allow the programmer to leverage that solution in their own work rather than starting again from scratch, which is usually just a waste of valuable time. In Cocoa, the 'problem' of drawing all sorts of things in windows has already been solved by the views classes, so we do not need to solve this problem again. Instead, we can make use of the existing code and simply extend it a little bit to do the unique thing that we want it to do, without worrying about the rest. This customisation of existing classes is called ''subclassing''. We will subclass Cocoa's NSView class, and then write some code to make it do the unique extra thing we want.

Interface Builder contains some neat helper tools to make this task very easy. Go into Interface Builder by double-clicking &quot;MainMenu.nib&quot; in the left hand panel of Xcode. Double-click the Window icon to make the window come to the front. Select and delete the &quot;Hello World&quot; text. In the library go to the map Cocoa and submap `views &amp; Cells` (for Xcode versions prior to Xcode 3.1 it is in the tools palette). Drag the 'CustomView' into the window and drop it.

Drag the selection handles to position the view where you'd like&amp;nbsp;— for this exercise, don't make it fit exactly to the whole window; leave a bit of a margin. Note how Interface Builder gives you guidelines as you move and size the custom view. These guidelines are a boon for neatly laying out more complex interfaces.

At the moment, &quot;CustomView&quot; is just a placeholder for the view we are going to make, so next we need to define a class for the custom view. IB will help us. Go back to the main IB window, titled &quot;MainMenu.nib (English)&quot;, and click the tab button marked 'Classes'. This shows a column view of lots of classes, starting with 'NS'. Find NSObject→NSResponder→NSView and select it. A number of existing NSView subclasses will show to its right, but we don't need those now&amp;nbsp;— we want to add to this list. With NSView selected, choose Classes→Subclass NSView. A new item is added to the list, with its name highlighted. Type in a descriptive name for the class. If you are using XCode 3.0 or greater, Apple changed the way to do this step. In XCode, right click in the folder &quot;Other Sources&quot;, then mouse over &quot;Add&quot;, then &quot;New File...&quot;. Under the Cocoa heading, choose &quot;Objective-C Class&quot; from the icon list, then in the drop down list below that area, select &quot;NSView subclass&quot;. Type in your name in place of untitled, and leave the other stuff alone. I used 'GCHelloView' because GC are my initials, and HelloView is reasonably descriptive. Avoid the temptation to use silly or obscure names&amp;nbsp;— you'll regret it later!

Now go back to the window and click on CustomView to select it. Choose Tools→Show Identity Inspector. A new palette appears, which allows you to set the properties of objects. In the pop-up menu, choose &quot;Custom Class&quot;. A list appears. Find your custom class name ('GCHelloView' in my case) and select it. You'll see that the name of the view in the window changes to this name.

The next step is to get IB to actually create some skeleton code for this new class. Go back to the main window and its &quot;Classes&quot; panel. Ensure your custom view class is selected, and choose Classes→Create Files for GCHelloView (or whatever you named it). A dialog opens asking whether you want the files added to the project. Of course you do, so the defaults are fine. Click Choose. The files are created and added to Xcode automatically. If you're using a version of XCode larger than 3.0, however, don't worry&amp;nbsp;— you created these files earlier during the process of adding them. We're done with IB for now, so save the changes, and return to Xcode.

In the left-hand panel of your Xcode project, drill down to HelloWorld/Other Sources. You'll see two files added there: GCHelloView.h and GCHelloView.m (or whatever name you chose). The .h file is the header, as with any C program. The .m file contains the Objective-C code. Select the .h file. The main area of the Xcode window changes and displays the content of this file. (By the way, you might like to make the text part bigger by dragging the split bar upwards&amp;nbsp;— the top area isn't very interesting here and can be made much smaller.) The interesting part looks like:

 @interface GCHelloView : NSView
 {
 }
 @end

This is how a subclass is defined in Cocoa&amp;nbsp;— everything between '@interface' and '@end' is the ''class definition''. The class name is GCHelloView, and it is a subclass of NSView. Because our class doesn't implement any new methods, it will just reimplement (or ''override'', as we call it) existing NSView methods, the definition is empty and we don't need to add anything here. Note: C++ programmers might find this a bit odd&amp;nbsp;— in C++ we must explicitly declare which methods we are going to override; in Objective-C we just do it, which saves ourselves a little effort.

OK, to the code! Select the .m file. You will see two method skeletons there, one called 'initWithFrame:', and one called 'drawRect:' (remember, a colon is an intrinsic part of a method's name). For this exercise, we don't need to worry about the initWithFrame: method; all of our code will go in the drawRect: method.

First though, what happens if we build and go now? Try it! You'll see that everything compiles just fine, the program runs, and the window is blank once more (assuming you took the old text out in IB). OK, quit and go back to the editor.

This time, we want to make the text we write in the window a lot more impressive, so we'll make it use a large font size and a bright color. The way that Cocoa specifies fonts and so forth when rendering strings is to use a ''dictionary of attributes''. This is an object which simply associates a named property with a value. The font property is named &quot;NSFontAttributeName&quot;, and the color of the text attribute name is &quot;NSForegroundColorAttributeName&quot;. These names are called the ''keys'' of the attributes. First we'll set up these attributes, then draw the string using them. Here's the code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect
{
       NSString*               hws = @&quot;Hello World!&quot;;
       NSPoint                 p;
       NSMutableDictionary*    attribs;
       NSColor*                c;
       NSFont*                 fnt;

       p = NSMakePoint( 10, 100 );

       attribs = [[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init] autorelease];

       c = [NSColor redColor];
       fnt = [NSFont fontWithName:@&quot;Times Roman&quot; size:48];

       [attribs setObject:c forKey:NSForegroundColorAttributeName];
       [attribs setObject:fnt forKey:NSFontAttributeName];

       [hws drawAtPoint:p withAttributes:attribs];
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Type that in exactly as given, and hit &quot;Build and Go&quot;. Your application should greet you in large red letters! (If the text doesn't show up, try making the &quot;GCHelloView&quot; box in IB larger.) This code might look a little complex for such a trivial task as drawing a large red string, but in some ways that's because this task is a little artificially contrived. However, it's not that complex, let's look at it line by line.

The top five lines are simple variable declarations as you'd find in any C routine. The pointer variables with the name 'NS…' indicate that these are references to Cocoa objects. We declare a simple fixed string first, containing the text &quot;Hello World&quot;. This is an NSString object. This object is very different from an old-style C string, though here we use it in a very similar way. NSStrings are objects containing a text string which is encoded in a particular way, such as Unicode. NSStrings are more than mere containers, however; they have many methods for performing operations on strings. We'll revisit it later, but for now we just use it in a fairly dumb manner. Note that NSString constants are preceded by the '@' symbol and surrounded by quote marks.

The attributes are stored in a NSDictionary object which here is mutable&amp;nbsp;— that is, we wish to change it so that we can set up the attributes, so we use an NSMutableDictionary object. The color and font information is encapsulated in NSColor and NSFont objects.

Note that NSPoint is not a class but a plain old C type. It is a struct consisting of two floats x and y representing coordinates. That is why p is not a pointer variable like hws or attribs.

Now we will tell the text WHERE it will be drawn within the window. 'p' is just a coordinate which is 10 pixels in from the left, and 100 pixels up from the bottom of the view.

Next we instantiate the dictionary object&amp;nbsp;— that is, we make a concrete object of the class NSMutableDictionary. The line that does this is one you will encounter again and again&amp;nbsp;— the first method ''alloc'' reserves memory for the object and returns it; the second one, ''init'', asks it to initialise itself (whatever that means in practice); and the third tells it to &quot;autorelease&quot; itself. We'll discuss what that means later. Hold on, you might be saying&amp;nbsp;— what object is being called with the alloc method? We haven't made the object yet! In fact, alloc is an example of a ''class method'', which is a method that doesn't require a concrete example of the object, the class itself knows what to do. Class methods are common&amp;nbsp;— we'll encounter two more in a minute&amp;nbsp;— and very useful. They allow us to perform generic operations that pertain to the class of object without actually having an object available. Very often these class methods return actual objects&amp;nbsp;— they are known as ''factory methods'' in OOP-speak. A class method is called very simply by using the name of the class in place of an object instance variable, e.g.

 red = [NSColor redColor]; /* class method */

is a class method but:

 bright = [red brightnessComponent]; /* instance method */

is an instance method.

Two more factory methods follow&amp;nbsp;— the first to make an object embodying the color red, the second a font object embodying the font 48 point Times Roman. These are then added as attributes to the dictionary using the appropriate keys.

Finally, we are all set and ready to draw. The last line accomplishes this. Note that it is a method of NSString itself&amp;nbsp;— the string knows how to render itself, provided we give it enough information. So we tell it where, and what attributes we'd like it to use. Note that what we didn't tell it was WHEN to draw the string. Instead, we just made the method available, knowing that Cocoa would call upon it when required. Cocoa will do this when it needs to refresh the content of the window&amp;nbsp;— at such times, the documentation tells us that a view's drawRect: method will be called, so provided we put our code there, it will get called as needed.

==Gilding the lily==

Let's add a little more code, just for fun. At the end of the method, before the closing brace, add:

 [[NSColor blueColor] set];
 NSFrameRect([self bounds]);

Hit Build &amp; Go (command-R), and see what that does. Maybe you can guess?

The first line is a class method on NSColor to get us a blue color object, then call its 'set' method. This simply establishes that color as the one that will be used for drawing whatever happens to be drawn next. This is a handy way of setting up colors, and you will use it often. Finally we use a simple C function, 'NSFrameRect' which draws a rectangular frame. The interesting thing here is that the rectangle it draws is a property of the view itself, called ''bounds''. To ask an object for one of its own properties, or to call one of its own methods we use the object reference 'self'. This always refers to the object in which the code itself resides, so it's a very handy way of talking to yourself. The bounds of a view is the space it occupies within its parent view or window.

      <comment>/* Types of Businesses */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When we look around us, we observed that most of the people are engaged in one activity or the other. Teacher teach in the school, farmers work in the fields, workers work in the factories, drivers drive vehicles, shopkeepers sells goods, doctors attend to patients and so on. In this way,people are busy during the day and sometimes during the night throughout the year. Now the question WHY we all keep ourselves busy. The answer is to satisfy our wants. By doing so, we either fulfill various obligations or earn money through which we can buy goods and commodities.

Business is a human activity in order to satisfy our wants.

== Human Activities ==
Activities which human being undertake are known as human activities. These may be cultivating land, growing plants, rearing animals, teaching in school or college, working in a factory or office, watching television, listening radio, reading newspaper, worshiping in a temple, playing football, etc. We can divide this activities into two broad categories as
(i) economic activities
(ii) non-economic activities

'''(i) Economic activities'''

Activities, which are performed with an objective to earn money, are known as economic activities. For example, a farmer grow crops to sell them, a factory or office employee works and gets wage or salary, a businessman earns profit through buying and selling of goods.

'''(ii) Non-economic activities'''

Activities which are not performed to earn money but to get some satisfaction

==Types of Businesses==
'''Sole Proprietorship'''

A sole proprietorship is a business run by one person. This one person, known as a proprietor, has the advantage of being in control of the entire business, and having all the income of the business going directly to him or her. The downside of this is that a Sole Proprietorship is not taxed as a business entity, so all income of the business is taxed as personal income tax. Additionally, the proprietor has '''Unlimited Liability''' meaning that if the business goes under, and the assets of the business are insufficient to satisfy the debts of the business, the creditors can seize the personal assets of the proprietor.

'''Partnership'''

A partnership is a firm run by more than one person. These people are all known as partners of the company, and they have the advantage of sharing the losses, but have to share the profits too. The percentage of sharing loses and profits could be determined according to the partnership agreement drawn between the partners, they vary from country to country. The partners make all decisions collectively, and each partner is responsible to the others for any decision he makes with relation to the business. Each partner, by the virtue of being a partner, represents the business and is expected to act in ways that won't be detrimental to the business. New Partners are added for their expertise. Partnerships are easy to form usually professionals lawyers, doctors and consultants form partnership to benefit from the expertise of each other. 

'''Private Limited Companies'''

A private limited company too can have just two shareholders. However the shareholders of a private limited company could be limited to family members or friends. A private limited company is formed by registering the memorandum and articles of association with the local registrar of companies. The shareholder liability is limited to the authorized share capital. It is less complex to form unlike a public limited company. The rules and regulations on the formation of a private limited company have to be checked out with your local chamber of commerce or registrar of companies. The accounts of a private limited company have to be audited by independent auditors and board of director; they meet regularly to make decisions and they have an annual general meeting when all shareholders meet to discuss the wider management issues of the company.

'''Corportations'''

A corporation is created as a separate legal entity that has privileges and liabilities that are distinct from those of its owners. Despite not being a natural person, corporations are recognized by the law, in some countries and the USA in particular, as having the same legal rights and responsibilities as natural persons (&quot;people&quot;). The formation of a corporation protects the owners against unlimited liability. As long as the business operates legally it is liable to it's creditors only the value of the assets of the business. If the corporation fails the investors are liable only for the assets of the business.

      <comment>/* CTFT Definition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

The '''Continuous-Time Fourier Transform''' (CTFT) is the version of the fourier transform that is most common, and is the only fourier transform so far discussed in EE wikibooks such as [[Signals and Systems]], or [[Communication Systems]]. This transform is mentioned here as a stepping stone for further discussions of the '''Discrete-Time Fourier Transform''' (DTFT), and the '''Discrete Fourier Transform''' (DFT). The CTFT itself is not useful in digital signal processing applications, so it will not appear much in the rest of this book

== CTFT Definition ==

The CTFT is defined as such:

{{eqn|CTFT}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\omega) = \int f(t) e^{-j \omega t} dt&lt;/math&gt;

== CTFT Use ==

== Frequency Domain ==

== Convolution Theorem ==

Multiplication in the time domain becomes convolution in the frequency domain. Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain. This is an example of the property of '''duality'''. The convolution theorem is a very important theorem, and every transform has a version of it, so it is a good idea to become familiar with it now (if you aren't previously familiar with it).

The '''Discrete-Time Fourier Transform''' (DTFT) is the cornerstone of all DSP, because it tells us that from a discrete set of samples of a continuous function, we can create a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_summation periodic summation] of that function's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform Fourier transform].  At the very least, we can recreate an approximation of the actual transform and its inverse, the original continuous function.  And under certain idealized conditions, we can recreate the original function with no distortion at all.  That famous theorem is called the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem].

== DTFT ==

{{eqn|DTFT}}
:&lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x[n]e^{-j\omega n}&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting function, &lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function that is interesting for analysis.  It can be used in programs, such as Matlab, to design filters and obtain the corresponding time-domain filter values.

== DTFT Convolution Theorem ==

Like the CTFT, the DTFT has a convolution theorem associated with it. However, since the DTFT results in discrete-frequency values, the convolution theorem needs to be modified as such:

{{TextBox|
;DTFT Convolution Theorem: Multiplication in the continuous time domain becomes  discrete convolution in the discrete frequency domain. Convolution in the continuous time domain becomes mulitplication in the discrete frequency domain.}}

== Energy ==

It is sometimes helpful to calculate the amount of '''energy''' that exists in a certain set. These calculations are based off the assumption that the different values in a set are voltage values, however this doesn't necessarily need to be the case to employ these operations.

We can show that the energy of a given set can be given by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \left| x[n] \right| ^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Energy in Frequency ==

Likewise, we can make a formula that represents the power in the continuous-frequency output of the DTFT:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_x = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|X(e^{j \omega})\right|^2 d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

== Parseval's Theorem ==

Parseval's theorem states that the energy amounts found in the time domain must be equal to the energy amounts found in the frequency domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \left| x[n] \right| ^2 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|X(e^{j \omega})\right|^2 d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

== Power Density Spectrum ==

We can define the power density spectrum of the continuous-time frequency output of the DTFT as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{xx}(e^{j\omega}) = \left|X(e^{j \omega})\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

The area under the power density spectrum curve is the total energy of the signal.</text>

As the name implies, the '''Discrete Fourier Transform''' (DFT) is purely discrete: discrete-time data sets are converted into a discrete-frequency representation. This is in contrast to the DTFT that uses discrete time, but converts to continuous frequency. Since the resulting frequency information is discrete in nature, it is very common for computers to use DFT calculations when frequency information is needed. 

Using a series of mathematical tricks and generalizations, there is an algorithm for computing the DFT that is very fast on modern computers. This algorithm is known as the '''Fast Fourier Transform''' (FFT), and produces the same results as the normal DFT, in a fraction of the computational time as ordinary DFT calculations. The FFT will be discussed in detail in later chapters.

== DFT ==

The Discrete Fourier Transform is a numerical variant of the Fourier Transform.  Specifically, given a vector of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; input amplitudes such as {f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  ... , f&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;}, the Discrete Fourier Transform yields a set of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; frequency magnitudes.

The DFT is defined as such:

&lt;math&gt;X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{\frac{-j 2 \pi k n}{ N }}&lt;/math&gt;

here, k is used to denote the frequency domain ordinal, and n is used to represent the time-domain ordinal. The big &quot;N&quot; is the length of the sequence to be transformed.

The '''Inverse DFT''' (IDFT) is given by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] W_N^{-kn}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;W_N&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;W_N = e^{-j2\pi/N}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, &quot;N&quot; is the length of the transformed sequence.

== Matrix Calculations ==

The DFT can be calculated much more easily using a matrix equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{D}_N \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

The little &quot;x&quot; is the time domain sequence arranged as a Nx1 vertical vector. The big &quot;X&quot; is the resulting frequency information, that will be arranged as a vertical vector (as per the rules of matrix multplication. The &quot;D&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; term is a matrix defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}_N = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1      &amp; 1         &amp; 1            &amp; \cdots &amp; 1
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N       &amp; W_N^2        &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{(N-1)}
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^2     &amp; W_N^4        &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{2(N-1)}
  \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots    &amp; \vdots       &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{N-1} &amp; W_N^{2(N-1)} &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{(N-1)(N-1)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar way, the IDFT can be calculated using matrices as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{D}_N^{-1} \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;

And we will define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}_N^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}_N^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1      &amp; 1          &amp; 1             &amp; \cdots &amp; 1
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{-1}   &amp; W_N^{-2}      &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{-(N-1)}
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{-2}   &amp; W_N^{-4}      &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{-2(N-1)}
  \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots     &amp; \vdots        &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{-N-1} &amp; W_N^{-2(N-1)} &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{-(N-1)(N-1)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Visualization of the Discrete Fourier Transform==

It may be easily seen that the term

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-pi t} &lt;/math&gt;

represents a unit vector in the complex plane, for any value of j and k.  The angle of the vector is initially 0 radians (along the real axis) for &lt;math&gt;j=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;.  As j and k increase, the angle is increased in units of 1/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a circle.  The total angle therefore becomes &lt;math&gt;2\pi*jk/n&lt;/math&gt; radians.  

To understand the meaning of the Discrete Fourier Transform, it becomes effective to write the transform in matrix form, depicting the complex terms pictorally.  

For example, with &lt;math&gt;n=8&lt;/math&gt;, the fourier transform can be written:

:[[Image:DFT_vis.jpg]]

The top row (or the left-hand column) changes not at all; therefore, F0 is the resultant when the amplitudes augment each other.  The second row changes by 1/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a circle, going from left to right.  The third row changes by 2/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;s of a circle; the fourth row changes by 3/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;s of a circle; the fifth row, here, changes by 4/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;s = 4/8 = 1/2 a circle. Therefore, F4 is the resultant when the even terms are set at odds with the odd terms.

We therefore see from the square matrix that the DFT is the resultant of all 2-D vectoral combinations of the input amplitudes.

== Relation to DTFT ==

The DFT and the DTFT are related to each other in a very simple manner. If we take the DTFT of a given time sequence, x[n], we will get a continuous-frequency function called &lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt;. If we sample &lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt; at N equally-spaced locations, the result will be the DFT, X[k]

== Circular Time Shifting ==

'''Circular Time Shifting''' is very similar to regular, linear time shifting, except that as the items are shifted past a certain point, they are looped around to the other end of the sequence. This subject may seem like a bit of a tangent, but the importance of this topic will become apparent when we discuss the [[Digital Signal Processing/Circular Convolution|Circular Convolution]] operation in the next chapter.

Let's say we have a given sequence, x[n], as such:

 x[n] = [1&amp; 2 3 4]

As we know, we can time-shift this sequence to the left or the right by subtracting or adding numbers to the argument:

 x[n+1] = [1 2&amp; 3 4 0]

 x[n-1] = [0&amp; 1 2 3 4]

Here, we've padded both sequences with zeros to make it obvious where the next item is coming in from. Now, let's say that when we shift a set, instead of padding with zeros, we loop the first number around to fill the hole. We will use the notation x[&lt;n+A&gt;] to denote an A-point circular shift:

 x[&lt;n+1&gt;] = [2&amp; 3 4 1]

Notice how the length of the sequence started as 4, and ended as 4, and we didn't need to pad with zeros. Also notice that the 1 &quot;fell off&quot; the left side of the set, and &quot;reappeared&quot; on the right side. It's as if the set is a circle, and objects that rotate off one direction will come back from the other direction. Likewise, let us rotate in the other direction:

 x[&lt;n-1&gt;] = [4&amp; 1 2 3]

If we rotate around by N points, where N is the length of the set, we get an important identity:

 x[&lt;n+N&gt;] = x[&lt;n-N&gt;] = x[n]

== Time Inversion ==

Now, let's look at a more complicated case: mixing circular shifting with time inversion. Let's define our example set x[n]:

 x[n] = [1&amp; 2 3 4]

we can define our time-inverted set as such:

 x[n] = [4 3 2 1&amp;]

notice that the &quot;4&quot; went from n=3 to n=-3, but the &quot;1&quot; stayed at the zero point. Now, let's try to combine this with our circular shift operation, to produce a result x[&lt;-n&gt;]. We know that the &quot;1&quot; (in the zero position) has not moved in either direction, nor have we shifted to the left or right, because we aren't adding or subtracting anything to our argument (n). So we can put 1 back in the same place as it was. All the rest of the numbers (2 3 and 4) all shifted to the right of the sequence, and therefore we will loop them around to the other side:

 x[&lt;-n&gt;] = [1&amp; 4 3 2]

Here is a general rule for circular time-inversion:

:&lt;math&gt;x[&lt;-n&gt;] = \left\{
\begin{matrix} 
    x[0],  &amp; \mbox{if }n = 0 
  \\ 
    x[&lt;N-n&gt;], &amp; \mbox{if }n \ne 0
\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

== Circular Convolution ==

'''Circular Convolution''' is an important operation to learn, because it  plays an important role in using the DFT.

Let's say we have 2 discrete sequences both of length N, x[n] and h[n]. We can define a circular convolution operation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m]h[&lt;n-m&gt;_N]&lt;/math&gt;

notice how we are using a circular time-shifting operation, instead of the linear time-shift used in regular, linear convolution.

== Circular Convolution Theorem ==

The DFT has certain properties that make it incompatible with the regular convolution theorem. However, the DFT does have a similar relation with the Circular Convolution operation that is very helpful. We call this relation the '''Circular Convolution Theorem''', and we state it as such:


{{TextBox|
;Circular Convolution Theorem: Multiplication in the discrete-time domain becomes circular convolution in the discrete-frequency domain. Circular convolution in the discrete-time domain becomes multiplication in the discrete-frequency domain.}}

== Relation to Linear Convolution ==

Circular Convolution is related to linear convolution, and we can use the circular convolution operation to compute the linear convolution result. Let's say we have 2 sets, x[n] and h[n], both of length N:

# pad both sets with N-1 zeros on the right side.
# perform the circular convolution on the new sets of length N+(N-1)
# The result is the linear convolution result of the original two sets.

== Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ==
The Fast Fourier Transform refers to algorithms that compute the DFT in a numerically efficient manner.Algorithms like:-decimation in time and decimation in frequency.</text>

The '''Z Transform''' has a strong relationship to the DTFT, and is incredibly useful in transforming, analyzing, and manipulating discrete calculus equations. The Z transform is named such because the letter 'z' (a lower-case Z) is used as the transformation variable. 

== z Transform Definition ==

for a given sequence x[n], we can define the z-transform X(z) as such:

{{eqn|Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(x[n]) = X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x[n]z^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;it is important to note that z is a continuous complex variable defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;z = Re(z) + j Im(z)&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the z-transform rarely needs to be computed manually, because many common results have already been tabulated extensively in tables.

== The Inverse Z-Transform ==

The inverse z-transform can be defined as such:

{{eqn|Inverse Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \frac{1}{2 \pi j} \oint_C X(z) z^{n-1} dz&lt;/math&gt;

Where C is a closed-contour that lies inside the unit circle on the z-plane, and encircles the point z = {0, 0}.

The inverse z-transform is mathematically very complicated, but luckily--like the z-transform itself--the results are extensively tabulated in tables.

== Equivalence to DTFT ==

If we substitute &lt;math&gt;z = e^{j\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in radians per second, into the Z-transform, we get

:&lt;math&gt;Z(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]e^{-j\omega n}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the definition of the [[Digital Signal Processing/Discrete-Time Fourier Transform|Discrete-Time Fourier Transform]]. In other words, to convert from the Z-transform to the DTFT, we need to evaluate the Z-transform around the unit circle.

== Properties == 

Since the z-transform is equivalent to the DTFT, the z-transform has many of the same properties. Specifically, the z-transform has the property of duality, and it also has a version of the convolution theorem (discussed later).

The z-transform is a linear operator.

== Convolution Theorem ==

Since the Z-transform is equivalent to the DTFT, it also has a convolution theorem that is worth stating explicitly:

{{TextBox|
;Convolution Theorem:Multiplication in the discrete-time domain becomes convolution in the z-domain. Multiplication in the z-domain becomes convolution in the discrete-time domain.}}

== Z-Plane ==

Since the variable z is a continuous, complex variable, we can map the z variable to a complex plane as such:

[[Image:Empty Z Plane.svg|center|300px]]

== Transfer Function ==

Let's say we have a system with an input/output relationship defined as such:

 Y(z) = H(z)X(z)

We can define the transfer function of the system as being the term H(z). If we have a basic transfer function, we can break it down into parts:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{N(z)}{D(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where H(z) is the transfer function, N(z) is the numerator of H(z) and D(z) is the denominator of H(z). If we set N(z)=0, the solutions to that equation are called the '''zeros''' of the transfer function. If we set D(z)=0, the solutions to that equation are called the '''poles''' of the transfer function.

The poles of the transfer function amplify the frequency response while the zero's attenuate it. This is important because when you design a filter you can place poles and zero's on the unit circle and quickly evaluate your filters frequency response.

=== Example ===

{{TextBox|Here is an example:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(z) = \frac{z^{-1}}{(z^{-1} + 2)}X(z)&lt;/math&gt;

So by dividing through by X(z), we can show that the transfer function is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{z^{-1}}{(z^{-1} + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also find the D(z) and N(z) equations as such:

:&lt;math&gt;N(z) = z^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = (z^{-1} + 2)&lt;/math&gt;

And from those equations, we can find the poles and zeros:

;Zeros: z &amp;rarr; 0
;Poles: z &amp;rarr; -1/2}}

== Stability ==

It can be shown that for any system with a transfer function H(z), all the poles of H(z) must lie within the unit-circle on the z-plane for the system to be stable. Zeros of the transfer function may lie inside or outside the circle.

== Gain ==

Gain is the factor by which the output magnitude is different from the input magnitude. If the input magnitude is the same as the output magnitude at a given frequency, the filter is said to have &quot;unity gain&quot;.

== Properties ==

Here is a listing of the most common properties of the Z transform.

== Phase Shift ==

You've finally made that perfect object, armature or material:  a gamepiece, a robot, a fully rigged vampire character, or a millimeter-accurate model of the Empire State Building.  Besides using this work in your own artistic project, you have made the courageous decision to share that creation with the world.

Sharing your creative work is a great way to &quot;give back to the community,&quot; even if you don't write Blender code and you can't translate the Blender documentation to Swahili.

== How to Make a Library ==

So how do you make a library?  In Blender, you don't need to export to a special format.  In fact, you don't need to do anything special beyond saving your regular .blend file.  Every .blend is a library file.  Users can Append what they like from your .blend file, and ignore parts which they don't need for their own project.

This scheme has some benefits and some drawbacks.

The benefit of using .blend files as a library format is that it's super easy to include extra stuff to help the user see the objects.  If the user loads the .blend file directly, it works like the pretty packaging for foods, including a quick and easy way to get a pretty &quot;serving suggestion&quot; rendering of the library contents.  What you save in your .blend is what the user will see when they load it, including all your user interface settings, lighting types, and camera positions.

The drawback of using .blend files as a library format is that it's super easy to include ''unintended'' things, such as extra meshes, unused material and texture channels, and other things which the user will not find helpful.  Blender doesn't save things which are no longer referenced anywhere, but it cannot read your mind if you leave a spare mesh on layer 13 which uses some abandoned Material.034.

Also, some people are not accustomed to the way that Blender saves all of the user interface settings along with the .blend file.  When they load your mesh, they see your way of working.  This can be instructive, but unless that's your intention, it's best to try to stick to a simple and clean user interface setup for your library files.

For best results, you need to apply some discipline to publish a clean and useful library.

== Library Usefulness Checklist ==

After having used several library .blend files from various sources, I propose that anyone making libraries follow a few suggestions:

* keep to a certain object, theme or area of focus for each library file
* all the test cameras and lights prefixed with a dash; e.g., '''-Camera''', '''-HemiLight.001''', etc.
* any other components not intended for Appending prefixed with a dash; e.g., '''-ground'''
* all the test cameras and lights on the last one or two layers ('''lower right layer button''')
* any composite object intended for Appending organized in a '''group''' to hold it together
* any groups, objects, materials, textures intended for Appending given '''meaningful names'''
* document your unit scheme; e.g., '''1 blender unit == 1 imperial foot''', etc.
* any other layer contains test-render-ready objects or scenes
* choose rendering and world '''settings which will not take an hour''' to make a simple test render
* make visible upon loading the layers required for a camera, a good lighting angle, and a shared object 
* make visible upon loading one small text file which lists layers and objects
* make visible upon loading any python script, '''with instructions on how to start it''' in a big comment
* make your licensing expectations clear:  '''artistic license''', '''creative commons''', etc.
* pack the texture files and other data before saving that final .blend for publishing
* sign your work, stable email address or website url if possible

The dash prefixes for test-rendering cameras, boxes, floors and lights will help the user know at a glance what to Append and what not to Append from your library.

Here's a quick way to throw out all the stuff you really don't need, including extra meshes, materials and user interface complexity.

* save your current .blend (and make a nice backup file too)
* shut down Blender entirely
* open up Blender again, which will load the default settings
* delete the cube and cameras from the default settings
* Append all the useful parts of your library .blend file (including the ''useful'' test-rendering items)
* select the proper test-rendering camera for users to try out your model quickly (select, then Ctrl+KEYPAD0)
* adjust the views to ensure important things are visible and ready to render
* save the new library .blend, ready to publish

Blender saves the default settings in a file called '''.b.blend''' on your disk.  If your own preferred default settings are still too complicated for newcomers to understand, you can move that file away temporarily to get the &quot;factory&quot; built-in default settings which the Blender team produces as a part of each new version of the software.  Move the file back again when you want to go back to your individual way of working.

== Publishing Your Library ==

It's helpful to include the .txt file and/or post it separately so that people can read a summary before loading the blend file.  This should include any credits, usage notes, layer explanations, and licensing information.  For you Unix folks, remember to run it through '''unix2dos''' to enforce \r\n CRLF newlines, readable by people with less flexible tools such as Windows Notepad.

It's also of immense benefit to put up small test-renders of your library objects or materials.  They don't need to be large but they should give an honest view of the work you're sharing before a potential user takes the time to download library files that will not be useful to them.

So, where do you publish your work of artistic genius?

* http://www.e2-productions.com/bmr Blender 3D Model Repository
* http://blenderartists.org/ forums
* http://www.deviantart.com/
* http://www.blendswap.com
* your own website

If you post things on your own website, try not to rely on a free site that will over-run your bandwidth limits and disappear two months later.  Search engine links will sometimes live on for years, just frustrating those who were hoping to find a millimeter-accurate model of the Empire State Building.

== Beyond Libraries ==

If you have even more time to spare, consider writing up a tutorial on how you achieved any tricky results!

== Thank You ==

For every artist who chooses to share their creative works with the community, there are a dozen artists, or even hundreds, who thank you immensely.

==Introduction==

The way that the velocity of a particle can differ between observers who are moving relative to each other means that momentum needs to be redefined as a result of relativity theory.

The illustration below shows a typical collision of two particles. In the right hand frame the collision is observed from the viewpoint of someone moving at the same velocity as one of the particles, in the left hand frame it is observed by someone moving at a velocity that is intermediate between those of the particles.

If momentum is redefined then all the variables such as force (rate of change of momentum), energy etc. will become redefined and relativity will lead to an entirely new physics. The new physics has an effect at the ordinary level of experience through the relation &lt;math&gt;K = \gamma m c^2 - m c^2\,&lt;/math&gt; whereby it is the tiny deviations in gamma from unity that are expressed as everyday kinetic energy so that the whole of physics is related to &quot;relativistic&quot; reasoning rather than Newton's empirical ideas.

==Momentum==

In physics momentum is conserved within a closed system, the '''law of conservation of momentum''' applies.  Consider the special case of identical particles colliding symmetrically as illustrated below:

[[Image:relcollision2.gif]]

The momentum change by the red ball is:

&lt;math&gt;2m\mathbf{u_{yR}}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum change by the blue ball is:

&lt;math&gt;-2m\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;

The situation is symmetrical so the '''Newtonian''' conservation of momentum law is demonstrated:

&lt;math&gt;2m\mathbf{u_{yR}}=2m\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this result depends upon the y components of the velocities being equal, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u_{yR}}=\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The relativistic case is rather different. The collision is illustrated below, the left hand frame shows the collision as it appears for one observer and the right hand frame shows '''exactly the same collision''' as it appears for another observer moving at the same velocity as the blue ball:

[[Image:relcollision3.gif]]

The configuration shown above has been simplified because one frame contains a stationary blue ball (ie: &lt;math&gt;u_{xB}=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the velocities are chosen so that the vertical velocity of the red ball is exactly reversed after the collision ie:&lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = -u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt;. Both frames show exactly the same event, it is only the observers who differ between frames. The relativistic velocity transformations between frames is:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = \frac{u_{yR} \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB}^' =\frac{u_{yB} \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}{1 - u_{xB}v/c^2}= u_{yB} \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; given that &lt;math&gt;u_{xB}=0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that the y components are equal in one frame, in Newtonian physics they will also be equal in the other frame. However, in relativity, if the y components are equal in one frame they are '''not''' necessarily equal in the other frame (time dilation is not directional so perpendicular velocities differ between the observers). For instance if &lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt; then:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB} = \frac{u_{yR}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt; then in this case &lt;math&gt;u_{yR} \ne u_{yB}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the mass were constant between collisions and between frames then although &lt;math&gt;2 m\mathbf{u_{yR}^'} = 2m\mathbf{u_{yB}^'}&lt;/math&gt; it is found that:

&lt;math&gt;2 m\mathbf{u_{yR}} \ne 2m\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;

So momentum defined as mass times velocity is not conserved in a collision when the collision is described in frames moving relative to each other. Notice that the discrepancy is very small if &lt;math&gt;u_{xR}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are small. 

To preserve the principle of momentum conservation in all inertial reference frames, the definition of momentum has to be changed. The new definition must reduce to the Newtonian expression when objects move at speeds much smaller than the speed of light, so as to recover the Newtonian formulas. 

The velocities in the y direction are related by the following equation when the observer is travelling at the same velocity as the blue ball ie: when &lt;math&gt; u_{xB} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB} = \frac{u_{yR}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If we write &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; for the mass of the blue ball) and &lt;math&gt;m_R&lt;/math&gt; for the mass of the red ball as observed from the frame of the blue ball then, if the principle of relativity applies:

&lt;math&gt;2 m_R u_{yR} = 2 m_B u_{yB} \,&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;m_R = m_B \frac{u_{yB}}{u_{yR}}&lt;/math&gt;

But:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB} = \frac{u_{yR}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;m_R = \frac{m_B}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that, if the principle of relativity is to apply then the mass must change by the amount shown in the equation above for the conservation of momentum law to be true.

The reference frame was chosen so that &lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = -u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt; u_{xR}^' = v&lt;/math&gt;.  This allows &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to be determined in terms of &lt;math&gt;u_{xR}\,&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u_{xR}^' = \frac{u_{xR} - v}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2} = v&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{c^2}{u_{xR}}(1 - \sqrt{1-u_{xR}^2/c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

So substituting for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;m_R = \frac{m_B}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;m_R = \frac{m_B}{\sqrt{1 - u_{xR}^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The blue ball is at rest so its mass is sometimes known as its '''rest mass''', and is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  As the balls were identical at the start of the boost the mass of the red ball is the mass that a blue ball would have if it were in motion relative to an observer; this mass is sometimes known as the '''relativistic mass''' symbolised by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. These terms are now infrequently used in modern physics, as will be explained at the end of this section.
The discussion given above was related to the relative motions of the blue and red balls, as a result &lt;math&gt;u_{xR}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the '''speed''' of the moving ball relative to an observer who is stationary with respect to the blue ball.  These considerations mean that the relativistic mass is given by:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The relativistic momentum is given by the product of the relativistic mass and the velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=M\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

The overall expression for momentum in terms of rest mass is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{m\mathbf{u}}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the components of the momentum are:

&lt;math&gt;p_x = \frac{mu_x}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_y = \frac{mu_y}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_z = \frac{mu_z}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

So the components of the momentum depend upon the appropriate velocity component and the speed.

Since the factor with the square root is cumbersome to write, the following abbreviation is often used, called the Lorentz gamma factor:

&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for the momentum then reads &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m \gamma \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;.

It can be seen from the discussion above that we can write the momentum of an object moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; as the product of a function &lt;math&gt; M(u) &lt;/math&gt; of the speed &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and the velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;: 

&lt;math&gt; M(u) \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt; M(u) &lt;/math&gt; must reduce to the object's mass &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; at small speeds, in particular when the object is at rest &lt;math&gt; M(0) = m &lt;/math&gt;. 

There is a debate about the usage of the term &quot;mass&quot; in relativity theory.  If inertial mass is defined in terms of momentum then it does indeed vary as &lt;math&gt;M = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt; for a single particle that has rest mass, furthermore, as will be shown below the energy of a particle that has a rest mass is given by &lt;math&gt;E=Mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Prior to the debate about nomenclature the function &lt;math&gt; M(u) &lt;/math&gt;, or the relation &lt;math&gt;M = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt;, used to be called 'relativistic mass', and its value in the frame of the particle was referred to as the 'rest mass' or 'invariant mass'. The relativistic mass, &lt;math&gt;M = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt;, would increase with velocity. Both terms are now largely obsolete: the 'rest mass' is today simply called the mass, and the 'relativistic mass' is often no longer used since, as will be seen in the discussion of energy below, it is identical to the energy but for the units.

==Force==

Newton's second law states that the total force acting on a particle equals the rate of change of its momentum. The same form of Newton's second law holds in relativistic mechanics. The relativistic ''3 force'' is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} = d\mathbf{p}/dt&lt;/math&gt;

If the relativistic mass is used:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}= \frac{d(m\mathbf{u})}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

By Leibniz's law where &lt;math&gt;d(xy)=xdy+ydx&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}= m\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt}+\mathbf{u}\frac{dm}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation for force will be used below to derive relativistic expressions for the energy of a particle in terms of the old concept of &quot;relativistic mass&quot;.

The relativistic force can also be written in terms of acceleration. Newton's second law can be written in the familiar form

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = d\mathbf{v}/dt &lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration.

here m is '''not''' the relativistic mass but is the invariant mass.

In relativistic mechanics, momentum is &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m \gamma \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;

again m being the invariant mass and the force is given by &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d(\gamma \mathbf{v})}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

This form of force is used in the derivation of the expression for energy without relying on relativistic mass.

It will be seen in the second section of this book that Newton's second law in terms of acceleration is given by: 

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m \gamma( \mathbf{a} + \frac{\gamma^2 v}{c^2} \frac{dv}{dt} \mathbf{v}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Energy==

The debate over the use of the concept &quot;relativistic mass&quot; means that modern physics courses may forbid the use of this in the derivation of energy.  The newer derivation of energy without using relativistic mass is given in the first section and the older derivation using relativistic mass is given in the second section.  The two derivations can be compared to gain insight into the debate about mass but a knowledge of 4 vectors is really required to discuss the problem in depth. In principle the first derivation is most mathematically correct because &quot;relativistic mass&quot; is given by: &lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt; which involves the constants &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.


===Derivation of relativistic energy using the relativistic momentum===

In the following, modern derivation, m means the invariant mass - what used to be called the &quot;rest mass&quot;. Energy is defined as the work done in moving a body from one place to another. We will make use of the relativistic momentum &lt;math&gt; p=\gamma mv &lt;/math&gt;. Energy is given from:

&lt;math&gt; dE = \mathbf{f}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

so, over the whole path:

&lt;math&gt; E = \int_{0}^{x} \mathbf{f}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Kinetic energy (K) is the energy used to move a body from a velocity of 0 to a velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. Restricting the motion to one dimension:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} \mathbf{f} dx&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relativistic ''3 force'':

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} \frac{d(m\gamma u)}{dt}dx=\int_{u=0}^{u=u}m \frac{d(\gamma u)}{dt}dx= \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m d(\gamma u)\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

substituting for &lt;math&gt;d(\gamma u)&lt;/math&gt; and using &lt;math&gt;dx/dt=u&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m (\gamma du + ud\gamma) u&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m (u\gamma du + u^2 d\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

The Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt; 

meaning that :

&lt;math&gt;d\gamma = \frac{u}{c^2}\gamma^3du&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;du = \frac{c^2}{u\gamma^3}d\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

So that

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} m (u\gamma \frac{c^2}{u\gamma^3}d\gamma + u^2 d\gamma)
= \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} m (\frac{c^2}{\gamma^2} + u^2) d\gamma
= \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} m c^2 d\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we can use the fact that:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma^2c^2 - \gamma^2u^2 = c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating:

&lt;math&gt;2\gamma c^2d\gamma - \gamma^22udu -u^22\gamma d\gamma =0\,&lt;/math&gt;

So, rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma u du + u^2 d\gamma = c^2 d\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;

In which case:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m (u\gamma du + u^2 d\gamma) = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m c^2 d\gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; goes from 0 to &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;, the Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; goes from 1 to &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, so:

&lt;math&gt;K = m c^2 \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} d\gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;K = \gamma m c^2 - m c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

The amount &lt;math&gt;\gamma mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''total energy''' of the particle.  The amount &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''rest energy''' of the particle. If the total energy of the particle is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; E = \gamma m c^2  = mc^2 + K \,&lt;/math&gt;

So it can be seen that &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a mass that is stationary.  This energy is known as '''mass energy'''.

The Newtonian approximation for kinetic energy can be derived by using the binomial theorem to expand &lt;math&gt;\gamma = (1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The binomial expansion is:

&lt;math&gt;(a + x)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}x + \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}a^{n-2}x^2 ....&lt;/math&gt;

So expanding &lt;math&gt;(1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} m u^2 + \frac{3m u^4}{8c^2} + \frac{5m u^6}{16c^4} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is much less than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} m u^2 &lt;/math&gt;

which is the Newtonian approximation for low velocities.

===Derivation of relativistic energy using the concept of relativistic mass===

Energy is defined as the work done in moving a body from one place to another. Energy is given from:

&lt;math&gt; dE = \mathbf{F}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

so, over the whole path:

&lt;math&gt; E = \int_{0}^{x} \mathbf{F}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Kinetic energy (K) is the energy used to move a body from a velocity of 0 to a velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. So:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} F dx&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relativistic force:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} \frac{d(Mu)}{dt}dx&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} d(Mu)\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

substituting for &lt;math&gt;d(Mu)&lt;/math&gt; and using &lt;math&gt;dx/dt=u&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} (Mdu + udM) u&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} (Mu du + u^2 dM)&lt;/math&gt;

The relativistic mass is given by:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be expanded as:

&lt;math&gt;M^2c^2 - M^2u^2 = m^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating:

&lt;math&gt;2Mc^2dM - M^22udu -u^22MdM =0&lt;/math&gt;

So, rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;Mu du + u^2 dM = c^2 dM&lt;/math&gt;

In which case:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} (Mu du + u^2 dM)&lt;/math&gt;

is simplified to:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} c^2 dM&lt;/math&gt;

But the mass goes from &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;K = c^2 \int_{M=m}^{M=M} dM)&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;K = Mc^2 - mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

The amount &lt;math&gt;Mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''total energy''' of the particle.  The amount &lt;math&gt;mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''rest energy''' of the particle. If the total energy of the particle is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 + K&lt;/math&gt;

So it can be seen that &lt;math&gt;mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a mass that is stationary.  This energy is known as '''mass energy''' and is the origin of the famous formula &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; that is iconic of the nuclear age.

The Newtonian approximation for kinetic energy can be derived by substituting the rest mass for the relativistic mass ie:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;K = Mc^2 - mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} - mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

ie:

&lt;math&gt;K = mc^2 ((1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}} -1)&lt;/math&gt;


The binomial theorem can be used to expand &lt;math&gt;(1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

The binomial theorem is:

&lt;math&gt;(a + x)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}x + \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}a^{n-2}x^2 ....&lt;/math&gt;

So expanding &lt;math&gt;(1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} mu^2 + \frac{3mu^4}{8c^2} + \frac{5mu^6}{16c^4} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is much less than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} mu^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the Newtonian approximation for low velocities.

==Nuclear Energy==

When protons and neutrons (nucleons) combine to form elements the combination of particles tends to be in a lower energy state than the free neutrons and protons.  Iron has the lowest energy and elements above and below iron in the scale of atomic masses tend to have higher energies.  This decrease in energy as neutrons and protons bind together is known as the '''binding energy'''.  The atomic masses of elements are slightly different from that calculated from their constituent particles and this difference in mass energy, calculated from &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;, is almost exactly equal to the binding energy.

The binding energy can be released by converting elements with higher masses per nucleon to those with lower masses per nucleon. This can be done by either splitting heavy elements such as uranium into lighter elements such as barium and krypton or by joining together light elements such as hydrogen into heavier elements such as deuterium.  If atoms are split the process is known as '''nuclear fission''' and if atoms are joined the process is known as '''nuclear fusion'''.  Atoms that are lighter than iron can be fused to release energy and those heavier than iron can be split to release energy.

When hydrogen and a neutron are combined to make deuterium the energy released can be calculated as follows:

The mass of a proton is 1.00731 amu, the mass of a neutron is 1.00867 amu and the mass of a deuterium nucleus is 2.0136 amu. The difference in mass between a deuterium nucleus and its components is 0.00238 amu. The energy of this mass difference is:

&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \times 0.00238 \times (3 \times 10^8)^2&lt;/math&gt;

So the energy released is &lt;math&gt;3.57 \times 10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt; joules or about &lt;math&gt;2 \times 10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; joules per gram of protons (ionised hydrogen).

(Assuming 1 amu = &lt;math&gt;1.66 \times 10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt; Kg, Avogadro's number = &lt;math&gt;6 \times 10^{23}&lt;/math&gt; and the speed of light is &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^8&lt;/math&gt; metres per second)

Present day nuclear reactors use a process called '''nuclear fission''' in which rods of uranium emit neutrons which combine with the uranium in the rod to produce uranium isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U which rapidly decay into smaller nuclei such as Barium and Krypton plus three neutrons which can cause further generation of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U and further decay. The fact that each neutron can cause the generation of three more neutrons means that a self sustaining or '''chain reaction''' can occur. The generation of energy results from the equivalence of mass and energy; the decay products, barium and krypton have a lower mass than the original &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U, the missing mass being released as 177 MeV of radiation. The nuclear equation for the decay of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U is written as follows:

&lt;math&gt;^{236}_{92}U \rightarrow ^{144}_{56}Ba + ^{89}_{36}Kr + 3n + 177 MeV &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg|left|thumb|Nuclear explosion]]If a large amount of the uranium isotope &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (the '''critical mass''') is confined the chain reaction can get out of control and almost instantly release a large amount of energy.  A device that confines a critical mass of uranium is known as an '''atomic bomb''' or '''A-bomb'''.  A bomb based on the fusion of deuterium atoms is known as a '''thermonuclear bomb''', '''hydrogen bomb''' or '''H-bomb'''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Nominative case''' is the most commonly used [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|grammatical case]] in Russian. It is the default case for words, and so it is the case that words are written in the dictionaries.

== What is a case? ==
The nature of cases in Russian is detailed more thoroughly on [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|its dedicated page]]. A case tells you what a noun, pronoun, or adjective is doing in a sentence, and is denoted by a set of rules that change the end of the word. For instance, if a person or thing is the object of a sentence (the 'object' is the thing which is being verbed), then you place it in the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative_case|accusative case]]; an example of a rule for this case states that words which usually end in '''а''', such as '''книга''' ('book'), change the '''a''' to '''у''' (so '''книга''' becomes '''книгу'''). English relies on the ''order'' of words to convey this kind of meaning, but Russian does this with grammatical cases, so they use word order for different purposes.

So, cases have rules that change a word and tell you what it's doing in a sentence. A word in the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|accusative case]] is the thing being verbed ('the dog chased ''the cat''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;), the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive case]] describes something being counted ('he has five ''apples''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or something owned ('the house ''of Sasha''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Sasha's'' house'), and so on.

The nominative case is special, as there are few rules to learn. When you look up a word in the dictionary, it will be in its nominative form. Thus, you don't need any rules to change a word into the nominative case: it's already in it by default. The only rules that are used in the nominative case are those to turn a word into its plural form (each case has its own rules for converting a word into the singular of that case, and into that case's plural form).

== Usage ==
The Nominative case is used when no other case is being used. Its use is to denote a word as being the ''subject'' of a verb - that is, the thing that's doing the verb. For instance, in the sentence, &quot;Peter is driving a car&quot;, 'Peter' is the ''subject'' of the verb 'to drive'. In Russian, then, the word 'Peter' would be placed in the nominative case. If you don't know what case to put a word in, use the nominative, and you'll probably be right.

One of the first things to learn in Russian is the idea of [[Russian/Grammar/Gender|gender]]; this article will give a brief overview, but see the dedicated page for a more thorough treatment. Unlike French, where gender is arbitrary, you can work out a word's gender by it's ending:
* Most words are &lt;small&gt;''MASCULINE''&lt;/small&gt;, and they end in a consonant in the nominative case: '''б, в, г, д, ж, з, й к, л, м, н, п, р, с, т, ф, х, ч, ц, ш''', or '''щ'''. It is easiest to remember that a word that doesn't have a feminine or neuter ending, is probably masculine, though you will soon learn to predict gender intuitively. Words which are masculine in meaning but feminine in grammar (such as 'uncle', '''дядя'''), are classed as masculine (for adjectives, pronouns, etc), but conjugate as a feminine noun ('''дядя &gt;&gt; дядю''', for instance). The soft sign, '''ь''', can be on either masculine or feminine nouns. Examples are '''стол''' ('chair'), '''музей''' ('museum'), and '''медведь'''' ('bear').
* Most other words are &lt;small&gt;''FEMININE''&lt;/small&gt;, and they end in '''а''' or '''я''', or occasionally '''ь'''. Examples are '''корова''' ('cow'), '''змея''' ('snake'), and '''дочь''' ('daughter').
* Then there are &lt;small&gt;''NEUTER''&lt;/small&gt; words, which end in either '''o''' or '''e'''. Examples are '''письмо''' ('letter'), '''море''' ('sea'), and '''платье''' ('dress').

You may have noticed that not all the letters in the Russian alphabet have been used here, such as '''ё''', '''у''', '''и''', etc. This is because they don't occur on the ends of default, nominative, singular nouns, and instead are really only used as noun endings after conjugation ('''ы''', for instance, is the common ''plural'' ending for nouns). Rarely, unusual or foreign words may end in these non-standard letters, such as '''такси''' ('taxi') - these have irregular genders, and are indeclinable (that is, they don't change according to case or number).

Finally, apart from denoting verbal subjects and helping us tell a word's gender, the nominative has one other, small use: it is used after some prepositions. Like other cases, there are prepositions that call the nominative case, though these are extremely rare nowadays, and are mostly used in sayings and idioms. They are:
* '''За''' + ''nom'', 'of', 'what kind of' - this preposition is used in sentences like, &quot;What kind of X is Y?&quot;, and are constructed in Russian using the word '''что''': &quot;Что Y за X&quot;, with both X and Y being in the nominative. For example: What kind of woman is she? '''Что она за женщина?'''. What kind of worker is Ivan? '''Что Иван за работник?'''.
* '''В''' + ''nom'', 'became' - this is used only with plural nouns to denote joining a group: &quot;I became a worker&quot;, '''Я в рабочие'''.

==Nouns==
As stated above, the nominative case is the default, dictionary, singular form of a noun, and is used to denote the subject of a verb. As such, there are no rules for working out how to conjugate a singular word into this case, as it's already in it by default. When learning about other cases, the rules will explain how to go from this nominative case, to the case in question. Examples of nouns in the nominative are:
:The husband is talking - '''Муж говорит'''
:The train is old - '''Поезд старый'''
:The student is new - '''Студент новый'''

=== Plural Nouns ===
If you want to refer to a group of objects in the nominative, you use the plural, just like in English. Though there are no rules needed to form the nominative singular (just look the word up in the dictionary), there ''are'' rules for forming the plural. These are very simple to learn:
: Masculine nouns add '''-ы''' to the end of the word, just like how we add 's' in English. For example, '''стол''' ('table') &gt;&gt; '''столы''' ('tables').
: Feminine nouns that end in '''-а''' replace the vowel with '''-ы''', while nouns that end in '''-я''' or '''-ь''' have '''-и'''. For example, '''машина''' ('car') &gt;&gt; '''машины''' ('cars'); '''свинья''' ('pig') &gt;&gt; '''свиньи''' ('pigs'); '''ночь''' ('night') &gt;&gt; '''ночи''' ('nights').
: Neuter nouns that end in '''-о''' have '''-а''' in the nominative plural, while '''-е''' becomes '''-я''': '''письмо''' ('letter') &gt;&gt; '''письма''' ('letters'); '''море''' ('sea') &gt;&gt; '''моря''' ('seas').
These are the basic rulers for making words plural. In other cases, there are different rules which must be learned. As with many things in Russian, there are exceptions. There are several words in Russian with exceptional nominative plurals:
:'''Сын '''&gt;&gt;''' Сыновья''' ('son', 'sons')
:'''Брат '''&gt;&gt;''' Братья''' ('brother', brothers')
:'''Друг '''&gt;&gt;''' Друзья''' ('friend', 'friends')
Perhaps the most common exceptions are those that fall under the Seven-Letter Rule.

===The 7-letter spelling rule===
There is a spelling rule called the '7-letter spelling rule', so called because it comes into effect after seven letters: '''к, г, х, ш, щ, ж''', and '''ч'''. When you remove the default ending from a word, you are left with the stem. If the stem ends in one of those seven letters, then you generally have to add an alternate ending. For example, '''книга''', 'book', has the stem '''книг-''', so it obeys the 7-letter rule. What to do when this spelling rule appears will be covered in each instance individually. However, the rule generally just requires the use of an 'alternate' noun ending.

For the nominative plural, if a masculine or feminine word ends in the 7-letter rule, you always use the ending '''-и''', not '''-ы'''. So, although '''книга''', 'book', ends in '''-а''', its nominative plural is '''книги''', as its stem ends in '''г'''.
:These rabbits - '''Эти кролики'''
:The mice are nice - '''Мыши симпатичные'''
:These are my friends - '''Эти мои друзья''' - ''Note the exceptional ending '''-я'''''

What follows is a summary table for the endings found on singular and plural nouns in the nominative case. Where there are multiple endings, refer to the rules above:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Nominative !! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter
|-
| Singular || ''const.'', '''ь''' || '''а/я/ь''' || '''о/е'''
|-
| Plural || '''ы/и''' || '''ы/и''' || '''а/я'''
|}

In the future, the plural case will be treated as a sort of 'fourth gender', and will be give its own column. Here, however, it has a separate row.

As with all things in Russian, there are some irregular, unpredictable exceptions to the above rules:
: Some masculine nouns drop the last vowel before adding '''ы''' or '''и''', such as '''подарок''' ('gift') &gt;&gt; '''подарки'''. Theses are known as 'fleeting vowels', and are generally found in dictionaries in parentheses: '''подар(о)к'''.
: Some masculine nouns add '''a''' to form the nominative plural, such as '''дом''' ('house') &gt;&gt; '''дома''' ('houses').
: As mentioned above, words of foreign origin ending in '''o''', '''и''', or '''у''', don't change between singular and plural. So, '''радио''' means 'radio' or 'radios', and '''такси''' is both 'taxi' and 'taxis'.

==Adjectives==
Like nouns, adjectives change according to case, number, and gender. An adjective has no inherent gender, so it changes its ending to suit the gender (and case and number) of the noun it's modifying. An adjective modifying a singular, feminine noun in the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental case]], is itself in the singular, feminine, instrumental case. 

However, when you look up an adjective in the dictionary, what do you see? You see the default, nominative, masculine, singular form. For a more thorough treatment of adjectives, see their [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives|dedicated page]]. For our purposes, we only need to know two things: all adjectives end in either '''-ый''', '''-ий''', or '''-ой''', and conjugating adjectives is as simple as removing these endings and adding the new ones. The ending you add is the one that corresponds to the noun.

Adjectives modifying masculine nouns in the nominative case keep their default endings: 'new pencil' is '''новый карандаш'''.
For feminine nouns, the adjective takes on the ending '''-ая''': 'new book' is '''новая книга'''.
For neuter nouns, the ending is '''-ое''': 'new letter' is '''новое письмо'''.

Adjectives also change according to number, so when modifying a plural noun, regardless of gender, they have the ending '''-ые''': 'new books' is '''новые книги'''. However, like nouns, they obey the 7-letter spelling rule.

=== The 7-letter spelling rule ===
As mentioned earlier, if the stem of a noun ends in '''к''', '''г''', '''х''', '''ш''', '''щ''', '''ж''', and '''ч''', then different endings from usual apply. The same is true for adjectives. Adjectives such as '''хороший''' ('good'), '''русский''' ('Russian'), and '''другой''' ('different'), take on alternate endings to other adjectives. In the nominative case, this only affects plural adjectives: instead of '''-ые''', these adjectives have the ending '''-ие'''.
:New books - '''Новые книги'''
:Old books - '''Старые книги'''
:Good books - '''Хорошие книги'''
:Different books - '''Разные книги'''
In general, after these seven consonants, whenever you would normally see '''ы''' in an adjectival ending, you instead find '''и'''. This also applies to standard adjectival endings: after these seven letters, you always have the default ending '''ий'''. This can be useful in predicting or remembering the default endings of adjectives.
Unlike nouns, adjectives are affected by a second spelling rule.

=== The 5-letter spelling rule ===
On top of the previous spelling rule, there's a second important rule: after the letters '''ш, щ, ж, ч''', and '''ц''', the first unstressed '''о''' in an ending becomes '''е'''. For nominative adjectives, this only affects neuter singular endings: we have '''-ее''' as the ending, not '''-ое'''.
:Bad wine - '''Плохое вино'''
:Good wine - '''Хорошее вино'''
:Old letter - '''Старое письмо'''
:Fresh letter - '''Свежее письмо'''
An easy way to remember this is that four of the five letters are the 'hushes', '''ш''', '''щ''', '''ж''', and '''ч''', and these are also four letters from the seven-letter spelling rule. Few adjectives end in '''цый''', so you don't have to worry about this so much. As such, almost all adjectives that follow this rule also follow the 7-letter rule: '''хороший''', '''хорошее письмо''', '''хорошие письма'''.

=== Soft adjectives ===
The final nuance with Russian adjectives are the adjectives that have the so-called 'soft ending': '''-ний''', such as '''синий''' ('dark blue'). These adjectives don't fall into the above two spelling rules, but still take on the exceptional endings. These are covered more thoroughly on [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives#Soft_endings|their own page]], but in the nominative case they have only one unique ending: the feminine singular ending for these adjectives is '''-яя''', not '''-ая'''. They also take on the alternate neuter and plural endings we learned for the seven- and five-letter spelling rules: '''-ее''' for neuter nouns, and '''-ие''' for plural nouns.

So, a summary of adjectival endings in the nominative case is as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! Plural
|-
| ый ий ой || ая&lt;br&gt;''яя''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || ое&lt;br&gt;''ее''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || ые&lt;br&gt;''ие''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;For adjectives with the soft ending.
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For adjectives ending in the five-letter rule, and those with the soft ending.
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;For adjectives ending in the seven-letter rule, and those with the soft ending.

==Personal Pronouns==
The personal pronouns (words used to denote the speaker) are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! 1st-person
| Я ('I') || Мы ('We')
|-
! 2nd-person
| Ты ('You', informal) || Вы ('You', polite/plural)
|-
! 3rd-person
| Он/она/оно ('He', 'She', 'It') || Они ('They')
|}

They are more thoroughly discussed on their [[Russian/Personal_Pronouns|dedicated page]].

==Possessive pronouns==
The possessive pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! Plural
|-
! My
| Мой || Моя || Моё || Мои
|-
! Your (informal)
| Твой || Твоя || Твоё || Твои
|-
! Our
| Наш || Наша || Наше || Наши
|-
! Your (polite/plural)
| Ваш || Ваша || Ваше || Ваши
|}

'His' and 'its' are '''его''' ('ye-voh'), 'her' is '''её''' ('ye-yoh'), and 'their' is '''их''' ('eekh'), and these do not change with the gender or number of the possessed object.

==Demonstrative Pronouns==

это (&quot;ehtuh&quot;) translates to &quot;this&quot; or &quot;these.&quot;

Note that it starts with э (&quot;eh&quot;), not е (&quot;yeh&quot;) or з (z).

When это is followed by a nominative case noun, это changes to match the gender of the noun, thus becoming a demonstrative adjective:

&lt;table cols=5 border=1&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;этот (&quot;etuht&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;эта (&quot;etuh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;это (&quot;etuh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;эти (&quot;etee&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

For example, Этот чемодан мой (&quot;This suitcase is mine.&quot;).

However, when a possessive pronoun is between это and the noun, the possessive pronoun changes but это doesn't change. For example, Это мой чемодан (&quot;This is my suitcase&quot;).

Also note that for neuter nouns, changing word order doesn't change это, and that эта and это are both pronounced &quot;etuh&quot;, since their endings are both unstressed.

==Demonstrative Adjectives==

&lt;table cols=5 border=1&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тот (&quot;tot&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;та (&quot;ta&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;то (&quot;to&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;те (&quot;tyeh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Accusative case is the second most common grammatical case in Russian. It is mainly used to identify a word as being the ''object'' of a verb, such as the word 'him' in the sentence &quot;She likes him&quot;. In English, this is denoted by the ''objective'' case. Other uses of the accusative case are after some common prepositions, such as '''в''' + ''acc'', 'into', or '''на''' + ''acc'', 'onto'.

== Usage ==
As mentioned above, the primary use of the accusative case is to denote the object of a verb. The ''indirect'' object ('I write a letter ''to you'' ') is denoted by the [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|''dative case'']]. English has a case called the ''objective'' case, so called because it denotes the object of verbs. However, words in the English objective case are largely the same as when they're the subject of a verb (i.e., in the subjective case). Thus, English uses word order to denote what's the subject and object of a verb: though 'cats' and 'dogs' remain the same in &quot;cats hate dogs&quot; and &quot;dogs hate cats&quot;, word order denotes which is the subject and which is the object.

In Russian, there is a very definite case system which denotes what's what in a sentence. Since Russians don't have to rely as much on word order to convey grammatical information, they can move words around more freely than in English. Word order instead denotes emphasis; whatever is on the end of a sentence is what's being emphasised. That said, Russians typically use a 'Subject Object Verb' construct by default, placing emphasis on the verb. So you would often see the sentence &quot;I speak to her&quot; as '''Я ей говорю''', even though other permutations like '''Ей говорю я''' or '''Я говорю ей''' are grammatically correct.

In practice, though you can use the 'Subject Verb Object' system of English and still be understood, it pays to be aware that Russians don't always construct sentences that way. Thus, a good understanding of the Russian case system is essential.

:I like dogs - '''Я люблю собак''' - English 'SVO' word order; usual Russian word order
:''I'' like dogs - '''Собак люблю я''' - Emphasis on 'I'
:I ''like'' dogs - '''Я собак люблю''' - Emphasis on 'like'
:I like ''dogs'' - '''Я люблю собак''' - Emphasis on 'dogs'; same as English word order

The other use of the accusative case is with two major prepositions: '''в''' and '''на'''. When followed by the accusative case, '''в''' means 'to' or 'into', as in 'I walked ''into'' the house' ('''Я шёл в дом'''), and '''на''' means 'onto' or 'toward', as in 'I walked ''onto'' the street' ('''Я шёл на улицу'''). However, both prepositions can also use the [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional case]]: '''в''' + ''prep'' means 'in' or 'at', as in 'I lived in London' ('''Я жил в Лондоне'''), and '''на''' + ''prep'' means 'upon' or 'at', as in 'It's on the table' ('''Оно на столе'''). The accusative and prepositional uses are similar, though generally the accusative case denotes ''direction'' ('I walked ''towards'' the hotel'), while the prepositional case denotes ''location'' ('I stayed ''at'' this hotel').

:I walked towards the hotel - '''Я шла в гостиницу''' - note the use of the accusative ending '''-у'''
:I lived at the hotel - '''Я жила в гостинице''' - note the use of the prepositional ending '''-е'''
:He walked onto the roof - '''Он шёл на крышу'''
:He is on the roof - '''Он на крыше'''

==Nouns==
The accusative case is a peculiar case in Russian, as it makes a distinction that other cases do not. Specifically, if a masculine word denotes an inanimate thing ('table', 'chair', etc), then it remains the same as the nominative. If, however, a masculine word denotes a person or animal ('man', 'son', 'cow', etc), then the case uses the endings of the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|''genitive case'']]. For plurals in the accusative, no matter what gender the word, they are also split: any plural word that's inanimate is identical to its [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative case|nominative plural form]], while animate plural words follow the rules for the genitive plural. Some examples highlighting this distinction are as follows:
:This chair is brown - '''Этот ''стул'' коричневый''' - Nominative of an inanimate noun
:I made a chair - '''Я де́лал ''стул''''' - Accusative of the noun
:This cat likes me - '''''Этот кот'' любит меня''' - Nom. of an animate noun
:I like this cat - '''Я люблю ''этого кота''''' - Acc. of the noun
:These women like me - '''''Эти женщины'' любят меня''' - Nom. of an animate, plural, feminine noun
:I like these women - '''Я люблю ''этих женщин''''' - Acc. of the noun

So, masculine nouns denoting inanimate objects in the accusative case are the same as in the nominative case. If they're animated nouns, they follow the genitive rules, which are: add '''-а''', and replace '''-й''' and '''-ь''' with '''-я'''.

Neuter nouns, regardless of animation, also keep their nominative forms in the accusative case.

Feminine words are the only words to have their own accusative ending: '''-а''' becomes '''-у''', and '''-я''' becomes '''-ю'''. Feminine nouns ending in the soft sign '''-ь''' do not change.

To form the plural of an inanimate word, use the nominative rules: add or replace with '''-ы''' or '''-и''', and neuter nouns change '''-o''' to '''-а''' and '''-e''' to '''-я'''. If the word is animate, regardless of gender, use the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case#Nouns|genitive plural]]: drop '''-а''' and '''-о''', convert or append ending consonants with '''-ов''', '''-ев''', or '''-ей''', and replace '''-я''' with '''-ь''' or '''-й'''.

This summary table splits the masculine and plural forms into to sections, the left being the inanimate form, the right being the animate form.

|}

Examples:
*Dogs don't like cats - '''Собаки ненавидят котов'''
*Cats don't like dogs - '''Коты ненавидят собак'''
*I drove to the museum - '''Я поехал в музей'''

==Adjectives==
Adjectives change to fit the noun they modify, taking on their noun's gender, number, and case. This also includes animation: adjectives modifying inanimate masculine nouns keep their [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative case#Adjectives|nominative form]] ('''ый''', '''ий''', and '''ой'''), while animate masculine adjectives take on their [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case#Adjectives|genitive form]] ('''ого''' and '''его''').

Neuter adjectives also keep their nominative form ('''ое''').

Feminine adjectives in the accusative case have the ending '''-ую''' - this is easy to remember, as it's the two endings of feminine nouns in the accusative.

Plural adjectives take on their nominative form ('''ые''' and '''ие''') when modifying inanimate nouns, and their genitive form ('''ых''' and '''их''') when modifying animate nouns, as you might have guessed.

|}

Examples:
* 1
* 2
* 3

== Personal Pronouns ==
Personal pronouns conjugate as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Nominative !! Accusative
|-
| I/me || Я || Меня
|-
| We/our || Мы || Нас
|-
| You || Ты || Тебя
|-
| You || Вы || Вас
|-
| He/him || Он || Его
|-
| She/her || Она || Её
|-
| It || Оно || Его
|-
| They/them || Они || Их
|}

Notice that the third-person singular masculine and neuter pronouns are the same word, '''его''', and, like the genitive adjectival endings '''-ого''' and '''-его''', are pronounced ''ye-&lt;small&gt;VOH&lt;/small&gt;''. The third-person personal pronouns, '''его, её''', and '''их''', are the same as those in the genitive. Finally, if it's a preposition (i.e., '''в''' + ''acc'' or '''на''' + ''acc'') that calls the accusative, then the three third-person pronouns have the suffix '''н-''': '''Я еду к нему''', 'I'm walking towards him'.

Examples:
* 1
* 2
* 3

==Possessive pronouns==
Possessive pronouns act like adjectives, changing to suit the noun they modify, and thus, in the accusative case, make a distinction between animation. Like before, masculine and plural pronouns are split into inanimate forms on the left, and animate forms on the right.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Masculine
! Feminine !! Neuter
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Plural
|-
| My || Мой || Моего|| мою || Моё || Мои || Моих
|-
| Your &lt;small&gt;''(informal/single)''&lt;/small&gt; || Твой || Твоего ||твою || Твоё || Твои || Твоих
|-
| Our || Наш || Нашего || нашу || Наше || Наши || Наших
|-
| Your &lt;small&gt;''(formal/plural)''&lt;/small&gt; || Ваш || Вашего ||вашу || Ваше || Ваши || Ваших
|}

For the third-person, the masculine and neuter possessive pronouns are the same as the personal pronouns: '''его'''. The feminine is '''её''', and the third-person plural is '''их'''. These do not decline according to the gender or number of the modified noun.

Examples:
:I want his cat - '''Я хочу его кота'''
:I want his cats - '''Я хочу его котов'''

== Prepositions ==
As well as the two major prepositions, '''в''' and '''на''', there are a total of ten prepositions that can call the accusative case: '''в, на, за, под, по, с, про, о''', '''сквозь''', and '''через'''. Мany of these can also call other cases to denote other things.

=== Direction of motion, в, на, за, &amp; под ===
Four prepositions refer to the direction of movement, and generally answer the directional question, '''Куда?''', &quot;Where (are you going)?&quot;. They can also call either the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]] or [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional]] case to answer the location question, '''Где?''', &quot;Where (are you)?&quot;. In depth, these four are:
*'''В''', 'into' - as discussed earlier, this preposition states that something is moving ''into'' something else, such as 'I walk ''into'' the building'. It can also call the prepositional case to say you ''are'' in somewhere, such as 'I'm ''in'' the theatre'.
*'''На''', 'onto' - as discussed earlier, this denotes onto which something is moving, such as 'I'm landing ''onto'' the roof'. Like '''в''', if it calls the prepositional, it states what you ''are'' upon: 'I'm ''on'' the roof'.
*'''За''', 'behind' - this denotes that you are moving to the rear of something, as in 'I'm walking ''behind'' the building'. If it calls the instrumental case, it denotes that you ''are'' behind something, as in 'I'm ''behind'' the building'.
*'''Под''', 'under' - like '''за''', this denotes that you are moving to the underside of something. By calling the instrumental case, it denotes that you ''are'' under something, as in 'I'm ''under'' the bridge'. '''Под''' also has three minor, unrelated uses for which it calls the accusative case: to denote something as being 'designated' for something else ('That bar is designated for celebrities'), to denote something fake ('artificial furniture', '''под обстановку'''), or to denote an approximate time ('around the evening', '''под вечер''')

=== The remaining six: по, s, про, о, сквозь, через ===
The remaining six prepositions operate as follows:
*'''Про''', 'about' - this preposition means 'about', in the same way as '''о''' + ''prep'' does. So, 'Let's talk about me!' can be translated as either, '''Давайте говорить обо мне!''' ('''о''' + ''prep''), or, '''Давайте говорить про меня!''' ('''про''' + ''acc'').
*'''С''', 'about' - this preposition denotes an approximate number, as in 'I stayed there about a week'. When stating specific numbers, such as &quot;I have five apples&quot;, Russians normally say, '''У меня есть пять яблок'''. To approximate the quantity, simply reverse the number and object: &quot;I have about five apples&quot; is '''У меня есть яблок пять'''. However, as Russian omit the word 'one', to say 'about one', you use '''с''' + ''acc'': &quot;I have about one apple&quot; is '''У меня есть с яблоко'''.
*'''По''', 'up to' - this means 'up to' in the context of the extent of an object's involvement, relative to some other object. For example, 'I'm up to my neck in work' is '''Я по шею в работе'''. It is also used in the same way as '''по''' + ''dat'' to denote several verbal objects: &quot;Dad gave the kids two apples each&quot; - '''Папа дал детям по два яблока'''.
*'''О''', 'against' - this means 'against' in a physical sense, such as 'They hit their ball against the tree'. '''О''' + ''prep'' means 'about', in the same way as '''про''' + ''acc''.
*'''Сквозь''', 'through' - this denotes the object through which another passes, as in 'The ball went through the window!'.
*'''Через''', 'through'/'across' - the final preposition has two main meanings. The first is synonymous with '''сквозь''' + ''acc'', meaning 'through', and the second is to move 'across' something, as in 'I walked through the woods' - '''Я шёл через лес'''. The verbal prefix '''пере-''' is synonymous with this preposition, so '''через''' can be omitted when a verb with this prefix is used. For example, both of the following are grammatically correct: 'I crossed the street' - '''Я перешёл через улицу''', '''Я перешёл улицу'''.

Most information on Russian accusative prepositions was derived from [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/prepacc.html here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''prepositional case''' is the sixth and final case in Russian, though due to its relative simplicity it is often learned before the more complex genitive, dative, and instrumental cases.

== Usage ==
Words decline into a case for two broad reasons: because they match that case's primary function (the [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|nominative]] denotes the verbal subject, the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|accusative]] denotes the verbal object, etc), or because they come after a preposition that commands that particular case ('''у''' calls the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive]], '''между''' calls the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]], etc). The prepositional case is so called because it is only ever used after prepositions. Historically, the prepositional case was called the ''locative'' case as it did have a main function, which was to denote the location of something. This use has been taken over by prepositions, so it's name was changed accordingly. However, you may still hear it referred to by it's old name, and some words still bear hallmarks of the old locative case.

=== Prepositions ===

The four prepositions that call this case are '''о/об/обо''' ('about'), '''при''' ('on') '''в''' ('in'), and '''на''' ('on'). Notice that these last two are locative in meaning when they call the prepositional case.

* '''О/об/обо''' means 'about', and denotes the person or thing about which some verb is done ('they were talking about him', '''они говорили о нём''').
::When the following word begins with a vowel, '''о''' becomes '''об''' ('I heard about the bus', '''я послышал об автобусе''').
::Before awkward clusters of consonants, it becomes '''обо''' ('Boris read about me', '''Борис читал обо мне''').
* '''При''' means 'on' or 'on one's person' ('She has an umbrella on her', '''У её есть зонтик при себе'''), and 'during' ('This happened during the reign of Peter I', '''Всё это случилось при Петре первом'''). As you might guess, this preposition is quite rare
* '''В''' means 'in' or 'at', referring to the location of a person or thing ('I'm in Moscow', '''я в Москве'''). 
* '''На''' means 'on' or 'at', and like '''в''' refers to the location of something ('He's on the roof', '''Он на крыше''').

=== At a place ===
The word 'at' is translated using '''в''' + ''prep', '''на''' + ''prep', and '''у''' + ''[[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|gen]]''.

If you wished to say someone or something is at an enclosed building, such as 'He is at the theatre', use '''в''' + ''prep'', as he is ''in'' that particular place: '''Он в театре'''. To say someone or something is at a particular street, such as 'She lives at Tverskaya street', use '''на''' + ''prep'', as she is ''on'' something, rather than in it: '''Она живёт на Тверской улице'''. In general, if the place where someone or something is 'at' is an inanimate structure that humans normally go inside, use '''в''' + ''prep'' (e.g., 'They were at the theatre', 'He was at Moscow for the meeting'), otherwise use '''на''' + ''prep'' (e.g., 'They were at the field'). If the place is ''animate'', instead use '''у''' + ''[[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|gen]]'', meaning 'by someone's place' (e.g., 'They were at Sasha's')

'''В''' and '''на''' can also call the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case#Usage|accusative case]] to refer to the direction towards which something is moving into or onto ('I'm walking ''into'' Moscow', 'He climbed ''onto'' the roof'). As a memory aid, recall that when '''в''' and '''на''' refer to the ''location'' of something, they use the prepositional case, which was once called the ''locative'' case. '''О/об/обо''' calls the accusative to mean 'against' or 'upon' something ('He leant upon the wall').

Examples:
: Let's talk about the weather - '''Дава́йте говори́ть о пого́де'''
: They'll read about [[w:Aeroflot|Aeroflot]] tomorrow - '''Они́ прочита́ют об Аэрофло́те за́втра'''
: She told a story about me - '''Она́ рассказа́ла расска́з обо́ мне'''
: Boris lives in Liverpool - '''Бо́рис живёт в Ливерпул́е'''
: Tatya is at work - '''Та́тя на рабо́те'''

== Nouns ==
Forming the prepositional case is arguably easier than any other case.

=== Singular ===
To form the prepositional case, in general, you add '''е''' (pronounced ''yeh''):
* Masculine and neuter nouns ending in a consonant add '''e''', and nouns ending in '''й''', '''o''', or '''ь''', replace that letter with '''е'''. Nouns ending in '''ий''' instead become '''ии'''.
::About the garden - '''Сад --&gt; Саду'''
::About the train - '''Поезд --&gt; Поезде'''
::About the museum - '''Музей --&gt; Музее'''
::About the letter - '''Письмо - Письме'''
* Feminine nouns ending in '''а''' or '''я''' replace that letter with '''е'''. Those ending in '''ь''' instead replace that letter with '''и'''. Feminine nouns that end in '''ия''' become '''ии'''.
::About the book - '''Книга --&gt; Книге'''
::About the bird - '''Птица --&gt; Птице'''
::About the pig - '''Свинья --&gt; Свинье'''
::About mother - '''Мать --&gt; Матери''' - ''note the addition of '''-ер-''' when '''мать''' declines''
* Neuter nouns ending in '''е''' are unchanged, unless they end in '''ие''', in which case they become '''ии'''. Those that have the exceptional ending '''мя''' become '''ени''' (though this is fortunately quite rare).

Exceptions:
* As you might have guessed from the above, always write '''ии''' instead of '''ие'''
*Some nouns have a stressed '''у''' or '''ю''' after '''в''' + ''prep'' and '''на''' + ''prep'', but not after '''о/об/обо''' + ''prep''. This is the final hallmark of the old locative meaning of this case, as it can be seen as an ending that only occurs after ''locative'' prepositions ('in' and 'on'). See [http://www.study-languages-online.com/grammar_comments/locative-case.html here] for a list of such words.

In general, add or replace with '''е''', but always have '''ии''' instead of '''ие'''.

=== Plural ===
The two plural endings, '''ах''' and '''ях''', follow the same rules as the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|dative]] plurals: after consonants, '''o''', or '''а''', use the ending '''ах'''. If such a noun has an irregular nominative plural ending in '''я''' (e.g., '''друг''' --&gt; '''друзья'''), or if the noun ends in '''ь''', '''й''', '''е''', or '''я''', the ending is '''ях''' (e.g., '''друг''' --&gt; '''друзья''' --&gt; '''друзьях''').
::About the gardens - '''Сад --&gt; Садах
::About the trains - '''Поезд --&gt; Поездах
::About the museums - '''Музей --&gt; Музеях
::About the letters - '''Письмо - Письмах
::About the books - '''Книга --&gt; Книгах
::About the birds - '''Птица --&gt; Птицах
::About the pigs - '''Свинья --&gt; Свиньях
::About the mothers - '''Мать --&gt; Матерях'''

One exception is feminine nouns ending in '''мя''', which instead take the ending '''енах'''. Again, this ending is fortunately quite rare.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! ''Prepositional'' !! Masculine !! Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! Nouns
| е&lt;br&gt;(''ий --&gt; ии'') || е&lt;br&gt;(''ие --&gt; ии'')&lt;br&gt;(''мя --&gt; ени'') || а, я --&gt; е&lt;br&gt;ь --&gt; и&lt;br&gt;(''ия --&gt; ии'') || ах ях&lt;br&gt;(''мя --&gt; енах'')
|}
Rules in italics are rare exceptions to the more general rules.

==Adjectives==
Adjectives modifying masculine or neuter nouns in the prepositional case usually end in '''ом'''. For adjectives with the soft ending ('''ний'''), or for those whose stem ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''), the ending is '''ем'''.

For feminine adjectives, the endings are the same as those in the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive]], [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|dative]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]] cases: '''ой''' or, for those with the soft ending or which end in the 5-letter rule, '''ей'''.

Like nouns, adjectives in the prepositional plural end in &quot;х&quot;, and in fact take the same endings as the genitive plural: '''ых''' or, for those which normally end in '''ий''', '''их'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! ''Prepositional'' !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! Adjectives
| ом ем || ой ей || ых их
|}

: I heard about your beautiful new wife - '''Я слышал о красивой новой жене'''
: They're talking about those old Russian cars in the big red garage - '''Они говорят об этих старых русских машинах в большом красном гараже'''

== Pronouns ==
=== Personal ===
The possessive pronouns in the prepositional case are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Мне || Нас
|-
! Second person
| Тебе́ || Вас
|-
! Third Person
| Нём/Ней || Них
|}
The third person singular personal pronoun '''нём'''  is masculine and neuter, and '''ней''' is feminine.

===Possessive===
The possessive pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! My
| Moём || Мое́й || Мои́х
|-
! Our
| На́шем || На́шей || На́ших
|-
! Your (sg., informal)
| Твоём || Твое́й || Твои́х
|-
! Your (pl., formal)
| Ва́шем || Ва́шей || Ва́ших
|}

As ever, possessive pronouns conjugate almost exactly like adjectives. The possessive pronouns in the third person are '''его''' for masculine and neuter owners ('his' and 'its), '''её''' for feminine owners ('her'), and '''их''' for plural owners ('their'). These are the same in all cases.

Examples:
: I am reading about them - '''Я чита́ю о них'''
: I am reading about their children - '''Я чита́ю о их де́тях'''

=== This and that ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! About this
| Э́том || Э́той || Э́тих
|-
! About that
| Том || Той || Тех
|}

Remember that '''о''' ('about') becomes '''об''' before the vowel '''э'''.

It may seem strange to have a section devoted to analog filter design in a digital signal processing book. However, there is a method to the madness. It turns out that digital filters can be modeled using analog filters, and analog techniques--which have been studied in depth for many years prior to digital systems--can be utilized to quickly and efficiently design digital filters. 

The following chapters will show some of the techniques involved in designing analog filters, and transforming analog filters from one type to another. The section will culminate on a chapter on the bilinear transform, which transforms the mathematical representation for an analog filter into the equations for an equivalent digital filter.

== Analog Design Process ==

Digital filters can be designed using analog design methods by following these steps:

#Filter specifications are specified in the digital domain. The filter type (highpass, lowpass, etc.) is specified.
#An equivalent lowpass filter is designed that meets these specifications.
#The analog lowpass filter is transformed using '''spectral transformations''' into the correct type of filter.
#The analog filter is transformed into a digital filter using a particular mapping.

There are many different types of spectral transformations and there are many mappings from analog to digital filters. the most famous mapping is known as the '''bilinear transform''', and we will discuss that in a different chapter.

== Butterworth ==
Butterworth ensures a flat response in the passband and an adequate rate of rolloff. A good &quot;all rounder,&quot; the Butterworth filter is simple to understand and suitable for applications such as audio processing.

== Chebyshev I ==

The Chebyshev 1 filter has ripple in the passband of the filter.

== Chebyshev II ==

Chebyshev 2 has ripple in the stopband.

== Elliptic ==

This filter has equiripple (the same amount of ripple in the passband and stopband).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The genitive case has four main uses: to denote possession ('Michael's car', meaning 'the car of Michael'), to denote number ('five apples'), in negative constructions ('there are no books'), and after several important prepositions ('without me').

== Usage ==
The genitive case is the third most commonly used case, after the nominative and accusative, and has four main uses.

=== Counting ===
When denoting how many of something you have, we usually place the object in question in the genitive case. However, Russian has some key differences to English:
* If there is 1, 21, 31, 41, etc, of something, they go in the ''nominative singular'':
:There is one cat - '''Есть оди́н кот'''
:He knows 21 words - '''Он зна́ет два́дцать одно́ сло́во'''
* If there is 2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34, etc, of something, use the ''genitive singular'':
:Two roubles - '''Два рубля́'''
:22 kopecks - '''Два́дцать две копе́йки'''
* If there is 5 to 19, 25 to 29, 35 to 39, etc, or something, use the ''genitive plural'':
:Five roubles - '''Пять рубле́й'''
:25 kopecks - '''Два́дцать пять копе́ек'''
&lt;br&gt;
There are also other quantity words that take the genitive, either singular or plural according to meaning:
*'''Мно́го''' - a lot, many, much,
*'''Не́сколько''' - a few, not many
*'''Ма́ло''' - few, little
*'''Ско́лько''' - how much? How many?
Examples:
:Few beers - '''Ма́ло пива'''
:A few months - '''Не́сколько ме́сяцев'''
:A lot of money - '''Мно́го де́нег'''
:Many apples - '''Мно́го я́блок'''
:How many pounds? - '''Ско́лько фунтов?'''

The effective difference between '''не́сколько''' and '''ма́ло''' is like that between 'a few' and 'few' - one denotes a quantity that is just enough ('I have a few friends here'), while the other denotes an insufficient quantity ('I have few friends here'). That said, though, they are largely interchangeable.

=== Possession and Negation ===
To denote something as belonging to something else, you place the owner in the genitive case:
:This is David's house - '''Э́то - дом Давида'''
:This is Ivan's brother - '''Э́то - брат Ива́на'''
Note that (unlike English'' 's'' forms and Russian possessive adjectives and pronouns) Russian possessive genitives are usually ''postpositional''.

Another use of the genitive is in the phrase &quot;I have...&quot;. Though Russian does have the verb 'to have' ('''иметь'''), it is rarely used. Instead, Russians use the following construction to say &quot;I have X&quot;: '''У меня есть Х'''.
This literally means, 'By me exists X'. Since the preposition '''у''' calls the genitive case, the person or thing that has the object in question is placed in the genitive. The thing that is possessed remains in the nominative: '''У''' + ''gen'' + '''есть''' + ''nom''
To turn this into a question, place an inflection on '''есть''', just as you place an inflection on the verb in a normal question.
:Do you have a son? - '''У вас есть сын?'''
:Yes, I have a son - '''Да, у меня есть сын.'''
:Yes, I do - '''Да, есть.'''

'''Есть''' on its own can also be used on its own to say 'There is...', 'There are...', or 'There exists...'. It is followed by the nominative case:
:There are Frenchmen on this street - '''На э́той у́лице есть францу́зы'''
:There are old buildings in Moscow - '''В Москве́ есть ста́рые зда́ния'''

Conversely, to say 'There isn't...', 'There aren't...', we use the word '''нет''' followed by the genitive case. Note that this use of the word '''нет''' is quite different from its usual meaning of 'no', and is closer to its original meaning as a contraction of '''не есть'''.
:There are no restaurants - '''Нет рестора́нов'''
:There are no old buildings in Moscow - '''В Москве́ нет ста́рых зда́ний'''

So, combining the above, to say 'I ''don't'' have...' is constructed as ''''У меня нет...'''', followed by the ''genitive'' case.
:Do you have a son? - '''У вас есть сын?'''
:No, I don't have a son - '''У меня́ нет сы́на'''
:My brother doesn't have any money - '''У моего́ бра́та нет де́нег'''

=== Prepositions ===
We've already seen how '''у''' commands the genitive case to roughly mean 'by', but many more prepositions use the genitive. The four most common, including '''у''', are:
*'''Для''' - for, for the benefit of
:I want a present for my friend - '''Я хочу́ пода́рок для моего́ дру́га'''
:He did this for her - '''Он э́то сде́лал для неё'''
*'''У''' - by, near
:I live near your house - '''Я живу́ у ва́шего до́ма'''
:Your husband has one friend - '''У твоего́ му́жа есть оди́н друг'''
*'''Без''' - without
:He will drive without you - '''Он пое́дет без тебя́'''
:Black coffee - '''Ко́фе без молока́'''
*'''Из''' - from, out of (the opposite of '''в''' + ''acc'', 'into')
:I'm from England - '''Я из А́нглии'''
:She's arrived from work - '''Она́ пришла́ с рабо́ты'''

== Nouns ==
=== Singular ===
Masculine and neuter nouns follow the same rules for forming the genitive case:
* Replace a consonant or '''-o''' with '''-a'''.
* Replace '''-й''', '''-ь''', and '''-е''' with '''-я'''.

Notice that these are the same rules for masculine animate nouns in the accusative case. Similarly, feminine nouns use the same rules as the nominative plural:
* Replace '''-a''' with '''-ы'''.
* Replace '''-я''' and '''-ь''' with '''-и'''.
* If '''-а''' is preceded by one of the 'seven consonants', replace it instead with a '''-и'''.

=== Plural ===
The genitive plural is by far the most complicated ending in Russian, and is also the one with the most exceptions. However, as these rules are also the same for the accusative plural of animate nouns, they are also very commonly used:
* Masculine nouns ending in a consonant add '''-ов''' in the genitive plural.
:Table, five tables - '''Стол, пять столов'''
* Nouns ending in '''ц''' add '''-ев''', and '''-й''' is replaced by '''-ев'''.
:Museum, six museums - '''Музе́й, шесть музе́ев'''
* Nouns ending in '''-е''', '''-ь''', or one of 'hushes' ('''-ш''', '''-щ''', '''-ж''', '''-ч''') add '''-ей'''.
:Thing, ten things - '''Вещь, десять веще́й'''
* Feminine nouns ending in a consonant and '''-я''' replace the '''-я''' with '''-ь'''. If they end in a vowel and '''-я''', replace the '''-я''' with '''-й'''.
:Week, seven weeks - '''Неде́ля, семь неде́ль'''
* Feminine nouns lose their '''-a''', and neuter nouns lose their '''-o'''.
:Book, eight books - '''Кни́га, во́семь книг'''

In the case of awkward consonant clusters from dropping end vowels, it is common for '''o''' or '''e''' to be added between the consonants: '''марка''' - '''марок''', '''англичанка''' - '''англичанок'''.

==Adjectives==
=== Usage ===
Adjectives take the number, gender, and case of the noun they modify. However, there is a peculiarity in Russian when counting: though we use the genitive singular on nouns that are numbered 2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, etc, we use the genitive ''plural'' for any adjectives attached to that noun:
:Three bookshops - '''Три кни́жных магази́на'''
:Five bookshops - '''Пять книжных магази́нов'''
:He knows 102 Russian words - '''Он зна́ет сто два ру́сских сло́ва'''
:He knows 106 Russian words - '''Он зна́ет сто шесть ру́сских слов'''

=== Conjugation ===
Like nouns, masculine and neuter adjectives have the same ending in the genitive singular, '''-ого''', pronounced 'oh-vo'. If the adjectival stem ends in '''ж''', '''ч''', '''ш''', '''щ''', or '''ц''', the ending is '''-его''', pronounced 'ye-vo'. Notice that this is the same ending for masculine animate adjectives in the accusative case.
Similarly, feminine adjectives in the genitive case have the same ending as the prepositional case: '''-ой''', or, after the same five 'hush' consonants, '''-ей'''.
:A kilogram of good Russian cheese - '''Кило́ хоро́шего ру́сского сы́ра'''
:A kilogram of good Russian sausage - '''Кило́ хоро́шей ру́сской колбасы́'''

To form the plural, the ending for all genders is simply '''-ых''', or, if the stem ends in '''к, г, х, ш, щ, ж''', or '''ч''', the ending is '''-их''',
:A kilogram of clean fresh apples - '''Кило́ чи́стых све́жих я́блок'''

== Personal Pronouns==
To use personal pronouns refer to the following table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''English''' || I || We || You || You || He/she/it|| They
|-
! '''Nominative'''
| Я || Мы || Ты || Вы || Он/она/оно || Они
|-
! '''Genitive'''
| Меня́ || Нас || Тебя́ || Вас || Его́/её || Их
|}

Notice that the genitive for 'of him' and 'of it' are the same: '''его́'''. Also, when the genitive is called by a preposition, '''его''', '''её''', and '''их''' have an '''н''' preceding them:
:For him/it - '''Для него́'''
:Without her - '''Без неё'''

Other pronouns are conjugated as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Of this &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of that &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of all &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of one's own &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of what? || Of whom?
|-
| Э́того́ / э́той / э́тих || Того́ / той / тех || Всего́ / всей / всех || Своего́ / своей / своих || Чего || Кого
|}

Notice that, where available, variants of a word in the genitive are given in the order masculine/neuter, then feminine, and then plural.

==Possessive Pronouns==
Like personal pronouns, refer to this table for the possessive pronouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! of my
| '''Моего́
| '''Мое́й || '''Мои́х 
|-
! of our
| '''На́шего || '''На́шей || '''На́ших
|-
! of your
| '''Твоего́ || '''Твое́й || '''Твои́х
|-
! of your
| '''Ва́шего || '''Ва́шей || '''Ва́ших
|}

As ever, possessive pronouns conjugate almost exactly like adjectives. For third person possessive pronouns (of his, of her, of its, of their), use '''его''', '''её''', or '''их''', regardless of the gender of the modified noun.

Examples:
:The roof of my house - '''Крыша моего дома'''
:The brother of his uncle - '''Брат его дяди'''
:The sister of his aunt - '''Сестра́ его тёти'''
:The brother of my wife - '''брат моей жены'''
:The wife of my brother - '''жена моего брата'''
:My brother is older than your sister - '''Мой брат старше твоей сестры'''
:Without his chair - '''Без его сту́ла'''
:Without his letter - '''Без его письма́'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''dative case''' is traditionally the third grammatical case, and denotes the indrect object of a verb. This page asssumes some familiarity with [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|verbal aspect]] and the [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|case system]].

== Usage ==
Remember that verbs generally have a subject and an object: the person or thing that performs the verb (the subject: &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''He'' is reading a book'), and the person or thing being verbed (the object: 'He is reading ''a book''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Just as the subject of a verb is in the nominative case, and the object of the verb is in the accusative case, there can be an ''indirect'' object of the verb that goes in the ''dative'' case.

The indirect object refers to objects called by the verb that are not being directly verbed themselves. For example, 'I wrote a letter to you' - 'I' is the subject, 'a letter' is the object, and 'to you' is the indirect object. Thus, in Russian, instead of saying 'to you', they say the word 'you' in it's dative form: '''Я пишу письмо ''вам'''''. There are many common verbs that can have an indirect object, and most correspond with the English use of the word 'to':
: To speak to... - '''Говорить/сказать''' + ''dat''
: To relate, tell to... - '''Рассказывать/рассказать''' + ''dat''
: To telephone (to)... - '''Звонить/позвонить''' + ''dat''
: To answer, reply to... - '''Отвечать/ответить''' + ''dat''
: To show (to)... - '''Показывать/показать''' + ''dat''
: To give (to)... - '''Давать/дать''' + ''dat''
Some of these verbs don't use 'to' in English (e.g., 'I'll ring you' is, in Russian, is 'I'll ring ''to'' you'), while others can either use it or omit it (e.g., we can say both 'Give it to him' and 'Give him it'). In general, the object given or spoken about is in the accusative, while the person to whom the object is given or spoken about is in the dative case.

=== To give, давать/дать ===
One important verb that calls the dative is давать/дать, 'to give'. It is irregular, and conjugates as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
!  rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| !! rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|  !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Давать (''imperf.'') !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Дать (''pf.'')
|-
! sing. !! pl. !! sing. !! pl.
|-
! rowspan=&quot;3&quot;| Non-past !! First person
| я даю || мы даём || я дам || мы дадим
|-
! Second person 
| ты даёшь || вы даёте || ты дашь || вы дадите
|-
! Third Person 
| он даёт || они дают || он даст || они дадут
|-
! rowspan=&quot;4&quot;| Past !! Masculine 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | давал || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | дал
|-

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | давала || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | дала
|-

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | давало || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | дало
|-
! Plural
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | давали || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | дали
|}

=== Prepositions ===
Like other cases, there are prepositions that require the following phrase to be place in the dative case. The two main prepositions are '''к(о)''' ('to', 'towards') and '''по''' ('along'). Of all Russian prepositions, '''по''' is the vaguest: it can call three difference cases as a preposition, it's commonly seen as a prefix in the perfective [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|aspect of verbs]], and has seven broad categories of meaning when it calls the dative case:
* '''Motion on/along/across a surface''' - the most common meaning is movement across (e.g., crossing the road), or along (e.g., walking along the street), or about (i.e., moving all around the entirety of a surface), or otherwise moving in some fashion on top of some surface.
:: We drove &lt;u&gt;along&lt;/u&gt; the street - '''Мы поехали по улице'''
:: To travel &lt;u&gt;about&lt;/u&gt; Russia - '''Ездить по России'''
:: Housework (work about the house) - '''Работа по дому''' - ''notice that 'about a surface' can be interpreted quite loosely, and can lead to idioms such as this.''
* '''Activity in identical places/times''' - some activity or verb is occurring in multiple instances of a place or time. Places visited multiple times, or things done at multiple times, use '''по'''.
:: She went &lt;u&gt;around to&lt;/u&gt; many shops - '''Она шла по многим магазинам'''
:: She runs &lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt; the evenings - '''Она бегает по вечерам'''
:: They meet every friday - '''Они встречаются по пятницам'''
* '''Uniform distribution''' - commonly translated as 'apiece' or 'per', this use of '''по''' is used to denote a singular noun as being distributed one apiece. For example, in the sentence, 'He gave his boys one apple each', we could say '''по яблоку''' to mean 'one apple each'. If there are multiple objects being given out,  (e.g., 'five apples each'), use '''по''' and the ''accusative'' case.
:: He gave his boys one apple each - '''Он дал его детям по яблоку''' - one item each, so '''по''' + ''dat''; note that the dative is also used for 'his kids'.
:: He gave his boys two apples each - '''Он дал его детям по два яблока''' - two items each, so '''по''' + ''acc''.
* '''The thing struck''' - primarily used with the verb '''бить/побить''' ('to beat/strike'), this denotes something as being struck or hit or beat.
:: He hit &lt;u&gt;the table&lt;/u&gt; with his shoe - '''Он бил ботинком по столу'''
:: Rain drummed &lt;u&gt;against&lt;/u&gt; the window - '''Дождь барабанил по окну'''
* '''Reason or cause of''' - the reason or cause of some event can be denoted using '''по''' and the dative case.
:: The woman drank the poison &lt;u&gt;by mistake&lt;/u&gt; - '''Женщина выпила яд по ошибке'''
* '''Your specialisation''' - the trade or subject you specialise in, particularly with work, school, exams, etc. This typically translates as 'in'.
:: Russian exam (exam &lt;u&gt;in Russian&lt;/u&gt;) - '''экзамен по русскому языку'''
:: in my opinion (colloquially, 'in my') - '''По моему мнению ('по-моему')'''
* '''In accordance with''' - this usage denotes one thing as being in line with, or in accord with, or in accordance with, another thing, such as a plane flying &lt;u&gt;to&lt;/u&gt; schedule.
:: The plane flew according to plan - '''Самолёт летал по плану'''

'''По''' can also be used with the accusative case (meaning 'up to' or 'till', or, as discussed above, 'apiece'), and with the prepositional case (meaning 'after' or 'for'). '''К''' is relatively simpler, referring to or gesturing at the direction something is located.

== Nouns ==
To decline masculine and neuter nouns into the dative case, replace the ending '''o''' with '''у''', add '''у''' to a consonant, or replace '''й, е''', or '''ь''' with a '''ю'''. Feminine nouns decline exactly as in the prepositional case: '''а''' and '''я''' become '''е''', while '''ь''' becomes '''и'''.

The dative plural is formed using the same rules that govern the instrumental and prepositional plural, albeit with slightly different endings: all nouns which end in a consonant, an '''а''', or an '''о''', the plural ending is '''-ам'''. As a memory aid, try to link the '''a''' and '''ам'''. For those that end in a '''й''', a '''я''', or a '''е''', ''and'' any noun with an irregular nominative plural ending in '''-я''', the ending is '''-ям'''. Again, try to link the '''я''' and the '''ям'''.

|-
!  !! Masculine !! Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! Dative
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''у/ю''' || '''е/и''' || '''ам/ям'''
|}
Examples:
: The pen moved across the letter - '''Ручка пошла по письму'''
: Why did he tell it to the policeman? - '''Почему он сказал это полицейскому?'''
: She gave money to the museum - '''Она дала деньги музею'''
: The ship travelled about the sea - '''Судно шлo по морю'''
: Sasha is walking towards the school - '''Саша идёт к школе'''
: 
: 
:
: Boris won, thanks to his friends - Борис побеждал благодаря его друзьям

==Adjectives==
Adjectives modifying masculine or neuter nouns in the dative case have the ending '''-ому'''. If they end in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж''', or '''ц''') or have the soft ending (-'''ний'''), their dative ending is '''-ему'''. Feminine adjectives have '''-ой''' or, after the 5-letter rule or soft ending, '''-ей'''. Essentially, these are the same as e prepositional endings, with masculine and neuter adjectives having an extra '''-у''' - the same ending most masculine and neuter nouns get.

To form the dative plural, the ending is '''-ым''' or, after the soft ending or the 7-letter rule ('''к, г, х, ш, щ, ч''', or '''ж'''), '''-им'''.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
!  !! Masculine !! Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
| Dative || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ому/ему || ой/ей || ым/им
|}

: She spoke to his good friend Sasha - '''Она сказала его хорошему другу Саше'''
: Tanya will give the presents to the nice Russian man  - '''Таня даст подарки симпатичному русскому человеку'''
: They travelled across the large country - '''Они поехали по большей стране'''

== Pronouns==
===Personal===
The possessive pronouns in the dative case are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Мне || Нам
|-
! Second person
| Тебе || Вам
|-
! Third Person
| Ему/ей || Им
|}
The third person singular personal pronoun '''ему'''  is masculine and neuter, and '''ей''' is feminine.

===Possessive===
The possessive pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! to my
| Моему
| Мое́й || Мои́м
|-
! to our
| На́шему || На́шей || На́шим
|-
! to your
| Твоему || Твое́й || Твои́м
|-
! to your
| Ва́шему || Ва́шей || Ва́шим
|}

As ever, possessive pronouns conjugate almost exactly like adjectives. The third person pronouns are '''его''' for masculine and neuter owners, '''её''' for feminine owners, and '''им''' for plural owners. These are the same in all cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The instrumental case is traditionally taught as the fourth case in Russian. It typically denotes an object as being the means by which some action is carried out (e.g., I ate ''with a fork'').

== Usage ==
The instrumental case is used to denote the means by which some actions is carried out. In the phrase, 'Boris wrote a letter to school with a pencil', there are four items:
# 'Boris' is the person who is doing, or did, or will do, the verb, so he is the ''subject'' of the verb. Thus, the word '''Бори́с''' is in its nominative form.
# 'A letter' is the thing that's being verbed, the ''direct object'' of the verb. Thus, the word '''письмо''' is in its accusative form.
# 'To school' is the thing that's being indirectly verbed, so it's the ''indirect'' object of the verb. Thus, the word '''школа''' is in its dative form, '''школе''', and means 'to school'.
# 'With a pencil' is the thing that allows the verb to be done, or is the means by which it is done. Thus, the word '''карандаш''' is in its instrumental form, '''карандашо́м''', and means 'with a pencil'
# Finally, the complete sentence is: '''Борис писал письмо школе карандашом'''. Notice that the words 'a', 'to', 'with', etc, are omitted in Russian and instead controlled by grammatical endings.

So the instrumental case is so called because it denotes the instrument by which some task is carried out, and this is its primary meaning. Thus, a word in the instrumental case can be translated by adding the words 'with' or 'by'.

Like the other cases, there are prepositions which can place whatever comes after them in the instrumental case. There are six in total: '''С(о), над, под, за, перед''', and '''между'''.
*'''C(o)''' + ''inst'' means 'with'. This may be confusing, as the primary meaning of the instrumental case on its own is also 'with'. There are two concepts that are both conveyed by the English word 'with', but are conveyed separately in Russian. 'With', as in 'by means of' ('He built it with his hands') is conveyed by the instrumental case on its own ('his hands' in their inst. form). 'With', as in 'accompanied with' ('He built it with her') is conveyed by '''''c(o)''''' followed by the instrumental case ('with her' is '''c''' + ''inst.''). It can also be used to denote the manner in which something is done ('He built it with ease'). In both of these uses, '''c(o)''' ''inst'' is the antonym of '''без''' + ''gen'' ('without').
*'''Над''' means 'over' or 'above', and '''под''' means 'under' or 'beneath'. '''Под''' + ''inst'' means 'under' if there is no motion involved - if there's motion, use '''под''' + [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|''acc'']] instead ('The book is under the bed' - no movement, 'The book slid under the bed' - movement). '''Под''' + ''inst'' can also mean 'physically near', and '''под''' + ''acc'' can mean 'temporally near' or 'near in time' ('They live ''near'' the city' - physically near).
*'''Перед''' means 'before' or 'in front of' in terms of positioning, and can also indicate responsibility ('The dog is in front of the house', 'The dog walked in front of the house', 'the family has a responsibility ''to'' the dog').
*'''Между''' means 'between' or 'among', similar to '''среди''' + ''gen'', 'among' (e.g., 'He stood between them').
*'''За''' generally means 'behind' or 'beyond', but has a few nuances to it. Like '''под''', when no motion is involved, the instrumental case is used. When motion ''is'' involved, however, the accusative case is used ('It's behind the house' - '''под''' + ''inst'', 'It went behind the house' - '''под''' + ''acc'').

== Nouns ==
Nouns in the instrumental case decline unusually compared to other cases, using rules that aren't found elsewhere. While not as complex as the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive plural]], it still warrents extra attention.

=== Singular ===
* Nouns ending in '''о''' or a consonant have '''-ом''' in the instrumental. However, if this ending syllable is both a) unstressed, and b) preceded by the five-letter rule ('''ч, ж, ш, щ, ц'''), then the ending becomes '''-ем'''.
:: Train - '''поезд''' --&gt; '''поездом'''
:: Morning - '''утро''' --&gt; '''утром'''
:: Pencil - '''карандаш''' --&gt; '''карандашом''' - ''ends in '''ш''', but ending syllable is stressed''
:: Husband - '''муж''' - '''мужем''' - ''ends in '''ж''' and is unstressed''
* Nouns ending in '''й''', '''е''', or '''ь''', have the ending '''-ем'''. If this ending is stressed, it becomes '''-ём'''. This applies mainly to masculine and neuter nouns; See below for feminine nouns ending in '''ь'''.
:: Museum - '''музей''' --&gt; '''музеем'''
:: Sea - '''море''' --&gt; '''морем'''
:: Dictionary - '''словарь''' --&gt; '''словарём''' - ''ending is stressed''
:: Day - '''день''' --&gt; '''днём''' - '''''e''' is a fleeting vowel, so vanishes when the word declines''
* Those ending in '''а''' of any gender have '''-ой'''. As above, if the ending is both unstressed and ends in the five-letter rule, the ending becomes '''-ей'''.
:: Book - '''книга''' --&gt; '''книгой'''
:: Newspaper - '''газета''' --&gt; '''газетой'''
:: Arm/hand - '''Рука''' --&gt; '''Рукой'''
:: Chicken - '''курица''' --&gt; '''курицей''' - ''untressed ending and stem ends in '''ц'''''
:: Pear - '''груша''' --&gt; '''грушей''' - ''unstressed ending and stem ends in '''ш'''''
* The ending '''я''' of any gender becomes '''-ей'''. If stressed, it becomes '''-ёй'''.
:: Week - '''неделя''' --&gt; '''неделей'''
:: Surname - '''фамилия''' --&gt; '''фамилией'''
:: Pig - '''свинья''' --&gt; '''свиньёй''' - ''stress on end syllable''
* Feminine nouns ending in '''ь''' have '''-ью''' in the instrumental.
:: Square - '''площадь''' --&gt; '''площадью'''
:: Horse - '''лошадь''' --&gt; '''лошадью'''
:: Church - '''церковь''' --&gt; '''церковью'''
So masculine and neuter nouns have the endings '''ом''', '''ем''', or '''ём''', and feminine nouns have '''ой''', '''ей''', '''ёй''', or '''ью'''.

=== Plural ===
There are two general endings for the instrumental plural: '''ами''' and '''ями'''. If the noun ends in a consonant, '''й''', '''о''', or '''а''', the ending is '''ами'''. However, if such a noun has an irregular nominative plural that ends in '''я''', use '''ями''' instead. If the noun ends in '''ь''', '''е''', or '''я''', use '''ями'''. In the following examples, the first word is the nom. sing., the last is the inst. pl., and the middle word (if one is given) is the nom. pl.:
: House - '''дом''' --&gt; '''домами'''
: Book - '''книга''' --&gt; '''книгами'''
: Letter - '''письмо''' --&gt; '''письмами'''
: Day - '''день''' --&gt; '''днями'''
: Pig - ''' свинья ''' --&gt; '''свиньями'''
: Sea - '''море''' --&gt; '''морями'''
: Brother - '''брат''' --&gt; '''братья''' --&gt; '''братьями''' - ''note the irregular nominative plural''
: Friend - '''друг''' --&gt; '''друзья''' --&gt; '''друзьями''' - ''note the irregular nominative plural''

There are three words which have the irregular instrumental plural ending '''ьми''',  (the three words given are the nom. sing., the nom. pl., and the inst. pl.):
: Daughter - '''дочь''' --&gt; '''дочери''' --&gt; '''дочерьми'''
: Child - '''ребёнок''' --&gt; '''дети''' --&gt; '''детьми'''
: Person - '''человек''' --&gt; '''люди''' --&gt; '''людьми'''

== Adjectives ==
Adjectives modifying masculine or neuter nouns in the instrumental case have two endings: adjectives which have the default ending '''ый''' or '''ой''' have the instrumental ending '''ым''', and those which end in '''ий''' have '''им'''. Feminine adjectives have the same endings as the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive]], [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|dative]] cases: '''ой''', or, if the adjective's stem ends in the five letter rule ('''ц, ш, щ, ч, ж''') or it has the soft ending ('''ний'''), the ending is '''ей'''.

The plural ending is '''ыми'''. For adjectives that end in '''ий''', the ending is '''ими'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

Digital Signal Processing units, on first glance, are very similar to other programmable microprocessors, microcontrollers, and FPGAs. However, DSP chips frequently have certain features and limitations involved that other categories of chips don't have. This chapter will attempt to explain, in broad language-neutral terms, some of the issues involved with DSP programming.

== Saturation Arithmetic ==

Intel-compatible microprocessors, something that most programmers are familiar with, have several features that people have come to expect from programmable chips. In particular, Intel-compatible chips have an arithmetic mode known as &quot;Roll-Over Arithmetic&quot;, also called modular arithmetic. Let's say that we have the integer number 250 (decimal) stored in a byte-sized register. If we add 10 to that number, the processor will overflow, and will roll-over the answer, giving us the answer 4. However, DSP chips frequently do not roll-over, and instead '''saturate''' to the maximum value. 

Let's say we are processing a grayscale image. This image has byte-sized integer values of white/black value as such: Pure white is 255, and pure black is 0. Now, let's say we want to &quot;brighten&quot; every pixel by 10 points, to improve visibility. So we create a loop, and we go through each pixel in the image, adding 10 to the value at any particular point. But what happens if we add 10 to a pixel that is already pure white? In a regular Intel-compatible chip, the value 255 + 10 = 9. In effect, if we make the white pixels brighter, we are turning them black! now, to avoid this, DSP chips saturate, and will go up to the highest value (255), and won't roll over. So, on a DSP chip, white can't get any whiter. Here are some examples (using unsigned bytes):

:&lt;math&gt;255 + 10 = 255&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0 - 10 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) ==

In difference equations, we have seen that multiply and addition operations are the most common. Let's look at a general example:

:&lt;math&gt;A x_n + B x_{n-1} + C x_{n-2} + D x_{n-3} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we notice that each element in this equation is multiplied by a coefficient, and added to the total. DSP engineers have noticed this pattern, and have optimized DSP chips to be able multiply and add very quickly (at the expense of other operations missing or slow). In fact, many DSP chips will have instructions known as '''multiply and accumulate''', which will perform both operations simultaneously, much quicker than a normal processor could do.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Are you learning Russian to &quot;get by&quot; on a one-week business trip to Moscow? Or do you want to learn &quot;good Russian&quot;? 

Russians will love you if you speak &quot;good Russian.&quot; Educated Russians are extremely proud of their grammar skills, and rightly so. Russian grammar is unbelievably complex. The Russian word for &quot;good&quot; sounds like &quot;horror show,&quot; and if you want to learn &quot;horror show Russki&quot; (good Russian) prepare for some scary stuff!

If you learn Russian grammar, you'll see how precise a language can be, and how imprecise English is in comparison. English is full of useless little words such as &quot;a,&quot; &quot;an,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; &quot;this,&quot; &quot;that,&quot; etc. These words add no meaning to sentences, they just make sentences &quot;sound right.&quot; English also conveys meaning via word order and context. Russian words communicate meaning so clearly that the order of the words can be mixed up. For example, in Russian you can say &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot; or &quot;Lunch eats Bob&quot; and there's no doubt that Bob is doing the eating. 

Pronouns (&quot;I,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; &quot;they,&quot; etc.) are built into verbs, so Russians often drop pronouns without losing clarity. Thus Russian sentences are typically shorter and less ambiguous than English. The price you pay for this efficient, precise language is far more demanding grammar.

But to &quot;get by&quot; you need only basic grammar, but not the byzantine grammar of &quot;good Russian.&quot; You could treat all nouns as if they were masculine, and all verbs as if you are the person doing the action, and Russians would usually understand your meaning. But you should read over the many grammar rules so that you have a clue what Russians are saying. E.g., you should be able to recognize when a Russian uses the prepositional case, even if you only use the nominative case.

Native speakers learn grammar as children by listening to adults talk, and by being corrected by their parents. A child who reads a lot and whose parents speak correctly doesn't need to learn grammar rules. As an adult learning Russian, you'll learn best if a native Russian listens to you and corrects your mistakes. But the grammar rules will act as shortcuts, to help you learn faster.

In learning some people are auditory learners, some are visual, and some are movement learners. (See ISBN 1573240648 &quot;The Open Mind&quot; by Dawna Markova, for more about this.) But all three learning styles are needed for organizing and committing to long-term memory. You may prefer to hear spoken Russian, or see written Russian, or (for movement learners) write a Russian word and then write how it sounds in English. You may need to do an activity, such as cooking dinner, to pay attention. But all of us need to do all of these things to learn well.

      <comment>/* Possessive */ Моё платье is neuter?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronouns are words which take the place of nouns (compare &quot;Your husband drove to Florida&quot; with &quot;He drove to Florida&quot;), which denote ownership (&quot;My cat&quot;, &quot;Your cat&quot;, etc), or which replace nouns with questions (compare &quot;He drove&quot; with &quot;Who drove?&quot;, &quot;What drove?&quot;, and &quot;What drove?&quot;). Russian has six categories of pronouns, the three most common of which are detailed further on their own pages: Personal, Possessive, Interrogative, Demonstrative, Reflexive, and Determinative. In Russian, the pronouns change according to the gender of the  noun.

== Formality ==
While most pronouns can be used just as they would in English, there's an important facet to them that English doesn't have: formality.

In English, there are two first-person personal pronouns, 'I' and 'we', four third-person pronouns, the singular ('he, 'she', and 'it') and the plural ('they'), and a single second-person pronoun, 'you'. That English has only one second-person personal pronoun, is a peculiarity of our language. In Russian, and indeed in most other languages, there is a distinction between two forms of 'you'.

Like first- and third-person pronouns, second-person pronouns have a singular and a plural form. To say 'you' and mean one person, say '''ты''' (''ti''). To refer to more than one person, use '''вы''' (''vi'').  However, if you want to show respect, such as to a teacher or elder, or the person is someone you don't know, use '''вы''' instead of '''ты'''.
:Where are you, brother? - '''Где ты, брат?''' - Notice the singular form '''ты'''
:Where are you, teacher? - '''Где вы, учительница?''' - Notice the plural form '''вы'''

Interestingly, though English lost its second-person plural pronoun, some dialects have recreated it: Southern US English uses 'y'all' to refer to just that: 'you all'. But this isn't just a contraction, as it's used in a pronoun in its own right, giving us constructions like: &quot;I want to talk to all y'all&quot;.

It is important to at least grasp this distinction, as it becomes important when learning about [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs|verbs]]: verbs have ''six'' basic forms of conjugation, one for each type of pronoun (1st/2nd/3rd person, and singular/plural).

== [[Russian/Personal Pronouns|Personal]] ==
Broadly speaking, sentences involve three people: the person speaking, the person being spoken to, and someone else not involved in the conversation. The person speaking is known as the 'first person' (think of ''first-person games'' that are viewed through the eyes of the player), the person spoken to is the 'second person', and the other person is the 'third person'. Each 'person' can be referred to as either singular ('I', 'he') or plural ('we', 'they'). Finally, note that third-person singular pronoun comes in three varieties that vary with gender: 'he', 'she', and 'it'. Russian pronouns are generally used the same as in English, with the exception of the above distinction between formal and informal 'you':
:I see  - '''Я ви́жу''' - ''ya &lt;small&gt;VEE&lt;/small&gt;-zhoo''
:We see - '''Мы ви́дим''' - ''mi &lt;small&gt;VEE&lt;/small&gt;-deem
:You speak (sing. informal) - '''Tы говори́шь''' - ''ti ga-vo-&lt;small&gt;REESH&lt;/small&gt;''
:You speak (sing. formal) - '''Вы говори́те''' - ''vi ga-vo-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye''
:You speak (plural) - '''Вы говори́те''' - ''vi ga-vo-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye''
:He/she/it reads - '''Он/Она́/Оно́ чита́ет''' - ''on/on-&lt;small&gt;AH&lt;/small&gt;/on-&lt;small&gt;OH&lt;/small&gt; chee-&lt;small&gt;TA&lt;/small&gt;-yet''
:They read - '''Они́ чита́ют''' - ''on-&lt;small&gt;EE&lt;/small&gt; chee-&lt;small&gt;TA&lt;/small&gt;-yoot''
Notice that though the verbs are the same in meaning, they change form: 'speak' changes from '''ты говоришь''' to '''вы говорите'''. Changing verbs like this is known as ''conjugation'', and is covered more fully on its [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs#First_conjugation|dedicated page]]. When nouns, pronouns, and adjectives change, it's called ''declension'' (this can also refer to verbs changing, however 'conjugation' refers specifically to verbs). Like most things in Russian, the personal pronouns change depending on which of the [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|six cases]] they're in:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|''Personal Pronouns !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|First person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Second person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Third person
|- style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;
! s !! p !! s !! p !! s !! p
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|Nominative]]
| Я || Мы || Ты || Вы || Он/Она/Оно || Они
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive_case|Genitive]]
| Меня́ || Нас || Тебя́ || Вас || Его́/Её || Их
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Dative_case|Dative]]
| Мне || Нам || Тебе́ || Вам || Ему́/Ей || Им
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative_case|Accusative]]
| Меня́ || Нас || Тебя́ || Вас || Его́/Её || Их
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental_case|Instrumental]]
| Мной || На́ми || Тобо́й || Ва́ми || Им/Ей || И́ми
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional_case|Prepositional]]
| Мне || Нас || Тебе́ || Вас || Нём/Ней || Них
|}
Note that when some of these have several forms, these are clarified in the pages for that specific case. Also note that third-person singular pronouns have the suffice '''н-''' when preceeded by a preposition: '''к ней''', '''от неё''', etc. This doesn't apply to the possessive pronouns, or in general any third-person pronoun that isn't ''directly'' called by the preposition.
:I like you - '''Я тебя люблю'''
:You talk to me - '''Вы мне говорите'''
:You talk about me - '''Вы говорите обо мне'''
:You talk with me - '''Вы говорите со мной'''

As the last example shows, the third-person singular pronouns '''он''', '''она''', and '''оно''' vary by gender in grammar, but not in meaning. The '''он''' in &quot;Я сел на стул, и он развалился&quot; (I sat on a chair, and it fell apart) is grammatically male to correspond with the table, but still translates to 'it' in English.


===quiz===
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;

{Formal or informal? Вы говорите со мной
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ formal
- informal

{Formal or informal? Я тебя люблю
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- formal
+ informal

{Formal or informal? Tы говори́шь
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- formal
+ informal


&lt;/quiz&gt;

== [[Russian/Possessive Pronouns|Possessive]] ==
These pronouns act as adjectives and modify a noun, stating that it is owned by one of the three speakers (''my'' cat, ''your'' cat, '''his''' cat). Unlike personal pronouns, but like adjectives, possessive pronouns also change to match the gender and number of the noun they modify. So in the following table, notice that the different gender and number of each type of pronoun refers to the object that's possessed, not the possessor. Since there are four pronouns that conjugate in four ways laterally and six ways vertically, shown here is only the forms for '''мой''', 'my'. The rest are detailed on their own pages:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''My'' !! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! Plural
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|Nominative]]
| Мой || Моя || Моё || Мои 
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive_case|Genitive]]
| Моего́ || Мое́й || Моего́ || Мои́х
|-

| Мои́м || Мое́й || Мои́м || Мои́ми
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional_case|Prepositional]]
| Моём || Мое́й || Моём || Мои́х
|}
The various forms given in the accusative case are detailed more thoroughly on that page.
Third-person possessive pronouns are special: there are only three words, and each refers to the gender of the speaker, not the case, gender, or number of the object possessed. For masculine and neuter possessors, the word is '''его''', 'his'/'its', pronouns ''ye-vo''. For feminine possessors, use '''её'''. For plural possessors of any gender, use '''их'''.
:My chair - '''Мой стул'''
:My dog - '''Моя собака'''
:My dress - '''Моё платье'''
:My books - '''Мои книги'''
:His chair - '''Его стул'''
:His books - '''Его книги'''
:Let's talk about his books - '''Давайте говорить о его книгах'''

==Russian names==

Russians use three names: first name, or имя; middle or patronymic name, or отчество, which is their father's first name plus a suffix meaning &quot;son of&quot; (ович) or &quot;daughter of&quot; (овна); and the last name or family name, or фамилия. Women's last names add an а to the masculine form of the name.

To address a boss, a teacher, or somebody who is older or superior in rank use the person's first name and patronymic. For instance: Василий Иванович!

To address a military or police officer use the rank and the officer's family name. For instance: Рядовой Иванов (Private Ivanov).
If you don't know the family name, use Товарищ and the rank. For instance Товарищ рядовой (Comrade private).

To address a suspect, a former spouse, and other types that don't deserve the title Comrade, use гражданин fem. гражданка (citizen). For instance: Гражданин, пройдёмте. (The citizen, follow me.)

The titles Господин fem. Госпожа (Mr. or Ms.) are reserved for wealthy foreigners. Ordinary citizens of foreign countries are your comrades. However, lately Russians have started to use Господин/Госпожа more frequently, especially in business circles.

Russians use relatively few first names. There are only a dozen or so men's first names, and maybe three dozen women's first names. Creativity in baby-naming isn't encouraged.

Russians also use diminutives or nicknames&amp;#151;lots! Each name typically has a version used by your best friend, another used by your other friends, another used by your teachers, another used by your grandmother, another used when you are scolded, etc. Some of the most common examples include Sasha for Alexander, Alyosha for Alexei, Misha for Mikhail, Dima for Dmitri, Lena for Elena, Olya for Olga, Natasha for Natalya and Katya for Ekaterina.

Digital Filters can be very complicated devices, but they must be able to map to the difference equations of the filter design. This means that since difference equations only have a limited number of operations available (addition and multiplication), digital filters only have limited operations that they need to handle as well. There are only a handful of basic components to a digital filter, although these few components can be arranged in complex ways to make complicated filters.

There are two types of filters in the digital realm: '''Infinite Impulse Response''' (IIR) filters, and '''Finite Impulse Response''' (FIR) filters. This page will attempt to discuss the differences between the two filter types, and the pros and cons of each.

== FIR Filters ==

We will start the discussion with FIR filters, which are conceptually the easiest to understand and the easiest to design. However, FIR filters suffer from low efficiency, and creating an FIR to meet a given spec requires more hardware than an equivalent IIR filter.  However, an FIR filter with symmetric coefficients is guaranteed to have linear phase.  This is important in some applications.

If we define the discrete time impulse function as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta [n] = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; n = 0 \\ 0 &amp; n \not = 0 \end{cases} \mbox{,} &lt;/math&gt;

the response of an FIR filter to &amp;delta;''[n]'', denoted as ''h[n]'', will decay to zero after a finite number of samples.  The transfer function of an FIR filter contains only zeros and either no poles or poles only at the origin.

===Filtering a time-series in Octave/Sciplot===

First create some points for a time series. In this case we'll create one second of random data sampled at 44 kHz.

 sampling_t = 1/44000;
 t = 0:sampling_t:1;
 x = rand(size(t));

Have a look at the time series

 plot(t,x);

Have a look at its spectrum (it is mostly uniform, what we would expect from noise)

 specgram(x)

Now we'll use a built-in function to create a third order Butterworth low-pass filter with cutoff frequency pi*0.1 radians 

 [b,a] = butter(3,0.1)

Now filter the time series.

 y = filter(b,a,x);

Have a look at  the first 100 points of the filtered data.

  hold on
  plot(y(1:100))
  plot(x(1:100))
  hold off

Check its spectrogram

  specgram(y)

Now look at the magnitude of the FFT

  plot(log(abs(fft(y))))

== IIR Filters (infinite impulse response filter) ==

IIR filters are harder to design than the FIR filters, but the benefits are extraordinary: IIR filters are ''an order of magnitude more efficient'' than an equivalent FIR filter. Even though FIR is easier to design, IIR will do the same work with fewer components, and fewer components translate directly to less money. IIR filters differ from FIR filters because they always contain feedback elements in the circuit, which can make the transfer functions more complicated to work with.  

The transfer function of an IIR filter contains both poles and zeros.  Its impulse response never decays to zero (though it may get so close to zero that the response cannot be represented with the number of bits available in the system).

== High-pass and Low-pass ==

High-Pass and Low-Pass filters are the simplest forms of digital filters, and they are relatively easy to design to specifications. This page will discuss high-pass and low-pass transfer functions, and the implementations of each as FIR and IIR designs.

== Band-pass ==

'''Band-pass Filters''' are like a combination of a high-pass and a low-pass filter. Only specific bands are allowed to pass through the filter, and frequency data that is too high or too low

== Stop-band ==

'''Notch filters''' are the complement of Band-pass filters in that they only stop a certain narrow band of frequency information, and allow all other data to pass without problem.

== Notch ==

The direct complement of a bandpass filter is called a '''bandstop filter'''. A notch filter is essentially a very narrow bandstop filter.

== Comb Filters ==

'''Comb Filters''', as their name implies, look like a hair comb. They have many &quot;teeth&quot;, which in essence are notches in the transfer function where information is removed. These notches are spaced evenly across the spectrum, so they are only useful for removing noise that appear at regular frequency intervals.

== All-pass == 

The All-pass filter is a filter that has a unity magnitude response for all frequencies. It does not affect the frequency response of a filter. The All-pass filter does affect the phase response of the system. For example, if an IIR filter is designed to meet a prescribed magnitude response often the phase response of the system will become non-linear. To correct for this non-linearity an All-pass filter is cascaded with the IIR filter so that the overall response(IIR+All-pass) has a constant group delay.

== Canonic and Non-Canonic ==

'''Canonic filters''' are filters where the order of the transfer function matches the number of delay units in the filter. conversely, '''Noncanonic filters''' are when the filter has more delay units than the order of the transfer function. In general, IIR filters are noncanonic, and FIR filters are canonic. This is not always the case, however.

Here is a demonstration of a canonical, 2nd order filter:
[[Image:Cannonical DSP Filter.JPG]]

Here is an example of a non-canonical 2nd order filter:
[[Image:NonCanonical DSP Filter.JPG]]

Notice that in the canonical filter, the system order (2) equals the number of delay units in the filter (2). In the non-canonical version, the system order is not equal to the number of delays (4 delay units). Both filters perform the same task, however the canonical version will be easier to implement in digital hardware, because you will need fewer delay units.  However, this drawback nearly disappears if several second order IIR's are cascaded, as they can share delay elements.  In this case, the only &quot;extra&quot; delay elements are those on the input side of the first section.

== Notations ==

There are some basic notations that we will be using:

:&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Pass-band cut off frequency
:&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; Stop-band cut off frequency
:&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Pass-band ripple peak magnitude
:&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; Stop-band ripple peak magnitude</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

Filtering a data input that is infinite in length can be a tricky task for any computer to manage, and DSP engineers have identified two techniques for breaking down an infinite input into manageable chunks for filtering.

== &quot;Infinite Input&quot; ==

'''infinite input response''' (IIR) filters are structures that use a feedback element to help filter data. An IIR filter has a transfer function of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{\prod(a_n - z^{-1})}{\prod(b_m - z^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

The constants ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are known as the '''zeros''' of the transfer function, and the ''b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms are known as the '''poles''' of the transfer function. FIR filters, by comparison do not have poles.

IIR filters are named as such because the filter does not stop responding once the input has stopped, but instead the feedback element will continue to input values into the filter structure for processing after the input has stopped.

== IIR vs FIR Filters ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! FIR !! IIR 
|-
|Stability || Always BIBO Stable || May not be stable
|-
|Efficiency || Not efficient || Very Efficient
|-
|Phase || May have linear phase || phase not linear
|-
|}

An FIR filter will have an order that is a significantly higher than the order of an equivalent IIR filter. This means that FIR filters need more complexity and more components then IIR filters to complete the same task. However, IIR filters have a potential for instability, which requires more analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Articles are small grammatical words that convey the ''definiteness'' of a noun.

== Omission of articles ==
In English, the two articles are 'the' and 'a/an'. English uses the definite article &quot;the&quot; to indicate a specific place, thing, etc: 'I ate the orange' suggests there was only one orange, or it was in some way special. English uses the indefinite articles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; to indicate that the following noun is not specific, e.g., &quot;I ate an orange&quot; suggests there were several oranges. Note that English only uses indefinite articles for singular nouns: 'I ate oranges' (plural) lacks an article. The word 'some' is sometimes used as a sort of faux indefinite plural article: 'I ate some oranges' conveys the same indefiniteness as 'an'.

The details and nuances of articles can fortunately be glossed over, as Russians simply omit articles altogether. For example, while we say 'I want an apple', using the article 'an', in Russian this is simply 'I want apple', or '''Я хочу яблоко''' (''ya kha-&lt;small&gt;CHOO&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;YA&lt;/small&gt;-bla-ka''). This can make the language seem quite blunt, though this is due to Russian's deliberate efficiency in grammar.

== To be ==
To compound this efficiency, the most common verb in English, 'to be', is also omitted in Russian, at least in the present tense - that is, the words 'is', 'am', 'are', etc, don't have Russian counterparts. The infinitive '''быть''' 'to be' exists with past- and future-tense conjugations, but its present-tense conjugation is not used in contemporary Russian. For example, 'She is nice' becomes 'She nice', or '''Она симпатичная''' (''a-&lt;small&gt;NA&lt;/small&gt; seem-pa-&lt;small&gt;TEECH&lt;/small&gt;-na-ya'').

Thus, the English four-word sentence 'I am a student' is just two words in Russian: '''Я студент''' (''ya stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;''). In written Russian, when a sentence equates two nouns in a row, a long dash, or  &amp;#151;, is written between the nouns to indicate the verb 'to be'. For example, 'Tanya is a student' translates to '''Таня &amp;#151; студент''' (''&lt;small&gt;TAN&lt;/small&gt;-ya &amp;#151; stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;'').

==quiz==
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;

{Она актриса
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ She is an actor.
- She needs an aspirin.
- She is Alica.
&lt;/quiz&gt;

A '''court-bouillon''' is an aromatic liquid in which meat, fish, or vegetables may be cooked.

The simplest form is salted water. Normally, however, a court-bouillon consists of water flavoured with herbs, spices, wine, lemon juice, shallots, etc. The liquid is usually allowed to simmer for a while to concentrate the flavours before the item to be cooked is added.</text>

As a memory aid, the following noun's gender and number change какой. Какой precedes masculine nouns, какая precedes feminine nouns, какое precedes neuter nouns, and какие precedes plural nouns. Because что is never followed by a noun, it only changes form in different cases.

If you just want to &quot;get by,&quot; always use что for &quot;what.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page discusses the nature of verbs in Russian, as well as the basics of how to use them in the present tense. For more advanced concepts, see the pages on [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|verbal aspect]], the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]], the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|future tense]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Participles|verbal participles]].

[[File:G. Caillebotte - Homme portant une blouse.jpg|thumb|'''Идти''' (''eed-&lt;small&gt;TEE&lt;/small&gt;'') — to walk]]

== The Nature of Verbs ==
In English, there are several ways to say that different people are doing some action, such as studying: &quot;I study&quot;, &quot;we study&quot;, &quot;you study&quot;, &quot;he/she/it studies&quot;, and &quot;they study&quot;. However, notice that third-person singular pronouns (he, she, and it) change 'study' into 'studies'. When verbs change, this is called 'conjugation'. English has a simple two-form verb conjugation ('study' and 'studies'), which is the origin of the term: ''conjugate'' comes from the Latin ''conjugare'', meaning 'yoked together', because English verbs come in these pairs. Similarly, 'conjugal', meaning yoked together in marriage, comes from this same root.

Like English verbs, Russian verbs also conjugate according to who is doing the verb: when on its own the default ''infinitive'' form corresponds to the English 'to' ('to see', 'to walk', etc), and this infinitive can conjugate for each of the six [[Russian/Personal Pronouns|personal pronouns]] - '''я''' ('I'), '''мы''' ('we'), '''ты''' ('you', informal), '''вы''' ('you', plural/polite), '''он/она/оно''' ('he/she/it'), and '''они''' ('they'). Notice that although the third-person singular pronoun has three forms for each gender, there is still only one third-person singular form of a verb, just as in English. The other thing to note is that Russian has two words for 'you' like French and German, but unlike English. Briefly, '''ты''' is used informally for a single person who you know well, while '''вы''' is used for groups of people, or for an individual person to whom you want to show respect.
:You &lt;small&gt;(informal)&lt;/small&gt; are speaking - '''Ты говоришь''' - ''ti ga-vuh-REESH''
:You &lt;small&gt;(formal/plural)&lt;/small&gt; are speaking - '''Вы говорите''' - ''vi ga-vuh-REET-ye''

The rules for conjugating Russian verbs come in two main patterns: the [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs#First conjugation|'first' or 'type 1' conjugation]], and the [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs#Second conjugation|'second' or 'type 2' conjugation]]. All verbs have an infinitive form, which is listed in dictionaries, and this virtually always ends in '''-ть''' (e.g., '''говорить''', 'to speak', '''работать''', 'to work').

=== How to place emphasis ===
In Russian, basic sentences with verbs are constructed with the verb's subject (the thing doing the verbing), the verb's object (the thing being verbed), and the verb itself. English uses a specific word order to denote the subject and object of a verb: 'cats like dogs' and 'dogs like cats' are the same words but repressed to change who's doing what. Russian, however, uses a [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|case]] system to denote what's the object and what's the subject - that is, the words change their endings depending on what they're doing in a sentence.  This means that word order can instead be used to emphasise parts of a sentence; specifically, the word placed at the end of a sentence is the one emphasised. In practice, Russian usually say &quot;Subject object verb&quot;, such as &quot;I her like&quot;. Other word orders place emphasis on other words: &quot;I like her&quot; emphasises that it is ''her'' I like, while &quot;Her like I&quot; emphasises that is is ''me'' who likes her.

Because verbs take on different forms for different pronouns, Russians often omit the noun or pronoun altogether if it's obvious who the speaker is:
:Are you speaking? - '''Вы говори́те?''' - ''vi ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye?''
:Yes, I'm speaking - '''Да, говорю́.''' - ''da, ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;RYOO&lt;/small&gt;''
This can also be done for the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|future tense]], but not the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]], for reasons that will be obvious once you learn those tenses.
Finally, note that objects like 'plane' or 'boat' call for the third-person form of a verb: 'He is flying' and 'The plane is flying' both use the third-person singular form '''лета́ет'''.

=== Questions and negation ===
To form a question in Russian, simply place an higher intonation on stress of the verb. This is different to English, which often reorders sentences ('You are riding.' - 'Are you riding?') or adds auxiliary words ('You ride' - 'Do you ride?'), with a higher intonation on the end of the sentence. The use of pronouns in asking questions ('He is riding' - 'Who is riding?'; 'You are going here' - 'You are going where?') is detailed more thoroughly on the page on [[Russian/Interrogative Pronouns|interrogative pronouns]].

To negate a verb, simply add '''не''' (''nye'') before the verb:
:Are you speaking? - '''Вы говори́те?''' - ''vi ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye?''
:Yes, I'm speaking - '''Да, говорю́''' - ''da, ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;RYOO&lt;/small&gt;''
:No, I'm not speaking - '''Нет, не говорю́''' - ''nyet, nye ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;RYOO&lt;/small&gt;''
:He's not a student - '''Он не студент''' - ''on nye stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;'' - as '''быть''' is omitted in the present tense, that '''не''' is used on it's own 
:Boris isn't coming - '''Борис не приходит''' - ''borees nye pree-KHO-&lt;small&gt;deet&lt;/small&gt;''

The phrase '''У меня есть + ''nom''''' means 'I have...' (literally, 'by me exists...'), using the infinitive of the verb '''есть''' to mean 'exists'. To negate this and say 'I don't have...', we replace '''есть''' with '''нет''', and place the following object in the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|''genitive case'']].  '''Нет''' is a contraction of '''не есть''', and has a different meaning to '''нет''' as in 'no'. The use of this phrase, it's negation, and forming the genitive case in general, are discussed further on the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive page]].

=== The Infinitive ===
As discussed above, verbs by default are in their ''infinitive'' form, meaning they haven't been conjugated yet. In English, this correspond to the 'to...' form of a verb; in the sentence, &quot;I want to live in Moscow&quot;, 'to live' is the infinitive of that verb. Just like in English, dictionaries give verbs in their infinitive, unconjugated form. The infinitive almost always ends in '''-ть''', and conjugating a verb is as simple as removing this '''-ть''' and adding the appropriate ending.
:What do you want to do? - '''Что вы хотите делать?''' - ''shto vi kho-&lt;small&gt;TEE&lt;/small&gt;-tye'' - '''делать''' is the infinitive of the verb 'to do'

== The Present tense ==
The present tense is used much like in English, with a few important exceptions. First, Russians omit the verb 'to be' in the present tense: &quot;She is nice&quot; in Russian is '''Она симпатичная''', with no word for 'is'. A long hyphen or dash is used to equate two nouns together, where the word 'is' or 'are' is used in English: &quot;They are students&quot; is '''Они – студенты'''. Second, as discussed more in the page on the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|future tense]], there are times when Russians use the present tense when English wouldn't, such as reporting a story.

Second, there is the concept of [[Russian/Verbal_Aspect|verbal aspect]]: simply put, all verbs in Russian have ''two'' words, the imperfective and the perfective. For instance, 'to speak' is '''говорить''' ''and'' '''сказать'''. Which you use is discussed more thoroughly on the specific page, but for our purposed we just need to know that the present tense can only be formed using the ''imperfective'' word. So to say &quot;I am speaking&quot;, you use the imperfective '''говорить''', not the perfective '''сказать'''. So, unless otherwise stated, the rest of this page will use imperfective verbs.

So, to form the present tense, you simply take the ''imperfective aspect'' of the verb and add the appropriate endings. Verbs in Russian conjugate in one of two ways.

===First conjugation===
These verbs usually end in '''-ать''', though there are enough exceptions that it's probably best to simply learn the conjugation of a new verb. Eventually, you will be able to 'predict' how verbs conjugate. To conjugate these verbs, remove the '''-ть''', and add the appropriate ending:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Я, I !! Мы, we !! Ты, you (informal) !! Вы, you (formal) !! Он/она/оно !! Они, they
|-
| -ю || -ем || -ешь || -ете || -ет || -ют
|}

Remember, these six forms are for each personal pronoun ('I', 'we', etc). If you want to refer to something else, such as &quot;The plane flies&quot; or &quot;The boat sails&quot;, remember that 'plane' and 'boat' are in the third-person, so would take the '''он''' ending of '''-ет'''.

Let's look at how you conjugate '''читать''', 'to read':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Я читаю&lt;br&gt;I am reading&lt;br&gt;I read || Мы читаем&lt;br&gt;We are reading&lt;br&gt;We read
|-
! Second person
| Ты читаешь&lt;br&gt;You are reading&lt;br&gt;You read || Вы читаете&lt;br&gt;You are reading&lt;br&gt;You read
|-
! Third person
| Он/она/оно читает&lt;br&gt;He/she/it is reading&lt;br&gt;He/she/it reads || Они читают&lt;br&gt;They are reading&lt;br&gt;They read
|-
|}

Notice that conjugating verbs forms the present tense, and a Russian present tense verb can be translated as either the ''simple present'' tense ('I read') or the ''continuous present'' tense ('I am reading') in English.

===Second conjugation===
Second conjugation verbs usually end in '''-ить'''. Like other verbs, to conjugate them, simply remove the '''-ть''' and add the appropriate ending. These endings are similar to first-conjugation verbs, though with a change in vowel:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|  !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|First Person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Second Person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Third Person
|-
! Я, I !! Мы, we !! Ты, you (informal) !! Вы, you (formal) !! Он/она/оно !! Они, they
|-
! First conjugation
| -ю || -ем || -ешь || -ете || -ет || -ют
|-
! Second conjugation
| -ю || -им || -ишь || -ите || -ит || -ят
|}

Let's look at how you conjugate '''говори́ть''', 'to speak':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Я говорю́&lt;br&gt;I am speaking&lt;br&gt;I speak || Мы говори́м&lt;br&gt;We are speaking&lt;br&gt;We speak 
|-
! Second person
| Ты говори́шь&lt;br&gt;You are speaking&lt;br&gt;You speak || Вы говори́те&lt;br&gt;You are speaking&lt;br&gt;You speak 
|-
! Third person
| Он/она/оно говори́т&lt;br&gt;He/she/it is speaking&lt;br&gt;He/she/it speaks || Они говоря́т&lt;br&gt;They are speaking&lt;br&gt;They speak 
|-
|}

=== Exceptions ===
Like all things in Russian, there are exceptions to the above rules:
*Seven verbs with the infinitive ending '''–еть''', and three which end in '''-ать''', take the second conjugation: '''видеть''' ('to see'), '''вертеть''' ('to twirl'), '''обидеть''' ('to offend'), '''зависеть''' ('to depend'), '''ненавидеть''' ('to hate'), '''терпеть''' ('to tolerate'), '''смотреть''' ('to watch'), '''слышать''' ('to hear'), '''дышать''' ('to breathe'), and '''держать''' ('to keep').
*Two verbs with the infinitive ending '''–еть''' take the first conjugation endings: '''брить''' ('to shave') and '''стелить''' ('to lay').
*The verb '''гнать''' ('to drive') takes the second conjugation endings  - However, verbs of motion are quite complex, and will be discussed in [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs_of_Motion|their own page]].

== The Past and Future tenses ==
Now that we've covered the present tense, there are two other tenses that can be used in Russian: [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|the past tense]] and [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|the future tense]]. These are detailed more thoroughly on their own pages, but in brief, they are formed as follows:
* To form the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|&lt;small&gt;PAST TENSE&lt;/small&gt;]] of a verb, remove '''-ть''' and add '''-л''' ('''-ла''' if the subject is feminine, '''-ло''' if neuter, '''-ли''' if plural). This rule applies to both [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|aspects]] of a verb. So, &quot;I was speaking&quot; (imperfective) is '''я говорил''', while &quot;I spoke&quot; (perfective) is '''я сказал'''.
* To form the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|&lt;small&gt;FUTURE TENSE&lt;/small&gt;]] of verbs, choose your aspect. If you're using the ''perfective'' aspect to form the future, simply conjugate it as you would the imperfective aspect, and this creates the future tense. If you're using the ''imperfective'' aspect to form the future, conjugate the verb 'to be', '''быть''', and add the infinitive of the imperfective. So, &quot;I will speak&quot; (perfective) is '''я скажу''', while &quot;I will be speaking&quot; (imperfective) is '''я буду говорить'''.

== Missing Wikibooks policies ==

I know there is the little policy/vote thing, but I thought I'd bring it up here. We seem to be missing a few policies here at Wikibooks. Notably {{bad link|Wikibooks:Verifiability}}, {{bad link|Wikibooks:Cite sources}}, and {{bad link|Wikibooks:No original research}}. I am not positive which policies are really warranted here, but I thought I'd start building the Wikibooks policies. Please see [[User:Lord Voldemort/Quicksand|my sandbox]] for an adapted start to the No original research policy. Any comments or tweaks are encouraged. Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:22, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

And wow, no policy about personal attacks. I have adapted the en.wiki NPA policy and have started a poll about enforcing it. Please see [[Wikibooks talk:No personal attacks]]. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

Yet another missing policy important to Wikibook integrity. Please see [[Wikibooks talk:No legal threats]] for poll to enforce. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:50, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:I would suggest that bringing over all those policies quickly is critical to resolving some of the issues we've had here.--09:21, 25 November 2005 (UTC) ''this comment from [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]''

::I've been so busy on my books trying to get content up to an acceptable level, that I havent really taken the time to cite everything.

== Feedback on my first wiki-book? (&quot;Stuttering Therapy&quot;)== 

I've started moving my book &quot;No Miracle Cures: A Multifactoral Guide to Stuttering Therapy&quot; to wikibooks. The wiki-title is &quot;Stuttering Therapy.&quot; Please send me suggestions or tell me what mistakes I made! E.g., I couldn't find how to move the book onto the &quot;Medical: Clinical Medicine: Speech-Language Pathology&quot; bookshelf (which I also created). I've moved the first chapter. I'll try to move the other chapters in the next week or two. [[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 22:40, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:Because using the Programming namespace for a programming language makes eminent sense? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 19:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::Whether it makes sense or not (I don't particularly like it), the programming books are all located in the Programming: namespace. It's the way it's always been done here, and by having everything uniform, makes pages easier to find. All we need is a few pages to break the mould, and we will have total CS chaos. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:::[[Ada Programming]] moved out of the &quot;Programming:&quot; pseudonamespace; that seems to be the trend. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::::Is there a consensus yet on whether or not to drop the the &quot;Programming:&quot; pseudo-namespace?  When I created [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] it seemed it was almost universal but now there is a drift away from it.  So what do people think?  As far as I am concerned it is perfectly reasonable to drop the pseudo-namespace but it will mean renaming a lot of pages.  As an aside: this illustrates perfectly why relational databases are not necessarily very good at manipulating hierarchical data (Wikibooks backend is a MySQL database I think, (alright MySQL isn't a classical Cobb relational database if you are a purist but it's close enough for engineering purposes :-)).  I made all the internal links relative so I shouldn't have to edit many pages, just rename them.  Does everyone use relative links? --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

::I don't like the Programming: namespace, but i can't see a reason why we would want to go out and rename ''all those pages''. I mean, unless you had a bot to do it all, it seems like a huge waste of effort. Just leave well-enough alone I suppose. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 14:28, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:::If I start working on some book in the &quot;Programming:&quot; false namespace, then I might move it out of the namespace. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:03, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

This book only has about 5 pages. I don't like it in the programming namespace when other books are not put into a namespace. I am going to rename the pages anyway so is it OK to drop the Programming bit? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 05:05, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
:Go ahead.  After all if it's only five pages it can easily be undone.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Policy]] ===

There are two point to this. The [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Policy]] - chapter 4 and 5. The first considers all pseudo-namespaces as obsolete naming convention and while we have not jet agreed on [[WB:NP]] this particular point is undisputed. The later outlines a possible future of Programming: - a book to containt all the programming language which have not yet enough support to support a book of there own. I know this is harsh but live is harsh.

Then there is also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which can only detect books which follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. Statistics might not be all - however they can serve as a motivating factor. Especialy since the Stat is sorted by size ;-) .

I know it seems like I am raising hell, but I think I am going to nominate the entire Pokedex, and related pages for deletion.

:::Game manuals are not textbooks. A book perhaps on Game Theory might be, but have you even seen modules in the Pokedex? They are not textbooks, and never will be. Wikibooks is not a place for random game's walkthroughs, cheat codes, or indices. It is for textbooks. Wikibooks needs to be more serious, and the Pokedex hurts our reputation as a valid resource for educators and students. This should be able to be used as a resource in low-wealth areas such as parts of Asia and Africa as well. What good is the Pokedex going to do a 12-year-old Nigerian boy trying to learn? What about that 8-year-old Thai girl? This just isn't the place. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
::::No, it is some people's beliefs that wikibooks should only be textbooks.  That is not the original mission statement, nor has it ever been how wikibooks has operated.  Not even in its earliest days, when the point of wikibooks would have been well understood as it was just created.  There is no consensus at this time that wikibooks is textbook only-  if anything it seems to be the opposite.  
::::Hell, if we go by 12 year old Nigerian boys and 8 year old Thai girls, we need to delete just about everything?  What good is a book on Calculus or Quantum Mechanics to them?  We'd need to limit our wikibooks to &quot;How not to starve&quot; and &quot;Working in a sweat shop&quot;.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;Of course neither of those would qualify, as they aren't taught in classes and thus aren't textbooks either.  &lt;/sarcasm&gt;--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:::::I think you know what I mean. This should be usefule for teachers and professors and especially students (no matter how old). And to quote the history of Wikibooks, &quot;''Wikibooks, previously called '''Wikimedia Free Textbook Project''' and '''Wikimedia-Textbooks''', is a sister project to Wikipedia and is part of the Wikimedia foundation, begun on July 10, 2003''&quot;, so originally it ''was'' just for textbooks. Somewhere along the lines, the intent and purpose was corrupted. Saying it wasn't for textbooks is just a fallacy. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
::::::Example: I have many non-fiction books on my shelves relating to wolves, wolf biology, history, etc. Despite never having seen a textbook on them, I think I would get support for a {{bad link|The Wolf}} Wikibook. But what about a book on something more specific, like the history of the wolves since their reintroduction to Yellowstone? I ''have'' books on that subject, but calling them textbooks would be an incredible stretch. Where do you draw the line? (I think without a '''very''' solid line very, very clearly defined somewhere, this discussion will be extremely difficult to advance.) --[[User:Telamon|Telamon]] 22:58, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::::::No, I don't.  You have conflicting arguments, one of which is dead wrong, the other of which is asinine.  The dead wrong one is that this site is or ever has been textbooks only.  It is not, and never has been.  The purpose of the site is instructional books, not merely textbooks.  Textbooks are a major part of the site, arguably the most important part.  But not the only part.  The asinine part is that if an instructional book is not useful for third world nations, then it isn't applicable to wikibooks.  Even ignoring the fact that what third worlders need to know most would eliminate most wikibooks that both of us think should be here, this is still not a prerequisite for wikibooks.  Third worlders don't need english lit or US history-  yet we have wikibooks for each.  They also don't need instruction manuals on how to use obscure electronics-  yet we have those too.  The fact that they are unlikely to play pokemon does not mean that its a reason for it to be eliminated from wikibooks.  Hell, not even wikipedia would agree with you-  there are articles there on pokemon.  If you followed that line of thought, it would need to delete every article on every movie, game, book, TV show, musician, artist ever written from both sites-  a significant amount of material and time spent.  And much of it useful under the right circumstances.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 23:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:::::::Oh, stop it. By this time, we all know what Wikibooks is for. ''It has specifically been outlined by Jimbo.''' As Jimbo has the right to speak for the Board of the Wikimedia Foundation, I am inclined to agree with him on how their website should be run. And I quote, &quot;''This is for textbooks, not joke books, '''not random books on any subject you like'''. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''&quot; (emphasis added). And I don't mean that only people in third world countryies should be able to use Wikibooks, and to try and paint my comments in such a light is dead wrong. I simply meant that the purpose of this project (to provide '''free''', open-source textbooks) ties in with the overall mission of the Wikimedia Foundation (to provide the sum of human knowledge and to be accessible by everyone... even those in third world countries). Stop trying to continue this fallacy that any random subject matter is appropriate for Wikibooks. We get crap dumped on us from Wikipedia, and for too long we just said, &quot;Hey, why not? We might attract more editors here if we had this. I know it doesn't really fall into line with was Wikibooks actually ''is'', but who cares... we need more editors.&quot; Well this thinking has to stop. And if that means losing editors (even great ones) then so be it. This might not be the wiki for them. This is for editors who want to help write free textbooks. Everyone else is expendible. I know I am harsh and am probably losing any chance at adminship here, but someone needs to stand up for Wikibooks and it might as well be me.

(De-indenting) First, let me call your baloney. There are a few others trying, or even want, to hold up the integrity and reputation of Wikibooks. 

Second, did you not even read what I wrote? What exactly do you think Wikibooks was founded for? As a retard-dump for out-of-place Wikipedia articles? I'm sorry that I am the one who has to be so vocal about this, but I'm not about to let you and your kind ramrod this crap down my throat. Let me quote again, since you apparantly missed it the first time: &quot;''This is for textbooks, not joke books, '''not random books on any subject you like'''. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''&quot; (emphasis added) I think Jimbo knows a little bit more about the goals than you do. 

Third, I ''am'' doing something constructive for this site. Do you have any idea how many missing policies are around here? You quote &quot;no original research&quot;, do you have any idea what that actually means? No, because there is no policy defining it. Should we even be deleting anything? Porbably not, because the Deletion policy isn't even approved of yet. I could tell you to &quot;die, mother fucker, i'm coming to stab you&quot;, because there is no &quot;No personal attacks&quot; policy. I could threaten to sue you if you even write on this board again, because there is no &quot;No legal threats&quot; policy. I seem to be one of the few that actually cares what happens here. I am trying to keep Wikibooks as a serious project that can be used as a useful resource. Sorry if you want this place to be shoddy, I don't. I can edit where I please, so don't try lecturing me on being useful. See you around, my friend. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:So you continue to quote a page that was recently edited and under dispute.  Much of the quote isn't even by your hero Jimbo (check the history).  It proves nothing.  Wikibooks is, and always has been, a repository of non-fictional books.  It has never been restricted to textbooks.  Its you who are undermining the integrity of wikibooks, by trying to change its definition and thus eliminate large amounts of good, solid content with your narrow views.  And you are the only one-  I don't see anyone else with you on your crusade.  If you want to bring it to a vote, try it.  You'll lose badly.  Otherwise drop it.

Your wishes that Wikibooks should include shoddy pieces of crap like the Pokedéx and other general junk doesn't make it so either.

=== Why Keep {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex}} ===
If the Pokedex goes to VFD, then I will vote '''keep'''.
# The Pokedex is essentially a macropedia (banned by [[WB:WIW]]). A typical page like {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex:Farfetch'd}} contains tables, but it does not give instructions. However...
#* The {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex}} module explicitly says that it is a part of {{bad link|Pokémon}}. As part of the larger strategy guide for these video games, the macropedia is acceptable.
#* The main reason for the [[WB:WIW]] rule is to put encyclopedia information on Wikipedia, which has a Pokemon article. But [[Wikipedia:Farfetch'd]] does not contain the tables from {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex:Farfetch'd}}, and [[WB:WIW]] allows Wikipedia articles to be extended into Wikibooks in this manner.
# To quote [[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]]: ''They are not a textbook, are not a source for academic information, and no class will be taught on Pokemon.'' It is a textbook; the information might not be [[wikt:academic|academic]] but it is useful to certain video game players. A ''school'' class might not teach this material in lecture, but could still use it as a textbook. Some schools have classes for video games (studying the games themselves in addition to making new ones).

I created the page [[Wikibooks talk:Game manual guidelines]] for a discussion on whether Wikibooks should ban game guides. However, most opponents of game guides only associated them with Jokebook, Naturism, and [[Getting a date]], the three books that [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] wanted to delete. Those three books had problems that the game guides did not; they were debated at [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]].

I had argued that game guides (1) are textbooks (2) are allowed by [[WB:WIW]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:The question is, are they allowed by Jimbo? He's tightening policy and all that. And here I quote from one of his diffs, &quot;''This is for textbooks, not joke books, not random books on any subject you like. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''&quot; Judging by that line, game guides are definite goners, as they are certainly not the subject of classes other than being examples of game design or violence in media or whatnot. Hm. Wasn't someone (LV?) going to ask Jimbo about this? Anyway, we need an answer from him, and the policy page needs to be amended to reflect that.

----
' A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class' is a ludicrous definition of the word textbook.  My personal library is full of books that I consider, and are often described by the publishers, as textbooks but which would definitely not be usuable in their entirety for study in an 'existing class'.  A better definition is 'a book used as a standard work for the study of a subject' (from http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;field-12668446=textbook&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname), unfortunately for most of us that is in some ways an even more restrictive test than Mr Wales'.  It does, however, have the advantage that it does not not tie you down to a narrow definition of study.  To give one example: 'The Handyman's Complete Self Instructor' published by Odhams.  This is definitely a textbook, it has theory, practice and exercises but what class would use it?  It covers house building, decorating, radio receivers (theory and practice), the theory of internal combustion engines, and much more.  It was published in the heyday of self-improvement when an enthusiastic person might expect to make serious progress through independent study.  No class would ever have used it as its principal text and quite likely no one person would be interested in every chapter.  If we are to take literally the constraint that a book must be usable in an existing class then we must have a description of the syllabus that the class follows in order to determine whether or not the book qualifies.  For me a much more telling objection to the Pokemon modules is their lack of exercises, they read more like an operating manual than a textbook and the user is merely informed of facts, never challenged to use them to generate anything new.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:35, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:A [[wikt:class|class]] might not be a class at school, nor one with a syllabus. It might only be &quot;a group, collection, category or set sharing characteristics or attributes&quot;, for example, the class of all Pokemon users, instead of the class at school that studies whichever type of game includes Pokemon. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:08, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

I am new to this snakepit of endless wrangling. I am interested in editing a crummy old public domain translation into a modern edition. (A novel by Tolstoy.) Obviously, a translated version of a novel by Tolstoy could be used in a classroom, so it appears to fit the definition of a Wikibook mentioned several times above. This could turn into a whole series of modernized, public domain translations of classic fiction (and non-fiction, later). As I explained when discussing this over at GP, this would involve changing the mode of expression of a translator, not editing Tolstoy. The Gutenburg folks try to faithfully reproduce old works, not create new ones, so they suggested I try here. Is this within the Wikibook concept of itself? &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; --Gene (sorry, I am not conversant with all these codes; I just got here.)

== Another Language ==

Before I say anything, I just want to say that I love this site, it's so awesome and has great information...keeps me really busy at work when it's slow.  I just find this part of your website, wikibooks and notice that you have an area on learning a different language which is cool.  But you don't have an area on learning Latvian, which is strange considering you have an option to change the language format of Wikipedia to Latvian.  My wife is a Latvian and I always wanted to learn how to speak her language to her as a surprise gift without her knowing I learned it.  I was hoping that you could start including that language in the Wikibooks too. Well I hope that it happens, if not, I'll still keep this in my favorites.  

Thanks

Craig

:We don't have one because noone who knows both Latvian and English has volunteered their time to write one yet.  It would definitely be welcomed content.

== Proposed [[Sexual Health]] Wikibook ==

I threw together a proposed outline for a book on sexual health on my user page. I think that a book like this could be a wonderful resource where people with serious questions about the subject can come to get serious and helpful answers. I do realize however a few important facts:

#I am not exactly an expert on the topic myself
#Such a book would probably invite a higher-then-average amount of vandalism
#some of the topics (birth control, STDs, sexual education in general) are hot-button topics, and would bring in alot of controversy.

Despite the hardships, I think that this book could still potentially be an excellent resource, and the type of serious, helpful book that could really help wikibooks out in general. I wanted to get some feedback on the current outline (which i threw together pretty quickly) before any motions were made to actually introduce this book onto a bookshelf. Comments and suggestions are welcome both here and on the page itself. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:02, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:We have a [[Sexual Psychology]] book with some of the same topics, but almost no actual content. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:50, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

::I have seen that book. Unfortunately, sexual psychology just can't cover all the same topics.

Now, we could rename and expand that book to cover all these topics, but i dont know if that's the best idea. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

This book sounds like an excellent albeit difficult idea.  I have some comments.

* The &quot;Transmitting disease via Anal and Oral sex&quot; subtopic is misplaced under &quot;Fertility and Infertility&quot;.  I assume that that's basically a typo.
* Consider adding material on [[w:Circumcision|circumcision]] and so-called [[w:Female circumcision|female circumcision]].  The latter is not so relevant in the US where presumably it is rare&amp;mdash;however, we have a world-wide audience.  Be aware that (male) circumcision is far more a hot button topic than you might expect.  There is an amazing amount of near-insane fanaticism, both pro and con, over this little snip.
* Consider adding material on [[w:Abortion|abortion]] and [[w:Selective reduction|selective reduction]].  Well, out of the frying pan and into the fire concerning hot button topics.
* Consider adding material on such [[w:Abortifacient|abortifacients]] as [[w:Mifepristone|Mifepristone]] ([[w:RU-486|RU-486]]) and [[w:Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptives]] as [[w:Levonorgestrel|Levonorgestrel]] ([[w:Plan B|Plan B]]).

Note that, for the last three items, you should take the &quot;consider adding&quot; (as opposed to &quot;please add&quot;) part seriously.  I did not intend them as topics that need to be added, but rather ones that could possibly be worthing of adding.  I could very well see you thinking some or all of them as too tangential to include, or too controversial to be worth the headache or whatever. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:16, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:I wanted to add a heading for abortion, but i realize all too well that that page could quickly get out of control. It would be hard to add a page that is completely non-biased.

Also, if you see any typos on that page, feel free to edit them out, or to add your own ideas. It's only an outline afterall, and the more pre-planning we do now, the better the book will be when (if) we introduce it --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:57, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

Look at Amazon, there are dozens of fertility books (for women who want to get pregnant) and ZERO birth control books (for women who don't want to get pregnant). Seems like a big need there. The best birth control info I've seen is the chapter in &quot;Our Bodies, Our Selves.&quot; I would be happy to let you use a section about STDs I wrote for my book &quot;Hearts and Minds.&quot; My advice re. avoiding STDs differs from the &quot;conventional wisdom,&quot; you might find it interesting.

== Anon users can't create new pages ==
On wikipedia, Jimbo has established a new policy that anonymous users cannot create new pages, but are instead restricted to only editing current pages. This change was enacted after some amount of controversy involving a vandalized page that remained un-reverted for a very long length of time. I don't propose that wikibooks has all the same problems as wikipedia, but I am wondering if perhaps we don't need a similar safeguard. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:09, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
* Absolutely not. We have to few contributors and anons are creating many pages. If more sysops watched recent changes, there would be no problems with vandals. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:21, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
**I agree with [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]], anything that discourages contributors is definitely not a good idea.  I can easily imagine good reasons for a contributor wanting to remain anonymous (think about writing a book that discusses abortion, Scientology, etc.).  On the front page of Wikibooks it says 'Welcome to Wikibooks, a collection of open-content textbooks that anyone can edit.'  Let's cross that bridge when we reach it.  Also, did Jimbo Wales establish that policy unilaterally, or was there a consensus on Wikipedia for the change?  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 07:57, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
***I don't know all the specifics of the action, but i know that it was deemed news enough to appear on [http://www.slashdot.com slashdot]. I also did a quick test where i signed out and tried to create a new page on the 'pedia and i couldnt. I think Jimbo may have made that decision unilaterally. Also, nobody is saying that anonymous users can't contribute, they are only saying that an anonymous user can't create a new page. Why would we want a bunch of vandals being able to come in here and create a bunch of pages like {{bad link|Wiki is stupid}} or {{bad link|UR GAY ROFLS}}? Ordinary users then can't help to revert this vandalism, it falls on the backs of sysops to fix this stuff. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 13:49, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

I disagree strongly with the notion implicit in the change that anonymity implies bad faith.

----
Actually, when this change was mentioned on foundation-l (which I now read), it was described as an experimental change. The most significant problem is that anonymous users now cannot contribute to Wikipedia through red links. Also from reading foundation-l, I get the idea that a few English Wikipedia users now think that it is OK to deter new users instead of welcoming them when the new users make mistakes.

Jimbo was smart to try the experimental change on English Wikipedia, which has almost no need for new users and new pages when compared to other wikis, such as this one. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:50, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== User styles and monobook.js ==

I think that perhaps we could use a guide for creating style changes using monobook.js and monobook.css. for that matter, maybe we could just use a good guide to the skins here on wikibooks. on the 'pedia these kinds of tools and things are relatively popular, but on here they are unheard of. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:22, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:::If the scope of the book would be using wikis in general, and not just editing in the wiki-project style, it could be VERY helpful.

== Backing up and working offline ==

Hi. After spending a not insignificant amount of time on a wikibook that I am largely running, I am scared about the possibility of a wikibooks crash and the loss of all my painstaking work. Is there an easy way to locally back-up a wikibook (without going into edit for every page and copying the text and pasting it into a word file and saving it). Also, is there a way for me to make and see the results of  wiki on my computer when I'm not online (obviously I can write the mark-up, but I can't see what it looks like). If there is a way to make a wikibook locally, is it possible to have the images all ready locally and then upload them all in one go? At the moment the image upload page is a one at a time job, which is a little labour intensive.

May I also take the opportunity to say thank-you to whoever it is that deserves my thanks in making and maintaining this site. It is truely amazing and beautiful. [[User:Demipomme|Demipomme]] 21:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't know of a way to locally keep specific modules, but you can get all of them from a database dump. That's probably not what you are looking for. I don't think there is a way to view wiki programming outside of a wiki. If you are really worried, perhaps create a user subpage on Wikipedia or another wiki much less likely to crash. But saving them as a word file would work too. Sorry I couldn't be more of a help... it may have been better if I had just let someone who could explain better tell you.

:As to the thank you... everyone maintains this site (even you, so thanks). Just keep up the good work. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:50, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

::You might want to look at [[Wikibooks:Mirrors and forks]]; there are some sites that have copies of everything from Wikibooks. Also [[MetaWikipedia:Wikimedia servers]] describes the servers, which are the same ones that host [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]. There are at least 100 servers in different parts of the world, so this wiki does not fail easily. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

''is there a way for me to make and see the results of  wiki on my computer when I'm not online?''
Well, in theory you could install 
[[w:MediaWiki]]
on your personal computer.
There are a *lot* of people who install wiki software on their own personal computer ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki ) -- most wiki software is fairly easy to install. Unfortunately, the MediaWiki software is (according to rumors I've heard) too complicated for most people.
(Is there some other, simpler-to-install wiki that uses MediaWiki-style markup?)

''image upload page is ... is a little labour intensive.''
Unfortunately, that's true on most web sites -- but people are coming up with some clever ideas to simplify the [http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.fcg/LongImageIncorporationProcess Visual:LongImageIncorporationProcess].

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:03, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for the feedback. I think I'll feel a little safer knowing there are &quot;at least 100 servers&quot;! And I'll create a back-up page as per the post below to back-up the html. Cheers.

:I use a local cacheing proxy server called [http://scache.sourceforge.net/ SmartCache] to keep a local copy of all my web browsing (well, not quite all, just the important bits).  When I want to keep a ''snapshot'' of part of a web site I use [http://www.httrack.com/ HTTrack].  [http://scache.sourceforge.net/ SmartCache] lets you browse the pages you have visited just as though you were on line, [http://www.httrack.com/ HTTrack] can copy entire web sites or parts of web sites to your local disk and rewrite the internal links so that the site works just by opening the files in a browser.  I haven't tried [http://www.httrack.com/ HTTrack] on WikiBooks yet so I'm not sure how easy it is to confine it to a single book.  You could also use [http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html wget].  These techniques will give you the rendered pages so they aren't exactly backups of the source but they would be enough to recreate the content. Please use common sense when using such mirroring tools so that you don't overload the servers. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

==  easy way to locally back-up a wikibook ==

There ''is'' an easy way to back up the rendered HTML output for an entire book in one fell swoop.
For example, you can go to
[[C++ Programming/Print version|Programming:C_plus_plus:All_Chapters]]
or [[Python/Print version]]
and tell your browser to save that one page, which contains the rendered HTML output for the latest version of every page in the entire book.

I'd be happy to help you set up a similar page for any other book.
([{{fullurl:C++ Programming/Print version|action=edit}} Check out how] the
[[w:Wikipedia:Transclusion &quot;transclusion&quot;]] is done if you want to do it yourself).

Alas, I don't know any way to back up the raw Wikitext other than going to each page manually, hitting the &quot;edit&quot; button, and copy-and-pasting it into a local text file.

== What language is en.wikibooks.org? ==

I ask, because I've just had a completely valid Australian english word (Glycaemic) repeatedly corrected as being a 'typo'.

Is there a policy as to the language to be used?  I looked but couldn't find one.  Thanks.  [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 11:15, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:The language is english, although there is no specific rule on which english is being used. There are many differences (although most are small) between the &quot;english&quot; spoken in australia, the UK, and America. A general guideline is people should be tolerant of these differences, but many people don't even know that a word is from a different dialect. The problem is that the word &quot;Glycaemic&quot; might be spelled correctly in Australian english, but the corrected version might be correctly spelled in British english, or American english. no sense getting into an edit war about it, maybe just provide a footnote or something. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 13:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:: Okay, Thanks. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 20:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

I say there should be no &quot;official&quot; dialect in wikibooks, else we would have to have 3 wikibook sites for German, some 100 dialects for the phillipeno one, etc. etc. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:05, 26 December 2005 

I think that turning the 'offending' word into a link to a footnote or to the Wiktionary entry would be better than correcting it unless it is wrong in all the dialects and variants.  Not sure that British, American and Australian English are different enough to qualify as dialects though; most of the differences that people mention are simply variant spellings.  I agree with [[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] that there should not be an official dialect.  This is especially so in English because we do not have any equivalent of [http://www.academie-francaise.fr  l’Académie française] or [http://www.sprakrad.no Norsk Språkrådet], the language belongs to the people who use it.  Perhaps this lack of policy should be made official :-) --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

== Recent changes question ==
As an active member of other Wikis and a newcomer to the Wikibook, I'm having a really difficult time orienting myself around here. My main problem is that I'd like to contribute to the Cookbook, but not the other areas of the site. I guarantee there are plenty of other folks out there like me who feel discouraged because there is too much to wade through before you can find what you're interested in. Specifically, I'd like to use the Recent Changes page to look at Cookbook specific changes. The problem is that there seems to be only a handful of Cookbook related changes per 500, making it near-impossible to selectively follow the Cookbook's progress. Is there some way to access a Cookbook specific Recent Changes page? [[User:Kneague|Kneague]] 22:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:Hmmm... you could always watchlist each Cookbook module. I don't think there is another way to just see Cookbook changes. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:Is there some way such a feature could be programmed, then? Having a single Recent Changes page is a real limiting factor because it means so many new contributions and edits will fall under the radar. Looking through the Cookbook now, there are numerous things that need to be better streamlined, and I think that could be achieved if there a better mechanism for tracking Cookbook specific changes. On a more global scale, having Book specific Recent Changes pages could cultivate a sense of community on those pages, encouraging people to contribute and providing a newcomer with the necessary attention to keep them around. [[User:Kneague|Kneague]] 22:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::On the top of the page, when you are logged in, there is a tab that says &quot;watch&quot;. When you click that button, the page will go onto your personal watch list. Then, to see your watchlist, you can click the &quot;My Watchlist&quot; link in the upper right-hand corner (near your user name). Alternatively, when you edit a page, there is a check box labled &quot;Watch this page&quot;, which has the same effect. If you want to automatically watch every page you edit, you could click on the &quot;preferences&quot; link (right next to &quot;my watchlist&quot;), and under the &quot;editing&quot; button, click the checkbox called &quot;Add pages you edit to your watchlist&quot;. Then, every time you edit a page in the cookbook, it will add that page to your watchlist.

::: I think it's not exaltly what Kneague was looking for - this function lets you watch only single pages. There's another feature I think will meet your needs. In every article, you have &quot;toolbox&quot; left to the text of article. On its top you have &quot;Related changes&quot; link - it shows changes in every article current article is pointing to.

:Another way of monitoring pages is to use a program like [http://www.btinternet.com/~markwell/webmon/ Colin Markwell's WebMon] to periodically check the pages you are interested in and alert you when the have changed.  I do this for the pages that I edit most often.  You could tell WebMon to monitor the Related Changes for the contents page of the book.  Of course you might need to monitor several Related Changes pages if there is no comprehensive contents page.  As with any automated web client please don't overload the servers by careless use, that is, don't check too often.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:18, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

:The idea of watching the related changes pages sounds good, but i'm having trouble getting it to work.  when i click on Cookbooks, it gives me the option of watching the Cookbooks page. that works fine. However, when I click on &quot;related changes&quot; to the Cookbook, suddenly the watch button disappears. am i doing something wrong or this feature removed for a reason? if its not possible to add those pages to my watch list, i could always bookmark them in my browser, but i thought i should check here first. [[User:Kneague|Kneague]] 05:23, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:Looks like the related changes don't provide for watching; it isn't just the Cookbook that behaves that way.  [http://www.btinternet.com/~markwell/webmon/ WebMon] works though and gives you essentially the same feature.  In fact it could be argued that it is better as it will pop up a messge saying that the page has changed (WebMon Windows only I'm afraid but Unix users can probably throw a shell script together to do the same trick).  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:41, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:The webpage says that wikimedia has a &quot;flawed business model&quot;, but considering that wikimedia is a not-for-profit organization, i hardly doubt we have a business model at all. What pisses me off the most is the fact that a few screw-ups on the 'pedia have created a situation where some people are being libeled. Beyond that, attempts to correct obvious cases of libel have been reverted, or discouraged. wikimedia needs to be far more careful on this subject then they historically have been. However, i don't think that this particular lawsuit will hold water. Wikimedia is a not-for-profit, and the contributers are not affiliated with wikimedia in any business sense. Saying that wikimedia should be responsible for the actions of it's contributers is akin to saying that ISPs should be responsible for the content on rented webspace, or that telecom companies should be responsible for terrorists who make phone calls. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 02:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
:On a side note, i personally am against the practice of allowing anonymous users post anything at will. I know that such a sentiment is against the general wiki-spirit of things, but i can't see any benefit to allowing anonymous users to post anything that their hearts desire. Further more, people should be legally responsible for the content that they do contribute. By disallowing anonymous posters, and making vandals legally responsible for their contributions, i think that would cut down on alot of the bullshit and nonsense that does happen. Either we should make the vandals responsible for their vandalism, or we have to drop that responsibility in the lap of the wikiemedia foundation itself.

== Do we need CheckUser? ==

Probably some of you have heard of [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]] interface - allowing to find IP address of suspicious registered users. As you can see, we are having some cases of vandalism, there also were claims that people voting for BOTM or COTM were sockpuppets (not confirmed). Use of CheckUser is very restricted - only stewards have CheckUser rights on every project, and as you might know, it's not always easy to reach a steward. I think that we should have users with CheckUser rights, in order not to be dependant on stewards.

Choosing users with such rights will be similar to giving sysop rights, except that at least two users must have such rights (in able to control themselves). But before we can start discussion in [[WB:RFA]], we should decide whether we need ChecUser-s. What do you think? &lt;small&gt;(Preceding comment unsigned by [[User:Derbeth]])&lt;/small&gt;

:Yeah, I think it might be helpful to give access to a select few users, but I do not know how much it will need to be used. Over at WP, where this is much more needed, a very few of them currently have access to it, and there are a lot more of them than us. I don't know the necessity of this, quite yet. For votes and such, there should be some limit (say 30 edits) before their vote gets counted. That would rule out most socks. But when in doubt, I'd say [[WB:AGF|assume good faith]]. Just my 2 pennies. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

::I have stayed out of the whole Check User debate, but IMHO this is something that should be given to all admins.  I really don't understand the whole issue of &quot;privacy&quot; for a given user.  The Wikimedia Privacy policy clearly states that this information is available and can be used against somebody, like the current Siegenthaler case on Wikipedia, if they are caught saying something liabelous or illegal (like the notorious White Heritage Society Wikibook mentioned earlier, if the contributor was a German citizen).  This is merely another tool to help keep vandalism under control, and for some exceptionally rare circumstances can be used to identify sock puppets.  I have seen things like this on MUDs and IRC servers for decades (yes... decades) and if you are connected to the internet, there is no reason for your immediate connection to presume anonyminty unless you are specifically going through an anonymizer service.  Even then, your physical location could in theory still be traced, but you are relying on the policies of the anonymizer service to protect you at least for a brief period of time.  Only under the most exceptional circumstances could I see that this sort of feature could be abused, and the administrator vetting procedure alone IMHO is sufficient to keep this from going too far.&lt;p&gt;BTW, can a bureaucrat grant Check User status?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Upon further review of [[m:CheckUser Policy]], it seems as though Wikibooks will be a couple of years before we can even get the 30 or more active users to approve somebody for the CheckUser status, and it can only be granted by a Steward or Developer.  I really don't understand the privacy concerns here, but the only way I see the policy being changed is to run for the Wikimedia Foundation board with this issue as one of my platform planks.

::If you want to put your name up on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] page and add a section for CheckUser status, you got my vote right now.  And a standing offer to support any current admin on this project (baring any discussion for abuse where a vote for deadminship if it is currently occuring).  As for the requirement for two CheckUser privileges as a minimum, I think that is just simple paranoia from the group that wrote the CheckUser policy, not anything that came from actual experience (and a bad reason to write any rule of that nature).  The number of people with this &quot;privilege&quot; on all Wikimedia projects is appallingly small.  They aren't even giving this status to Stewards (although Stewards can give it to themself... if they can find a &quot;justification&quot;).  Since this option can also be given to non-admins, I would consider supporting other users here as well, but you would have to go through a vetting process that you might as well become an admin here too.  We could use the help even if done on a small scale.  Let's see if we can get the required 30 votes of support.

== Criticisms of Wikibooks ==

I thought that the Wikibooks community might be interested in this exchange I had with one of the early pioneers of e-book publishing, Ben Crowell.  I personally value his opinions considerably, perhaps even more than Jimbo's in many ways, and he does know how to organize collaborative e-book projects, with one GFDL'd Physics textbook he helped co-write that pre-dated Wikibooks by over three years.  You can read the full discussion at:

http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=170873&amp;cid=14234478

which is attached to an interview review that Jimbo gave earlier for Wikinews.

There are a number of interesting points brought up, including a very low S/N (signal to noise for non-techies) to be able to find a high quality Wikibook, and the quality of the stages icons.  I know there are many other areas of Wikibooks that need work, but some effort perhaps should be done to fix up the front page for those visitors who are perhaps not familiar with Wikimedia projects and editing styles.  I'm comfortable with Wikibooks, but I've been here for some time now.  The front page is the &quot;public personna&quot; of what we expect visitors to see.

His website, http://theassayer.org/ , is one that people on Wikibooks should also be aware of, as it lists free (as in speech as well as price) e-books, many of which can be used as resources for Wikibooks as well.  It may be wise to have some of the better quality Wikibooks be reviewed there as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:With en.wikipedia (if not other languages as well), it can be generally assumed that if one user starts an artical, other users will quickly come in and add to it. There are enough users on wikipedia, that you can assume that each given area of expertise can be well covered by contributers. Unfortunately for wikibooks, there simply aren't enough contributers to get any new project up and running (to a reasonable degree of completion) in any amount of time. Some books are started, but there aren't enough knowledgable contributers to complete it. Once a book has been dropped to the bottom of barrel, it is unlikely that potential contributers in the future will be able to find it, and they won't be able to coherently figure out what previous contributers had in mind. Textbooks require much more planning then a single encyclopedia artical, and it can be very difficult coming in the middle of the creation of the book. I know that I spend a good amount of time planning each new book I introduce, although i don't always leave enough notes around to aid future contributers in my absence. It's just a fact of life that we will need to deal with here until our numbers get larger. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 04:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::Wikipedia is an abnormally large project.

::But even when comparing Wikibooks to [[Wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]], for example, many users (including myself) contribute to the Wiktionary, but few users contribute to any Wikibook (except very large books like [[Cookbook]]). Wikibooks is split into many individual books. Sometimes I work on one book, then switch to another book (or to Wiktionary or some other wiki), and when I come back, no one has edited the first book except for me and the anonymous IP that fixed the spelling and grammar.

::Wikibooks also includes many abandoned stubs and incomplete books, which are only useful when some Wikibookian comes and restarts work on them, as I sometimes do.

::Some users confuse Wikibooks or Wikisource with a project like Wiktionary. [[MeatBall:AccidentalLinking|AccidentalLinking]] (just putting brackets around words that you like) fails here when it succeeds at Wiktionary. In fact, sometimes I change red links into Wikipedia interwiki links. When I have time, I would like to work on the Wikibooks FAQ at [[WB:FAQ]] and explain some of this. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::That's exactly the problem. When you walk away from a particular book, and come back to it, nothing substantial will have changed. I would say that our ratio of Active Contributers-Per-Book is incredibly low. I know that I personally am the primary contributer to 6 books. Most contributions to those books by other people are usually (but not always) limited to simple fixes. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 15:46, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

:::I really think we need a better method of either

:::1)Getting contributors together to coauthor books.  Books with 1 author stall easily, books with 3 or 4 authors have peer pressure working for them.  It might be a good idea to push people to get at least 1 co-author before starting a book.
:::2)Groups of people willing to move from book to book within a subject, improving one at a time.  THis way books get concentrated resources for a while.  Probably best done within bookshelves (a math group, a CS group, etc).  Anyone else interested?

:::I agree, we have way too few editors/book on most books.  I've written the differential equations wikibook, and other than a few typos corrected, I have had 1 correction and a short intoduction to the idea of a solution added.  Thats it.  No example problems, no content additions, nothing.  Its currently stalled since I moved in September, due to my lack of time.  Unless my life changes again, or hell freezes over and someone else contributes to it, it will likely stay that way for another year at least.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 18:32, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

http://theassayer.org/ now links to http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/infrastructure.html where Ben Crowell discusses infrastructure for free textbooks, including Wikibooks....

I would have to check the text of the [[GFDL]] and CC-BY-SA again, but I believe that images at Wikimedia Commons which use these licenses are not restricted to only free textbooks as Ben Crowell claims. Instead, a free image may be aggregated to a non-free book. I can also put a CC-BY-SA image on a GFDL wiki page, even though the two licenses are incompatible. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:39, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

== Hijacking a Bookshelf ==

Hello, my name is Paul, and I've been looking around Wikibooks for a few months, but haven't really contributed anything. I have a great interest in adding things to the economics bookshelf and changing the way it looks, but I can't seem to find any activity on the whole bookshelf. Should I just start making changes, or is this rude? Thanks, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:51, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:I was able to make lots of edits to [[Wikibooks:Computer software bookshelf|Computer software bookshelf]]. I had posted proposals at the [[Wikibooks talk:Computer software bookshelf|talk page]] with almost no response. It seems that the best choice is to just start making changes. It should not be &quot;rude&quot; because other users are free to make their own edits improving the bookshelf, and to revert bad changes.

:However, your idea of ''adding things to the bookshelf'' gave me attention. Note that bookshelves, in general, only hold existing books (the top-level Wikibooks modules, see [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]). So if you were planning to add many red links for proposed books, put red links at [[Wikibooks:Requested Wikibooks]] instead of a bookshelf. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:38, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I'm also wondering if perhaps we need to have a formal page for name change requests?  I don't know of any, and the usual forum so far is to simply ask a bureaucrat directly on their user talk page.  This shouldn't be a huge issue, but it is something that with multiple bureaucrats could become harder to deal with, and we should have a central place to put stuff like that.&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you compare Wikibooks to Wikipedia, yeah, we are as dead as your mother's web page.

== {{bad link|Qrai}} ==

The only two references to &quot;Qrai&quot; that I can find are the {{bad link|Qrai}} module at Wikibooks and http://www.geocities.com/qrai_dreamer/ at a free web host. It seems to me that one document is a derivative work of the other, which makes it either a copyright violation or an original work (candidate for speedy deletion). See my post at [[Talk:Qrai#Copyright violation]] where I explained my {{tl|copyvio}} tag on the [[Qrai]] page.

Recently, anonymous users edited the {{bad link|Qrai}} page and removed my {{tl|copyvio}} tag. One anonymous user (posting as an IP address but signing as [[Special:Contributions/David|&quot;User:David&quot;]], which is a user that never contributed to Wikibooks) posted to {{bad link|Talk:Qrai}}, claiming that these edits resolved the copyright-violation problem.

I would like someone other than me to examine the {{bad link|Qrai}} page and determine whether we have a [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]] license for the page and whether this page can remain at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:22, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== We have Cookbook namespace ==

hashad has just informed me at the IRC channel that Cookbook namespace had been created. You can browse it here: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=&amp;namespace=102].

----
I'm not sure how much time it takes to create one, but it might not be a bad idea for an admin or someone with a lot of knowledge of Wikibooks' structure to request that several namespaces be created to house bookshelves (such as a &quot;Programming&quot; namespace be created, etc.). It wouldn't be a bad idea in my opinion to add this to help organization. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:40, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, the current trend in [[Wikibooks:naming policy|naming policy]] is to ''not'' put books in bookshelf namespaces. For example, [[Programming:Ada]] changed its name to [[Ada Programming]]. The bookshelves themselves live in the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; project namespace. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:03, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Creating additional namespaces requires that a developer alter the configuration of the MediaWiki software.  We can do without creating any further new namespaces.  Stick to the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] and use sub-pages.  It's simple, and it doesn't require developer intervention for every single module.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 13:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

: A Bookshelf namespace might make sense (Bookshelf:Computer science), in the same way of Portal: namespace in Wikipedia.

:: Indeed. A look on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistat] and you see that Cookbook is our largest book.

==Textbook layout==
I've been looking across the site but haven't found a page that includes any sort of suggested layout/template/design for a Wikibook. Most Wikibooks do have a slight resemblance with each other, but many features vary e.g. some have a title page, a contents page and an inroduction page; some have these three all on one page. Is there any sort of suggested layout at all? 
----

No, there's no strict policy about it. Book authors are free to decide if a book should contain a title page or not, how to make navigation in the book etc. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:25, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Personaly, I think that having at least standard navigation buttons would be an advantage (at least a nextpage/nextchapter button).  I dont know how many times I've been reading a book and lost the ability to go to the next chapter.  You shouldn't have to be using the browser &quot;back&quot; buttons to get back to a table of contents to get anywhere. - Jason

It would be a good idea to have a standard navigation method but it should be optional, not compulsory.  It would be especially useful to have a standardized way of tagging pages so that single page books could be automatically created for printing (and converting to PDF, PostScript, etc.). --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:10, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

== Think free. Learn free. ==

Is there any chance of having this slogan changed to ''Think freely. Learn freely.''? Using adjectives when you mean to use adverbs is non-standard English, silly, wrong and annoys me no end. --[[User:Mooquackwooftweetmeow|Greg K Nicholson]] 17:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

:The &quot;slogan&quot; that is used in the logo was simply something that was established to help give an initial start to the project.  The Wikibooks logo certainly hasn't had the kind of attention that the Wikipedia logo recieved, and the slogan on the bottom IMHO is irrelvant as well.  There were a bunch of logos that were proposed back at the beginning of the project, but perhaps it is time to make it more up-to-date in terms of what we are doing here right now.  Mind you, designing a logo is not a trivial task, and can take a whole log of time and arguments back and forth over what it should look like.  Do you have any other suggestions?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:57, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== Beginner's Guide to Wikibooks==

To me, the links on the main page and community portal and recent changes are all helpful, but when I first started looking around Wikibooks, I didn’t really pay attention to all the links. I didn’t know what was more important to read, in what order I should read it, or where to find answers to questions without having to ask them. I propose a Beginner’s Guide to Wikibooks, that will do the following:

*Explain every link in “navigation” and “toolbox” in the sidebar
*Explain the difference between enforced policies, proposed policies, and guidelines
*Explain the use of templates and categories
*Explain different places to ask different questions (staff lounge, talk pages, IRC, study help desk)
*”What Can I Do?” Links to pages involving active discussion (vfd, NPOV and accuracy disputes) and explanations on how to do small editing jobs (double redirects, orphaned pages, stubs, naming policy)

Perhaps the help files already available just need to be revised, or they need to be put in better order, but I think that a Beginner’s Guide to Wikibooks could really draw more people into the community- I know that everyone I tell right now feels overwhelmed. Let me know what you think, and if you’d like to help me write this book, leave me a message on my talk page. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 20:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

* I think that that could be a useful tool. I might like to work on something like that. (I know this isn't your talk page, but I hope you see this anyway.) --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:42, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
* The [[Help:Contents|help]] already has all of those. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 03:48, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
* Yes, the way that Wikibooks introduces itself is a mess. My idea is to improve the [[Wikibooks:FAQ]], but I have not started work on that yet. Do look at [[Help:Contents]] as Uncle G suggested; it links to several useful pages. We do have several important rules in the policy [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]; we only allow certain types of books. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:23, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

== Centralized development status proposal ==

I have a proposal for centralizing the development stages of books inspired by the current usage in Spanish Wikibooks. See [[User:ManuelGR/Centralized development status proposal]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 21:00, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

That's a really good idea, but is it not a problem to create so many templates? [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 22:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't know. In Spanish Wikibooks we use the main namespace for /Development pages and we haven't experienced any problem. Does it change anything in using the template namespace?  I think it doesn't because the transclusion is still made. Is it a performance penalty for the server for using transclusion? I don't know, but I think the maintainability would be greatly improved. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:12, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

Good idea! [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 16:27, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

----
Since you mentioned the development stages, I will mention that our current status images - [[File:00%.svg]] [[image:25%.png]] [[image:50%.png]] [[image:75%.png]] [[File:100%.svg]] - are copyright violations. These images violate policy at [[Special:Upload]] which requires that all images have copyright tags. Normally, one would put [[Template:image copyright]] on the talk page of the uploading user.

I was hoping to tag the images with {{tl|no license}}, because I thought that someone would know the correct license and replace it with the correct tag. But the image descriptions seem to be protected against vandalism, so I cannot add the tag. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:34, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:All of these images are not copyright violations... they were created and uploaded by Karl Wick.  Commons has them listed as being released under the GFDL.  See [[commons:Wikibooks book development]] for more details.  Perhaps the images here on Wikibooks should be deleted instead so the images are drawn directly from commons?  BTW, the reason they are protected is because of their widespread use and the fact that vandals have overwritten these images in the past with... well... unsavory images instead that showed up all over Wikibooks simultaneously.  These images will need to be protected on commons if we draw from there instead. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:25, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for adding the {{tl|GFDL}} tags. I thought that someone would know the correct license. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:51, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== Law Issues ==
I think that perhaps wikibooks dealing with Law should have a tag at the top, saying perhaps something along the lines of &quot;This information is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have a legal problem you should consult a lawyer for specific legal advice. Do not wait since there may be a deadline which affects your legal claim. If you need immediate legal advice involving political opression, or other free speech violations, contact your local American Civil Liberties Union.&quot;  Just a bit of thought, for the author and webmaster's protection. [[User:CaladSigilon|CaladSigilon]] 15:24, 23 December 2005 (UTC)
:So be '''bold''' and do it. It seems like a reasonable addition. However, some will have a problem with the ACLU bit. I would support something like &quot;This information is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have a legal problem you should consult a lawyer for specific legal advice. Do not wait since there may be a deadline which affects your legal claim.&quot; That way there is a warning, but not an advertisment for a specific organisation. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:48, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

One wikibook discussion page that happens to be on my watchlist is being scrubbed and replaced by a commercial link every few days. History [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikimania05/DEV&amp;action=history here]. DNS lookup shows that the IPs attacking the page come from all over the map--Madison, Ann Arbor, Hicksville ... Typically, each IP is making its first edit with this vandalism.

:IMHO this is a page (the Wikimainia page and related ones) that should never have been on Wikibooks in the first place, precisely for the reasons you are mentioning.  The policy wasn't all that clear in the past, but after a considerable amount of discussion we have made it abundantly clear (with general concensus from people on other Wikimedia projects as well, not to metion the Foundation board itself) that Wikibooks is not to be a seed wiki for new Wikimedia projects.  What really needs to happen here is a trans-wiki of this page to Meta and a complete deletion of all the content... perhaps even a deletion/protection from recreation as well.  Any takers on trying to do the transwiki? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:13, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

:{{note|gnu}} http://www.gnu.org (To make this footnote, write &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{note|gnu}} http://www.gnu.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. Put the footnote at the bottom of the page, not here.)

:The part between &quot;|&quot; and &quot;}}&quot; must be the same for both the ref and the note, else they will not link together. I used &quot;gnu&quot; for this footnote. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:35, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, works great! I added a section about this to the &quot;Manual of Style.&quot;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 22:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

== Hide table of contents? ==

Is there a way to permanently hide the table of contents on a page? I have a page with many headings, each with a short paragraph of text. The reader can see the contents at a glance, no need for the TOC.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 23:00, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

: Sure.  Put &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the top of the page. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:14, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, that worked.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 00:32, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[In Memoriam: September 11, 2001]] ==

I am adding a link to '''[[MetaWikipedia:Meta:Requests for deletion#Sept11 Memorial Wiki]]''' to this staff lounge. It is a request to delete the http://sep11.wikipedia.org/ wiki. Because the request suggests moving pages to Wikibooks, and because we already have a page [[In Memoriam: September 11, 2001]], this discussion concerns English Wikibooks. I invite Wikibookians to participate in the discussion. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== Linking to subsection in a page? ==

&quot;How do I make links?&quot; explains how to make links to pages, but it doesn't say how to make links to a subsection of a page. In HTML I would put &lt;a name=&quot;MyTag&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/a&gt;, then link with &lt;a href=&quot;#MyTag&quot;&gt;.

: &lt;nowiki&gt; [[the/whole/page/address#heading]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;. Section headers automatically create shortcuts. For example:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Linking to subsection in a page?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:[[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Linking to subsection in a page?]]
: See how it works? Usual stuff apply. &lt;nowiki&gt; [[blahblah#blah | blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would display &quot;blah&quot; in a link. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:04, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

----
You can make links to a subsection of the same page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#name of subsection]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

If you link from one page to a subsection of a different page, the wiki software sometimes drops the subsection. For example, [[:fr:Project:Le Bistro#Livre d'humour]] links to the top of the page, not the &quot;Livre d'humour&quot; section. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:52, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== Navigational map for books ==

[[m:User:Nigelk]] has implemented an extension for structuring a set of pages in a book or slide-like manner, providing a TOC and previous-up-next links to pages. I think this extension would be useful to Wikibooks, so I invite all the contributors to discuss it: [[m:User:Nigelk/Nav]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:55, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Type 4''' is a casual format with two fundamental rules:
* Players may play spells for free (i.e., players have infinite mana)
* Each player may play only one spell per round(this serves as a limitation to balance the first rule)
Due to these two rules, the format is also known as &quot;Limited Infinity&quot;. Some players use additional rules, such as 'only rares and uncommons are allowed'.

Since the mana cost of spells is irrelevant, players can more freely use powerful rare cards in ways that would be impossible in &quot;normal&quot; Magic. This makes the gameplay very dynamic and exciting. Also it means that players can use cards that are normally &quot;unplayable&quot; due to prohibitively high mana costs, allowing players to utilise cards which are in low commercial demand. This makes the format quite cheap to get into; along with the &quot;high thrill&quot; gameplay, this has made the format quite popular.

Due to the nature of the format, many cards are banned - for example, a Fireball would instantly win the game, due to the players having infinite mana to pump into it. Also, there are many cards that are extremely weak in constructed Magic but extremely powerful in Type 4 - such as Vedalken Orrery, which allows the controller to play threats during other players' turns.

To prevent the format from becoming excessively overpowered, players' decks are usually drafted, rather than constructed. Often one player would construct a '''stack''' of approximately 200 cards, which is then distributed amongst the players using one of several drafting methods - eg [[Booster Draft]], Rochester Draft, or Winston Draft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../First_Cocoa_program_-_Hello_World|Previous Page: First Cocoa program - Hello World]] | [[../Some_Cocoa_essential_principles|Next Page: Some Cocoa essential principles]]

In the last chapter, we were introduced to Objective-C, and used it to write the &quot;Hello World&quot; code in an object-oriented fashion that worked with Cocoa. Now we will learn more about Objective-C as a language, and why it has certain advantages. This isn't meant as a complete guide to Objective-C, more of an overview. There is another wikibook that goes into far more detail. The original goal of Objective-C was to create a language that is efficient and productive, while avoiding being overburdened with too many features that are often only of theoretical benefit. As a strict superset of C, this does mean that some of C's drawbacks remain in Objective-C, but on the other hand it makes it much faster to learn. Becoming an expert in C++, with its myriad of features, can take years. It's probably fair to say that this learning curve for C++ means that much C++ code is not written as perfectly as it could be. Mastering Objective-C, by contrast, is quite easy, so code quality can be higher at an earlier stage. That said, Objective-C doesn't provide other features which can reduce bugs, such as const (read only) objects, and so forth. (In Cocoa, read-only objects are established by design, for example NSString is read only, whereas NSMutableString is read/write).

We have already seen much of the basic Objective-C syntax. Object methods are accessed using the square bracket notation, and parameters are passed using colons and parameter names. Methods are just like functions in C, only the syntax of how they are called differs. This different syntax is required because we need to specify WHAT object we are referring to, and WHICH method we'd like it to carry out. The square brackets link these two pieces of information together. Other than that they are just like functions&amp;nbsp;— they can return an optional value, and take any number of parameters.

The body of a method is also just like a function. We start with the name of the method and its return type, then enclose the method's code in curly braces, just as in C. Within the code, we have seen that we can refer to the object itself using 'self'. This saves us from having to find out our own address, the compiler will handle all of that. Most objects we'll encounter are subclasses of other, already existing objects. In Cocoa, there is a generic base object class called NSObject, which contains a lot of useful functionality that most classes will wish to inherit. So in general we can be sure that every object has an ancestor object. We can refer to the most immediate ancestor object (called the ''superclass'' of the object) within any method body using the shorthand 'super'. This is like self, but refers to the immediate ancestor instead.  Super is most often used when you need to override a method in your current class with a method in the superclass.  Self is used much more often than super, but occasionally we'll need to use super.

We saw how IB helped us out last chapter by creating the skeletons for our custom view class for us. Every class consists of two parts&amp;nbsp;— the ''interface'' and the ''implementation''. Usually these are placed in separate files, the .h and the .m respectively. The idea of this two-part design is both to make managing your code easier, and to encourage you to hide implementation details. Remember, objects should be usable from external code without the internal details of how they work being exposed. If we endeavour to hide all of the internal parts from the outside world, we will encounter fewer bugs, because we have eliminated dependencies on those details. Thus the interface (.h) file is used to tell the world about your object's methods, and the implementation file contains the code that makes it work, but should be of no interest to the outside world. If you use external libraries, very often you'll simply not have access to the .m files&amp;nbsp;— only the .h files are available. This is true of Cocoa itself; you will do well to follow the same model.

&lt;pre&gt;
 @interface GCHelloView : NSView
 {
     /* data members go here */
 }

     /* methods go here */

 @end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Within the curly braces you can add ''data members'' (or just members) to the class. Data members are like variables that are owned by concrete instances of the object. Every separate instance has its own copy of the data members, and they can have independent values. Data members are used to store the actual values of the properties of the object.

Methods are just like function prototypes. They go after the data member section, but before the '@end' statement.  As in C++, they are required, but unlike C++, only those that are unique to the class are required&amp;nbsp;— overrides of superclass methods don't need to be written out again. This helps the user of the object focus on what is unique and interesting about this object, as opposed to its superclasses. In other words the implementation file is a strict delta or difference file from the superclass.

Let's add some data members and methods, as an example.
&lt;pre&gt;

 #import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;

 @interface GCHelloView : NSView
 {
	int		_age;
	int		_size;
	NSString*	_text;
 }	
	- (void)	setAge:(int) age;
	- (int)		age;
	- (void)	setText:(NSString*) text withSize:(int) size;
	- (NSString*)	text;

 @end
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have added three data members, an integer called _age, an integer called _size, and an NSString called _text. The leading underscores used here are just part of the name, they have no special meaning, but they can be quite handy. Within code you write to implement an object's methods, you can refer to the object's data members simply by naming them, as if they were variables local to that function. By using the underscore, you can tell at a glance that they are data members, and not local variables. Any similar convention you might care to use is a good idea&amp;nbsp;— getting confused between what is local, global or an object's data member is a recipe for bugs.

We also added four methods, setAge:, age, setText:withSize: and text. Remember, the colons are part of the method's name. Method names should follow this convention in Cocoa. Whenever you want to set a property, create a method called setProperty, and whenever you want to ask for that property, create a method whose name is the property. Some programmers might be tempted to call such a method getProperty&amp;nbsp;— don't do this! In Cocoa, this naming scheme is more than just a convention, it is used later to allow us to automatically read and write properties in all sorts of simple and elegant ways that are awkward or impossible in other programming languages.

Since 'age' is just an integer, couldn't we just refer to it from elsewhere without having to go through all the overhead of calling a method? Yes we could, but we'd be breaking the rule about hiding the implementation. Suppose at a later stage you decided that this object should calculate the age by counting tree rings, instead of simply storing it. If external code was peeking at the integer, it would stop working when we changed the code within the age method so it counted tree rings. So never, never peek at data members from outside of an object. Even within the object, we should usually call our own methods to read our data member's values, since again, if later we change the way it works, we can minimise the number of places that need to be changed by making sure that there is only one main place that deals with that value.

Note how we declare a method's parameter types. We put the type in parentheses following the colon. We can also, as here, nominate a variable name for the parameter, though as in C this is optional. However, since the parameter name is built into the method, leaving it out doesn't leave us with an undocumented mystery, as it does in C. In other words:

 - (void)   setText:(NSString*) withSize:(int);

gives us all we need to know about what the method does, leaving no mystery. We have the names of the parameters (text and size) and their types (NSString* and int). For contrast, in C you might have had something like:

 void  setText( NSString*, int );

What is the second parameter? Unless the programmer used a more descriptive name or added a comment to tell us, we can't tell.

The return types of the method are also indicated using the same bracket notation. In addition, the leading '-' is important&amp;nbsp;— this tells us that this is an ''instance method'', one that pertains to a particular instance of an object. If we wanted to declare a class method, we would use a '+' symbol instead. This use of + and - allows us to tell at a glance which methods are which in the interface file. C++ by contrast uses the 'static' keyword for class methods.

Finally, notice that the interface ''imports'' the Cocoa/Cocoa.h file at the top. #import is just like #include, except that it automatically includes the file only one time, so you don't need to use any #define tricks to ensure it. Here we import Cocoa so that we get the interface for NSView, of which this is a subclass. At the very least, a class interface must somehow make details of its superclass known, though where you are subclassing a Cocoa object, using #import is best.

==Implementation==

The implementation of an object is placed in the .m file, and is declared like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &quot;GCHelloView.h&quot;

@implementation GCHelloView

- (id)		initWithFrame:(NSRect)frameRect
{
	if ((self = [super initWithFrame:frameRect]) != nil)
	{
		_text = @&quot;Hello World!&quot;;
		_size = 48;
		_age = 16;
	}
	return self;
}

- (void)		setAge:(int) age
{
	_age = age;
}

- (int)		age
{
	return _age;
}


- (void)		setText:(NSString*) text withSize:(int) size
{
	[text retain];
	[_text release];
	_text = text;
	_size = size;
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
}


- (NSString*)	text
{
	return _text;
}

- (void)		drawRect:(NSRect)rect
{
	NSPoint					p;
	NSMutableDictionary*	        attribs;
	NSColor*				        c;
	NSFont*					fnt;
	
	p = NSMakePoint( 10, 100 );
	
	attribs = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
	c = [NSColor redColor];
	fnt = [NSFont fontWithName:@&quot;Times Roman&quot; size:_size];
	
	[attribs setObject:c forKey:NSForegroundColorAttributeName];
	[attribs setObject:fnt forKey:NSFontAttributeName];
	
	[[self text] drawAtPoint:p withAttributes:attribs];
	
	[[NSColor blueColor] set];
	NSFrameRect([self bounds]);
}

@end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The implementation of an object is everything between '@implementation' and '@end'. The methods are coded just as a C function. Here we have our unique methods, setText:withSize: and so on, and also a couple of methods that we inherited from our superclass, initWithFrame: and drawRect: These last two don't appear in our interface file, as they are not a unique feature of this class. To override them, we simply redefine the methods in the implementation.

The setAge: and age methods should be fairly obvious&amp;nbsp;— the values are simply assigned to the data member _age, or return its value. Many methods that simply read and write properties of an Objective-C object are like this&amp;nbsp;— short and simple. It can get a bit tedious to write these all out if you have many properties, but don't be tempted to avoid this, because hiding the implementation is much more important in the long run.

The setText:withSize: method is a little more complex, since we need to retain and release objects. We'll be covering this in detail in the next chapter, so don't worry about it for now. However, this is required most times that you are using objects as properties of other objects, which will happen a lot. Simple values such as the int '_size' can just use simple assignments. The last line, [self setNeedsDisplay:YES] is an example of calling one of your own methods. Here, we use the method setNeedsDisplay which is inherited from NSView. This signals to Cocoa that the view content has changed and should be redrawn. Cocoa makes a note of that and will cause our drawRect: method to get called in due course, so anyone who makes use of the setText:withSize: method of our view will see those new settings appear immediately.

The initWithFrame: method also sets these various data members to some default values, so that the object will work even if nobody ever comes along and sets the text, its size, etc. Every object has an 'init' method whose purpose is to establish the object's default properties so that it will function properly right out of the box. Sometimes, objects will need parameters sent to the init method, so a different version of an init method is needed, as the way initWithFrame: was coded.  Note that the init method's first job is to call the superclass's initWithFrame: method. This happens all the way back up the chain of ancestor classes until everyone has initialized what it knows about. So there are two main rules to follow when writing your init method:

* call your super's init method
* initialize only what you know about (your own data members only)

The init method must return 'self' as its result, provided that the super's initialization succeeded. If not, it will return nil and so should you. If your own initialization fails, but your super's succeeded, you should return nil also. This indicates to the caller that something went wrong while making your object. More about this later.

==Some Objective-C advantages==

Like C++ and other object-oriented languages, Objective-C supports ''polymorphism''. This means two different things. In the first place, it means that you can have different methods that differ only according to their parameter types, and the correct one will be called according to what you're passing. This is static polymorphism, so in C++:

 void setAge( int );
 void setAge( float );

are two distinct methods. The right one is called depending on whether you pass an int or a float. While handy, this can get confusing, especially when automatic type conversion is taking place, as it frequently does between simple scalar values. Objective-C doesn't support this type of potentially ambiguous polymorphism. Instead, because parameters are an inherent part of a method's name, you can make it much clearer, e.g:

 - (void) setAgeWithInt:(int);
 - (void) setAgeWithFloat:(float);

There is no ambiguity, since you have to name which one you mean explicitly. This might reduce the potential for bugs for some people, though C++ programmers might grumble.

The second kind of polymorphism is ''dynamic polymorphism''. We have already seen this in action in our simple program. When Cocoa calls the view's drawRect: method, it actually doesn't have a clue that the object in question is a GCHelloView, and not a plain vanilla NSView. It calls our object ''as if it were'' an NSView. The method call resolves to our custom object however, and so our code gets called, allowing it to do its thing. All object-oriented languages need to support this kind of polymorphism, so the fact that Objective-C does too is no surprise.

What is different is that Objective-C resolves the method at runtime. This is in contrast to languages such as C++ that resolve everything at compile time, building a set of fixed tables that allow this apparent magic to occur. For the typical case, this runtime ''binding'' makes no difference. However, there are other cases where the runtime binding makes a huge difference, and this adds a degree of power to Objective-C that is absent from C++ and others. It safely allows us to use ''anonymous'' objects, and even null objects. It allows us to create a delayed method call called an ''invocation'' that can be used later, and it permits things like Undo to be implemented much more easily. It greatly helps us create a graphical user interface for our code, because commands, actions and so on of various window controls can be made extremely general. It also permits something called &quot;Key-value observing&quot; and &quot;key paths&quot; which are incredibly powerful&amp;nbsp;— more on these later.

Let's suppose we have an object that must respond to a click on a button in a window. Really, the button shouldn't need to care which sort of object it is controlling, only that when it is clicked, it should do something. Let's suppose a method exists called 'action:', and the button knows that it should call this on an object called 'target' when clicked. In a traditional language, the target object's type must be known to the button, so that it can determine if a method called action: really exists. Once that type is indicated to the button, it can only ever deal with objects of that type, or their subclasses. However, in Objective-C, we could hook up totally unrelated objects to the button, and as long as they implemented action:, they would respond to the button. This is a great improvement in flexibility. Many GUI elements such as buttons and menus use this type of target/action approach.

An 'anonymous' object has a type of 'id'. Anywhere you see 'id' used as an object type, an anonymous object reference is created. 'id' can stand in for any type of object whatsoever.

In Objective-C, the value ''nil'' has a type of id. This means that nil is an object! (NULL, meaning nothing, is still available) In other languages, especially C and C++, we must be careful not to use an object reference of nil, meaning we have to litter our code with lots of checks, like:

 if ( object != nil )
     object-&gt;action();

In Objective-C, we don't need to bother. Calling a nil object's methods is harmless, because of the runtime binding of the method call. Of course the action won't do anything, but it won't crash.

Another example. Let's suppose we want to invoke a periodic action on one of our objects. Cocoa has a handy class for setting up periodic actions, NSTimer. One day we might want our 'GCWidget' class to have its 'dwim' method called once a minute, another time we have an unrelated HPSprocket class that needs its 'fubar' method called every 5 seconds. In a traditional language, both of these classes would have to inherit from a common class known to NSTimer, and in addition the periodic method would have to have the exact same name. But because of the runtime binding and anonymous objects, NSTimer simply needs to be told the method name to  call, and call it on an object type of 'id'. If the object implements the method, it does its thing. If not, nothing bad happens.

Objective-C implements the runtime binding using a mechanism called a ''selector''. This helps make the process a lot more efficient&amp;nbsp;— as you might imagine if a method lookup really had to go through and compare the actual names of the methods letter by letter it would be very slow. Instead, at compile time Objective-C converts every method name into a simple unique number which is much faster to lookup. There is still a cost compared to C++'s approach, but the benefits are worth it. In practice, a method call in Objective-C is probably only about 2 or 3 times slower than a C++ method call.

We can obtain the selector for a method using the '@selector( ... )' function. Sometimes we need to do this when we are setting up targets and actions, as in our timer example above.

We have already seen the basics of Cocoa in action. Last chapter, we talked about inheriting from NSObject, and how we must make sure that we call an object's chain of init methods. Here, we'll go into more detail about this, as it's important. Then, we'll talk about memory management.

==Creation==

Initialising an object properly is your responsibility. Unlike C++, there is no automatic ''constructor'' method, nor an automatic ''destructor'' method. However, we can easily do without these as long as we are aware of a few simple rules. Following the rules is necessary for success in Cocoa.

When we instantiate an object:

 id   myObject = [NSString alloc];

All we get back is a blob of uninitialised memory. If we were to use this object now, we'd be very unlikely to get the results we wanted. It could even crash. We MUST call the initialiser method:

 id   myObject = [[NSString alloc] init];

Then we'll be OK. You'll see this alloc/init combination all the time. So why doesn't alloc simply call init as part of its internals and be done with it? Wouldn't that save us the time and reduce the chance of forgetting? Yes, except for one problem. Sometimes we need a different version of init, that requires a parameter. Since alloc can't know which one we'd like, it leaves the call to us.

Every object has a version of init that acts as the 'master' init - the one we must call when we make that object. Things are arranged so that any other variations of init call it, so everything works properly. The master init method is called the ''designated initialiser''. In most cases this will be the vanilla 'init' method, so using any of the other variants will call init internally. Where this isn't the case, the documentation should indicate the designated initialiser.

'init' is just an ordinary method call, it has no special status like a C++ constructor. Thus it's your responsibility to write the code in init correctly, making sure you call your super's designated initialiser (or any of its initialiser methods that eventually call through the designated initialiser) first. Once you've done that, you should initialise your own part of the object.

Initialisation is permitted to fail. Your object might want to allocate a large block of memory for example. If there is no memory available, you should cleanup anything you've allocated already, then return nil from your init method. Since nil objects can be called safely, it means that running out of memory (for example) will not crash the program.

==Destruction==

When an object is no longer required, its 'dealloc' method will be called. If you allocated anything as part of your initialisation, or operation of your object, you need to override this method and deallocate it. Once done, you should call the super's dealloc method. You will be frequently overriding dealloc, so become familiar with doing it. However, dealloc is rarely called directly. Instead, it is called indirectly when an object is released.

==Retain and Release==

Every object that inherits from NSObject implements retain and release. This is a simple memory management technique that relies on ''reference counting''. An object keeps track of how many references there are to it within the program. When there are no more references, the count is zero and it is deallocated. In Cocoa, the reference count is often referred to as the ''retain count''. It's the same thing.

The retain method increments the count, and the release method decrements it. When the count reaches zero, dealloc is called automatically.

When an object is first created, its retain count is set to 1. Thus:

 id  myObject = [[NSString alloc] init];

'myObject' has a retain count of 1, because there is only one reference to it.

If we then do:

 [myObject release];

It will be immediately deallocated, because the count is decremented from 1 to 0, and dealloc gets called. By calling release, we are telling Cocoa we are no longer interested in this object here, and will not refer to it further.

Some people find retain and release confusing, but the rules are really quite simple. If you create an object, you are responsible for releasing it. If you create a new reference to an existing object, you are responsible for releasing it. You create an object using either alloc, or copy on another object, so any time you use these, you need to be aware of the retain/release responsibility. It is yours. If you forget to release, things will probably work out, but you have a ''memory leak'', which can cause problems down the track.

Let's look at the second part, creating a second reference. Suppose you have an object which is part of another object. We saw this in our earlier example, where our GCHelloView had an NSString as a data member. When we are passed an NSString from outside, we don't know who made it, who is responsible for it - we only know it's not us! However, by storing it as a data member, we are creating a new reference to that same string, so we must retain it. What about any previous string that we had there? Well, we created a reference to it, so we must release it.

 &lt;pre&gt;
 - (void)		setText:(NSString*) text withSize:(int) size
 {
	[text retain];
	[_text release];
	_text = text;
	_size = size;
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

So now we can see what's going on here. We retain 'text' because we are creating a new reference to it, our _text data member, and we are releasing the previous value as we are no longer concerned with it. We don't care where the string came from originally or who made it, we are done with it, so we release it. If someone else is still retaining it, it will continue to exist, but if not, it will be deallocated. Now, what if 'text' and '_text' are in fact the same string? This can easily happen. If we release the old one first, it might get deallocated. The following retain will be acting on a stale reference, which is likely to crash (note, unlike the case of accessing nil, accessing a deallocated object is unsafe). Thus by retaining before we release, we avoid that potential snag. &quot;retain before release&quot; is a common and sensible approach.

Note that the retention of objects is efficient, because only a simple count needs to be incremented. If you were required to make a copy of every object, not only would it be much slower, but you'd have the potential for different copies to get out of step with each other, as well as using up much more memory than necessary.

==Autorelease==

What happens when we make an object, but we want to hand it over to someone else? How can we ensure that it stays valid long enough to be retained by the other object, before we release it? Look at this:

 id myObject = [[NSString alloc] init];
 return myObject;

Does the receiver know that this object needs to be released? If no-one releases this object, then we have a memory leak. To eliminate the burden of releasing, we want to mark it for release, when the receiver has done with it. Autorelease designates the object to be released later, it says 'retain the object until the next memory pool is drained'. If you are not explicitly draining the pool, then you can be assured it the return value will remain for use in the receiver's immediate scope.

 id myObject = [[[NSString alloc] init] autorelease];
 return myObject;

This code is OK, since the returned object is valid, but responsibility for ownership has been passed to the pool.

When control returns to the main event loop, the pool can be sure that any objects that have an interest in the object will have retained it by then, and so it releases all of the objects it has. Any that have no references will be deleted, any that do have references will become owned by the objects retaining them. Everything remains neat and tidy.

Most factory methods return autoreleased objects. This is entirely sensible, and if you write a factory method, you should do the same. For example:

 NSColor* red = [NSColor redColor];

NSColor's redColor class method return an autoreleased colour object. If you want to keep this object, you should retain it. If you just want to use it for a few lines, then you don't need to do anything - it will get deleted automatically later, but only after you've finished.

In practice, retain, release and autorelease are straightforward. Some people seem to find it confusing but perhaps they think it's more complicated than it is. To keep an object you're given, retain it. Objects you make are already retained.  To throw it away and refer to it no more, release it. If you write a factory method, autorelease it. If you are simply making use of an object returned by a factory method for a short while, do nothing.

==Object values==

What about when a property of your object is another object, and someone else wants to read that property? Should you retain, autorelease, what? No, you should do nothing. You are already retaining it as it's your property. If the caller wants to retain it, that's their business, and autorelease doesn't come into it because it's not a factory method. So simply return the object verbatim. So:

 - (NSString*) text
 {
    return _text;
 }

is absolutely correct.

Note that if the caller did retain it, you are still completely free to release it when you're done with it. What would be an error would be for the caller NOT to retain it if it wanted to use the value for an extended time (being a time longer than the current event). This is not a new rule - if the caller creates a reference to an object, it must retain it. But if all it needs to do is use that object for a short time, within a single function say, it can simply do so and not worry that it will get released by someone else.

==Event loops==

We have touched on the event loop without explaining what it is. In a Cocoa application, user activities result in ''events''. These might be mouse clicks or drags, typing on the keyboard, choosing a menu item, and so on. Other events can be generated automatically, for example a timer firing periodically, or something coming in over the network. For each event, Cocoa expects there to be an object or group of objects ready to handle that event appropriately. The event loop is where such events are detected and routed off to the appropriate place. Whenever Cocoa is not doing anything else, it is sitting in the event loop waiting for an event to arrive. (In fact, Cocoa doesn't poll for events as suggested, but instead its main thread goes to sleep. When an event arrives, the OS wakes up the thread and event processing resumes. This is much more efficient than polling and allows other applications to run more smoothly).

Each event is handled as an individual thing, then the event loop gets the next event, and so on. If an event causes an update to be required, this is checked at the end of the event and if needed, and window refreshes are carried out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wow... impressive... you knocked this out quickly. A couple of things I would like to see... you have three terminal objectives grouped together and all the enabling objectives grouped together. Can you break these out? I would like to see one terminal and then the attached enabling. Take a look at the Fire Officer IV outline to see the way to set up the outline.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Situation: I teach 8th language arts and have had a difficult time reaching some of the students, especially in my 5th period. In this class, I have many students who are below grade level. One particular student, Mandy, refuses to write or read anything I give her. &quot;Miss, why do I have to read this anyway?&quot; I try to explain to her that it is required for the 8th grade and that she might finding it interesting if she gave it a chance. She just brushes me off. When I assign writing projects, she would rather take a zero instead. I know that she has potential; she seems very bright. I just don't know how to reach her. --New Teacher (sample)


Response #1: Relevant Reading Materials You have tough situation on your hands. As a teacher of Language Arts myself, I find that students who refuse to read or write usually feel that the stuff we assign them is boring. (Granted after reading it over and over for the last couple of years, I might agree!) One way I work around this is to bring popular trade books or magazines. At the beginning of the year, I give all my students an interest survey, which helps me get ideas about their hobbies and what topics they like. Then, I visit with the librarian to see what materials we might have available. Sometimes, I build my own library of interesting materials by going to yard sales. I hope this helps. --Miss. Carter, Central Middle School, Texas (sample)

Response #2: Success Builds on Success Having worked with at-risk students in my district for the last 5 years, I have discovered that students like Mandy oftentimes refuse to do work because they believe that they are not good in the subject. So, rather than try, they simply don't put forth the effort. This way if they fail, they can chalk it up to not caring. I would begin with small, simple reading passages or assignments. These assignments should have high interest value and incorporate higher thinking skills. If Mandy can complete these smaller assignments in class with success, she might begin to love her fear of failing and begin to see herself as successful. --Mr. Tweedmoore, Western Middle School, Alaska (sample)

      <text xml:space="preserve">When moving an RMI application over to Jini, the main issue is to stop [[Jini and Network Computing:Subclassing the UnicastRemoteObject class|subclassing UnicastRemoteObject]] and switch to [[Jini and Network Computing:Using Jini Exporters|using Jini Exporters]] instead.  

The RMI registry is replaced with [[Jini and Network Computing:The Jini Lookup Service|the Jini Lookup Service]] (referred to with LUS in many cases)).  The RMI registry is for local registration and remote lookup.  The Jini Lookup Service can be used from anywhere on the network that the appropriate routing is available.  The [[Jini and Network Computing:Jini Service Lookup Specification|Jini Service Lookup Specification]] provides for the use of multicast lookup which allows for come as you are computing to occur with no specific knowledge of the network.  Where multicast is not supported or routed, unicast lookup can be used with specific IP addresses/host names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The classic specification of an RMI codebase is typically performed using the &lt;tt&gt;java.rmi.server.codebase&lt;/tt&gt; system property on the command line starting the Java Virtual Machine.  There are more powerful techniques that allow a single JVM to serve out remote objects with varied codebases.  This mechanism is through the codebase annotation service provider interface available through the [[Jini and Network Computing:java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSPI|RMIClassLoaderSPI]] abstract class.

One can simply subclass this class, providing the appropriate annotations that are appropriate for the classes in the getClassAnnotation(Class) call.  A container could allow the user to specify a codebase that is associated with a classpath that it could associate with a specific ClassLoader.  Then the implementation of RMIClassLoaderSPI would use the passed Class to find the appropriate ClassLoader that would then designate the codebase annotation that applied.

This entire book makes absolutely no sense.  No offense, but I think this entire book hurts people more than making them want to learn. Perhaps the author is not English-native, however, that is no excuse for the constant mis-use of the English language.  Please edit/remove this book as soon as possible. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:67.150.6.135|67.150.6.135]] ([[User talk:67.150.6.135|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/67.150.6.135|contribs]]) 06:45, 18 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

Excuse me, but your comment is awfully negative and undermines the spirit of this website, not to mention it is just very rude.  I personally enjoyed this Wikibook very much and I think it could be very helpful to someone.  Yes, it is obvious that English is not the first language of this author.  I however, admire the courage it took for this person to write on a subject that is obviously very important to him, even though he is still struggling with the language.  Maybe, instead of making negative comments, someone like you could actually help the author out and edit some of this Wikibook, so that it may be more clear and coherent for others readers.  It is nay-sayers like you completely undermine the whole point of Wiki, and quite frankly, you make me sick.  Good day. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:12.47.73.242|12.47.73.242]] ([[User talk:12.47.73.242|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/12.47.73.242|contribs]]) 20:58, 18 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

== Message from Author ==

Well, not being harsh, it will take time for the completion of the book. So I'll slowly first put the main idea as to what to write. Then I'll try my best to make the English crystal clear as possible. You are most welcome to help. You can edit the module for now because it needs some attention. Then you can edit pages especially the ones which are provided by development stages mark.
Note:- If you are adding a &quot;Personal Note From Author&quot; or adding your preface please assign a signature with timestamp to know who worte what. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] ([[User talk:Mastermind 007|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Mastermind 007|contribs]]) 10:41, 19 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

== Regarding: How To Become A Good Student ==

Actually, the idea for the book is a very intriguing one at best. It is important that students know how to become better students. I wish that you would only provide constructive criticism. I thank the author for starting this. I will be looking for several links to organizations and books that further educate students. I speak from personal experience because at the moment, I am a student. I'm involved with several organizations that deal with leadership, changing paradigms, and other community work. I would be happy to help you in my spare time with all that needs to be done.--Helius 16:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Work For Some ==

Hello! Thank you for sending discussions. I'm the one who came up with the idea of this book, so if you have queries please respond to me. I would be delighted if you can help especially in the English grammar of this book. Please try an effort also to make this book with a good look. Hope you understand the motto of this book! Have a good day and enjoy reading this Wikibook. --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 11:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Reminder ==

This is an important reminder of ones who are currently reading this book. This book is mostly for students in order to enlighten them for their future. Since it's for students, I've kept the data as brief and easy as I can. So, if you're editing a section or a part of this book, try to keep it small so that it would be easy for you as well as for other students to understand. Hope you enjoy this book!!! --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 11:53, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Simple Request ==

Hello! Everybody. I think I've worked on this book as much as I can and I think it deserves either a &quot;Collaboration Of The Month&quot; or &quot;Book Of The Month&quot; award. Please support this book as much as possible. Have a good time! --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 17:21, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Failed Editing Attempts ==

It was my intention to spend this entire editing session fixing grammatical and communicational errors within this book. I quickly realized, however, that it is, as an editor, an extremely difficult book to approach, due, in large part, to the plentiful usage of first person point-of-view, and the constant basis on the author's personal experiences. This circumstance makes it difficult to both refine grammar and to add new advice and/or content beyond the author's own contributions. This is quite a shame given the author's obviously kind-hearted intentions. That is to say, it is unfortunate that such a book as this should suffer because of communicational barriers.

If the author is still interested in producing and developing this book, I would recommend to them that they take a day to revamp the book from a [[w:The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People|7 Habits of Highly Effective Adults/Teens/Etc.]] style, to a more neutral POV manual of advice, so that it may be more easily approached by outside editors. My email address can be found here if the author would like to discuss this with me personally: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Mitglied_von_die_Elektronischenzyklop%C3%A4die_Schriftleitung Wikipedia Email Service] --[[User:24.175.54.43|24.175.54.43]] 06:32, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== Major Revisions/Additions ==

D. I just wrote in a preface which described the importance and use of this page. I tried to explain the importance of this page as simply and as concisely as possible. If anyone can improve it or add additional information I would invite them to edit it. 

I just spent a fair bit of time on each of the chapters (except the last one, which is only a single paragraph at the moment) and I am quite happy with how things turned out. Overall the thing is still simply too difficult to read, but I intend on fixing this soon. Also, despite having covered the very basics, we need to spend time getting some more useful content into each of the chapters. I think the chapter on management is the most important one at the moment.

''Chapter 1: Motivation'' is fine at the moment, but nothing too special. ''Chapter 2: Concentration on studies'' has been improved nicely, but once again will need work later. ''Chapter 3: Behaviour'' is almost useless at the moment... I really can't see some guy reading that chapter and getting anything out of it. However, I do see potential in it. ''Chapter 4: Management'' is where I feel we should focus our energy. Putting things like 'how to keep a good study plan' would be invaluable in this book. ''Chapter 5: Helping Others And Advising''... I seriously think this would be one of the things that should be put at the very end of the book, as the book is about helping ''yourself'', not others. But if this book was fairly developed, then I would welcome it.

Well I'll see what I can do, but I know this could be a very good book if we work on it.
--[[User:Babij|Babij]] 08:31, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

Agreed. Needs major work before it can be considered complete. Plus - please get rid of the annoying and poorly designed logo at the top of the page. It's unnecessary.

Yes, naming convention in this book is okay. Plese don't sign your name in book pages - authors should be mentioned once, in separate chapter (I see you already have one, that's fine).

You can add nice navigation to your book - see [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Navigation]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

I was poking through the [[Special:Lonelypages|ophaned pages]] and stumbled across [[Trouble With Mandy]].  I was about to put it up for [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] when I noticed it might belong to your [[Guide to First Year Teaching]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

In the following we will provide some notes on numerical optimization algorithms. As there are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_%28mathematics%29 numerous methods] out there, we will restrict ourselves to the so-called ''Gradient Methods''. There are basically two arguments why we consider this class as a natural starting point when thinking about numerical optimization algorithms. On the one hand, these methods are really workhorses in the field, so their frequent use in practice justifies their coverage here. On the other hand, this approach is highly intuitive in the sense that it somewhat follow naturally from the well-known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point properties of optima]. In particular we will concentrate on three examples of this class: the ''Newtonian Method'', the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' and the class of ''Variable Metric Methods'', nesting amongst others the ''Quasi Newtonian Method''.

Before we start we will nevertheless stress that there does not seem to be a &quot;one and only&quot; algorithm but the performance of specific algorithms is always contingent on the specific problem to be solved. Therefore both experience and &quot;trial-and-error&quot; are very important in applied work. To clarify this point we will provide a couple of applications where the performance of different algorithms can be compared graphically. Furthermore a specific example on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood Maximum Likelihood Estimation] can be found at the end. Especially for statisticians and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics econometricians] the Maximum Likelihood Estimator is probably the most important example of having to rely on numerical optimization algorithms in practice.

==Theoretical Motivation==

Any numerical optimization algorithm has solve the problem of finding &quot;observable&quot; properties of the function such that the
computer program knows that a solution is reached. As we are dealing with problems of optimization two well-known results seem
to be sensible starting points for such properties. 

''If f is differentiable and &lt;math&gt;x^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a (local) minimum, then'' 

&lt;math&gt; (1a) \quad Df(x^\star) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''i.e. the Jacobian &lt;math&gt; D f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is equal to zero''

and

''If f is twice differentiable and &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; is a (local) minimum, then''

&lt;math&gt; (1b) \quad x^{T}D^2 f(x^\star)x \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''i.e. the Hessian &lt;math&gt; D^2 f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix pos. semidefinite].''

In the following we will always denote the minimum by &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt;. Although these two conditions seem to represent statements that help in finding the optimum &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt;, there is the little catch that they give the implications of &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; being an optimum for the function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. But for our purposes we would need the opposite implication, i.e. finally we want to arrive at a statement of the form: &quot;If some condition &lt;math&gt; g(f(x^\star))&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; is a minimum&quot;. But the two conditions above are clearly not sufficient in achieving this (consider for example the case of &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3 &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; Df(0) = D^2 f(0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; x^{\star} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;). Hence we have to look at an entire neighborhood of &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; as laid out in the following sufficient condition for detecting optima:


''If &lt;math&gt; Df(x^\star) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x^{T}D^2f(z)x \geq 0, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z \in \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta)&lt;/math&gt;, then: &lt;math&gt;x^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a local minimum.''

''Proof: For'' &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta) &lt;/math&gt; ''let'' &lt;math&gt; z=x^\star + t(x-x^\star) \in \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;. ''The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem Taylor approximation] yields:'' &lt;math&gt; f(x) - f(x^\star) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(x-x^\star)^{T}D^2 f(z)(x-x^\star) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, ''where'' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; ''denotes an open ball around'' &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta) = \{x : ||x - x^\star|| \leq \delta \} &lt;/math&gt; ''for'' &lt;math&gt; \delta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.


In contrast to the two conditions above, this condition is sufficient for detecting optima - consider the two trivial examples 

&lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3 &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; Df(x^\star = 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; x^{T}D^2f(z)x = 6 z x^2 \not\geq 0 \quad (e.g. \,\,z = -\frac{\delta}{2})&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^4&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; Df(x^\star = 0) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{T}D^2f(z)x = 12 z^2 x^2 \geq 0 \quad \forall z&lt;/math&gt;.

Keeping this little caveat in mind we can now turn to the numerical optimization procedures.

== Numerical Solutions ==

All the following algorithms will rely on the following assumption:

''(A1) The set &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(0)}) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n | f(x) \leq f(x^{(0)})\}&lt;/math&gt; is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space compact]''

where &lt;math&gt; x^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt; is some given starting value for the algorithm. The significance of this assumption has to be seen in the ''Weierstrass Theorem'' which states that every compact set contains its ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremum supremum]'' and its ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum infimum]''. So ''(A1)'' ensures that there is some solution in &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(0)}) &lt;/math&gt;. And at this global minimum &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; it of course holds true that &lt;math&gt; D(f(x^\star)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. So - keeping the discussion above in mind - the optimization problem basically boils down to the question of solving set of equations &lt;math&gt; D(f(x^\star)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

=== The Direction of Descent === 

The problems with this approach are of course rather generically as &lt;math&gt; D(f(x^\star)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; does hold true for 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point maxima and saddle points] as well. Hence, good algorithms should ensure that both maxima and saddle points are ruled out as potential solutions. Maxima can be ruled out very easily by requiring &lt;math&gt; f(x^{(k+1)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt; i.e. we restrict ourselves to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence sequence] &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; such that the function value decreases in every step. The question is of course if this is always possible. Fortunately it is. The basic insight why this is the case is the following. When constructing the mapping &lt;math&gt; x^{(k+1)} = \varphi(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the rule how we get from &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;) we have two degrees of freedoms, namely

* the direction &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; and

* the step length &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence we can choose in which direction we want to move to arrive at &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' how far this movement has to be. So if we choose &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; in the &quot;right way&quot; we can effectively ensure that the function value decreases. The formal representation of this reasoning is provided in the following


''Lemma: If &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Df(x)^{T}d^{(k)} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then: &lt;math&gt;\exists \bar{\sigma} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
such that''

&lt;math&gt; f(x + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}) &lt; f(x) \quad \forall \sigma \in
(0,\bar{\sigma}) &lt;/math&gt;

''Proof: As &lt;math&gt;Df(x)^{T} d^{(k)} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Df(x)^{T} d^{(k)} = \lim_{\sigma \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}) - f(x)}{\sigma^{(k)}}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;f(x + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}) &lt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; small enough.''

=== The General Procedure of Descending Methods === 
A direction vector &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies this condition is is called a ''Direction of Descent''. In practice this Lemma allows us to use the following procedure to numerically solve optimization problems.

1. Define the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence sequence] &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; recursively via &lt;math&gt; x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; 

2. Choose the direction &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; from local information at the point &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Choose a step size &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; that ensures [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] of the algorithm.

4. Stop the iteration if &lt;math&gt;|f(x^{(k+1)}) - f(x^{(k)})| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is some chosen tolerance value for the minimum

This procedure already hints that the choice of &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are not separable, but rather dependent. Especially note that even if the method is a descending method (i.e. both &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are chosen according to ''Lemma 1'') the convergence to the minimum is not guaranteed. At a first glance this may seem a bit puzzling. If we found a sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; such that the function value decreases at every step, one might think that at some stage, i.e. in the limit of ''k'' tending to infinity we should reach the solution. Why this is not the case can be seen from the following example borrowed from W. Alt (2002, p. 76).

====Example 1====
* Consider the following example which does not converge although it is clearly descending. Let the criterion function be given by
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, let the starting value be &lt;math&gt;x^{(0)} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, consider a (constant) direction vector &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}=-1&lt;/math&gt; and choose a step width of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{k+2}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the recursive definition of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence sequence] &lt;math&gt;\{x^{(k)} \}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; follows as

&lt;math&gt;(2) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + (\frac{1}{2})^{k+2} (-1) = x^{(k-1)} - (\frac{1}{2})^{k+1} - (\frac{1}{2})^{k+2} = x^{(0)} -
\sum_{j=0}^{k} (\frac{1}{2})^{j+2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt; x^{(k)} &gt; 0 \,\, \forall \,\, k&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt; f(x^{(k+1)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) \,\, \forall \,\,k&lt;/math&gt;, so that it is clearly a descending method. Nevertheless we find that

&lt;math&gt;(3) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}x^{(k)} = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} x^{(0)} - \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (\frac{1}{2})^{j+2} = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} 1 - \frac{1}{4}(\frac{1-(\frac{1}{2})^{k}}{\frac{1}{2}}) = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2} + (\frac{1}{2})^{k+1} = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0 = x^\star. &lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this non-convergence has to be seen in the stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; decreasing too fast. For large ''k'' the steps &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; get so small that convergence is precluded. Hence we have to link the stepsize to the direction of descend &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Efficient Stepsizes === 
The obvious idea of such a linkage is to require that the actual descent is proportional to a first order approximation, i.e. to choose &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;  (4) \quad f(x^{(k)} + \sigma^{(k)}d^{(k)}) - f(x^{(k)}) \leq c_1
\sigma^{(k)} D(f(x^{(k)})) d^{(k)} &lt; 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that we still look only at descending directions, so that &lt;math&gt; Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; as required in Lemma 1 above. Hence, the compactness of &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(k)})) &lt;/math&gt; implies the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] of the LHS and by (4)

&lt;math&gt; (5) \quad \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \sigma^{(k)} D(f(x^{(k)}))
d^{(k)} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Finally we want to choose a sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}D(f(x^{(k)})) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; because that is exactly the necessary first order condition we want to solve. Under which conditions does (5) in fact imply &lt;math&gt; \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}D(f(x^{(k)})) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;? First of all the stepsize &lt;math&gt; \sigma^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; must not go to zero too quickly. That is exactly the case we had in the example above. Hence it seems sensible to bound the stepsize from below by requiring that

&lt;math&gt; (6) \quad \sigma^{(k)} \geq -c_{2} \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{||
d^{(k)}||^{2}} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for some constant &lt;math&gt;c_2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting (6) into (5) finally yields

&lt;math&gt; (7) \quad f(x^{(k)} + \sigma^{(k)}d^{(k)}) - f(x^{(k)}) \leq -c
(\frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||})^{2}, \quad c = c_1
c_2 &lt;/math&gt;

where again the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space compactness] of &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(k)})) &lt;/math&gt; ensures the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] of the LHS and hence

&lt;math&gt; (8) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} -c
(\frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||})^{2} = lim_{k
\rightarrow \infty} \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||} =
0 &lt;/math&gt;

Stepsizes that satisfy (4) and (6) are called ''efficient stepsizes'' and will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;. The importance of condition (6) is illustrated in the following continuation of Example 1.    

====Example 1 (continued)====
* Note that it is exactly the failure of (6) that induced Example 1 not to converge. Substituting the stepsize of the example into (6) yields

&lt;math&gt;(6.1) \quad \sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{(k+2)} \geq -c_{2} \frac{2x^{(k)}(-1)}{1} = c_{2}\cdot2(\frac{1}{2}+(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}) \Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4(1+2^{(k)})} \geq c_{2} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so there is ''no'' constant &lt;math&gt;c_{2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; satisfying this inequality for all ''k'' as required in (6). Hence the stepsize
is not bounded from below and decreases too fast. To really acknowledge the importance of (6), let us change the example a bit and assume that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we find that

&lt;math&gt;(6.2) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} x^{(k+1)} = lim_{k \rightarrow
\infty}x^{(0)} - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}(\frac{1}{2})^{i} = lim_{k
\rightarrow \infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1} = 0 = x^\star, &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] actually does take place. Furthermore recognize that this example actually does satisfy condition (6) as

&lt;math&gt;(6.3) \quad  \sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{(k+1)} \geq -c_{2}
\frac{2x^{(k)}(-1)}{1} = c_{2}\cdot 2(\frac{1}{2})^{k}  
\Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4} \geq c_{2} &gt;0. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Choosing the Direction ''d'' ===

We have already argued that the choice of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is intertwined. Hence the choice of the &quot;right&quot; &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is always contingent on the respective stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;. So what does &quot;right&quot; mean in this context? Above we showed in equation (8) that choosing an ''efficient stepsize'' implied

&lt;math&gt; (8') \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} -c (\frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||})^{2} = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The &quot;right&quot; direction vector will therefore guarantee that (8') implies that

&lt;math&gt; (9) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Df(x^{(k)}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

as (9) is the condition for the chosen sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; to converge. So let us explore what directions could be chosen to yield (9). Assume that the stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is ''efficient'' and define

&lt;math&gt;(10) \quad  \beta^{(k)} = \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| Df(x^{(k)})|| ||d^{(k)}||} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \beta^{(k)}|| Df(x^{(k)})|| = \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||} &lt;/math&gt;

By (8') and (10) we know that

&lt;math&gt;(11) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \beta^{(k)}|| Df(x^{(k)})|| = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

So if we bound &lt;math&gt;\beta^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; from below (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\beta^{(k)} \leq - \delta &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), (11) implies that

&lt;math&gt;(12) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \beta^{(k)}|| Df(x^{(k)})|| = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} || Df(x^{(k)})|| = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Df(x^{(k)}) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where (12) gives just the condition of the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; converging to the solution &lt;math&gt;x^{\star}&lt;/math&gt;. As (10) defines the direction vector &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; implicitly by &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;, the requirements on &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; translate directly into requirements on &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Why Gradient Methods? ===

When considering the conditions on &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; it is clear where the term ''Gradient Methods'' originates from. With &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; given by

&lt;math&gt; \beta_{k} = \frac{D(f(x)) d^{(k)}}{|| Df(x^{(k)}) || || d^{(k)} ||} = cos(Df(x^{(k)}),d^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

we have the following result

''Given that'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''was chosen efficiently and'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfies''

&lt;math&gt;(13) \quad cos(Df(x^{(k)}),d^{(k)}) = \beta_{k} \leq - \delta &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''we have''

&lt;math&gt;(14) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Df(x^{(k)}) \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''Hence: Convergence takes place if the angle between the negative gradient at'' &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''and the direction'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''is consistently smaller than the right angle. Methods relying on'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfying (13) are called Gradient Methods.''

In other words: As long as one is not moving [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal orthogonal] to the gradient and if the stepsize is chosen efficiently, ''Gradient Methods'' guarantee convergence to the solution &lt;math&gt;x^{\star}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Some Specific Algorithms in the Class of Gradient Methods===
Let us now explore three specific algorithms of this class that differ in their respective choice of &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.
==== The Newtonian Method ====
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_method ''Newtonian Method''] is by far the most popular method in the field. It is a well known method to solve for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28mathematics%29 roots] of all types of equations and hence can be easily applied to optimization problems as well. The main idea of the Newtonian method is to linearize the system of equations to arrive at

&lt;math&gt;(15) \quad g(x) = g(\hat{x}) + Dg(\hat{x})^{T}(x-\hat{x}) =
0. &lt;/math&gt;

(15) can easily be solved for ''x'' as the solution is just given by (assuming &lt;math&gt;Dg(\hat{x})^{T} &lt;/math&gt; to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_matrix non-singular])

&lt;math&gt;(16) \quad x = \hat{x} - [Dg(\hat{x})^{T}]^{-1}g(\hat{x}). &lt;/math&gt;

For our purposes we just choose &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be the gradient &lt;math&gt;Df(x)&lt;/math&gt; and arrive at

&lt;math&gt; (17) \quad d_{N}^{(k)} = x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)} = - [D^2f(x^{(k)})]^{-1}Df(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d_{N}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ''Newtonian Direction''.

===== Properties of the Newtonian Method =====

Analyzing (17) elicits the main properties of the Newtonian method:

* If &lt;math&gt;D^2f(x^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt; is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix positive definite], &lt;math&gt;d_{N}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is a direction of descent in the sense of ''Lemma 1''.

* The ''Newtonian Method'' uses local information of the first ''and'' second derivative to calculate &lt;math&gt;d_{N}^{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

* As

&lt;math&gt; 
(18) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + d_{N}^{(k)} 
&lt;/math&gt;

the ''Newtonian Method'' uses a fixed stepsize of &lt;math&gt; \sigma^{(k)} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the Newtonian method is ''not'' necessarily a descending method in the sense of ''Lemma 1''. The reason is that the fixed stepsize &lt;math&gt; \sigma^{(k)} = 1 &lt;/math&gt; might be larger than the critical stepsize &lt;math&gt; \bar{\sigma_{k}} &lt;/math&gt; given in ''Lemma 1''. Below we provide the Rosenbrock function as an example where the ''Newtonian Method'' is not descending. 

* The Method can be time-consuming as calculating &lt;math&gt; [D^2f(x^{(k)})]^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; for every step ''k'' can be cumbersome. In applied work one could think about approximations. One could for example update the Hessian only every ''s''th step or one could rely on ''local approximations''. This is known as the ''Quasi-Newtonian-Method'' and will be discussed in the section about ''Variable Metric Methods''.

* To ensure the method to be decreasing one could use an efficient stepsize  &lt;math&gt;  \sigma_{E}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; and set

&lt;math&gt;(19) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)}d_{N}^{(k)} = x^{(k)} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} [D^2 f(x^{k})]^{-1} Df(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

==== Method of Steepest Descent ====
Another frequently used method is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steepest_descent ''Method of Steepest Descent'']. The idea of this method is to choose the direction &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; so that the decrease in the function value ''f'' is maximal. Although this procedure seems at a first glance very sensible, it suffers from the fact that it uses effectively less information than the ''Newtonian Method'' by ignoring the Hessian's information about the curvature of the function. Especially in the applications below we will see a couple of examples of this problem.

The direction vector of the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is given by

&lt;math&gt; (20) \quad d_{SD}^{(k)} = argmax_{d : ||d|| = r} \{-Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d \} = argmin_{d : ||d|| = r} \{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d
\}  = -r \frac{Df(x)}{|| Df(x) ||} &lt;/math&gt;

''Proof: By the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy-Schwartz_inequality Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality] it follows that''

&lt;math&gt; (21) \quad \frac{Df(x)^{T}d}{|| Df(x) || ||d||} \geq -1 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad Df(x)^{T}d \geq -r || Df(x) ||.
&lt;/math&gt;

''Obviously (21) holds with equality for'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)} = d_{SD}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''given in (20).''

Note especially that for &lt;math&gt;r = || Df(x) ||&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;d_{SD}^{(k)} = - Df(x^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. we just &quot;walk&quot; in the direction of the negative gradient. In contrast to the ''Newtonian Method'' the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' does not use a fixed stepsize but chooses an efficient stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' defines the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; by

&lt;math&gt; (22) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \sigma_{E}^{(k)} d_{SD}^{(k)}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is an efficient stepsize and &lt;math&gt;d_{SD}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; the Direction of Steepest Descent given in (20).

===== Properties of the Method of Steepest Descent =====
* With &lt;math&gt;d_{SD}^{(k)} = -r \frac{Df(x)}{|| Df(x)||}&lt;/math&gt; the Method of Steepest Descent defines a direction of descent in the sense of ''Lemma 1'', as

&lt;math&gt;Df(x)^{T}d_{SD}^{(k)} = Df(x)^{T}(-r \frac{Df(x)}{|| Df(x)||}) = - \frac{r}{|| Df(x)||}Df(x)^{T}Df(x) &lt; 0. &lt;/math&gt;

* The ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is only locally sensible as it ignores second order information.

* Especially when the criterion function is flat (i.e. the solution &lt;math&gt;x^\star&lt;/math&gt; lies in a &quot;valley&quot;) the sequence defined by the Method of Steepest Descent fluctuates wildly (see the applications below, especially the example of the Rosenbrock function).

* As it does not need the Hessian, calculation and implementation of the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is easy and fast.

==== Variable Metric Methods ====
A more general approach than both the ''Newtonian Method'' and the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is the class of ''Variable Metric Methods''. Methods in this class rely on the updating formula

&lt;math&gt; (23) \quad x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} [A^{k}]^{-1} Df(x^{k}). &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix symmetric] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix positive definite] matrix, (23) defines a descending method as &lt;math&gt;[A^{k}]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite if and only if &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite as well. To see this: just consider the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_decomposition spectral decomposition]

&lt;math&gt; (24) \quad A^{k} = \Gamma \Lambda \Gamma^{T} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; are the matrices with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvectors eigenvectors] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvectors eigenvalues] respectively. If &lt;math&gt; A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, all eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are strictly positive. Hence their inverse &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are positive as well, so that &lt;math&gt;[A^{k}]^{-1} = \Gamma \Lambda^{-1} \Gamma^{T}&lt;/math&gt; is clearly positive definite. But then, substitution of &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)} = [A^{k}]^{-1} Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; yields

&lt;math&gt; (25) \quad Df(x^{k})^{T}d^{(k)} = -Df(x^{k})^{T}[A^{k}]^{-1}Df(x^{k}) \equiv - v^{T} [A^{k}]^{-1} v \leq 0, &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the method is indeed descending. Up to now we have not specified the matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt;, but is easily seen that for two specific choices, the ''Variable Metric Method'' just coincides with the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' and the ''Newtonian Method'' respectively.

* For &lt;math&gt;A^{k} = \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; being the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix identity matrix]) it follows that

&lt;math&gt; (22') \quad x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the ''Method of Steepest Descent''.

* For &lt;math&gt;A^{k} = D^{2}f(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; it follows that

&lt;math&gt; (19') \quad x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} [D^{2}f(x^{k})]^{-1}Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the ''Newtonian Method'' using a stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===== The Quasi Newtonian Method =====
A further natural candidate for a ''Variable Metric Method'' is the ''Quasi Newtonian Method''. In contrast to the standard ''Newtonian Method'' it uses an efficient stepsize so that it is a descending method and in contrast to the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' it does not fully ignore the local information about the curvature of the function. Hence the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'' is defined by the two requirements on the matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt;:

* &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; should approximate the Hessian &lt;math&gt;D^{2}f(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; to make use of the information about the curvature and

* the update &lt;math&gt;A^{k} \rightarrow A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; should be easy so that the algorithm is still relatively fast (even in high dimensions).

To ensure the first requirement, &lt;math&gt;A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; should satisfy the so-called ''Quasi-Newtonian-Equation''

&lt;math&gt; (26) \quad A^{k+1}(x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}) = Df(x^{(k+1)})-Df(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

as all &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (26) reflect information about the Hessian. To see this, consider the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; defined as

&lt;math&gt; (27) \quad g(x) = f(x^{k+1})+Df(x^{k+1})^{T}(x - x^{k+1})+\frac{1}{2}(x-x^{k+1})^{T}A^{k+1}(x - x^{k+1}). &lt;/math&gt;

Then it is obvious that &lt;math&gt;g(x^{k+1}) = f(x^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Dg(x^{k+1}) = Df(x^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are reasonably similar in the neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;. In order to ensure that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is also a good approximation at &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;, we want to choose &lt;math&gt;A^{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; such that the gradients at &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are identical. With

&lt;math&gt;(28) \quad Dg(x^{k}) = Df(x^{k+1}) - A^{k+1} (x^{k+1} - x^{k})&lt;/math&gt;

it is clear that &lt;math&gt;Dg(x^{k}) = Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the ''Quasi Newtonian Equation'' given in (26). But then it follows that

&lt;math&gt; (29) \quad A^{k+1} (x^{k+1} - x^{k}) = Df(x^{k+1}) - Dg(x^{k}) = Df(x^{k+1}) - Df(x^{k}) = D^2 f(\lambda x^{(k)} + (1-\lambda)x^{(k+1)})(x^{k+1} - x^{k}). &lt;/math&gt;

Hence as long as &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are not too far apart, &lt;math&gt;A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (26) is a good approximation of &lt;math&gt;D^2 f(x^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us now come to the second requirement that the update of the &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; should be easy. One specific algorithm to do so is the so-called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFGS_method ''BFGS-Algorithm'']. The main merit of this algorithm is the fact that it uses only the already calculated elements &lt;math&gt;\{x^{(k)}\}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{Df(x^{(k)})\}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; to construct the update &lt;math&gt;A^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence no new entities have to be calculated but one has only to keep track of the ''x''-sequence and sequence of gradients. As a starting point for the BFGS-Algorithm one can provide any positive definite matrix (e.g. the identity matrix or the Hessian at &lt;math&gt;x^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;). The ''BFGS-Updating-Formula'' is then given by

&lt;math&gt; (30) \quad A^{k} = A^{k-1} -
\frac{(A^{k-1})^{T}\gamma_{k-1}^{T}\gamma_{k-1}A^{k-1}}{\gamma_{k-1}^{T}A^{k-1}\gamma_{k-1}} + \frac{\Delta_{k-1}\Delta_{k-1}^{T}}{\Delta_{k-1}^{T}\gamma_{k-1}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{k-1} = Df(x^{(k)}) - Df(x^{(k-1)})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{k-1} = x^{(k)} - x^{(k-1)}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore (30) ensures that all &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are positive definite as required by ''Variable Metric Methods'' to be descending.

===== Properties of the Quasi Newtonian Method =====
* It uses second order information about the curvature of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as the matrices &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are related to the Hessian &lt;math&gt;D^{2}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Nevertheless it ensures easy and fast updating (e.g. by the BFGS-Algorithm) so that it is faster than the standard Newtonian Method.

* It is a descending method as &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are positive definite. 

* It is relatively easy to implement as the BFGS-Algorithm is available in most numerical or statistical software packages.

== Applications ==

To compare the methods and to illustrate the differences between the algorithms we will now evaluate the performance of the ''Steepest Descent Method'', the standard ''Newtonian Method'' and the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'' with an efficient stepsize. We use two classical functions in this field, namely the Himmelblau and the Rosenbrock function.

=== Application I: The Himmelblau Function ===
The Himmelblau function is given by

&lt;math&gt; (31) \quad f(x,y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

This fourth order polynomial has four minima, four saddle points and one maximum so there are enough possibilities for the algorithms to fail. In the following pictures we display the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line contour plot] and the 3D plot of the function for different starting values.

In Figure 1 we display the function and the paths of all three methods at a starting value of &lt;math&gt;(2, -4)&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously the three methods do not find the same minimum. The reason is of course the different direction vector of the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' - by ignoring the information about the curvature it chooses a totally different direction than the two ''Newtonian Methods'' (see especially the right panel of Figure 1). 

[[Image:Himmelblaufunction1.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Figure 1: The two Newton Methods converge to the same, the Method of Steepest Descent to a different minimum.]]

Consider now the starting value &lt;math&gt;(4.5, -0.5)&lt;/math&gt;, displayed in Figure 2. The most important thing is of course that now ''all'' methods find different solutions. That the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' finds a different solution than the two ''Newtonian Methods'' is again not that surprising. But that the two ''Newtonian Methods'' converge to different solution shows the significance of the stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. With the ''Quasi-Newtonian Method'' choosing an efficient stepsize in the first iteration, both methods have different stepsizes ''and'' direction vectors for all iterations after the first one. And as seen in the picture: the consequence may be quite significant. 

[[Image:Himmelblau no2.JPG|center|thumb|550px|Figure 2: Even all methods find different solutions.]]

=== Application II: The Rosenbrock Function ===

The Rosenbrock function is given by

&lt;math&gt; (32) \quad f(x,y) = 100(y - x^2)^2 + (1-x)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Although this function has only one minimum it is an interesting function for optimization problems. The reason is the very flat valley of this U-shaped function (see the right panels of Figures 3 and 4). Especially for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics econometricians] this function may be interesting because in the case of Maximum Likelihood estimation flat criterion functions occur quite frequently. Hence the results displayed in Figures 3 and 4 below seem to be rather generic for functions sharing this problem.

My experience when working with this function and the algorithms I employed is that Figure 3 (given a starting value of &lt;math&gt;(2,-5)&lt;/math&gt;) seems to be quite characteristic. In contrast to the Himmelblau function above, all algorithms found the same solution and given that there is only one minimum this could be expected. More important is the path the different methods choose as is reflects the different properties of the respective methods. It is seen that the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' fluctuates rather wildly. This is due to the fact that it does not use information about the curvature but rather jumps back and forth between the &quot;hills&quot; adjoining the valley. The two Newtonian Methods choose a more direct path as they use the second order information. The main difference between the two Newtonian Methods is of course the stepsize. Figure 3 shows that the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'' uses very small stepsizes when working itself through the valley. In contrast, the stepsize of the ''Newtonian Method'' is fixed so that it jumps directly in the direction of the solution. Although one might conclude that this is a disadvantage of the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'', note of course that in general these smaller stepsizes come with benefit of a higher stability, i.e. the algorithm is less likely to jump to a different solution. This can be seen in Figure 4.

[[Image:Rosenbrockfunction1.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Figure 3: All
methods find the same solution, but the Method of Steepest Descent
fluctuates heavily.]]

Figure 4, which considers a starting value of &lt;math&gt;(-2,-2)&lt;/math&gt;, shows the main problem of the ''Newtonian Method'' using a fixed stepsize - the method might &quot;overshoot&quot; in that it is not descending. In the first step, the ''Newtonian Method'' (displayed as the purple line in the figure) jumps out of the valley to only bounce back in the next iteration. In this case convergence to the minimum still occurs as the gradient at each side points towards the single valley in the center, but one can easily imagine functions where this is not the case. The reason of this jump are the second derivatives which are very small so that the step &lt;math&gt;[Df(x^{(k)})]^{-1} Df(x^{(k)}))&lt;/math&gt; gets very large due to the inverse of the Hessian. In my experience I would therefore recommend to use efficient stepsizes to have more control over the paths the respective Method chooses.

[[Image:Rosenbrockfunction2.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Figure 2: Overshooting of the Newtonian Method due to the fixed stepsize.]]

=== Application III: Maximum Likelihood Estimation ===

For econometricians and statisticians the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood Maximum Likelihood Estimator] is probably the most important application of numerical optimization algorithms. Therefore we will briefly show how the estimation procedure fits in the framework developed above.

As usual let

&lt;math&gt;(33) \quad f(Y | X; \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

be the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_distribution conditional density] of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;(34) \quad l(\theta; Y | X)  &lt;/math&gt;

the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function conditional likelihood function] for the parameter &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;

If we assume the data to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iid independently, identically distributed (iid)] then the sample log-likelihood follows as

&lt;math&gt;(35) \quad \mathcal{L}(\theta; Y_{1}, ..., Y_{N}) = \sum_{i}^{N} \mathcal{L}(\theta; Y_{i}) = \sum_{i}^{N} log(l(\theta; Y_{i})). &lt;/math&gt;

Maximum Likelihood estimation therefore boils down to maximize (35) with respect to the parameter  &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;. If we for simplicity just decide to use the ''Newtonian Method'' to solve that problem, the sequence  &lt;math&gt; \{ \theta^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; is recursively defined by

&lt;math&gt;(36) \quad D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k+1)}) = D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)}) + D_{\theta \theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})(\theta^{(k+1)} -\theta^{(k)}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \theta^{(k+1)} = \theta^{(k)} - [D_{\theta \theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})]^{-1}D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_{\theta \theta}\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the first and second derivative with respect to the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; [D_{\theta \theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})]^{-1}D_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt; defines the ''Newtonian Direction'' given in (17). As Maximum Likelihood estimation always assumes that the conditional density (i.e. the distribution of the error term) is known up to the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the methods described above can readily be applied.

==== A Concrete Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation ====

Assume a simple linear model

&lt;math&gt; (37a) \quad Y_{i} = \beta_{1} + \beta_{x} X_{i} + U_{i} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\theta = (\beta_{1}, \beta_{2})'&lt;/math&gt;. The conditional distribution ''Y'' is then determined by the one of ''U'', i.e.

&lt;math&gt; (37b)  \quad p(Y_{i} - \beta_{1} - \beta_{x} X_{i}) \equiv p_{\mid X_{i}}(Y_{i})  = p(U_{i}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_function density function]. Generally, there is no closed form solution of maximizing (35) (at least if ''U'' does not happen to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution normally distributed]), so that numerical methods have to be employed. Hence assume that ''U'' follows [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution Student's t-distribution] with ''m'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_%28statistics%29 degrees of freedom] so that (35) is given by

&lt;math&gt; (38)  \quad \mathcal{L}(\theta;Y_{\mid X}) = \sum log( \frac{\Gamma(\frac{m+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi m}\Gamma(\frac{m}{2})}(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m})^{-\frac{m+1}{2}}) &lt;/math&gt;

where we just used the definition of the density function of the t-distribution. (38) can be simplified to

&lt;math&gt; (39) \quad \mathcal{L}(\theta;Y_{\mid X}) = N[log(\Gamma(\frac{m+1}{2})) - log(\sqrt{\pi m}\Gamma(\frac{m}{2}))] -\frac{m+1}{2} \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m}) &lt;/math&gt;

so that (if we assume that the degrees of freedom ''m'' are known)

&lt;math&gt; (40) \quad \textit{argmax} \{ \mathcal{L}(\theta;Y_{\mid X}) \} = \textit{argmax} \{ -\frac{m+1}{2} \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m}) \}  = \textit{argmin} \{ \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m}) \}. &lt;/math&gt;

With the criterion function

&lt;math&gt; (41) \quad  f(\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}) = \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - \beta_{1} - \beta_{2}x_{i})^2}{m}) &lt;/math&gt;

the methods above can readily applied to calculate the Maximum Likelihood Estimator &lt;math&gt;(\hat{\beta}_{1,ML}, \hat{\beta}_{2,ML})&lt;/math&gt; maximizing (41).

We have already had a brief encounter with NSDictionary, when we used one to set up a couple of attributes for drawing our &quot;Hello World&quot; string. Now we will have a look at it in more detail, and look at some of Cocoa's other container classes.

A '''container class''' is an object that is designed simply to look after collections of other objects. Time and again we will need to keep things in lists or tables, and the two main classes in Cocoa that do this job are NSArray and NSDictionary, and their mutable versions, NSMutableArray and NSMutableDictionary. In addition, Cocoa has some other containers such as NSSet, but for this tutorial we will not be looking at these.

==Arrays==

In Cocoa, NSArray and NSMutableArray objects are 'smarter' than the traditional arrays that you may be used to if you've programmed in C before. C arrays are still available if you need them, but they are very simplistic and in many cases using an NSArray or NSMutableArray will be worthwhile.

Note that an NSArray is a static array (its contents cannot be changed after it is created) while an NSMutableArray is a dynamic array (its contents can be changed after it is created).  NSMutableArray is a subclass of NSArray, so it can do everything an NSArray can do and more.

If you want to keep lists of objects, NSMutableArray is generally superior to the equivalent C array. The biggest difference is that an NSMutableArray can grow (and shrink) to accommodate as many objects as you want to store. A C array has a fixed size.

Just like a C array, you refer to the elements of the array using a simple index, starting at 0 for the first element. Here are the basic access methods of NSMutableArray:

 - (void)       addObject:(id)object;
 - (void)       insertObject:(id)object atIndex:(NSUinteger)index;
 - (void)       removeObject:(id)object;
 - (void)       removeObjectAtIndex:(NSUinteger)index;
 - (id)         objectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
 - (NSUInteger) count;

Note that NSUInteger represents an unsigned integer (32 or 64-bit, depending on platform).

We must use these access methods to change what the array stores, there is no special syntax such as myarray[5] to access array elements, as there is with a C array. In some C++ frameworks, the C array syntax can be used to access elements in a dynamic array thanks to operator overloading of the [] operator, but Objective-C does not support this.

addObject: adds an object to the end of the array. insertObject:atIndex: inserts an object anywhere in the array, though be sure that the index already exists - if it's beyond the end of the array you'll get an error. Elements above the index inserted will be moved up one to accommodate the new item. removeObject: removes an object from the array, moving elements at higher index positions down to fill the gap. objectAtIndex: returns the object stored at the index, and count returns the total number of elements in the array.

When objects are added to an array, the array retains the object. When the object is removed from the array, the array releases the object. This means that objects within an array should always be valid. If the array itself is released, all the objects it contains are released too. All of Cocoa's object containers work this way.

==Dictionaries==

An array is great when you want to use index numbers to refer to objects, and don't mind if the indexes can change as objects come and go. You can use arrays for other types of structures too, such as queues and stacks. However, when you want to store objects in a way so that they are always associated with the same &quot;index value&quot;, or ''key'', a '''dictionary''' is a better bet.

NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary are Cocoa's dictionary classes. Instead of an index, you associate objects with a key value. Later, you can retrieve the object using the key. The key never changes even as other objects come and go.

The main methods are:

 - (void)    setObject:(id) object forKey:(id) key;
 - (id)        objectForKey:(id) key;
 - (void)    removeObjectForKey:(id) key;
 - (int)       count;

The key is itself declared to be an object, so you can use anything you like. Most commonly, you would use an NSString as the key, but you are not required to.

Internally, NSDictionary is implemented as a hash table, so accessing elements is fast.

==Iterators==

Often, you will want to loop over the contents of an array or dictionary, and carry out some action on each object. Cocoa declares a number of ''iterator'' or ''enumerator'' classes to make this easy. Of course, you could use a simple for(...) loop, using 'count' as a terminal value, but using an iterator is both more object-oriented, and allows quick and easy change between using an array or a dictionary for storage.

To obtain an iterator for a given container, ask the container to make it for you. The generic iterator class is NSEnumerator:

 NSEnumerator* myIterator = [myArray objectEnumerator];

Because 'objectEnumerator' is a factory method, the returned iterator is autoreleased, so you don't usually need to retain it - you'll be using it once to iterate the contents of the array, then throw it away. In fact, iterators can only be used once - once you have iterated the array, there is no way to &quot;back up&quot; and do it again with the same iterator. Instead, you ask for a new iterator, which starts at the beginning.

To iterate, you repeatedly call the iterator's 'nextObject' method until it returns nil, meaning there are no more objects. So, an iterative loop looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
 id anObject;

 while( anObject = [myIterator nextObject])
 {
     /* do something useful with anObject */
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This code would be identical whether the container was a dictionary or an array. If you used a for loop, the dictionary case would need to be quite a bit more complex than the array case, since you'd need to obtain all of the keys, then get each in turn to obtain the object.

If you wish to iterate backwards over a set of objects, ask for the reverseObjectEnumerator instead. The body of the loop doesn't change:

&lt;pre&gt;
 NSEnumerator* myIterator = [myArray reverseObjectEnumerator];
 id anObject;

 while( anObject = [myIterator nextObject])
 {
     /* do something useful with anObject */
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Iterators and enumerators have, to a large extent, been superseded in the Objective-C language by the concept of 'fast enumeration'. Fast enumeration is a language feature that allows you to efficiently and safely enumerate over the contents of a collection using a concise syntax.  The Cocoa collection classes support fast enumeration. For example

&lt;pre&gt;
  NSArray *cities = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;London&quot;, @&quot;Paris&quot;, @&quot;Rome&quot;, nil];

  for (NSString *city in cities) // fast enumeration
  {
    NSLog(@&quot;City is %@&quot;, city);
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Cocoa enumerator classes also support fast enumeration. For example

&lt;pre&gt;
  NSArray *cities = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;London&quot;, @&quot;Paris&quot;, @&quot;Rome&quot;, nil];

  for (NSString *city in [cities reverseObjectEnumerator]) // fast enumeration
  {
    NSLog(@&quot;City is %@&quot;, city);
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Letter Frequency ==
Whenever you consider any available language, it gives information about the frequency of letters that occur most frequently in it. The same matter is more enough for cryptanalysis (process of discovering ciphertexts) which is more beneficial when encryption is performed using the Conventional Classical Encryption Techniques.

This gives statistical information of data that cryptanalysts can use in order to decrypt the encrypted data, provided the language in which data is present is known.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In many ways the United Nations is a product of the Second World War.  It took quite a bit of effort to forge the political alliances necessary to build the Allied military force that defeated the Axis powers during this war.  Even before the formal surrender of Germany and Japan, it was realized that a long-term relationship should be developed among those countries that participated in the defeat of Facism, and a political solution that had global input needed to occur with the territories captured from the Axis powers.

During the final years of WWII, the name of the alliance had even changed, with the term United Nations being used formally for the first time as the name of the allied nations in press releases and newspaper accounts.  While not formally the organization that exists today that is called the United Nations, many of the tasks that are now handled by the various Secretariats of the UN were first started at this time.  There was also a strong sentiment among all of the participants of this alliance that they should not repeat the same mistakes that occurred at the end of the First World War, and in retrospect it could be argued that the framers of the United Nations have largely succeeded in that task.

Another aspect of the organization of the United Nations is the need to coordinate new participation in the war.  The wartime alliance toward the end of WWII had many new countries willing to participate directly and indirectly in the combat operations, but this requried formal alliance treaties independently with each of the major allied powers and grew more complex as more countries joined the alliance.  It was becoming so complex that some otherwise needed wartime supplies were actually refused because of the political bureaucracy that was developing.

Some international agencies such as the International Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union pre-date the founding of the United Nations as well, but currently receive support from the UN and are considered appendenges to the larger organization as well and are governed under charters issued by the UN.  There were also some aspects of the League of Nations that were absorbed into the United Nations, as most of the participants in the older League of Nations were also members of the United Nations as well.  This is largely the result of a spirit of cooperation between nations that existed in the years prior to WWII, particularly for issues that didn't seem to have significant differences of opinion on how to proceed but required cooperation and standardization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Italian, ''passato prossimo'' is a very common tense expressing a recent, concluded action.
To have an idea, you can use passato prossimo for an action you have just done, let's say from five minutes ago to two or three days ago.
Despite this rule (which is not as strict as you can imagine), in northern Italy ''passato prossimo'' is also used to refer to actions which took place years ago, and the use of the correct tense for these cases, the ''passato remoto'', is almost disappeared (but its use is compulsory when writing). On the other hand, in southern Italy, the ''passato prossimo'' tense has been dropped, and, especially in Sicily, ''passato remoto'' is used in its stead.

just an example of conjugation:

'''fare''' (to do)
---- transitive verb, you must use &quot;avere&quot; to form the tense:

io     ho       fatto &lt;/br&gt;
tu     hai      fatto &lt;/br&gt;
egli   ha       fatto &lt;/br&gt;
noi    abbiamo  fatto &lt;/br&gt;
voi    avete    fatto &lt;/br&gt;
essi   hanno    fatto &lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This ''Italic text'' tense is like the third form of the verbs in English (done, fallen...), and is used only to compose some other tenses like ''passato prossimo'', ''trapassato prossimo/remoto'', ''congiuntivo trapassato''.

A general rule to form the ''Participio passato'' (not valid for the irregular verbs) is the following

'''for the first and the third group (-''are'' and -''ire'' verbs)''':

-drop '''-re'''&lt;/br&gt;
-add '''-to'''

examples: dare (to give) = da'''''to''''', mangiare (to eat) = mangia'''''to''''', dormire (to sleep) = dormi'''''to'''''.

'''''for the second group (-''ere'' verbs)'''''&lt;/br&gt;
-drop '''-ere'''&lt;/br&gt;
-add '''-uto'''

cadere (to fall) = cad'''''uto'''''; avere (to have) = av'''''uto'''''&lt;/br&gt;
Remember that for the verbs in which ''-ere'' follows '''-sc''' (conoscere (to know)), the sound sh must be preserved also in the ''participio'' ''passato form'', so an -i must be added in front of -uto:

conoscere = conosc'''i'''''uto''


some irregular verbs:

essere (to be)  =  stato

I started up editing lesson three, it's about connective forms and also negation.  I'm beginning to think the format we're using is a bit to change retroactively, but I don't think the entire format needs to change just yet. 14:32, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

The template does indeed belong there, if you're willing to change all the links :). As to &quot;buenas mañanas&quot;, I don't know. I was taught it, so I added it to the Wikibook.

: It's nice for concrete nouns, but it might be challenging to get contributors to find or draw images.  Besides, it's much more difficult to supply pictures for more abstract words. Also, I'd hope to see each foreign vocabulary word in such lists link to the English Wiktionary entry for that word.  Does that feeback help?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following demonstrates what's a state function and what's not a state function.

&lt;math&gt;q_{rev} \;&lt;/math&gt; is not exact differential for a gas obeying van der Waals' equation, but &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt; is as demonstrated below:

&lt;math&gt;dq_{rev} \;=\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right )_vdT+\left [ P_{ext}+\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

We assume quasistatic situation, so &lt;math&gt;P_{ext} = P \;&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;dq_{rev} \;=\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right )_vdT+\left [ P+\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=C_vdT+\left [ P+\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=C_vdT+\left [ P+\left ( \frac{a}{\overline V^2} \right ) \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=C_vdT+\left ( \frac{RT}{\overline V-b} \right )dV&lt;/math&gt;

Now, you take the cross partial derivatives.

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial C_v}{\partial V} \right )_T=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial \left ( \frac{RT}{\overline V-b} \right )}{\partial T} \right )_V=\frac{R}{\overline V-b}&lt;/math&gt;

They are not equal; hence, &lt;math&gt;q_{rev} \;&lt;/math&gt; is not exact differential (not a state function).

However, if we take &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt; it will be exact differential (a state function).

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_{rev}}{T}=\frac{C_v}{T}dT+\left ( \frac{R}{\overline V-b} \right )dV&lt;/math&gt;

Take the cross partial derivatives.

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial \left ( \frac{C_v}{T}\right )}{\partial V} \right )_T=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial \left ( \frac{R}{\overline V-b} \right )}{\partial T} \right )_V=0&lt;/math&gt;

Both are equal making &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt; exact differential (a state function).

      <comment>/* &quot;This is...&quot; and the feminine */ corrected typo: endng -&gt; ending</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If we want to use the phrase &quot;This is...&quot; basically pointing to something or identifying it, we would use the Arabic word '''(هذا)'''
which means &quot;this&quot;.

As we learned earlier(and to repeat here as a reminder) there are no connecting verbs in the Arabic language, by that I mean the words &quot;is&quot; and &quot;are&quot;.
Therefore remember when using the term  '''(هذا)''' that, in most cases, you will not need to add anything between &quot;this&quot; and the noun you are identifying.

== &quot;This is...&quot; and common nouns ==

Lets show a few examples to make it a bit clearer:

Phrase: This is a boy
this = '''(هذا)'''
a boy = '''(ولد)'''
thus the Arabic is : '''(هذا ولد)'''

At first glance one might see this as translating to (this boy)
yet there is another way to say that phrase, and before getting into we will practice using '''(هذا)''' a bit more.

This is a book = '''(هذا كتاب)''' 
This is a chair = '''(هذا كرسي)'''
This is a pen = '''(هذا قلم)'''

These sentences are both grammatically correct and complete sentences.

== &quot;This is...&quot; and proper nouns ==
'''(هذا)''' when used with a proper personal nouns, i.e. a person's name, nothing is added.
Thus you would say when introducing your friends John, Muhammad, Ali, and Rama:
This is John = '''(هذا جان)'''
This is Muhammad = '''(هذا محمد)'''
This is Ali = '''(هذا علي)'''
This is Rama = '''(هذا راما)'''

However, when using '''(هذا)''' with a proper noun that denotes other than a personal name, care must be taken to use it is a manner which will fulfill the requirements of a complete sentence.
Thus &quot;This pen...&quot; = in Arabic (هذا القلم) would be a sentence fragment, and would not carry a meaning that whoever you are speaking to can understand (unless of course you are answering a question about a pen)
An example will make this clearer:
Q: Which pen do you want? = '''(أي قلم تريد؟)'''
A: This pen.'''(هذا القلم)''' [identifying the specific pen he wants.]

== &quot;This is the...&quot; and the word (هذا) ==

Now when using the word '''(هذا)''' one might want to exclaim &quot;This is the boy!&quot; or point out &quot;This is the pen.&quot; 
Here a pronoun = '''(هو)''' needs to be added [in Arabic grammar this pronoun is called '''(ضمير الشأن)''']
This pronoun allows the sentence to move from one of a sentence fragment to one of a complete sentence.
Examples: 
&quot;This is the boy!&quot; = '''(هذا هو الولد)'''
Compare to = &quot;This boy...&quot; = '''(هذا الولد)'''
&quot;This is the pen.&quot; = '''(هذا هو القلم)'''
Compare to = &quot;This pen...&quot; = '''(هذا القلم)'''

== &quot;This is...&quot; and the feminine ==
The feminine form of '''(هذا)''' is '''(هذه)''' which means exactly the same thing yet will only be used for feminine nouns.

One might then ask &quot;How do I know that the noun is feminine?&quot;
Answer: Well one apparent clue is that you are using it to describe a female. Thus names such as Rebecca, Sara, Fatimah, and Aishah will all be identified with the word '''(هذه)'''.
This is Rebecca = '''(هذه رابكا)'''
This is Sara = '''(هذه سارة)'''
This is Fatimah = '''(هذه فاطمة)'''
This is Aishah = '''(هذه عائشة)'''

If the word is not blatantly used to describe a female, than there are certain signs that will denote for you the proper usage of '''(هذه)''' with that word, such as:
1- the word ending in '''(ــة ، ة)''' 
such as:
car = '''(سيارة)'''
printer = '''(طابعة)'''
government = '''(حكومة)'''

2- the word ending in '''(ـاء)''' 
such as the words: 
sky = '''(سـماء)'''
air = '''(هواء)'''
cover = '''(غطاء)'''

Other words are known to be feminine by usage, one needs to build their vocabulary in order to distinguish the masculine from the feminine.

== Overview ==

'''''Broderick Bode''''' is a worker in the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Bode attends the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] points him out to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] as he passes the Weasleys' tents.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], accompanied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], arrive to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], the day after the snake attack, they wait in line after an old stooped wizard who is there to see Broderick Bode. The Welcome Witch says he's wasting his time, Bode still thinks he's a teapot.

Some days later, Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] happen to end up on the long-term residents floor, due to a chance encounter with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]. There, they see Bode, who is apparently getting better. He receives a pot plant (US: house plant) for a Christmas present from an unnamed well-wisher.

Hermione later reads that he has been strangled by the pot plant, which turns out to have been a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Devil's Snare|Devil's Snare]]. 

In a dream Harry has in late February, where he perceives things happening in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s mind, Harry hears that Bode had been placed under the Imperius spell by Malfoy, but that he had known that he would not be able to do what was being asked of him, and so fought the spell very hard. Based on this sketchy information, Harry, Ron, and Hermione conclude that Bode was placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and was supposed to remove a prophecy concerning Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] from the shelf it is stored on. As an employee in the Department of Mysteries, however, he knew that he could not touch it, so he fought the curse unsuccessfully. The shock of touching the prophecy may have lifted the curse, but left him unable to speak. He was admitted to St. Mungo's, but was killed by the anonymously sent Devil's Snare plant as he began to regain speech abilities. It is theorized that the Death Eaters wished to silence him and so sent the plant, which his Healer thought was a harmless Christmas gift. Encouraged to care for the plant himself, Bode touched the Devil's Snare and was instantly throttled. His death was only briefly mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Standard (or Type 2) is a Constructed format where the total card pool is restricted by sets.  Normally, the standard format pool consists of cards from the most recent core set and the two most recent expansion blocks.
Currently, the core set is Magic 2011 and the expansions are the Scars of Mirrodin block and Zendikar.

Players must have at least a 60-card deck (a sideboard containing exactly 15 extra cards is not optional) consisting of cards of any printings that are legal in the current standard format; however, players must be able to shuffle their decks without assistance.  Decks (including the sideboard) may contain no more than 4 copies of any card other than basic lands.  In addition, certain cards may be &quot;restricted&quot; (only one copy of the card allowed) or &quot;banned&quot; (the card may not be used).

As of July 16th 2011, the sets legal in Standard:


'''CORE SET'''

Magic 2011
Magic 2012


'''Zendikar'''

Zendikar

Worldwake 

Rise Of The Eldrazi

'''Scars of Mirrodin'''

Scars of Mirrodin

Mirrodin Besieged

New Phyrexia

----

Beginning from September 30th 2012, standard will consist of the following sets:

'''CORE SET'''

Magic 2012

'''Scars of Mirrodin'''

Scars of Mirrodin

Mirrodin Besieged

New Phyrexia

'''Innistrad'''

Innistrad

----


Since the format rotates each year, decks have a maximum shelf life of two years, meaning that the format is quick to change and easily impacted. There are deck archetypes that have waxed and waned through the years, but maintain their existence in some form or another (White-Defensive, Blue-Control, Black-Kill and Weaken, Red-Direct Damage, Green-Creature Based ), while others (usually combo decks) are spawned from the centerpiece card (Tooth and Nail, Enduring Ideal), and are thus usually subject to their key card leaving Standard.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This article presents a small Java program which can be run from the console. It computes the distance between two points on a plane. You do not need to understand the structure and meaning of the program just yet; we will get to that soon. Also, because the program is intended as a simple introduction, it has some room for improvement, and later in the module we will show some of these improvements. But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves!

== The Distance Class: Intent, Source, and Use ==

This class is named ''Distance'', so using your favorite editor or [[Java Programming/Java IDEs|Java IDE]], first create a file named &lt;code&gt;Distance.java&lt;/code&gt;, then copy the source below and paste it into the file and save the file.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 2.1: Distance.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 public class Distance {
   private java.awt.Point point0, point1;
 
   public Distance(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) {
     point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);
     point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);
   }
 
   public void printDistance() {
     System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + point0 + &quot; and &quot; + point1
                     + &quot; is &quot; + point0.distance(point1));
   }
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     Distance dist = new Distance(
              intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
              intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
     dist.printDistance();
   }
 
   private static int intValue(String data) {
     return Integer.parseInt(data);
   }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

At this point, you may wish to review the source to see how much you might be able to understand. While perhaps not being the most literate of programming languages, someone with understanding of other procedural languages such as C, or other OO languages such as C++ or C#, will be able to understand most if not all of the sample program.

Once you save the file, [[Java Programming/Compilation|compile]] the program:
{{XCode|1='''Output for the compilation'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ javac Distance.java
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
(If the &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; command fails, review the [[Java Programming/About This Book#Installing the Java platform|Java installation instructions]].)

To run the program, you supply it with the ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates of two points on a plane separated by a space. For this version of Distance, only integer points are supported. The command sequence is ''&lt;code&gt;java Distance &lt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; &lt;y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; &lt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; &lt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'' to compute the distance between the points (''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'').
{{XWarning|If you have a &lt;code&gt;NumberFormatException&lt;/code&gt; exception, some arguments are not a number. If you will have a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&lt;/code&gt; exception, there is not enough arguments.}}

Here are two examples:
{{XCode|1='''Output for the distance between the points (0, 3) and (4, 0)'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java Distance 0 3 4 0
Distance between java.awt.Point[x=0,y=3] and java.awt.Point[x=4,y=0] is 5.0
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{XCode|1='''Output for the distance between the points (-4, 5) and (11, 19)'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java Distance -4 5 11 19
Distance between java.awt.Point[x=-4,y=5] and java.awt.Point[x=11,y=19] is 20.518284528683193
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

We'll explain this strange looking output, and also show how to improve it, later.

== Detailed Program Structure and Overview ==

As promised, we will now provide a detailed description of this Java program. We will discuss the syntax and structure of the program and the meaning of that structure.

::''For a further treatment of the syntax elements of Java, see also [[Java Programming/Syntax|Syntax]].''

The ''syntax'' of a Java class is the characters and symbols and their structure used to code the class using Unicode characters. Java programs consist of a sequence of tokens. There are different kinds of tokens. For example, there are word tokens such as {{java:class}} and {{java:public}} which represent ''[[Java Programming/Keywords|&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;'''keywords'''&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;'''(in purple'''&lt;/span&gt; [[#figure-1|&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;'''above'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;''')'''&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; special words with reserved meaning in Java. Other words such as &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;printDistance&lt;/code&gt; are not keywords but &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey&quot;&gt;''identifiers'' (in grey)&lt;/span&gt;. Identifiers have many different uses in Java but primarily they are used as names. Java also has tokens to represent numbers, such as &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;; these are known as ''[[Java Programming/Literals|&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange&quot;&gt;literals&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange&quot;&gt;(in orange)&lt;/span&gt;. ''[[Java Programming/Literals/String Literals|&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;String literals&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;(in blue)&lt;/span&gt;, such as  &lt;code&gt;&quot;Distance between &quot;&lt;/code&gt;, consist of zero or more characters embedded in double quotes, and ''[[Java Programming/Operators|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;operators&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;(in red)&lt;/span&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; are used to express basic computation such as addition or String concatenation or assignment. There are also left and right braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) which enclose ''blocks''. The body of a class is one such block. Some tokens are punctuation, such as periods &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and commas &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; and semicolons &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. You use ''whitespace'' such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, to separate tokens. For example, whitespace is required between keywords and identifiers: &lt;code&gt;publicstatic&lt;/code&gt; is a single identifier with twelve characters, not two Java keywords.

=== Declarations and Definitions ===

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: orange solid 3px; background-color: #fdc&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;+ &quot; is &quot; + point0.distance(point1));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: red solid 3px; background-color: #fcc&quot;&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dist.printDistance();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;figure-2&quot;&gt;Figure 2.2: The different declarations and definitions of the Java syntax in the &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/span&gt;

Sequences of tokens are used to construct the next building blocks of Java classes as shown [[#figure-2|above]]: declarations and definitions. A class declaration provides the name and visibility of a class. For our example, &lt;code&gt;public class Distance&lt;/code&gt; is the class declaration. It consists (in this case) of two keywords, {{java:public}} and {{java:class}}&lt;/code&gt; followed by the identifier &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;.

This means that we are defining a class named &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;. Other classes, or in our case, the command line, can refer to the class by this name. The &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; keyword is an [[Java Programming/Scope|access modifier]] which declares that this class and its members may be accessed from other classes. The &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword, obviously, identifies this declaration as a class. Java also allows declarations of ''[[Java Programming/Interfaces|interfaces]]'' and (as of Java 5) ''[[Java Programming/Annotations|annotations]]''.

The class declaration is then followed by a block (surrounded by curly braces) which provides the class's definition &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;(in blue in [[#figure-2|figure 2.2]])&lt;/span&gt;. The definition is the implementation of the class &amp;mdash; the declaration and definitions of the class's members.  This class contains exactly six members, which we will explain in turn.
# Two field declarations, named &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt;(in green)&lt;/span&gt;
# A constructor declaration &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange&quot;&gt;(in orange)&lt;/span&gt;
# Three method declarations &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;(in red)&lt;/span&gt;

==== Example: Instance Fields ====

The declaration
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.1: Declaration.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private java.awt.Point point0, point1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

...declares two ''instance fields''. Instance fields represent named values that are allocated whenever an instance of the class is constructed. When a Java program creates a &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; instance, that instance will contain space for &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt;. When another &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object is created, it will contain space for its ''own'' &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; values. The value of &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; in the first &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object can vary independently of the value of &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; in the second &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object.

This declaration consists of:

#The &lt;code&gt;[[Java Programming/Keywords/private|private]]&lt;/code&gt; access modifier,&lt;br/&gt;which means these instance fields are not visible to other classes.
#The type of the instance fields. In this case, the type is &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;This is the class &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;java.awt&lt;/code&gt; package.
#The names of the instance fields in a comma separated list.


These two fields could also have been declared with two separate but more verbose declarations,

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.2: Verbose declarations.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 private java.awt.Point point0;
 private java.awt.Point point1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Since the types of these fields is a reference type (i.e. a field that ''refers to'' or can hold a ''reference to'' an object value), Java will implicitly initialize the values of &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; to null when a &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; instance is created. The null value means that a reference value does not refer to an object. The special Java literal, {{java:null}} is used to represent the null value in a program. While you can explicitly assign null values in a declaration, as in

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.3: Declarations and assignments.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 private java.awt.Point point0 = null;
 private java.awt.Point point1 = null;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It is not necessary and most programmers omit such default assignments.

==== Example: Constructor ====

A ''[[Java Programming/Methods#Special method, the Constructor|constructor]]'' is a special method in a class which is used to construct an instance of the class. The constructor can perform initialization for the object, beyond that which the Java VM does automatically. For example, Java will automatically initialize the fields &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; to null.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.4: The constructor for the class'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public Distance(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) {
   point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);
   point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The constructor above consists of five parts:
#The optional [[Java Programming/Scope|access modifier(s)]]. &lt;br/&gt; In this case, the constructor is declared &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;
#The constructor name, which must match the class name exactly: &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;  in this case.
#The constructor parameters.&lt;br/&gt; The parameter list is required. Even if a constructor does not have any parameters, you must specify the empty list &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. The parameter list declares the type and name of each of the method's parameters.
#An optional {{java:throws}} clause which declares the [[Java Programming/Exceptions|exceptions]] that the constructor may throw. This constructor does not declare any exceptions.
#The constructor body, which is a Java block (enclosed in &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;).  This constructor's body contains two statements.

This constructor accepts four parameters, named &lt;code&gt;x0, y0, x1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y1&lt;/code&gt;. Each parameter requires a parameter type declaration, which in this example is &lt;code&gt;{{java:int}}&lt;/code&gt; for all four parameters. The parameters in the parameter list are separated by commas.

The two assignments in this constructor use Java's ''{{java:new}} operator'' to allocate two &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; objects. The first allocates an object representing the first point, &lt;code&gt;(x0, y0)&lt;/code&gt;, and assigns it to the &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; instance variable (replacing the null value that the instance variable was initialized to). The second statement allocates a second &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; instance with &lt;code&gt;(x1, y1)&lt;/code&gt; and assigns it to the &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; instance variable.

This is the constructor for the Distance class. Distance implicitly extends from &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object&lt;/code&gt;. Java inserts a call to the super constructor as the first executable statement of the constructor if there is not one explicitly coded. The above constructor body is equivalent to the following body with the explicit super constructor call:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.5: Super constructor.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{
   super();
   point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);
   point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

While it is true that this class could be implemented in other ways, such as simply storing the coordinates of the two points and computing the distance as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, this class instead uses the existing &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; class. This choice matches the abstract definition of this class: to print the distance between two points on the plane. We take advantage of existing behavior already implemented in the Java platform rather than implementing it again. We will see later how to make the program more flexible without adding much complexity, because we choose to use object abstractions here. However, the key point is that this class uses information hiding. That is, ''how'' the class stores its state or how it computes the distance is hidden. We can change this implementation without altering how clients use and invoke the class.

==== Example: Methods ====

[[Java Programming/Methods|Methods]] are the third and most important type of class member. This class contains three ''methods'' in which the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class is defined: &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt;

==== The printDistance() method ====

The &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt; method prints the distance between the two points to the standard output (normally the console).
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.6: &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt; method.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void printDistance() {
  System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + point0
    + &quot; and &quot; + point1
    + &quot; is &quot; + point0.distance(point1));
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This ''instance method'' executes within the context of an implicit &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object. The instance field references, &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt;, refer to instance fields of that implicit object. You can also use the special variable &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; to explicitly reference the current object. Within an instance method, Java binds the name &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; to the object on which the method is executing, and the type of &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is that of the current class. The body of the &lt;code&gt;printDistance&lt;/code&gt; method could also be coded as
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.7: Explicit instance of the current class.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + this.point0
    + &quot; and &quot; + this.point1
    + &quot; is &quot; + this.point0.distance(this.point1));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

to make the instance field references more explicit.

This method both computes the distance and prints it in one statement. The distance is computed with &lt;code&gt;point0.distance(point1)&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;distance()&lt;/code&gt; is an instance method of the &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; class (of which &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; are instances). The method operates on &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; (binding &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; to the object that &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; refers to during the execution of the method) and accepting another Point as a parameter. Actually, it is slightly more complicated than that, but we'll explain later. The result of the &lt;code&gt;distance()&lt;/code&gt; method is a double precision floating point number.

This method uses the syntax

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.8: String concatenation.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &quot;Distance between &quot; + this.point0
 + &quot; and &quot; + this.point1
 + &quot; is &quot; + this.point0.distance(this.point1)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

to construct a String to pass to the &lt;code&gt;System.out.println()&lt;/code&gt;. This expression is a series of ''String concatenation'' methods which concatenates Strings or the String representation of primitive types (such as doubles) or objects, and returns a long string. For example, the result of this expression for the points (0,3) and (4,0) is the String
{{XCode|1='''Output'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
&quot;Distance between java.awt.Point[x=0,y=3] and java.awt.Point[x=4,y=0] is 5.0&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
which the method then prints to &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt;.

In order to print, we invoke the &lt;code&gt;println()&lt;/code&gt;. This is an instance method from &lt;code&gt;java.io.PrintStream&lt;/code&gt;, which is the type of the static field &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; in the class &lt;code&gt;java.lang.System&lt;/code&gt;. The Java VM binds &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; to the standard output stream when it starts a program.

==== The main() method ====

The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method is the main entry point which Java invokes when you start a Java program from the command line. The command
{{XCode|1='''Output'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
java Distance 0 3 4 0
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
instructs Java to locate the Distance class, put the four command line arguments into an array of String values, then pass those arguments the &lt;code&gt;public static main(String[])&lt;/code&gt; method of the class. We will introduce arrays shortly. Any Java class that you want to invoke from the command line or desktop shortcut must have a main method with this signature or the following signature: &lt;code&gt;public static main(String...)&lt;/code&gt;.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.9: &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
   Distance dist = new Distance(
         intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
         intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
   dist.printDistance();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method invokes the final method, &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt;, four times. The &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; takes a single string parameter and returns the integer value represented in the string. For example, &lt;code&gt;intValue(&quot;3&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; will return the integer 3.

People who do test-first programming or perform regression testing
write
a main() method in every Java class, and
a [[Python Programming/Modules and how to use them | main() function in every Python module]],
to run automated tests.
When a person executes the file directly,
the main() method executes and runs the automated tests for that file.
When a person executes some other Java file
that in turn imports many other Java classes,
only one main() method is executed --
the main() method of the directly-executed file.

==== The &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method ====

The &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method delegates its job to the &lt;code&gt;Integer.parseInt()&lt;/code&gt; method. The main method could have called &lt;code&gt;Integer.parseInt()&lt;/code&gt; directly; the &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method simply makes the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method slightly more readable.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.10: &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private static int intValue(String data) {
   return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This method is {{java:private}} since, like the fields &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt;, it is part of the internal implementation of the class and is not part of the external programming interface of the &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class.

==== Static vs. Instance Methods ====

Both the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; methods are ''static methods''. The {{java:static}} keyword tells the compiler to create a single memory space associated with the class.  Each individual object instantiated has its own private state variables and methods but use the same &lt;b&gt;static&lt;/b&gt; methods and members common to the single class object created by the compiler when the first class object is instantiated or created.  This means that the method executes in a static or non-object context &amp;mdash; there is no implicit separate instance available when the static methods run from various objects, and the special variable &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is not available. As such, static methods cannot access instance methods or instance fields (such as &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt;) directly. The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method can only invoke the instance method &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt; method via an instance reference such as &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Data Types ===

Most declarations have a data type. Java has several categories of data types: reference types, primitive types, array types, and a special type, void.

==== Primitive Types ====

The ''[[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive types]]'' are used to represent boolean, character, and numeric values. This program uses only one primitive type explicitly, &lt;code&gt;''{{java:int}}''&lt;/code&gt;, which represents 32 bit signed integer values. The program also implicitly uses &lt;code&gt;''{{java:double}}''&lt;/code&gt;, which is the return type of the &lt;code&gt;distance()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; values are 64 bit IEEE floating point values. The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method uses integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3 to access elements of the command line arguments. The &lt;code&gt;Distance()&lt;/code&gt; constructor's four parameters also have the type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. Also, the &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method has a return type of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. This means a call to that method, such as &lt;code&gt;intValue(args[0])&lt;/code&gt;, is an expression of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. This helps explain why the main method cannot call:

{{XWarning|1=&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 2.11: Wrong type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
new Distance(args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3]) // This is an error
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Since the type of the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; array element is String, and our constructor's parameters must be &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, such a call would result in an error because Java cannot automatically convert values of type String into &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; values.

Java's primitive types are
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:boolean}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:byte}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:char}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:short}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:int}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:long}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:float}}''&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:double}}''&lt;/code&gt;. Each of which are also Java language keywords.

==== Reference Types ====

In addition to primitive types, Java supports ''reference type''. A reference type is a Java data type which is defined by a Java class or interface. Reference types derive this name because such values ''refer to'' an object or contain a ''reference to'' an object. The idea is similar to pointers in other languages like C.

Java represents sequences of character data, or ''[[Java Programming/API/java.lang.String|String]]'', with the reference type &lt;code&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/code&gt; which is most commonly referred to as &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. ''String literals'', such as  &lt;code&gt;&quot;Distance between &quot;&lt;/code&gt; are constants whose type is String.

This program uses three separate reference types:
# java.lang.String (or simply String)
# Distance
# java.awt.Point

:''For more information see chapter: [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types]].''

==== Array Types ====

Java supports ''[[Java Programming/Arrays|arrays]]'', which are aggregate types which have a fixed element type (which can be any Java type) and an integral size. This program uses only one array, &lt;code&gt;String[] args&lt;/code&gt;. This indicates that &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; has an array type and that the element type is &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. The Java VM constructs and initializes the array that is passed to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method. See ''[[Java Programming/Arrays|arrays]]'' for more details on how to create arrays and access their size.

The elements of arrays are accessed with integer indices. The first element of an array is always element 0. This program accesses the first four elements of the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; array explicitly with the indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. This program does ''not'' perform any input validation, such as verifying that the user passed at least four arguments to the program. We will fix that later.

==== void ====

{{Java:void}} is not a type in Java; it represents the absence of a type. Methods which do not return values are declared as ''void methods''.

This class defines two void methods:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.12: Void methods'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
public void printDistance()  { ... }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Whitespace ==
Whitespace in Java is used to separate the tokens in a Java source file. Whitespace is required in some places, such as between [[Java Programming/Scope|access modifiers]], [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|type names]] and Identifiers, and is used to improve readability elsewhere.

Wherever whitespace is required in Java, one or more whitespace characters may be used. Wherever whitespace is optional in Java, zero or more whitespace characters may be used.

Java whitespace consists of the
* space character {{Java:ch| }} (0x20),
* the tab character (hex 0x09),
* the form feed character (hex 0x0c),
* the line separators characters newline (hex 0x0a) or carriage return (hex 0x0d) characters.

Line separators are special whitespace characters in that they also terminate line comments, whereas normal whitespace does not.

Other Unicode space characters, including vertical tab, are not allowed as whitespace in Java.

=== Required Whitespace ===

Look at the {{Java:static}} method &lt;code&gt;intValue&lt;/code&gt;:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.13: Method declaration'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private static int intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Whitespace is required between {{Java:private}} and {{Java:static}}, between {{Java:static}} and {{Java:int}}, between {{Java:int}} and &lt;code&gt;intValue&lt;/code&gt;, and between &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.

If the code is written like this:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.14: Collapsed code'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
privatestaticint intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

...it means something completely different: it declares a method which has the return type &lt;code&gt;privatestaticint&lt;/code&gt; It is unlikely that this type exists and the method is no longer static, so the above would result in a semantic error.

== Indentation ==
Java ignores all whitespace in front of a statement. As this, these two code snippets are identical for the compiler:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.15: Indented code'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Distance dist = new Distance(
           intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
           intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
  dist.printDistance();
}

private static int intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.16: Not indented code'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
Distance dist = new Distance(
intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
dist.printDistance();
}

private static int intValue(String data) {
return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

However, the first one's style (with whitespace) is preferred, as the readability is higher. The method body is easier to distinguish from the head, even at a higher reading speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello, World Considered Harmful ==

I really dislike a Hello, World application as a first Java program. 
I propose [[User:Djb//First_Java_Program]] as a replacement for this page.
The first Java class there, and the associated discussions
may look more complicated but I think it will be much more educational and provide a better way of introducing Java as an OO language. This proposed first class also provides many opportunities to introduce other language concepts such as refactoring, overloading, packages, etc., all from a simple, understandable basis. I've not fleshed out the discussions here; I will work on them later...

Hello, I am a user of limited coding experiance by most standards. I was hoping to rely on this (and another tutorial hosted in Wikiversity) to pick up some Java, however, even with a few modifications made by seemingly intelligent reasoning, my IDE, Net Beans does not want to compile your code to the effect promised... or at all really. Someone please re-evaluate this code or add notes for my fellow Net Beans users, thank you. [[User:Zeotronic|Zeotronic]] 01:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

You can log out and log back in with a different session

Also, to Quit the KDE Display Manager

Use the following command:
 sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop
To restart kdm, enter:
 sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart
or, if you have currently stopped kdm:
 sudo kdm

You can also run the &quot;GNOME Display Manager&quot; (gdm) or the &quot;X Display Manager&quot; (xdm) with
 sudo gdm
and
 sudo xdm
(while no other display managers are running)

Note:  The code &quot;sudo /etc/init.d/&quot; can be used with &quot;kdm&quot;, &quot;gdm&quot;, or &quot;xdm&quot;, and is followed most commonly with &quot;start&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, or &quot;restart&quot;.

So far we have used Interface Builder to create a very simple interface for our &quot;hello world&quot; example. Now we'll look at it in a bit more detail so that we can see how to build much more complex and useful user interfaces.

==Building a GUI==

We have already discussed the concept of 'targets' and 'actions' in a very general way; now we'll see how Interface Builder makes extensive use of this to connect graphical controls to pieces of code that you write which implement the interesting functionality of your application.

Using &quot;hello world&quot; as a starting point, let's add a simple action to our code so that we can see how this works. The action is very basic - it just sets the font size of the text as a slider control is moved. In Xcode, click on &quot;GCHelloView.h&quot; so that it appears in the editor. Now add the following line to the class definition, below the other methods, but before the '@end' statement:

 - (IBAction)	textSizeAction:(id) sender;

Then do a Save to make sure this change is saved to the file. Here, we have declared the return type of the method to be IBAction. In fact, this is just a macro which is just 'void', but anything tagged as IBAction can be automatically detected by Interface Builder as an ''action routine'', that is, one which can be connected to any control that supports the target/action mechanism. We'll come back to Xcode in a moment to implement this method, but first let's hook it up in IB.

If IB isn't running, start it by double-clicking on 'MainMenu.nib'. Arrange the window in IB so that you can drag the file &quot;GCHelloView.h&quot; from Xcode to IB. This triggers IB to read the file, and so it will pick up the action method and add it to a list of available actions for the GCHelloView object. Next, switch back to the 'Instances' panel, and bring Window to the front by double-clicking its icon (or just click the window if you can see it). Make a bit of room at the bottom of the window by dragging it a little bigger. In the widgets palette, select the Controls panel (second from the left), and drag a horizontal slider control from the palette into the window. Make sure you put the slider in the space you made, not into the GCHelloView.

Select the slider control, and open the Inspector (Tools-&gt;Show Inspector if it's not visible). Make sure the pop-up menu is set to 'Attributes'. Set the attributes as follows:

* minimum - 9.0
* maximum - 72.0
* current - 48.0

Also, check the boxes 'Continuously send action while sliding' and 'Enabled'. The other settings should remain at their default values.

Next we need to give the slider control a target - that is, a connection to the object it should send the action to. IB sets up targets graphically. We control-drag FROM the sender of the action TO the target. A line will be drawn linking the two. Do that now - control-drag FROM the slider TO the GCHelloView. The Inspector will switch to the 'Connections' section and list all of the available action methods for GCHelloView. Highlight 'textSizeAction:' and click 'Connect' to make the connection. (Note - if textSizeAction: doesn't appear in the list, you can add it manually. Select GCHelloView in the 'Classes' list. Use the Inspector Attributes to switch to 'Actions', click 'Add', then type the name of the method - don't forget the colon! You might need to do this, since the earlier dragging of the file into IB, which should handle this for you, doesn't always seem to work reliably. Once you've added the method, try again with the control-drag step).

Save the changes, then return to Xcode. We now need to implement the action method. Find and select the GCHelloView.m file. Add the following method to the body of the implementation:

&lt;pre&gt;
 - (IBAction)	textSizeAction:(id) sender
 {
	[self setText:[self text] withSize:[sender floatValue]];
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[image:HWvers2.png|thumb|right|350px|Extended version of &quot;Hello World&quot; with slider control]]
Now Build and run the project. Drag the slider... the text should change size as you drag.

The above line implements the action. It is called whenever the slider is dragged to a new position, and sends a message to its own setText:withSize: method, passing the existing text ([self text]) and a size which is obtained from the slider's value itself. We set up the range of values in IB to be from 9 to 72 - this becomes the point size of the text. The 'sender' parameter to an action method is always the object that caused the action - in this case the slider. So we can simply call its 'floatValue' method to find out its current value, and simply pass that along as the text size. The change is immediately visible as you drag because we earlier added the line [self setNeedsDisplay:YES] to our setText:withSize: method, which causes Cocoa to call our drawRect: method, which redraws the text using the new size.

While simple, this example is very typical of how all controls interface to pieces of code in your application. You write an action method (which always has an IBAction return type, and a single 'sender' object parameter) in some suitable target object, then hook up that action and target in IB.

==Menu commands==

Menu commands work pretty much the same way as sliders or buttons. They have a target and an action. When the menu item is chosen, it sends the action to the target. You can set them up exactly like we did for the slider - control-drag FROM the menu item TO the target, select the action and click 'Connect'.

There are times when we don't want a menu command to go to a specific fixed target however, but one that depends on the context. For example, we might have an application with multiple similar windows open, such as a document. When the user chooses the 'Copy' or 'Paste' command, it should always target the currently active document. If we had tied this menu command to a specific target, these commands would not work as the user generally expects.

To fix this, Cocoa maintains a 'chain of command' which changes depending on the context. The frontmost window will contain a target which should be the first to respond to a command. If it can, it responds. If not, the command passes to the next object in the chain, which might be another view within the window, or the window itself. If the command can be handled, it is. If not, it passes up again, this time to the application object. If the application can't handle the command, it is discarded and ignored.

The first object in the chain that can respond to a command at any particular moment is called the '''first responder''', and an icon representing this object is shown in the main IB window. So all we need to do is to make it the target of our action, and we have solved the problem of changing targets for menu items. You'll find you can control-drag to this target just as any other targettable object. The 'Actions' list for the first responder lists all of the actions for all objects known to IB. You can link to any action. If the action is found within the current chain of command, the action will find its target and be executed. If the particular action can't be found in the chain of command at a particular time, what happens? Well, if the action is sent, nothing happens, because no-one responds to it, but in fact in this case Cocoa disables the menu item automatically! Thus actions that can't find a target are automatically greyed out, saving us a large part of the job of managing menu enabling as the context changes.

&quot;Hello World&quot; doesn't have multiple windows, so at this stage we can't demonstrate this convincingly, but shortly we'll be making a much more sophisticated application, and this approach will come into its own.

==Resizing Windows==

Run &quot;Hello World&quot;. Try resizing the window. It's probably not the behaviour you would expect - everything remains at a fixed distance from the bottom. Let's look at how we make views size the way we want them.

In Interface Builder, bring Window to the front and select the GCHelloView. Using the Inspector, switch to the 'Size' panel using the pop-up menu. The diagram there indicates which edges of the view should be rigidly linked to the edges of the window, and which can be flexible. By clicking on the links, you can change them from one to the other. GCHelloView should probably change size along with the window, so change the interior links to be flexible, and the exterior ones to be rigid. Now select the slider. Allow it to have a flexible link to the top and right edges, but a rigid link to the left and bottom edges. The interior should be rigid. Save the file and use Xcode to build and run the project. Now, you'll see that the GCHelloView (as shown by its blue border) stretches as you resize the window.

You'll probably notice that the text however, still doesn't seem to behave as we'd probably like, being a fixed distance from the bottom edge of the view. We are used to text remaining at a fixed distance from the TOP edge. The reason for this is that Cocoa's default coordinates follow the underlying Quartz graphics system, in which increasing y values go UP the screen, not down. While this is the mathematical convention, computer programmers are usually used to having things the other way up. Cocoa can allow any view to be ''flipped'' in this manner, using a simple override. So let's change it now.

In Xcode, select GCHelloView.m and add the following method to the implementation:
&lt;pre&gt;
 - (BOOL)  isFlipped
 {
     return YES;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is an override of an NSView method, so we don't need to declare it in our class. We simply return YES to let Cocoa know we'd like this view to have the y coordinate go from top to bottom. Build and run again and you'll see the difference this makes. Because of the choice of y coordinate used in drawRect:, the text will be fairly far down the view - you might like to change that to something like 10 so it's near the top.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cordwood Masonry'''

This construction method can be used as a survival technique or to create a long-term home.  The practice differs from creating a log cabin in that the logs are typically cut to 12 or 16 inch lengths and instead of being placed end to end are placed much the same as stacking wood to burn. The improvement comes when one uses a type of mortar to create a seal around the wood and acts as though the wood was a brick.
     
Increasing the length of wood can increase the thermal mass of the wall.  However in cold climates the greatest concern would be the ceiling and roof.  This is not an improvised shelter.  While the home can be built for next to nothing, proper construction will require a good saw for extended use.  If the only tool you had was a hatchet you may be better off building a cabin or hogan.

A good combination of clay soil and some type of dried grass can make a great mortar.  This may sound like a poor quality home for people living in &quot;modern housing&quot; but don't be fooled.  If built as to keep water away from the home especially these homes can last hundreds of years.  They have the same failing as all other homes made of wood.  Once the wood is wet termites can infest it.  Wet wood will also draw carpenter ants.  

Structurally, this type of home can be very resilient to bad weather and debris hitting the home.  The outside walls on these homes is very thick.  If you have the time this home can be built for almost no out of pocket expense and can be fitted at some expense with any modern convenience.

Well, &quot;Hello World&quot; will only take us so far. In order to get into more advanced aspects of Cocoa, we'll need to be a little more ambitious. The rest of this book will develop a new application, which will be a simple vector drawing program, a little like MacDraw. While we won't attempt to make this full featured, we will develop enough of the foundation so that you could go on to make it full featured.

The features we will develop are:

* Multiple drawings open at once (document interface)
* Saving and reading drawings from a file
* A palette of tools, such as rectangle, oval, line
* A drawing area allowing selection of objects for editing
* Objects can be resized and moved by dragging
* Objects can be cut and pasted
* An inspector for setting the properties of selected objects
* Changes are undoable
* Drawings can be printed

Writing a full-featured drawing program from scratch is not a small undertaking, though Cocoa is probably a faster route than most. Because we'd like to get to understand as much of Cocoa as possible, those parts of this code that don't contribute to this understanding will be glossed over a little. The full source code can be downloaded however.

==Application design==

Before we code, we must have a clear design in mind. Cocoa provides a lot of the basic infrastructure we'll need, such as a comprehensive document-based interface. However, we'll still have to develop a number of our own objects, since Cocoa is general purpose, and a drawing program is very specific.

We will need a class to embody the actual shapes that we will draw. Each new shape we draw creates a new instance of the object and adds it to a list of objects in the drawing. In fact the drawing is nothing more than a list of the objects it consists of. An array will make an ideal container for the contents of the drawing. By flattening the array to a file, we can easily save drawings. Reading a drawing file is a simple matter of reconstructing the array from the flattened file copy.

Because different shapes can be drawn, we will need different kinds of shape objects. Therefore a generic shape class which contains everything that is common to all shapes is needed, with subclasses of it to represent each different type of shape. The common class can deal with things such as the position and colours of the shape, handle mouse clicks, and so forth. The subclasses only need to provide the actual shapes. We will be using Cocoa's built-in graphics objects, mainly NSBezierPath, to implement the actual shape outlines.

The palette of tools is a user interface for selecting which type of shape will be drawn. One way to implement a tool palette is to use the selected tool to indicate which factory method should be used to make the shape being added. After that, the shape itself handles its own drawing. In fact the case of drawing the shape initially and resizing it later are almost the same, so we can leverage the same code for the two situations.

When we select objects, we will maintain a list of the selected objects. Another Array makes an ideal container for this. When the drawing is displayed, objects that are in the selection array can have the drag handles added. Changes to the selection need to be signalled to the Inspector so that it can update itself to reflect the object state, and so that it knows which object to target when changes are made. We will see how Cocoa makes this straightforward using notifications.

Every change to the list of objects, or to the object itself, needs to be recorded so it can be undone. As we will see, Cocoa has some very powerful features that make Undo quite easy to implement. As long as we design with Undo in mind, making it work is very straightforward.

The ability to print is also straightforward, because the Quartz graphics we will use for rendering is very close to the PDF (Portable Document Format) that is used for printing.

==Getting started==

To get started, return to Xcode and close the HelloWorld project. Choose File-&gt;New Project... In the assistant, find 'Cocoa Document-based application', select it and click 'Next'. Choose a name for the project - I have called it Wikidraw. Choose a path for the project - a good place is the same projects folder you made earlier, for the HelloWorld project. Click 'Finish'. A new project window is opened.

Click 'Build and Go' to compile the project source code, and run the resulting application. This time, an untitled window will be displayed, including the text 'your document contents here'. If you choose File-&gt;New, you'll get a second window, and so on. Unlike HelloWorld, you will see that automatically we have a multi-window application already, and we haven't written any code yet. Quit Wikidraw and return to Xcode.

In the left hand panel, drill down to Wikidraw-&gt;Resources-&gt;MyDocument.nib (in Xcode 4, these document-related files will be named &quot;Document&quot; rather than &quot;MyDocument&quot;). You'll see that we have a 'MainMenu.nib' as we did for HelloWorld, but also MyDocument.nib, which we didn't have before. This file contains the user interface resources for the document windows. MainMenu.nib, as before, contains the menubar and all the menus, but this time it doesn't include a Window. You can open these files in Interface Builder by double-clicking them. Have a look and see how they are different from the earlier case.

In developing Wikidraw, we will stick to these two resource files. Interface elements that pertain to the whole application, like the tool palette and the Inspector, will go in MainMenu.nib. Things that pertain to each document window, such as the view that displays the drawing, will go in MyDocument.nib. In all real applications, you will often create more .nib files as your interfaces develop, but we are trying to keep it fairly simple here. Once you get the general idea, it should be clear how and when to create new .nib files.

The first thing we'll do is customise the menu bar.

Open MainMenu.nib in IB, and double-click the 'MainMenu' icon. A small window containing a menu bar will open. To edit a menu, click its title to show the menu, then click the item to select it. Double-clicking an item selects it so you can edit its text. First go through and change every instance of 'NewApplication' to 'Wikidraw'.

We'll add more here later. Save the file, return to Xcode, build and run. Verify that the changes to the menubar show up.

==Setting up the document view==

Close MainMenu.nib, and open MyDocument.nib. Double-click Window to make it visible and frontmost. Position and size the window where you'd like it to show up in the application. Select and delete the 'Your document content here' text item. As with HelloWorld, drag a CustomView into the window. Position the view at the top left of the window . Choose Layout-&gt;Embed Objects In-&gt;Scroll View. This places the customView inside a scrollable view so that we will be able to scroll the drawing. Drag the scrollview so that it fits the edges of the window. Use the Size inspector to set the scroll view to follow the size of the window by making both interior &quot;springs&quot; flexible (click the straight line--it should become a coiled &quot;spring&quot;), and all the exterior ones rigid (straight). Double-click the CustomView to select it and use the Size inspector to make its width and height both 1500 pixels.

Create a subclass of NSView using the 'Classes' tab of the main window, selecting NSView, then choosing Classes-&gt;Subclass NSView. Type the class name as 'WKDDrawView'. Remember that if you are using XCode 3.0 or greater, Apple changed the way to do this step. In XCode, right click in the folder &quot;Other Sources&quot;, then mouse over &quot;Add&quot;, then &quot;New File...&quot;. Under the Cocoa heading, choose &quot;Objective-C NSView subclass&quot;. Type in your name in place of untitled, and leave the other stuff alone.

Use the Custom Class panel in the inspector to change the class of CustomView to WKDDrawView. (If you need to select the view, double-click it within the scroll view).

Finally, generate files for WKDDrawView (Classes-&gt;Create Files for WKDDrawView, having selected the class in the 'Classes' pane of the main window). Accept the default settings when asked if you want it added to the project. if you are using XCode 3.0 or greater, you can skip this step.

Save the nib file, and build and run it in Xcode. Verify that the window contains working scrollbars.

Assuming that works OK, let's add two simple methods to WKDDrawView.m. We will work in a flipped view, so we need to implement isFlipped, returning YES, and we can optimise drawing a little, by implementing a method called isOpaque, returning YES:

&lt;pre&gt;
 - (BOOL)	isFlipped
 {
	return YES;
 }


 - (BOOL)	isOpaque
 {
	return YES;
 }

&lt;/pre&gt;

Build and Go again to confirm that the scrollbars now start at the top rather than the bottom, and that the view is filled with white rather than the Aqua background stripes.

Depending on your location in the country or world, many types of food could already be available in your surroundings depending on the time of the year.  

Since the purpose of this book is self reliance lets operate with the idea of having a permanent connection to your land and surrounding area.  As you look at the location you are living in.  You need to keep your eyes open on a weekly basis.  New types of fruit and vegetable can make themselves available to you as the seasons progress. Marking on a calendar when and where you harvested will keep you prepared for next year. 

You must avoid the tendancy to over exploit any one food.  This leads to stomach upset very quickly and a poor diet will create health issues as time progresses.  Their have been times when I paid the price for too many green apples or too much yellow wood sorrel.

The list of edibles is incredibly long: Yellow Wood Sorrel, Apples and Crab apples, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, wild carrots, grapes, and currants are just some of my favorites from my area.  Other areas that I have been in offer; coconuts, mango, banana, paw paw, bamboo and sea weed.  Exploration of your area is the only way to get a full knowledge of what is available to you.  

Even the smallest amount of care for these wild plants will pay you back with large dividends.  Remove weeds from around the plants, make sure they get some water in a dry spell and pruning fruiting trees as needed are all quick easy methods of improving your harvest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Standard''' (also known as Type 2) is a Constructed format where the total card pool is restricted by sets.  Normally, this standard format pool consists of cards from the most recent core set and the two most recent expansion blocks.

The core set is currently comprised of the Magic 2011 core set(m11), the Magic 2012 Core set (m12), the Zendikar block and the Scars of Mirrodin block.

Players must have at least a 60-card deck (and optional sideboard containing exactly 15 cards) consisting of cards of any printings that are legal in the current standard format. Players must be able to shuffle their decks without assistance.  Decks (including the sideboard) may contain no more than 4 copies of any card other than basic lands.  In addition, certain cards may be &quot;banned&quot; (the card may not be used). There are currently two banned cards in the Standard Format. Jace, The Mind Sculpter and Stoneforge Mystic.

As of July 15th, 2011, the sets legal in Standard are:

&lt;DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''ZENDIKAR BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Zendikar&lt;br&gt;
Worldwake&lt;br&gt;
Rise of the Eldrazi&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Scars of Mirrodin BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Scars of Mirrodin&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Mirrodin Besieged&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;New Phyrexia&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''CORE SET'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;2011 (M11)&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;2012 (M12)&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;/DL&gt;

After September 30th Standard Legal Sets will consist of

&lt;DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Scars of Mirrodin BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Scars of Mirrodin&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Mirrodin Besieged&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;New Phyrexia&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Innistrad Block'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Innistrad&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Dark Ascension&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''CORE SET'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;2012 (M12)&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;/DL&gt;


Since the format rotates with each new block set release, decks have a maximum shelf life of two years, meaning that the format is quick to change and easily impacted. There are deck archetypes that have waxed and waned through the years, but maintain their existence in some form or another (White Weenie, Ponza, blue-based control, red aggro), while others (usually combo decks) are spawned from the centerpiece card (Tooth and Nail, Enduring Ideal), and are thus usually subject to their key card leaving Standard.

The Vintage format allows the use of all cards in the magic cardpool, barring those found in the Unglued/Unhinged sets, and those found on the banned and restricted list.  This list can be found on the link provided above.

A banned card is a card that cannot be played at all.  In vintage, only &quot;athletic&quot; cards, cards which require you to perform some sort of physical feat like flipping a card or spinning a card, and cards that deal with the &quot;ante&quot; are banned.  Ante was how magic was originally played, with players essentially playing each other for a card in the other's deck.  The only other card that is banned from the format is Shahrazad.

If a card is restricted, a deck may only contain one copy of it between the maindeck and the sideboard.  These are cards that are either format-warping, incredibly strong, or as recently declared by Aaron Forsythe in an article, &quot;un-fun&quot;.

&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;Hi guys, this is Surya, &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I'm a proud son, good brother &amp;amp; a great friend other than being a cricketer, cook, guide, software engineer, philosopher, tennis player, guitarist(soon&amp;nbsp;;))&amp;amp; many&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;My father's eldest brother (pedananna) proudly named as Surya Chandra Ra0 Gandreddi. I'm unfortunate to born to my Mom &amp;amp; Dad (:pp) on Febraury, 26th 1981.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I like so many things, out of which I like the most are girls and sports(alphabetical order&amp;nbsp;;)). Cricket is my passion. I play all kinds of sports, and I talk (make friendship) with all kinds of girls ..ssshh.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I have some problems, one of my biggest problem I want to be nice to people. &quot;Kindness is a desire that makes you want to do good things even though you dont get anything in return&quot;. May be this is what I had a bit 

more than any normal guy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I too love. My experience in Love is 1+0.98+0.0004 one-side&amp;nbsp;:) loves, once completely failed.... and almost fall in the second one, and just looking for the third one with two very real bad experiences, wish me all the best.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I have some drawbacks, one of my biggest drawback is ... unable to give the biggest drawbacks, lemme think.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;Can you read this line=&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT color=white&gt;I'm Modest, by now you must have known that. I always hide things from people, just like this :) /FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;Watchout this place to know more....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;2006, No SENTI&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;Hi guys, this is Surya.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;I'm a proud son, good brother &amp;amp; a great friend other than being a cricketer, cook, guide, software engineer, philosopher, tennis player, guitarist(;))&amp;amp; many&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;My father's eldest brother (pedananna) proudly named as Surya Chandra Ra0 Gandreddi. I'm fortunate to born to my Mom &amp;amp; Dad (:pp) on Febraury, 26th 1981.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;I always try to be kind but there are many others who are much worse than you can think of(kind-kinder-kindest).... so practically its tough for me to reach there.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;yeah man,I too love.. some love stories, but all of them are bad experiences but you know what in life there is always a next chance.... so waiting for the next bus *Hum Tum*&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;I have some drawbacks, one of my biggest drawback is ... nope I dont have any.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;Some people say I'm Modest, Is it so? :) .....  &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;Watchout this place to know more....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkred&gt;2007&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkred&gt;I'm getting married this Feb, 9th.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;

Types of movements:

LCD:  The most common digital.  Uses a Liquid Crystal Display to tell time--Generally black numbers on a silver or gray background, however colors are becoming more common.  Some LCD watches have more than just a basic readout of time, such as the Fossil Big Tic series that have animated seconds digits. 

Stepper-motor Quartz:  The most common type of analog watch.  These have one or more stepper motors that move in precise increments.  A typical watch will have a single stepper motor to drive the hands through a series of gears, while a chronograph may have one for each independent hand.  

LED:  The first type of digital watch, using glowing red numbers to read the time.  These required a large amount of current for a watch--Typically using 2 of the largest watch batteries available would give a year or so of run time, even with the display only active when the button is pushed.  Difficult to read in sunlight.  Obsolete soon after the LCD. 

Tuning fork--Invented by Bulova, most commonly known as the Accutron.  In this watch a tiny tuning fork vibrates at around 300-360 Hz, driving a tiny toothed wheel with a matching number of teeth.  This wheel would turn once per second, and in turn drove the rest of the movement.  Far more accurate than watches available at the time, surpassed by Quartz which could be made both cheaper and more accurate.  Several other watch companies either used Accutron movements or licensed the Accutron patents.  Tuning fork watches can be easily recognised by their completely smooth sweeping second hand.  

Electric/Elecronic:  While these terms would be a technically accurate description for any of the watches above, it is most generally understood to refer to movements with electrically-driven balance wheels.  To avoid confusion, these may be known as electromechanical or balance-wheel electric.   The earliest versions had no electronic components and suffered from contact arcing which limited the life of the watch.  The earliest ones had little practical advantage over automatic watches, and were not particularly reliable.  

Hybrid Quartz:  Either a balance-wheel electric or a tuning fork movement controlled by a quartz crystal. The first Timex quartz was a balance-wheel electric with a quartz module controlling the rate of the escapement.  The first Swiss quartz and the Accutquartz were both tuning-fork based hybrids.  A transitional step before switching to stepper-motor technology.  

Mechanical:  Using the power of a coiled spring to run the watch.  Almost all modern mechanical watches use some form of the lever escapement.  Some inexpensive watches in the 1800's and early 1900's used a cylinder escapement which is both more fragile and less accurate than a lever escapement.  

Lever escapement watches can be divided into pinlever and jeweled-lever, and mechanical watches can be divided into automatic (also known as self-winding) and manual wind.  A few watches use a plastic fork shaped like a jeweled lever.  

A jeweled lever watch has 2 jewels on the portion of the lever that touches the escape wheel.  A jeweled lever movement will almost always have at least 7 jewels--In addition to the jewels on the fork, there will be 2 cap, 2 pivot and an impulse jewel on the escape wheel.  

A pinlever watch will have the main body of the fork below the escape wheel, with hardened steel pins extending upward to a specially shaped escape wheel.  These watches were generally considerably cheaper, as well as less accurate and less durable over time (although likely more forgiving of abuse) than jeweled lever watches.  Typically they would have no jewels, or a single nearly useless cap jewel on the escape wheel.
There were some pinlever watches with a jeweled escapement, these were generally done for marketing reasons rather than for technical merit, since a jeweled lever will help timekeeping far more than a jeweled train.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Subdivision and Such==
Wings 3d is a polygon modeler that incorporates subdivision as one of its core functions. Wings and other modeling packages that subdivide polygonal meshes are often referred to as &quot;subdivision modelers&quot;. Wings is also often called a &quot;box modeler&quot; since most models start out as a cube primitive.

===Types of Subdivision=== 

There are fundamentally three types of subdivision surface styles available for polygon modelers:
&lt;ul&gt;
[[Image:Wings_Subd.png|frame|right|''Left: Smoothed Cube, Centre: Cube Primitive, Right: Faceted.  To achieve the facet type subdivision all the edges on the centre cube were made Hard prior to the Smooth operation. This kept the cube from smoothing out as the one on the left did.'']]
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Simply subdivides (tessellates) the model without doing any smoothing.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smooth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Does the subdivision and smooths the model by displacing the resulting vertices. This makes it look much more organic, which is why subdivision modeling has become so popular for organic modeling.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Metaform shows the smoothed model with the un-smoothed cage floating about it.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
[[Image:Wings_Cube.png|frame|left|''Wings has the ability to do facet and smooth, but currently does not support metaform. To get a feel for metaform modeling, create an object, press the '''Shift+Tab''' key combination for the Quick Smooth Preview then hit the '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' key by itself to lay the wireframe on top of it. This is similar to metaforms, but with true metaforms you would be able to specify the number of smooth levels, and manipulating the un-smoothed cage would give real-time  feedback to the smoothed model so you could see how changes affect the final form.'']]

===To Smooth Or Not To Smooth===

One of the mistakes new modelers often make is subdividing their models too soon, and/or too often.  When modelers smooth too soon and don't get the organic form they were hoping for they then often resort to smoothing again, to make it look well... smoother. Some people will smooth a model three or four times to try and get it to look right. This is almost always a mistake. It creates very bloated models, meaning a high in polygon count, which devour lots of memory needlessly. If you take the time to hand craft in details, then one smooth is likely to give you the results you want, the model will be much more efficient, and it will most likely look better too.

====Hard Edge Modeling: ''Keeping Edges Crisp''====

Often a model will lose desired edges and creases when it is smoothed. Fortunately there are several methods to keep sharp details even on a smoothed model.  There are three basic ways to ensure that an edge will stay sharp.  You can use '''Bevel''' on corners to add a slight chamfer which will help preserve the detail. Or you can add ''control edges'' on either side of edges you wish to remain defined. Sometimes these are called ''mechanical bevels'' and they offer the most control over how a model appears after smoothing.  You can also select the necessary edges and set them to '''Hard'''. Be sure the model export format and the rendering engine you intend to use support hard edges, or you may not get the results you expect.  The added geometry of Bevels or Control Edges on the other hand will always do the trick.

Another reason to use '''Bevel''' instead of hard edges is that they help show off detail. It seems that sharp edges don't show specularity well, making details hard to see. By giving man made objects softer edges via Bevel, it increases their specularity, thereby drawing out the detail that would otherwise be lost. Some online model stores will not even accept models for sale that do not use beveled edges to maintain detail, so avoid hard edges if you can.

And as with smoothing, some people tend to '''Bevel''' too soon in the modeling process. It should be one of the last things you do, unless you are using it to create new base geometry. The reason is that it overcomplicates your model, forcing you to manipulate many more elements than you otherwise would have had to deal with had you not beveled too soon.

We have already seen how to create a subclass of NSView that gives us the ability to draw in a window. Before we get into the hard work of implementing our drawing program, Wikidraw, we'll need to have a better understanding of graphics, and how to use the built-in vector graphics API, to do our bidding.

First let's recap the principles of views and how they draw. When we subclass NSView, we supply a method called drawRect: which Cocoa will call whenever it needs us to draw the content of our view. Any code we place here is executed at that time, so if we place graphics commands here, we can draw in the window. Anything we draw will be confined automatically to the boundary (the ''bounds'') of our view. Within the view, we have our own coordinate system, so we can draw without regard to where our view is within the window - everything is drawn relative to the view's bounds. Normally, coordinates are arranged so that x increases from left to right, and y increases from bottom to top, but by implementing isFlipped, returning YES, we can invert the y axis which will usually be more comfortable for programmers.

The coordinate system within a view starts at 0,0 for the top, left (assuming it is flipped), and increases by 1 for each pixel. However, coordinates are expressed as floating point values, so it's perfectly reasonable to specify a point 2.5 pixels across or 3.5612 pixels down if you want. We are not limited to integer coordinates, in other words. The view will render appropriately, rasterising our graphics using antialiasing so that these fractional pixel positions do have the proper outcome on a screen.

==NSBezierPath==

A key object for drawing any shapes in Cocoa is NSBezierPath. Its name is a little misleading, since while it is able to render bezier paths, it can also handle a variety of shapes including rectangles, circles, lines and polygons. Think of NSBezierPath as a '''list''' of coordinate points that can be joined up by lines, or optionally by curved bezier paths. We can build a list of points, adding them to the path object. We can then draw the outline of the path formed (called ''stroking'') or fill the interior of a closed shape (called ''filling''). A stroked path can have any width we choose. We can either use any colour we choose, or with more effort, a gradient or patterned fill.

Earlier we used a utility function, NSFrameRect, to draw the bounds of the view used in HelloWorld. Behind the scenes, NSFrameRect simply makes a temporary NSBezierPath object with a rectangular shape, then strokes the path. In Wikidraw, we will be using NSBezierPath as our workhorse to draw each shape we create.

Before we do that though, let's just try out a few simple shapes with NSBezierPath to get an idea of how it works. We'll temporarily add some code to WKDDrawView's drawRect: method. Later we'll remove it and put the real code there. To make this easier, we'll put our test code into a method called testDraw, and call it from drawRect.  Add the following code to WKDDrawView.m:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
static NSPoint tp[] = { 10, 10, 400, 100, 300, 200, 10, 150 };

- (void)	testDraw
{
	NSBezierPath* path = [NSBezierPath bezierPath];
	
	[path moveToPoint:tp[0]];
	[path lineToPoint:tp[1]];
	[path lineToPoint:tp[2]];
	[path lineToPoint:tp[3]];
	[path closePath];	
	[[NSColor yellowColor] set];
	[path fill];
	
	[[NSColor blackColor] set];
	[path stroke];
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To make supplying a set of points easier, we just create a static array with alternating x and y values. We can then refer to these points as tp[0], tp[1] and so on. We create an NSBezierPath object called 'path'. We use a class factory method to return an empty object, which is autoreleased, so we don't need to retain or release it, just use it and forget it.

We form the path using the moveToPoint:/lineToPoint: methods, finally closing the shape using closePath. Then we set yellow as the drawing colour and ask the path to fill itself. Then we set black and ask the path to stroke itself.

Next we need to call our method from drawRect: so it gets drawn when the view is refreshed. We also need to do one other thing. Though we have signalled that our view is opaque, we do need to erase the part of the background we are refreshing to avoid problems when we scroll. The 'rect' parameter passed to drawRect: is the area that is to be redrawn, so we set the colour white and erase this rect using the utility NSRectFill. Then we call our testDraw method.

&lt;pre&gt;
 - (void)	drawRect:(NSRect) rect
 {
	[[NSColor whiteColor] set];
	NSRectFill( rect );

	[self testDraw];
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add this code then Build and Go. Verify that the shape is drawn and that it works correctly when the view is scrolled. Now you have a basic mechanism for experimenting with NSBezierPath, you might like to explore some of its other methods, such as curveToPoint:controlPoint1:controlPoint2: which is how bezier curves are specified. You can also set rectangles and ovals in one go. Try altering the stroke width. Look at the documentation for NSBezierPath to see what else it can do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Nature of Edge Loops==

''Edge Loop'' is a term you will see used often in polygon modeling circles. It is often confusing to new users just what edge loops are and what their significance to modeling is. Edge loops can be thought of in two senses:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series of edges connecting vertices that are shared by four faces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the aesthetic sense, the controlling elements that define the overall form of the object you are trying to model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In the first sense they are important to Wings because if you maintain them well you can breeze up and down the edge loop chain with the '''F3''' and '''F4''' keys to do all sorts of tweaks and adjustments in no time. Let them fall apart and you'll be selecting things manually by hand constantly to make such adjustments.

But it's deeper than that. It has to do with how the overall form of the model will eventually turn out; whether or not it flows. I am told that Bay Raitt first coined the term as a way to create and maintain overall aesthetic control over a model, to use them to mimic the structure of the object, such as muscles.
&lt;!--There is a whole section on the use of edge loops in an article written by Bay Raitt and Greg Minter located at http://www.izware.com/news/indexa446.html. I suggest you read it in it's entirety. (Digital Sculpting Techniques by Bay Raitt and Greg Minter © Nichimen Graphics, 1998.) NOTE TO EDITORS: THE LINK IS DEAD--&gt;

So you can see that there are edge loops and there are edge loops. What I mean by that is that there are the actual loops themselves, composed of a series of edges all joined together at non-pole intersections, and there are the edge loops that define the form and nature of your model&lt;!--, as Bay Raitt describes in his excellent treatise--&gt;. Learning about the former is relatively easy and is necessary in order to develop the latter. But the real power and beauty of edge loops is in the latter, in the way they control and define the form and detail of the model. Here is where the true art occurs.

As stated before, technically, edge loops are a series of edges joined together at non-pole intersections. A non-pole intersection is an intersection of four edges at a given vertex. This is why quads usually help maintain edge loops, they help minimize poles. The edges that encircle an arm are edge loops.&lt;!--But if you look at the illustrations in Mr. Raitt's article, you will see there are other more important loops involved in the arm that link it to the chest and beyond. But that gets more into the artistic aspect, which I am not well qualified to discuss. So, back to the physical world.--&gt;

In Wings, there are tools that let you take advantage of edge loops in your modeling. You can use '''Loop Cut''' to cut off parts of the model when needed. You can select by edge loops and by edge rings (series of opposing edges of adjacent quads), and then work with that selection. You can use the '''F3''' and '''F4''' keys to march up and down a chain of edge loops to do rapid model adjustments. And of course there is the all-important central edge loop.

The central edge loop is important if you want to use '''Mirror''' or '''Virtual Mirror''' to speed up your modeling. If you maintain your central edge loop, the loop that runs entirely around the long axis of your model, then you will be able to model on one half of the model, '''Loop Cut''' off the other half, and then '''Mirror''', which will cut your modeling time in half. By maintain, I mean to keep the edges straight and not have it interrupted by poles. The first point is an absolute requirement, or very strange things will happen when you mirror. You can work around the second point. If when you go to select the loop it only partially encircles your model because of pole interruptions, you can manually select other parts to get a full loop for the '''Loop Cut''' operation.

Poles are vertices where more or less than four edges converge. An edge loop can only extend past a vertex at which four edges come together. If you think of a polygonal mesh as a city map with edges for streets, faces for city blocks and vertices for junctions, then drawing an edge loop means going straight on at four-way junctions and stopping at any others.

Keep in mind that quads (faces with four edges) do not ensure the absence of poles. To demonstrate this, create a cube and smooth it once. Now select an edge one level down from the top vertex. Do a '''Select''' | '''Edge Loop'''. The selected loop will not run all the way around the object, despite the fact that it is made entirely of quads. Examine where it stopped and you will see that there is indeed a three edged pole present where it stopped. Connect that vertex to the top most vertex (thus creating two triangles) and try the experiment again. The edge loops now runs on longer, despite the fact that there are now triangles in the model. Why? Because there are now four
edges	at 	that 	intersection; you have eliminated one pole, which was not necessarily a good thing to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Winged Edge Topology==
One of the reasons Wings works so well with edge loops and edge rings is the fact that it is based on a topological data structure called ''winged edge topology''.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WingedEdgeTopo.jpg|right]] --&gt;Winged edge topology is a method that mathematically defines all elements in a model by their relationships to other elements of the model. This is done by a set of tables; specifically, face, edge and node tables.

In the figure on the right, I have selected one face (Face 71) and then switched to Edge Mode to select its component edges. Similarly, if we had just selected Edge 72 and then done an edge loop selection, Wings would have selected edges 60, 68, 28, and the others on the back of the model that we can not see, to complete the loop. For a more detailed description of the winged edge data structure you can read The Winged Edge Data Structure by Dr. Ching-Kuang Shenefound here: http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/model/winged-e.html

The Status Line of Wings tells us that Face 71 is encircled by edges 9, 16, 70 and 72. (Note that newer versions of Wings place this information in a string at the top left of the workspace.) It only knows this because the winged edge topology exists to provide the information.

It is beyond the scope of a User's Manual to get into a thorough discussion of the winged edge data structure. It is enough to know that Wings is based on this data structure and it is used to make and manipulate selection sets very rapidly. You can also find winged edge topology illustrated from a geographic point of view here: http://www.bequia.swinternet.co.uk/edgeex.html

===Reference===
To use the commands in the menu, select one or more vertices and press RMB.
====Axes====
Many commands require that you select an axis from the menu. This axis defines the direction or orientation for the command.

In addition to the three world axes&amp;mdash;X, Y and Z&amp;mdash;many commands work with vertex normals, custom axes, default axes and most recently used axes.

If you specify vertex normals as the axis (by selecting '''Normal'''), each selected vertex uses its individual normal. Otherwise, the specified direction/orientation is used by all selected vertices.

Custom axes can be specified only when advanced menus are enabled. For details about this feature, see [[/The Wings3D Command Reference Guide/Advanced Menus|Advanced Menus]].

A default axis is an axis that you define in advance to use later. To define the default axis, use the '''Tools''' | '''Set Default Axis''' in the main menu. This is done in two stages: first you specify the actual axis, and then the point of origin for that axis. A default axis is stored until you redefine it. To recall the default axis for a vertex operation, such as '''Move''', select '''Default Axis''' from the vertex operations menu.

The '''Last Axis''' menu item recalls the axis you used during your most recent operation.
====Move, Rotate and Scale====
Moving, rotating or scaling are straightforward operations.

To move the selection, specify the axis you want to move it along. For details about axes, see above.

To rotate the selection, specify the pivot axis. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (center of rotation) is set automatically as well.

'''Scale Uniform''' scales the selection in all directions at once. If you use custom axes, specify the pivot point (scaling center). This can be used to quickly snap a vertex somewhere.

'''Scale Axis''' scales the selection along the axis you specify. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (scaling center) is set automatically as well.

'''Scale Radial''' scales sideways around the axis you specify, but not along it. Each vertex stays on the plane perpendicular to the specified axis. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (scaling center) is set automatically as well.

====Extrude====
Creates an edge loop that splits the edges connected to each selected vertex, and moves the vertex along the axis you specify, creating a &quot;spike&quot;.

====Flatten====
Puts the selected vertex or vertices on a plane perpendicular to the axis you specify. Can be used to make areas of the model planar or as a snapping tool.
Has three modes depending on which mouse button you click the command with:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;LMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Use one of the world axes, the default axis or the last axis. With advanced menus enabled, right-clicking an axis label lets you choose the point that the target plane must pass through.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Specify two things: a custom axis (for the plane normal) and a custom point that the target plane must pass through.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Specify a custom axis for the plane normal. The target plane passes through the center of the selection, so it doesn't make sense to use this option with one vertex selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
====Intersect====
Advanced aligning, projection and snapping tool. Requires advanced menus.
Has three modes depending on which mouse button you click the command with:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;LMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Projects the selected vertex or vertices along an axis onto a plane. Specify the axis first and the plane next.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Arranges the selected vertices along the specified line. The positions and spacing between the vertices are determined as follows: Wings puts parallel planes through each vertex and positions the vertices where their planes intersect the specified line. Specify two things: the normal of the resulting planes and the line that runs through them (and &quot;marks&quot; vertex positions).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Collects all selected vertices at the point where a custom line intersects a custom plane. Specify four things:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The direction of the line&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The point that the line must pass through&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The normal of the plane&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The point that the plane must pass through&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

====Connect====
[[Image:Spiral.PNG|right]]
Creates edges that connect the selected vertices as long as the vertices share a face. Tends to create quads when given a choice. For example, in the image on the right, a guiding edge loop has been created manually. Here, '''Connect''' will create spiraling threads to try and conform to that loop. Without that first loop, '''Connect''' will make closed loops that go all the way round the cylinder.

====Tighten====
Averages the positions of the selected vertices, taking into account the vertices that surround the selection.

As you drag the mouse, Wings uses percentages to show the strength of '''Tighten'''. At 100%, you get the most tension-free surface that the current iteration of '''Tighten''' can produce. If you still want less tension, do another '''Tighten'''.
You can use it to gently smooth out regions where you've made changes in the surface too harsh, by tightening specific areas slightly.

====Bevel====
Creates a face in place of each selected vertex, putting the vertices of the new face on the edges that shared the original vertex. Drag the mouse to slide the face along those edges.
Bevel has no effect on vertices where only two edges meet (a single edge cut in two). Such vertices should be eliminated, by the way, using '''Dissolve''' or '''Collapse''' (or '''Cleanup''' in body mode).

====Dissolve====
Removes the vertex or vertices, adjusting the faces and edges associated with it accordingly and leaves you in face selection mode.

====Collapse====
Removes the vertex. Unlike '''Dissolve''', '''Collapse''' leaves you in vertex selection mode so that you can continue to select and eliminate vertices without having to switch modes.

====Crumple====
Moves the selected vertices at random speed along the specified axis. With the '''Random''' option, direction is also random.
Good for adding &quot;noise&quot;.

====Inflate====
Pushes/pulls selected vertices away from/towards a center using a falloff radius to decrease strength with distance. Vertices outside the radius reverse their direction.
Left-clicking the command uses the center of the selection and the distance from it to the furthest selected vertex as the radius. Right-clicking the command (with advanced menus enabled) lets you specify the center and the radius.

====Taper====
Scales up sideways whatever is selected up the specified axis and scales down sideways whatever is selected down the axis. Scale strength increases linearly from the selection center.

====Twist====
Twists the selected vertices proportionally along the specified axis around the selection center.

====Torque====
Twists the selected vertices proportionally along the specified axis. Unlike '''Twist''', this operation always uses ''world'' axes that intersect at the origin (X=Y=Z=0).

====Vertex Color====
Opens a dialog box where you can specify a color for the selected vertices. The specified color is strongest at the target vertices and fades out towards surrounding vertices.

'''Note:''' A vertex cannot have a color and a UV coordinate at the same time.

====Bend====
'''Bend''' is a family of tools that deform the selected vertices along a curve. '''Bend''' is available only if advanced menus are enabled.

There are 3 types of bend deformation depending on which mouse button you click the '''Bend''' command with: Plastic Bend, Pivot Bend and TopRad Bend.

=====Plastic Bend=====
Click '''Bend''' with '''LMB''' to go into Plastic Bend mode. In this mode, you put an imaginary rod through your selection and bend the rod. The selection follows the curvature of the rod. To visualize what Plastic Bend does, find a ballpoint pen and take out the ink reservoir and the spring. Put the spring in the middle of the reservoir and wrap the reservoir round the side of a cup. The spring follows suit.

In this real-life example, the ink reservoir represents the rod that you use with Plastic Bend, and the spring represents your vertex selection. Note that the length of the rod stays the same, only the curvature changes.

The bend amount is specified in degrees. At 0 degrees, the rod is straight. At 180 degrees, the center and both ends are located on the line you specify. If you extend the curvature of the rod, you will get a circle or a flat spiral.

Specify three things for Plastic Bend:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod center&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point that marks the middle of the rod.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod top&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point where the positive extreme end of the rod is located. The other end is located opposite it at the same distance from the center. The rod top does not mean that bending ends there. The curvature remains constant even past this point. The rod top and bottom are simply the points that will find themselves on a straight line passing through them and the rod center at a 180-degree bend.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bend normal&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the direction of a line that passes through the center. At a 180-degree bend, the rod center, the rod top and the rod bottom are all located along this line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=====Pivot Bend=====
Click '''Bend''' with '''MMB''' to go into Pivot Bend mode. In this mode, you also have a rod, but you use it differently. First you specify where the rod is located and how it is curved, and then you stretch the vertex selection proportionally along it.

To continue our ink reservoir and spring analogy, you first wrap the reservoir with the spring on it round the side of a cup and hold it there, and then start stretching the spring. The stretching spring follows the curvature of the ink reservoir.

The bend amount is specified in degrees. At 0 degrees, the vertex selection is flattened about the rod center. At other values, it is stretched along the rod curve. If you extend the curvature of the rod, you will get a circle, a helix (spring shape) or a 3D spiral.

Specify four things for Pivot Bend:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod center&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point that marks the middle of the rod.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod top&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point where the positive extreme end of the rod is located. The other end is located opposite it at the same distance from the center. The rod top does not mean that bending ends there. The curvature remains constant even past this point.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pivot axis&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This axis defines how the final bent rod will be oriented. As we have pointed out, the resulting curvature can be a circle, a helix or a 3D spiral. If it’s a circle, then the pivot axis is perpendicular to the circle’s plane. If it’s a helix or 3D spiral, then the pivot axis is a line that this helix or spiral coils around.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pivot location&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point through which the pivot axis runs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=====TopRad Bend=====
Click '''Bend''' with '''RMB''' to go into TopRad Bend mode. In this mode, you first define the curvature of the rod and then stretch the flattened selection along the rod, as in Pivot Bend. However, you define the curvature in the same way as for Plastic Bend&amp;mdash;you specify a line that runs through the center, and both ends of the curved rod.
The bend amount is specified in degrees. At 0 degrees, the vertex selection is flattened about the rod center. At other values, it is stretched along the rod curve. If you extend the curvature of the rod, you will get a circle or a 2D spiral.

Specify three things for TopRad Bend:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod center&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point that marks the middle of the rod.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod top&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point where the positive extreme end of the rod is located. The other end is located opposite it at the same distance from the center. The rod top does not mean that bending ends there. The curvature remains constant even past this point.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bend normal&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash; This is the direction of a line that passes through the center. The rod is bent in such a way that the rod center, the rod top and the rod bottom are all located along this line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

====Bend Clamped====
Bend Clamped has the same functionality as Bend and the same three modes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend Clamped Plastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend Clamped Pivot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend Clamped TopRad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
See above for details.
The difference is that Bend Clamped lets you set limits for rod curvature. In addition to the Bend options, Bend Clamped requires that you specify two more:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top Clamp Point&amp;mdash;This is a point ''up'' the rod (or up the rod extension) at which the rod stops curving and continues as a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom Clamp Point&amp;mdash;This is a point ''down'' the rod (or down the rod extension) at which the rod stops curving and continues as a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Blocked from adding chapter to Ecology on 'Conservation Managaement' ==

I'm sorry if I have done something for mistake, but I can't see how could I prevent you from writing such chapter. Have I deleted something or have you seen messages about IP block? Please let me know because I don't know how can I help you. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

: I unblocked this IP. Is everything ok now? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Applied Ecology ==

You don't need to transfer anything - just treat [[Applied Ecology]] as new book's table of contents. Name book subchapter like &lt;tt&gt;Applied Ecology/Introduction&lt;/tt&gt;, you will be able to link to them writing &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Introduction|Introduction]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. After you write the TOC, add book to a bookshelf and [[template:new]]. I don't think you need any special preparations if you read naming policy.

For your conveniece, you can use [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Navigation|navigational templates]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:57, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Blocks ==

Your network must be often used by Wikibooks vandals. Please take my apologies for all unconvenience, if you such situations will happen again (I hope not), please visit our IRC channel or send me an e-mail with blocked IP number and I will unblock it.

By the way, I made a small edit to TOC of your book to shorten it (it works the same as before). If you don't like my change, you can revert me. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

== Links ==

I guess your problem is that [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment]] has no link to &quot;Environmental Evaluation&quot;? Such situation appears when there &quot;parent&quot; page does not exist. If you look at your TOC you'll see that you have [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Valuation]] chapter, whereas [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment]] is looking for page named [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation]]. You just need to fix one letter in one of these two pages title (you probably are able to use &quot;move&quot; function now so it would be easy).

When it comes to links - well, I don't know if it is possible to hide two first parts of link, I haven't heard of such possibility. You have two solutions: either link like: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment|Environmental Impact Assessment]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment|Environmental Impact Assessment]] (note pipe &quot;|&quot; sing dividing &quot;address&quot; and &quot;link text&quot;) or change names of these two paragraphs to &quot;flat&quot;. You don't have to name a chapter &quot;Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment&quot;. You can just call it &quot;Applied Ecology/Environmental Impact Assessment&quot;. Both conventions are correct, you can use the one you find more convenient. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:00, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

By now we have seen that Cocoa supports a &quot;document based&quot; multiple window type of application, which we will be basing our drawing program, Wikidraw, on. A better understanding of this will help us work through our design implementation.

A document is not itself a window. A window is used to ''view'' the contents of the document, and in many straightforward applications, there is a one-to-one mapping from NSDocument, the class that manages the document, and NSWindow, the window class. However, this is not the only approach - an application could offer several alternative ways of looking at a document, and therefore support more than one window per document. This is one reason why two different objects are used.

In Wikidraw, we will subclass NSDocument so that we have a place to store our drawing data as we draw it, and a place to place the various actions that we will need, such as Cut and Paste, etc. The view in our window simply provides a means of displaying the current state of the document. Ideally, we'd like to minimise the interdependence between the two classes, so that the internal workings of the document are not exposed to the view, and vice versa, in accordance with the principle of encapsulation. Because the view provides not just the drawing of the objects, but also the interaction with the user, the view will need to have some knowledge of the objects, so that it can pass on mouse clicks and so forth to them.

==Delegation and protocols==

Cocoa makes much use of a common design pattern called delegation. This is where an object relies on another object to supplement some of the details about its state, etc. The helper object is known as the ''delegate'' of the first object. Unlike subclassing, the delegate can be any other suitable object, and the runtime binding of methods means that the original object only needs to have the vaguest knowledge about the delegate to get information from it.

In Wikidraw, we can make the document a helper of our view. That way, the view can ask its delegate for basic information such as the list of objects in the drawing, or the list of selected objects, without requiring too much knowledge about the document object itself. Both objects agree to conform to a ''protocol'' for exchanging information. This is merely an agreed convention for some of the method names. Because the protocol is just a casual agreement, it's called an ''informal protocol''. Objective-C supports a stricter type of protocol, called a ''formal protocol'', using the '@protocol' keyword, but we won't be using that here.

==Implementing MyDocument==

In setting up our document-based application, Xcode and Interface Builder have already provided a starting point for us, a class called 'MyDocument'. This is a subclass of NSDocument that we will use to manage each Wikidraw document. If you find this file in XCode (Wikidraw-&gt;Classes-&gt;MyDocument.h) and select it, you'll see that it's an empty subclass of NSDocument. Select the .m file to show the current implementation. It contains a number of skeletal methods to get you started, though enough has been included to make the basics actually work, such as showing the window.

Now we need to add some data members and methods to MyDocument.h so that it can start to handle the task of managing our drawing.

&lt;pre&gt;
@interface MyDocument : NSDocument
{
	NSMutableArray*	_objects;
	NSMutableArray*	_selection;
}

/* drawing maintenance */

- (void)		addObject:(id) object;
- (void)		removeObject:(id) object;
- (NSArray*)	objects;

/* selection maintenance */

- (void)		selectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		deselectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		selectAll;
- (void)		deselectAll;
- (NSArray*)	selection;

/* clicks */

- (id)			objectUnderMousePoint:(NSPoint) mp;

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

We'll add more later, but these are the basic methods we'll need. There are two data members, each a mutable array. One contains all the objects in the drawing, the other just the objects in the selection. When we create a new object, it is added to the _objects list using addObject:, if we delete an object, it is removed using removeObject: We can make these actions undoable easily by recording the state of the _objects array before each of these operations. We'll come to that later, but for now it's only important to understand that to make Undo work simply, defining a couple of obvious places where the data is changed is needed. We'll do the same in our actual objects where they are edited, for example by having their size or position changed.

The selection works similarly. Objects are added to the selection array or removed from it. When the view comes to draw the drawing, it checks both arrays. If an object is found in both, it &quot;knows&quot; that the object should be drawn in its selected state. The object itself handles its own drawing, so all that is needed is for the view to request that it is drawn with selection highlighting or not. This way, the view simply acts as a mediator between the document, which maintains WHICH objects are selected, and the actual objects, which know HOW to portray the selected state. The view itself is not interested in what is selected. We'll see that this approach is quite straightforward and elegant, though it is not the only possible one. (A common alternative is for the selected state to be a boolean flag within each stored object, but that isn't usually the best approach in an application like this. Many document-level commands apply to the set of selected objects, so to implement these with our scheme involves a simple iteration of the _selection array. Using the flag approach, we'd have to go through the entire list, checking which objects had the flag set, and ignoring the others. In general this can hamper performance once the drawing gets large).

The 'objectUnderMousePoint:' method is provided as a simple way for the view to determine what was clicked. The view itself will handle the basic mouse events, such as clicking and dragging, and this method allows it to determine which object the operation is dealing with. Once it has that information, the view is able to implement the clicks and drags by simply handing them off to the object itself, which knows what to do (resize, move, etc). The document doesn't need to know what the user is doing, it just needs to track what's in the drawing. You'll see that we are pushing as much of the 'smarts' into the drawing objects themselves as possible.

==Saving and restoring from files==

A key ability of a document is to convert its internal representation to and from a file representation of the same data. You'll see in MyDocument.m that two skeleton methods to do this have been provided:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSData*)   dataRepresentationOfType:(NSString*)  aType
- (BOOL)       loadDataRepresentation:(NSData*) data ofType:(NSString*) aType
&lt;/pre&gt;

These are overrides from NSDocument, so are not declared in our class definition. The first is responsible for saving to a file, the second reading in a file. The 'type' string is used when we have more than one type of file we can read and write to&amp;nbsp;— many real applications will support different formats. Here we won't, we'll just have our own. The string passed is actually the file extension of the file, so if you opened a JPEG file, the type would be the string &quot;jpg&quot;.

So what do we do to make the file representations, or read from a file? It's easy. Cocoa supports this using something called an archiver. Most objects can be archived, meaning that they already know how to read and write themselves to a file stream. Doing this requires no more than writing values to a dictionary using a key, which we already know how to do. Each object in the drawing is asked to archive itself, so it must record as much information as necessary to completely recreate that object later&amp;nbsp;— its position, size, colour, etc. Each value is given a unique key, usually just a string. When the file is read back in later, each object is reinstantiated and given the opportunity to re-establish its data values from the stream. Using the same keys, the values are read back in, thus restoring the object to the saved state.

At the document level, all we need to do is to archive the '_objects' array. When an array is archived, all of the objects it contains are also automatically archived. We'll find that at this level, there is almost nothing to do&amp;nbsp;— all the hard work is, once again, done by the drawing object itself. The selection state is not saved, so we don't need to care about that.

Since the entire _objects array will be recreated from the file, MyDocument needs a way to set the whole array in one go. The obvious method would be one called setObjects, so let's add that to our definition.

 - (void)		setObjects:(NSMutableArray*) arr;

For now, this is enough to get started on our document implementation. We need to expand the methods we've declared in the implementation file. One way is to cut and paste them from the header, then add curly braces to turn them into actual methods. Do that now.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
@implementation MyDocument

- (id)		init
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self)
	{
		_objects = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
		_selection = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    }
    return self;
}


- (void)	dealloc
{
	[_objects release];
	[_selection release];
	[super dealloc];
}

- (NSString *)	windowNibName
{
    return @&quot;MyDocument&quot;;
}

- (void)		windowControllerDidLoadNib:(NSWindowController *) aController
{
    [super windowControllerDidLoadNib:aController];
}

/*

    if ( outError != NULL ) {

	[marr release];
	return YES;
}


- (void)		addObject:(id) object
{
	if(![_objects containsObject:object])
		[_objects addObject:object];
}

- (void)		removeObject:(id) object
{
	[self deselectObject:object];
	[_objects removeObject:object];
}

- (NSArray*)	objects
{
	return _objects;
}

- (void)		setObjects:(NSMutableArray*) arr

	_objects = arr;
	[self deselectAll];

	[_selection removeAllObjects];

	return _selection;
}

- (id)			objectUnderMousePoint:(NSPoint) mp
{
	NSEnumerator*	iter = [_objects reverseObjectEnumerator];
	id				obj;
	
	while( obj = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ([obj containsPoint:mp])
			return obj;
	}
	
	return nil;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The implementation is pretty straightforward. In the init method, we allocate _objects and _selection. We need a dealloc method to make sure they get released when our document is deallocated.

addObject: and removeObject: simply map to the NSMutableArray methods, though we additionally check that we are not adding the same object more than once. When an object is removed, it is also deselected, to make sure that we don't leave a stale reference in the selection list to an object that has gone altogether. objects simply returns the array itself as a read-only type (this gets around Objective-C's lack of a 'const' operator.) setObjects: replaces the entire array, which we'll use in a moment when we read a file.

The selection methods work similarly. selectObject: merely adds the object to the selection list, first checking that it isn't already selected and is indeed part of the drawing. deselectObject: removes it from the selection list. selectAll makes the selection list match the entire drawing using setArray:, and deselectAll simply makes the list empty.

The objectUnderMousePoint: method gives us a chance to use an iterator. We iterate over the objects array, calling containsPoint: on each object. As soon as one of them return YES, the method returns that object. It is up to the object itself to implement containsPoint: in a sensible manner. Why do we iterate here in reverse? It's because in the drawing, objects can be placed such that they overlap. To the user, this will appear as if some objects are behind others. The view will draw the list of objects in forward order, meaning that objects at the end of the list will get drawn 'on top of' any earlier ones. By detecting clicks in reverse, we make sure that we find the topmost objects before any underlying ones, if the click occurs on an overlapping area. It means that the user gets the expected behaviour—they can click on what they can see. If nothing gets clicked, nil is returned.

The methods that implement archiving and dearchiving a file are straightforward. Most of the magic is hidden from us at this level. We use NSKeyedArchiver's factory method 'archivedDataWithRootObject:' to pass it our objects array. It does its magic and returns us an NSData object, which we return. That's all we need to do, Cocoa handles the rest, writing the data to the file. When we go the other way, we use NSKeyedUnarchiver's 'unarchiveObjectWithData:' factory method to reverse the process. What we get back is an autoreleased NSArray object (because we saved an NSArray object earlier). You may ask how the archiver and unarchiver know how to encode or decode WKDShape objects. The answer is simple: they don't. As usual in object oriented programming, the WKDShape object is responsible for encoding and decoding itself. The (un)archiver will try to call corresponding methods of WKDShape which are not yet implemented. This is done in the chapter [[Programming_Mac_OS_X_with_Cocoa_for_beginners/Archiving|Archiving]]. At this point you may save a document and open a saved document, but it will be blank and not contain any shapes.

However we need the array obtained from the unarchiver to be mutable, so we use mutableCopy: to make a mutable copy. This is passed to the setObjects: method replacing any objects we already have. Because we made an explicit copy, we must release the object here. setObjects: retains it anyway, so it still sticks around, but we don't want to let it remain retained twice, otherwise we'll have a potential memory leak. setObjects: also deselects everything, since we are starting with a new freshly opened document—this just makes sure that no stray objects are left selected. This could happen after a revert, for example.

==File types==

How does Cocoa know what type of file we are saving or reading? It doesn't yet - if we Build and Go now, choosing Open gives us the file picker but we won't be able to pick any files. To set this, in the left hand panel of Xcode, Drill down from Targets to Wikidraw. Select Wikidraw and choose Get Info. In the dialog that opens, select the 'properties' tab. In the 'Document types' area, edit the first and only item so that Name is 'Wikidraw drawing', Extensions is set to 'wkd', OSTypes is set to '.wkd' and class is MyDocument. This sets up a mapping between files of type'.wkd', which will be our drawing file type, and the MyDocument class, which knows how to handle that file type. (Please note: dataRepresentationOfType: is Deprecated in Mac OS X v10.4. Use dataOfType:error: instead. for save to work)

While we are here, lets also change a few other settings. Change 'Identifier' to 'com.wiki.wikidraw', and Creator to 'WIKD'.

Close the Get Info window, and Build and Go again. We still have no files available in the open dialog, because there are no files with an extension .wkd yet. So let's save one. Do a Save As and save the file as 'wikidrawtest' or something similar. The open window should change to the name you choose. Now when you try an Open, you should be able to select and open this file. If you locate the file in the Finder, do a Get Info, you should be able to check that it does indeed have an extension of '.wkd'. Note that the file will not contain anything yet, since we don't have enough of the application built to actually create any drawings.

We'll tackle that next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Document-based_applications|Previous Page: Document-based applications]] | [[../Wikidraw%27s_view_class|Next Page: Wikidraw's view class]]

So far we have managed to get a very long way with hardly any code. However, our application still doesn't do much, and doesn't look too much like a real drawing program. So now we'll write the code at the heart of the application, which implements the actual shapes we can draw. We have deferred a lot of functionality by design to this class, so this will be a moderately complex object. However, once we are done, we'll have something very close to a drawing program!

Up until now we have used Interface Builder to create skeletal code files for us. This time, we'll have to do it manually. In XCode, find the file 'WKDDrawView.m' and select it. Then choose File-&gt;New File... In the assistant, locate and select 'Objective-C class', then click Next. Change the filename to 'WKDShape.m', then click Finish. A new .h and .m file are added to the 'Classes' list. You'll see that WKDShape is a subclass of NSObject, which is ideal.

==Design of the shape class==

Each shape will be an instance of the WKDShape class, but each type of shape will be a subclass, for example WKDRectShape and WKDOvalShape. In the Shape class itself, we need to put as much functionality that is common to all shapes as possible. In fact we'll see that this is almost all of it.

What properties does each shape need? There are graphical properties such as the colours to fill and stroke the shape, and whether the shape has a stroke or fill, and what thickness the stroke should be. There are geometrical properties such as the location and size of the shape, and if we were implementing rotation, a rotation angle (for simplicity we won't be doing this, but you might like to consider how it could be added as a further exercise). What we don't need to include is state information such as whether the object is selected - it doesn't need to know and it's already taken care of by the document/view combination.

Cocoa embodies colours in the NSColor object, so we can specify our stroke and fill colours using these. We can use the absence of either (a value of nil) to mean not to perform a stroke or a fill, allowing us to have hollow as well as solid shapes. The stroke thickness is a simple floating point value. The position of the object can be specified using an NSPoint, and the size using an NSSize. We'll decide that the location of the object refers to the top, left corner of its bounding box. An NSRect contains both an NSPoint specifying the origin of the rect, and an NSSize for its width and height, which is exactly what we need. A shape is drawn so that it fits this bounding box rectangle.

So let's add these data members:

&lt;pre&gt;
@interface WKDShape : NSObject
{
	NSRect		_bounds;
	NSColor*	_strokeColour;
	NSColor*	_fillColour;
	float		_strokeWidth;
}

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

These immediately suggest the first set of methods we'll need, which simply set and get these properties. We also, for convenience, define some methods for setting the location and size independently. We also know from developing our document class that we need a 'containsPoint' method, returning a BOOL value:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)          bounds;
- (void)            setBounds:(NSRect) bounds;
- (void)            setLocation:(NSPoint) loc;
- (void)            offsetLocationByX:(float) x byY:(float) y;
- (void)            setSize:(NSSize) size;
- (BOOL)            containsPoint:(NSPoint) pt;

- (NSColor*)        fillColour;
- (void)            setFillColour:(NSColor*) colour;
- (NSColor*)        strokeColour;
- (void)            setStrokeColour:(NSColor*) colour;
- (float)           strokeWidth;
- (void)            setStrokeWidth:(float) width;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's think about what we need the shape object to do. The most obvious thing is to draw itself, so we'll need a 'draw' method. This will be called by the view for each object in turn. In addition, the view will inform us whether we are selected or not, so we need a way to pass this information in so we can draw accordingly.

The next thing is user interaction with the object. The view will pass us clicks and drags, allowing the user to resize or reposition an object directly. We can figure out ourselves which operation is intended from where the mouse point was initially clicked. A view handles mouse operations by implementing three methods for mouse down, mouse dragged and mouse up. We can follow the same model here, making it very easy for the view to pass these things on to us. We'll need to track what operation we are performing (resize or reposition) so that when we receive a drag message, we continue doing the right thing! We'll track this state in a simple integer data member.

When an object is selected, it is drawn with &quot;selection handles&quot; around its edges. If we drag a handle, we want the size of the shape to be altered. If we drag the object itself, it should remain the same size but move to a new position. When a handle is dragged, the opposite handle becomes an 'anchor point' for the resize, so we need a way to distinguish between handles to work out which anchor to use. We'll use the integer data member we already have for this - its value will be set to the number of the handle we originally clicked. We'll also need to record the original mouse click position so we can work out how far things have been moved. We'll provide a separate method for drawing the handles as sensible factoring of code, as well as a number of utility methods for drawing and hit testing each handle.

Finally we need to allow subclasses to actually provide the detail of the shape being drawn. We could rely on subclasses reimplementing draw as needed, but a better approach which keeps subclasses smaller and simpler is to ask for the shape's path as an NSBezierPath object, then implement everything else in the common shape object. All the subclass needs to do is to use the current value of bounds to return an appropriate path whenever asked.

So let's add these methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)            drawWithSelection:(BOOL) selected;
- (void)            drawHandles;
- (void)            drawAHandle:(int) whichOne;
- (int)             handleAtPoint:(NSPoint) pt;
- (NSRect)          handleRect:(int) whichOne;
- (NSRect)          newBoundsFromBounds:(NSRect) old forHandle:(int) whichOne withDelta:(NSPoint) p;

- (void)            mouseDown:(NSPoint) pt;
- (void)            mouseDragged:(NSPoint) pt;
- (void)            mouseUp:(NSPoint) pt;

- (NSBezierPath*)   path;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We also add an int data member, _dragState, and an NSPoint data member, _anchor.

When we begin to draw a shape, it will be created and added to the drawing at the point where we clicked. It will then be in exactly the same state as if an existing object were being resized, so there is no difference between creation and later editing - we just arrange things so that new objects get created under the mouse. The view will deal with this.

==Shape implementation==

Now we can implement the methods for WKDShape. We'll supply a default path method so that using an unsubclassed shape object works - in fact, we can make the generic shape object handle the simple rectangle case.

Cut and Paste the method prototypes into the WKDShape.m file. Here's a quick trick for expanding them, which will work at this stage since there is no code written yet. Expand one method by replacing the trailing semicolon with a pair of curly braces and an extra line. Select and copy just the braces and the extra line. Open the Find/Replace dialog and do a Replace All on a semicolon with the lines you copied (paste the lines into the Replace field). This replaces all semicolons with the empty method bodies and an extra line, thus expanding all the method prototypes to full methods.

Here is the implementation for the property methods and initialisation:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (id)			init
{
	if ((self = [super init]) != nil )
	{
		[self setFillColour:[NSColor whiteColor]];
		[self setStrokeColour:[NSColor blackColor]];
		[self setStrokeWidth:1.0];
		_bounds = NSZeroRect;
		_dragState = 0;
		_anchor = NSZeroPoint;
	}
	return self;
}


- (void)		dealloc
{
	[_fillColour release];
	[_strokeColour release];
	[super dealloc];
}


- (NSRect)		bounds
{
	return _bounds;
}


- (void)		setBounds:(NSRect) bounds
{
	_bounds = bounds;
}


- (void)		setLocation:(NSPoint) loc
{
	_bounds.origin = loc;
}


- (void)		offsetLocationByX:(float) x byY:(float) y
{
	_bounds.origin.x += x;
	_bounds.origin.y += y;
}


- (void)		setSize:(NSSize) size
{
	_bounds.size = size;
}


- (BOOL)		containsPoint:(NSPoint) pt
{
	return NSPointInRect( pt, [self drawBounds]);
}



- (NSColor*)	fillColour
{
	return _fillColour;
}


- (void)		setFillColour:(NSColor*) colour
{
	[colour retain];
	[_fillColour release];
	_fillColour = colour;
}


- (NSColor*)	strokeColour
{
	return _strokeColour;
}


- (void)		setStrokeColour:(NSColor*) colour
{
	[colour retain];
	[_strokeColour release];
	_strokeColour = colour;
}


- (float)		strokeWidth
{
	return _strokeWidth;
}


- (void)		setStrokeWidth:(float) width
{
	_strokeWidth = width;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

These should be straightforward. In our init method, we call our own set...Colour methods to set the default colours to a white fill and a black border, as well as setting a stroke width of 1.0 and setting the other data members to zero. NSZeroPoint, NSZeroSize and NSZeroRect are all handy constants in Cocoa representing those structures with all-zero members. Note that our set...Colour methods retain before release. We retain these objects because we are creating new references to them within the data members of our shape object.

The drawWithSelection: method comes next:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		drawWithSelection:(BOOL) selected
{
	NSBezierPath* path = [self path];
	
	if ([self fillColour])
	{
		[[self fillColour] setFill];
		[path fill];
	}
	
	if ([self strokeColour])
	{
		[[self strokeColour] setStroke];
		[path setLineWidth:[self strokeWidth]];
		[path stroke];
	}
	
	if ( selected )
		[self drawHandles];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

First we call our own path method to get the path of the shape. Subclasses of WKDShape will be overriding this to provide us with other shapes, but the default one will give us a basic rectangle. Having got the path, we can stroke and fill it if we have colours for them - the absence of a colour means don't perform the operation. Finally, we use the selection flag we are passed to determine if we should draw the selection handles or not. Let's look at how the handles are drawn.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		drawHandles
{
	int h;
	
	for( h = 1; h &lt; 9; h++ )
		[self drawAHandle:h];
}


- (void)		drawAHandle:(int) whichOne
{
	NSRect  hr = [self handleRect:whichOne];
	[[NSColor redColor] set];
	NSRectFill( hr );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The method drawHandles iterates a short loop, calling drawAHandle for each one. We identify each handle using the numbers 1 to 8, with 1 meaning the top, left handle, number 2 the top centre handle, and so on round the edges of the shape in a clockwise direction. The numbering is arbitrary, but we need to be consistent. We did not use zero as a handle ID, because we use 0 elsewhere to mean 'drag the whole object' rather than drag a particular handle. This scheme is very simple, though other numbering schemes like it could be devised that could make the later handle code a little bit more compact. However, for this exercise this is entirely adequate and will function just fine.

The drawAHandle method calls handleRect: to obtain a rectangle representing the handle, then simply blocks it in using a bright red colour.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)		handleRect:(int) whichOne
{
	NSPoint	p;
	NSRect	b = [self bounds];
	
	switch( whichOne )
	{
		case 1:
			p.x = NSMinX( b );
			p.y = NSMinY( b );
			break;
	
		case 2:
			p.x = NSMidX( b );
			p.y = NSMinY( b );
			break;
	
		case 3:
			p.x = NSMaxX( b );
			p.y = NSMinY( b );
			break;
	
		case 4:
			p.x = NSMaxX( b );
			p.y = NSMidY( b );
			break;
	
		case 5:
			p.x = NSMaxX( b );
			p.y = NSMaxY( b );
			break;
	
		case 6:
			p.x = NSMidX( b );
			p.y = NSMaxY( b );
			break;
	
		case 7:
			p.x = NSMinX( b );
			p.y = NSMaxY( b );
			break;
	
		case 8:
			p.x = NSMinX( b );
			p.y = NSMidY( b );
			break;
	}
	
	b.origin = p;
	b.size = NSZeroSize;
	return NSInsetRect( b, -kHandleSize, -kHandleSize );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

HandleRect: consists of a big switch statement which sets up the position of the handle based on the current bounds of the shape. This is simple to understand but a bit dumb - we could have used bitfields to combine handles that share a side into a more compact function, but one that would be much harder to understand at a glance. This way is much easier. We use Cocoa's utility functions NSMinX, NSMinY, MSMidX, NSMaxY, etc to obtain particular corners of the bounding rect which is where we will locate the handles. Finally, we expand these points into a small rectangle and return it.

Now let's look at how we handle interaction with the mouse. The first thing that happens when the mouse is clicked is that the view determines which, if any, shape was hit, and passes the click down to its mouseDown method:

 &lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		mouseDown:(NSPoint) pt
{
	_dragState = [self handleAtPoint:pt];
	_anchor = pt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we do is call handleAtPoint: to see if any of the handles were hit. If a handle was hit, its number is returned and stored in _dragState. If no handle was hit, 0 is returned. This means 'drag the whole object'. We can be sure that we were hit at all because this method wouldn't even be called if we hadn't been. We also record the initial mouse click point in _anchor. At this stage, we only determine what a subsequent drag is going to do - we don't need to actually do any more. Let's look at how handleAtPoint: works.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (int)			handleAtPoint:(NSPoint) pt
{
	int		h;
	NSRect	hr;
	
	if ([self bounds].size.width == 0 &amp;&amp; [self bounds].size.height == 0 )
		return 5;
	else
	{
		for ( h = 1; h &lt; 9; h++ )
		{
			hr = [self handleRect:h];
			
			if (NSPointInRect( pt, hr ))
				return h;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's quite straightforward. We loop through the handles, obtaining the rect of each one, using handleRect: that we used before for drawing. If the rect contains the point, we return the handle's index number immediately. Otherwise, if we can't find any handles that the mouse has hit, we return 0. So what's this other bit, that checks the size? This is a little bit of a hack which simplifies code elsewhere. When an object is initially created, it has zero size and is placed under the mouse. From then on, the creation of the object proceeds just the same as for editing an existing one. However, at the moment of creation, we need to trick the system into thinking that we are dragging the bottom right corner of the shape, so that the user gets the expected behaviour. The index number for the bottom right corner's handle is 5, so if we have zero size, we immediately return 5 as if it were this handle that had been clicked.

After the view calls our mouseDown method, it will continually call our mouseDragged method until the user lets go of the button, at which point it will call our mouseUp method.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		mouseDragged:(NSPoint) pt
{
	NSPoint np;
	
	np.x = pt.x - _anchor.x;
	np.y = pt.y - _anchor.y;
	_anchor = pt;
	
	if ( _dragState == 0 )
	{
		// dragging the object
		[self offsetLocationByX:np.x byY:np.y];
	}
	else if ( _dragState &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; _dragState &lt; 9 )
	{
		// dragging a handle
		
		NSRect nb = [self newBoundsFromBounds:[self bounds] forHandle:_dragState withDelta:np];
		[self setBounds:nb];
	}
}


- (void)		mouseUp:(NSPoint) pt
{
	_dragState = 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

mouseDragged: first calculates how far the mouse has moved since last time. _anchor is used to store the previous mouse position, as all we need to do is to subtract the co-ordinates of the new point from it, then update _anchor to the new point ready for next time.

Next we look at _dragState. If it's zero, we are dragging the whole object, so we can simply offset our position bodily using offsetLocationByX:byY: using our calculated delta. Otherwise if _dragState is one of the handle index values, we know we are dragging a handle, and which one it is. We defer to another method, newBoundsFromBounds:forHandle:withDelta: to calculate what our new bounding rectangle will be given the old bounds, the handle index number being dragged, and the delta offset of the handle. It returns the recalculated bounds, so we can simply call setBounds to make it take effect.

mouseUp: doesn't need to do much here - it just sets _dragState to 0. This isn't absolutely necessary, but we do it just in case someone else is using this information - since we've finished dragging, we forget about what handle, if any, we dragged.

The code for newBoundsFromBounds:forHandle:withDelta: does most of the hard work in determining how a handle drag affects the bounds. Here it is:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)		newBoundsFromBounds:(NSRect) old forHandle:(int) whichOne withDelta:(NSPoint) p
{
	// figure out the desired bounds from the old one, the handle being dragged and the new point.
	
	NSRect nb = old;
	
	switch( whichOne )
	{
		case 4:
			nb.size.width += p.x;
			break;
			
		case 6:
			nb.size.height += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 2:
			nb.size.height -= p.y;
			nb.origin.y += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 8:
			nb.size.width -= p.x;
			nb.origin.x += p.x;
			break;
			
		case 1:
			nb.size.width -= p.x;
			nb.origin.x += p.x;
			nb.size.height -= p.y;
			nb.origin.y += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 3:
			nb.size.height -= p.y;
			nb.origin.y += p.y;
			nb.size.width += p.x;
			break;
			
		case 5:
			nb.size.width += p.x;
			nb.size.height += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 7:
			nb.size.width -= p.x;
			nb.origin.x += p.x;
			nb.size.height += p.y;
			break;
	}

	return nb;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Similar to handleRect:, it uses a switch statement to figure out which edges of the rectangle get moved according to the handle index. It's straightforward - if a right or bottom edge moves, the delta can simply be added to the width or height. If a left or top edge moves, we need to adjust both the width or height and the origin position of the rectangle.

That's pretty much it. When we look at how our view works, we will find we need to add one or two additional minor methods here to help things along, but we'll worry about that later. The final thing to look at here is the implementation of path. You'll recall that this is what subclasses are intended to override to supply the particular shapes that we will be drawing. The default version looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSBezierPath*)	path
{
	return [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:[self bounds]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All it does is use NSBezierPath's factory method for making a path from a rectangle, in this case our bounds. The path returned is already autoreleased, so we can just use it and forget it, which is what our drawWithSelection: method does. Other shape objects can return any path that they want, provided they honour the one rule that we define here - that ''bounds'' fully encloses the shape.

We have our basic shape class in place, and a document structure to store them. The final main piece of the jigsaw is the view, which pulls everything together to allow the user to create drawings interactively. Let's consider its design.

==Design of the view class==

A generic NSView provides two main pieces of functionality - the ability to draw graphics in a window, which we have looked at already, and the ability to handle the user's mousing, which is something new. We've already discussed that this comes in three parts - a mouse down event, a series of mouse dragged events, and a mouse up event. Our shape class is all ready to handle these when they are passed along from our view.

The view will need to do more than just pass along these events however, since it will need to deal with other aspects of user interaction, such as the fact there will be many different shapes in the drawing, and the need to manage the selection of them as the user clicks.

In addition, the creation of shapes will depend on which tool is currently selected in the tool palette (which we haven't designed yet). Since shape creation is also accomplished by using the mouse and drawing in the view, it is the view that will need to provide a means of distinguishing between the various tools.

When it comes to drawing, the view needs to render the entire drawing, and also determine if an object is selected. While the shape itself handles the actual rendering of itself, the view must make sure that every object's drawWithSelection: method is called, and pass along the selection state.

Where does the view obtain the information from the document? We'll set things up so that the view is able to call upon the document as a delegate. We established the informal protocol for getting the objects and the selection using the document's objects and selection methods. Provided we set up a valid delegate, the view can call it using this informal protocol, and get the information it needs. NSView doesn't have a delegate by default, so we need to add that ourselves. Add a _delegate data member to the WKDDrawView class, with type 'id'. Then add methods for setting and getting this - setDelegate, and delegate. Note that the view doesn't need to retain its delegate in this case - it is an exception to the usual rule about creating new references to object. In this case it's OK because we know that the document and the view will always be created and destroyed together.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	setDelegate:(id) aDelegate
{
	_delegate = aDelegate;
}


- (id)		delegate
{
	return _delegate;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we need to make sure the delegate gets set to the document when the view is created. To do this, we'll create a link in Interface Builder so that the document can find the view, then call its setDelegate method, passing itself. This seems a bit roundabout, but it prevents too much interdependency between the view and the document.

In MyDocument.h, add a data member as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
	IBOutlet id	     _mainView;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then Save the file. What we've done here is create a reference to an object called _mainView. We've also flagged it as an IBOutlet. Earlier we saw how a return type of IBAction can be used to provide information to Interface Builder. This is similar. It tells IB that this particular data member can be an ''outlet'', that is, one end of a connection to another object, which can be accessed using the control-drag connection method. In Xcode, IBOutlet is defined as nothing, so it doesn't affect the code in any way.

Drag MyDocument.h to the MyDocument.nib window open in Interface Builder. It will reparse the file, and pick up the new outlet. Now we need to connect this outlet to the window's view (WKDDrawView).

You might be wondering how we can do this, since the MyDocument class doesn't seem to be respresented in Interface Builder. Indeed this class is created by Cocoa when we open a file or choose New, so how do we solve this one? This is where the mysterious &quot;file's owner&quot; icon comes in. The object that owns 'MyDocument.nib' is in fact, the MyDocument class. So file's owner represents it. Having dragged in MyDocument.h you'll notice a small exclamation mark on the File's Owner icon. This means that there are unconnected outlets in that object, which is true, since we just added the outlet _mainView, but haven't connected it yet.

Control-drag from File's owner to the view within the window. Make sure it is WKDDrawView that is highlighted, not the enclosing scroller. When you let go, the Inspector shows the Connections, and switches to Outlets. Select '_mainView' and click connect. Save the file and return to Xcode.

Now when MyDocument is instantiated, the data member _mainView will be automatically set up pointing to the WKDDrawView in the window. So all we now need to do is to use this reference to set the view's delegate. When MyDocument is instantiated, one of the last methods called as part of the initialisation is 'windowControllerDidLoadNib:'. At this point all conections declared in the .nib file, like the one we just made, are guaranteed to be in place, so we can simply add our code here:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		windowControllerDidLoadNib:(NSWindowController *) aController
{
    [super windowControllerDidLoadNib:aController];
	[_mainView setDelegate:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

From now on, whenever the view needs anything from the document, it calls its delegate method to obtain the document, and the informal protocol to obtain what it wants. The view doesn't otherwise know anything about the document, and vice versa - overcoupling has been avoided. Note that the view could be used in another application that used an entirely different object but implementing the same informal protocol to get its work done. This is one way that you can design classes for reuse among a variety of projects.

==Rendering the document contents==

The first job our view has to do is to render the contents of the document. Here's the code:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	drawRect:(NSRect) rect
{
	[[NSColor whiteColor] set];
	NSRectFill( rect );
	
	NSArray*		drawList = [[self delegate] objects];
	NSArray*		selection = [[self delegate] selection];
	NSEnumerator*	iter = [drawList objectEnumerator];
	WKDShape*		shape;
	
	while( shape = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( rect, [shape drawBounds]))
			[shape drawWithSelection:[selection containsObject:shape]];
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

As before, we start by erasing the part of the background that is to be redrawn. Next we ask our delegate for the objects and the selection using the informal protocol we designed earlier. Then it's simply a case of iterating over the objects and drawing each one. For efficiency, we also check whether the refresh rect intersects the bounds of the object, and if not we don't bother - this just avoids drawing anything that isn't visible or affected by the refresh, speeding up drawing. The selection state is determined simply by seeing if the object is in the selection array.

Sharp-eyed readers will notice that a method called drawBounds is being called on the shape object. We have not so far discussed this, but we need to. If we were to use the shape's bounds, we'd find that small parts of the things it draws will not always get erased when they need to, because some things are actually drawn outside of the area defined by bounds. The selection handles for example, are centred ON the bounds, so at least half of the handle is outside the bounds. Likewise, when we stroke the shape, the bounds defines the ''centre'' of the stroked lines. We need to take these into account so that we can correctly refresh the entire area that is drawn. the method drawBounds returns a rectangle that is based on bounds, but slightly expanded from it:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)		drawBounds
{
	return NSInsetRect([self bounds], -kHandleSize - [self strokeWidth], -kHandleSize - [self strokeWidth]);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This takes into account both the size of the handles and the stroke width so that everything is guaranteed to fall within this area. Any drawing that simply repaints or refreshes an object will use drawBounds rather than bounds, but it must be remembered that bounds is the strictly mathematical boundary of the shape.

==Handling the mouse==

That's all there is to drawing. The case of handling the mouse is more involved. Let's look at that now.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=objc&gt;
- (void)	mouseDown:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	_dragShape = [[self delegate] objectUnderMousePoint:pt];
	
	if (_dragShape == nil)
	{
		_dragShape = [self shapeForCurrentTool];
		[[self delegate] addObject:_dragShape];
		[_dragShape setLocation:pt];
	}
	
	if (([evt modifierFlags] &amp; NSShiftKeyMask) == 0)
	{
		[[self delegate] deselectAll];
		[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	else
	{
		if ([[[self delegate] selection] containsObject:_dragShape])
		{
			[[self delegate] deselectObject:_dragShape];
			_dragShape = nil;
		}
		else
			[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
	[_dragShape mouseDown:pt];
}


- (void)	mouseDragged:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	NSRect update = [_dragShape drawBounds];
	
	[_dragShape mouseDragged:pt];
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:NSUnionRect([_dragShape drawBounds], update)];
}


- (void)	mouseUp:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	[_dragShape mouseUp:pt];
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:[_dragShape drawBounds]];
	_dragShape = nil;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Three methods are involved&amp;nbsp;— mouseDown, mouseDragged and mouseUp. Each is passed an NSEvent object, representing the mouse event that triggered the call. The first thing we need to do is to adjust the mouse coordinates from the window to our local view. NSEvent always stores mouse coordinates relative to the window, and this information is extracted using the locationInWindow method. NSView's convertPoint:fromView: will translate the coordinates, and a fromView: of nil means from the window itself.

In mouseDown:, once we are in local coordinates, we can query the document (the delegate) for the object under the mouse, using the method we wrote earlier. This either returns the topmost object hit, or nil meaning nothing was hit. We store the result in a data member called _dragShape. This keeps track of which shape we hit when later the mouseDragged and mouseUp methods are called.

If we hit empty space, we will (for now) use this to mean create a new object according to the current tool. Later we'll refine this so that we implement the ability to select objects by dragging a marquee (selection box) over them. So let's see what happens when we create a new shape object. First we call another method, shapeForCurrentTool, to make us the appropriate shape. This is a factory method so the returned object will be autoreleased. We immediately add the new object to the document, and set its location to be where our mouse point is. If we had hit an existing object, this step of creating the object and adding it to the document is skipped.

Next we test whether the shift key is down. If it is, we want to shift-select the item, which involves ''not'' deselecting everything first. Then we select the object we hit. Again, we use the shift key to add another refinement&amp;nbsp;— if shift is down, we toggle the selection state of an object, otherwise we simply select it and deselect everything else. Finally, we pass the click on to the object's own mouseDown method, which we've already looked at. Because we have changed the selection state of possibly any number of objects which could be anywhere in the drawing, we flag the need to refresh the entire thing to make sure that all these changes have an immediate effect on screen. Note that this approach is simple, but not necessarily optimum. Once the drawing gets complex, refreshing the entire thing every time can become very expensive and slow. Instead it can pay to track which objects are actually changed, and only refresh those areas. However for this simple tutorial, we won't attempt to complicate things by doing that.

mouseDragged: converts the coordinates as before, and passes the drag down to the current object as indicated by _dragShape, which we set up in mouseDown: Because a drag can move and resize an object, we need to refresh the area affected by both the new position of the object, and its old position. Thus we record the state of its bounds before and after the drag, combine them together and refresh that area. If we didn't do this, we'd find that objects would leave ugly trails behind them as they were dragged.

mouseDragged: doesn't currently attempt to deal with the situation where more than one object can be dragged. In most apps of this type, if there are two objects selected and one is dragged, both are dragged together. As an exercise, you might want to think about how mouseDragged: can be modified to achieve this.

Finally, mouseUp: cleans up by passing the call to the dragged object, refreshing the screen at that place, and then setting _dragShape to nil.

==Handling the tools==

As we saw, the shape to be added to the drawing is dependent on shapeForCurrentTool. This simply needs to look at which tool we have selected, and create the right sort of object. However, we don't yet have an interface for selecting a tool, so let's make one so that we can implement this. Since the tool palette is common to all documents in the application, we'll add it to MainMenu.nib.

One of the key design paradigms of Cocoa is its adherence to the model-view-controller (MVC) approach to object-oriented design. So far we haven't really encountered this directly, but we will have to say something about it now. MVC is a good method of separating functionality between the ''model'', which manages the actual meaningful data your application handles, and the ''view'', which is the visual representation onscreen of that data, and the controls that manipulate it. Sitting between them is the ''controller'' which does the job of mapping the view to the data and vice versa. So far we have used MyDocument as a combined model and controller, but with the tool palette, we'll be using a more strictly delineated MVC approach.

The tool palette itself will be the view. We'll need a controller to handle the selection of the tool button in the palette, and pass this along in the form of the selected tool. The model will be just a single variable, storing the current tool choice.

The view can be entirely created in Interface Builder. The controller can be partially set up in Interface Builder, supplemented by a little code we'll need to write. First let's look at our &quot;model&quot;. Because our WKDDrawView is going to take on the task of creating objects in response to the chosen tool, the obvious approach would be for the view to simply ask the tool controller what the current tool is whenever it needs to know. However, there is a snag. There is no easy way for the view (which is only one among many possible, given that we can have many documents open) to locate the tool controller without having an explicit reference to it. One solution would be a global variable which referred to the tool controller, and that is a viable approach. However, globals are discouraged in an object-oriented application, and besides, simply setting up this global would complicate things in a way that we'd rather avoid in this tutorial. Instead, we can declare a static variable in our view class which will store the ID of the chosen tool. Being a static variable, it can be accessed by any view (static variables are like globals that are only visible to code in the same file that they are declared in). This variable thus contains a COPY of the tool ID that the tool controller has. Normally we'd avoid this because copies of the same data need careful management to ensure they don't get out of step, but in this case it's fairly simple.

So how do we synchronise the tool ID when the user clicks the palette button? The answer is using a notification. A notification is Cocoa's way of passing information around without having explicit object references. The controller will post a notification every time the tool changes. Anyone interested in this can subscribe to the message and respond in a suitable way. In this case each view will subscribe to the message, but set the static variable in response. There is some overkill here - if there are two views, each will receive the message and the variable will get set twice to the same value. In this case we can tolerate this because it's only a single simple integer we are talking about.

What about when a new view is created, but the tool is set to some odd value? The view will still know about the tool, because it is a static variable, shared among all instances of the view. Thus we don't have to worry about the case of a new view never receiving a notification before it can use the correct tool, as we would if the variable was local to each view.

OK, let's make it happen.

Open 'MainMenu.nib' in IB. Select the Windows panel in the widgets palette (fourth button from the left) and drag a PANEL into the main window. Double-click the new icon to open the panel. In the Inspector, delete the window's title. Use the Size panel to set min w. to 60, and min h. to 100. Resize the panel to be narrow and tall, and position it at top left of the screen. Use the Attributes inspector to check 'Utility Window (panel only)' and 'Non activating panel (panel only)'. Make sure the 'Minimize' and 'Zoom' boxes are unchecked.

Switch to the Controls palette and drag a large square button to the window. Press the option key and drag the selection handle at the bottom downwards until you have four vertically organised buttons. Option-dragging a button creates what is known as a MATRIX of buttons, rather than a single button. With the matrix selected, use the attributes inspector to set the behaviour to 'Radio'.

In new versions of the interface builder you create the list of buttons option-dragging the buttons. Then select all of the buttons and use Layout-&gt;Embed Objects in-&gt;Matrix. This will create a Matrix encompassing all the buttons.

Double-click each button in turn and set the behaviour of each one to On/Off. Notice as you go through that the 'tag' field gives a different value for each button. This tag value is what will become our tool ID. Once done, we'll have a crude but functional tool palette interface. You can test its operation in IB by choosing File-&gt;Test Interface. Verify that the tool palette operates as a set of radio buttons with only one selected at a time, and that you can tell from the highlighting which one it is. To return to IB, choose 'Quit'.

Now we need a controller for the tool palette. IB again helps us by actually making this object for us, and creating skeletal .h and .m files that we can add code to later.

In the 'Classes' tab of the main window, locate the NSWindowController class (it is a subclass of NSResponder). Highlight NSWindowController and choose Classes-&gt;Subclass NSWindowController. A new name is added; name it ToolsController. Now we can ask IB to actually create this object, giving us an actual instance we can hook up to the view. To do this, highlight the new class, and choose Classes-&gt;Instantiate ToolsController. A new object is added to the main window, which looks like a box and has the name ToolsController. Go back to the 'Classes' view (a quick way is to double-click the new object). In the Inspector, use the Actions panel to add a new action: click Add, then type the action name selectionDidChange: (remember the colon!). This makes two actions, there should already be a showWindow: action.

Go back to Instances. control-drag FROM the ToolsController object TO the tools window (you can drag to the title bar of the actual window, or just to the icon in the main window). Connect this to the 'window' outlet. Next, control-drag FROM the NSMatrix (the four buttons - make sure you have the four buttons selected as a set not just one of them - the easiest way is to start the drag from a blank area just off the edge of one of the buttons) TO the ToolsController. Connect that to the action you just added, 'selectionDidChange:'.

Finally, we need a way to show the palette when we need it. Drag a new menu item to the Windows menu, placing it below Zoom item. Name it 'Show Tools'. control-drag FROM the menu item to the ToolsController. Connect it to the action 'showWindow:'

Save the file. With ToolsController selected, choose Classes-&gt;Create Files for ToolsController. Add the .h and .m files to Wikidraw. We're done in IB, so return to Xcode.

==Coding the controller==

Add an int data member to our ToolsController class, called _curTool. Add a method to return it, called currentTool. Your class definition should look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
@interface ToolsController : NSWindowController
{
	int		_curTool;
}

- (IBAction)	selectionDidChange:(id) sender;
- (int)			currentTool;

@end


extern NSString* notifyToolSelectionDidChange;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We also declare an extern string variable that will contain the name for our notification.

Now switch to the implementation. We don't have an 'init' method here, since the one we inherit from NSWindowController is fine, but we do need to do a little bit of set up after we've been created from the .nib file. We can do this by implementing an 'awakeFromNib' method. It's just a method (with no parameters) called when we are brought to life from the .nib file. Here's what we need:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	awakeFromNib
{
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setFloatingPanel:YES];
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setBecomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded:YES];
	_curTool = 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We need to tell our window to be a floating panel, and not to become key unless absolutely necessary. This is to prevent clicks in the tool palette taking focus away from the current document, which would be rather odd behaviour. We also take the opportunity to initialise _curTool to 0.

The main method of our controller is the action selectionDidChange;. Here it is.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	selectionDidChange:(id) sender
{
	_curTool = [[sender selectedCell] tag];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyToolSelectionDidChange object:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll recall that the sender of an action was an NSMatrix. The matrix will track the currently selected item and return it when we call selectedCell. Then we need to obtain the tag value associated with that item, so we call 'tag'. Then it's just assigned to _curTool.

The interesting thing comes next. We post a notification which tells any interested object that the tool selection was just changed by the user. We use something called the 'default notification center' to actually transmit this message. This is a global Cocoa object that exists for this purpose - to forward messages on to anyone who is interested. Because it's visible to all classes (in a way that our ToolsController isn't), it's an ideal way to pass information to objects we don't know about. The postNotificationName:object: method does the job. The notification name is just a string that we define which uniquely indicates what's going on, and object is the controller itself. The name is set up as a string:

 NSString* notifyToolSelectionDidChange = @&quot;toolSelectionChanged&quot;;

The string itself is really irrelevant, though it can be useful to give it a descriptive name because you later might want to log what notifications you receive somewhere as part of debugging - if the names are meaningful you'll be easily able to tell where it came from.

That's our controller in its entirety - all it does is to receive the change of the buttons and forward that as a notification.

==Receiving the notification==

Back in WKDDrawView.h, we need to declare a method to handle reception of notifications. We'll call it toolChange:, and it looks like this:

 - (void)		toolChange:(NSNotification*) note;

At the top of the.m file, outside the implementation, add:

 static int	sCurrentTool = 0;

This will be our local copy of the current tool ID. We declare it as static so that it's visible to any instance of our view class. Next we need to register for the notification. We do this as part of our init method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (id)		initWithFrame:(NSRect)frameRect
{
	if ((self = [super initWithFrame:frameRect]) != nil)
	{
		_delegate = nil;
		
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
											  selector:@selector(toolChange:)
											  name:notifyToolSelectionDidChange
											  object:nil];
	}
	return self;
}

- (void)		dealloc {
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
	[super dealloc];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We use addObserver:selector:name:object: to register an interest in this notification. When deallocation the object we have to deregister to avoid an exception for any notification sent after the deallocation.
When a notification matching the name is sent, the nominated method whose selector we passed is called:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		toolChange:(NSNotification*) note
{
	sCurrentTool = [[note object] currentTool];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we do is ask the notification which object sent the message ([note object]), and since we know that it is a ToolsController, we can then simply ask it for the tool ID, which we store in sCurrentTool. Thus sCurrentTool should always match the current value of the actual selected tool. Should the view need to know at any time which tool is selected, it can simply look at sCurrentTool rather than trying to figure out where the ToolsController is and asking it.

Of course, for this to compile we need to #import the ToolsController.h file into WKFDDrawView.m:

 #import &quot;ToolsController.h&quot;

Before we continue, let's build and go and check that we are in business as far as it goes. You should be able to choose &quot;Show Tools&quot; from the Window menu to make the palette visible, and clicking on the buttons should select them. We can't tell yet whether it's doing anything useful, as we haven't written code that acts on the value of the chosen tool. We can however, log the reception of the notification. Logging this sort of thing is always handy when developing and.or debugging an application.

To log anything, use the NSLog() function. This accepts a NSString constant which will be written out to the log. The log itself is visible as the main window in Xcode when the application is running. The string passed to NSLog accepts printf-like formatting instructions, so let's add:

 NSLog(@&quot;tool changed to %d&quot;, sCurrentTool);

To the end of the toolChange: method. Build and Go again, and verify that clicking the tool buttons causes the tool ID to be written to the log.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Turkey/Ottoman Empire/دولتِ عَليه عُثمانيه (Ottoman Turkish)==

Leader at 1901: Sultan Mehmed V

Color: Yellow

Neighbors: Russia, Austria, and Italy

Home supply centers: Constantinople, Ankara, Smyrna

Turkey has obvious natural strength--any beginner will be able to point out Turkey's strong defensive position, both from land and sea.  Turkey has the greatest staying power of any on the board.  Turkey can stalemate her enemies with six well-placed fleets and armies.  Turkey's natural defensive strength, however, is the cause of its offensive weakness.  And Turkey's defensive position is not as powerful as it initially appears.  Russia has a fighting chance to wrest BLA from Turkey in the early years, and an alliance between Italy and Austria can land an Italian Army in SMY by Autumn 1902.  Either of these cases mean curtains for Turkey. Because of its defensive position, Turkey is nicknamed &quot;The Sick Man of Europe&quot; for many. However, using this &quot;weakness&quot;, and given some good fighting, Turkey can be the best man in Europe.

==18 Center Goal==
3 home supply centers, The Balkans (4), Austria (3), Russia except St. Petersburg (3), Italy (3), and Tunis makes 17.  If Turkey has built many fleets, usually as part of an alliance with Russia, the 18th center can come from the Western half of the Mediterranean--MAR and SPA are tough, but possible.  Otherwise, Turkey must mass armies and cross the stalemate line to capture MUN.  BER and STP are too easily held from the north to be included, though if even a single Turkish army breaks into Scandinavia, victory can almost be guaranteed.

==Opening Strategy==

Turkey has by far the smallest opening book out of any Great Power.  The army in CON always goes to Turkey's one natural SC, and the fleet in ANK almost always heads to BLA, whether Russia has agreed upon a bounce or not.  Turkey fundamentally has two choices: attack Russia immediately with A SMY - ARM, or attempt to gain two builds with A SMY - CON.

===A SMY - ARM: The Russian Attack===

Perhaps Turkey's best shot at winning, this opening aims at Turkey's most dangerous enemy--Russia.  Unfortunately, Russia is Turkey's only possibility for a long-term ally, so the attack on Russia can leave Turkey friendless and surrounded in the East.  The opening is quite deadly when Turkey takes the Black Sea, as an opportunistic Austria may be willing to offer Turkey assistance for a share of the Russian spoils.  Without a fleet in BLA, the opening loses a good portion of its teeth, as gaining SEV is going to be impossible.

===A SMY - CON: The Bulgarian Push===

Turkey's best shot at two builds in 1901 is a push through BUL, followed by either a move to GRE or SER, or RUM with Austrian support.  Although Turkey rarely gets two builds--most Austrias move to ALB and SER in S 1901, and thus can pick up both SCs, and are wary of giving support to Turkey, Austria's natural enemy, the opening is safe and allows Turkey to work with or against any of his neighbors.

===Unorthodox Openings===

Several unusual openings have also sprung up.  These are not as forceful as the main lines, and therefore require more diplomacy, more trust, better intelligence gathering, and stronger tactical skill.

====A SMY H with A SMY - SYR: The Syrian Sidestep====

Spring 1901: A SMY H, A CON - BUL, F ANK - BLA.  Fall 1901: A SMY - SYR, F ANK - CON, A BUL H (or other).  Very rarely played, this opening has decent surprise value (first played in game [http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/S.html 1977KJ], first discussed in [http://www.diplomacyworld.net/pdf/dw47.pdf Diplomacy World #47]).  Turkey delays choosing Austria or Russia as his ally and leaves both coasts open for a build.  Convincing Russia to stay out of BLA in Fall 1901 by suggesting or demanding F SEV - RUM or F SEV S A UKR - RUM is a major diplomatic victory.  If instead F SEV - BLA, a Russian unit (new or existing) in SEV virtually guarantees war and requires Turkey to build F ANK.

A SYR can be useful in several ways:
:1.  Moving to ARM against Russia.
:2.  Convoying to GRE against Austria.
:3.  Discouraging Italy from playing a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Italy#A_VEN_H_or_A_VEN_-_TRI_and_A_ROM_-_APU:_The_Lepanto Lepanto].
This opening fails in the face of a determined Austro-Russian alliance, and should not be used if this alliance is expected.  The Bulgarian Push offers a safer and more direct counter.

====F ANK - ARM, A SMY - CON: Ship of the Desert====

Invented and first discussed by [http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/S.html Richard Sharp], this opening can be played as an attack on Russia, or to disguise a Turk-Russian alliance.  These approaches require essentially the same diplomacy:

:1.  Come to an arrangement with Russia over BLA.  Tell Russia that you want to bounce in BLA if you plan to attack him.  If Russia anticipates a bounce, he will be much less likely to play A MOS - SEV, which would spell curtains for you as A MOS - SEV is often part of an Austro-Russian anti-Turk alliance.  If you are working with Russia, tell him you want to shepherd his fleet through CON and into the Med (ordering it as you tell him, in return for doing the same for him with your A BUL).  You will temporarily trade CON for SEV, simulating a Turk-Russian war and taking everyone by surprise in 1902.
:2.  Tell Austria you want to partner with him against Russia.  Let him suggest who gets what Balkan territories, but demand GRE and justify yourself by saying you will need GRE as a springboard to force Italy out of ION once Russia is gone.  If he refuses, then demand he support you into RUM in F1901.  The idea is to get Austria firmly on your side if you plan to attack Russia, and to lull him into a false sense of security if you are working with Russia.
:3.  Tell Russia, Austria, and Italy (contact them all separately) that it will take them a long time to eliminate you if they are planning to attack, and that in the meantime they'll be open to a stab by anyone else.

You want the following in the first couple of years:

=====Anti-Russian=====

S1901
:Turkey: F ANK - ARM, A CON - BUL, A SMY - CON
:Russia: F SEV - BLA, A MOS - UKR, A WAR - GAL
:Austria: A VIE - GAL, A BUD - SER, F TRI H or F TRI - VEN (but expect F TRI - ALB)
:Italy: anything but a Lepanto.
:England, France, and Germany: infighting, but preferably EG vs. F

F1901
:Turkey: F ARM - ANK, A CON - ANK, A BUL - RUM
:Russia: F BLA - RUM, A UKR - SEV, A WAR - GAL (altough A WAR - UKR is more likely)
:Austria (assuming F TRI - ALB in S1901): A SER S A BUL - RUM, F TRI - GRE, A VIE - GAL (although - BUD or - TRI is also likely)
:Italy, England, France, and Germany: same as before

W1901: Hope like mad Russia didn't play F BLA S F ARM - ANK.  Build F ANK (or F CON if he played F BLA S A CON - ANK).

=====Russian Partnership=====

S1901 - Same moves as Anti-Russian.

F1901
:Turkey: F ARM - SEV, A BUL - GRE, A CON - ANK
:Russia: F BLA - CON, A UKR - RUM, A WAR - GAL
:Austria: A VIE - GAL, A SER S F ALB - GRE, F ALB - GRE
:Italy, England, France, and Germany: same as before.

W1901: Build F SMY, and sail into the Med. with Russia.

This opening has the advantage of allowing Turkey to justify keeping a fleet in BLA for at least a few turns.  When SEV and CON are swapped back (presumably in F1902), Turkey can argue that moving to BLA is the fastest way to get to the Med., and the best way to protect both BUL and RUM.  This allows Turkey a fair amount of protection against a delayed Russian stab.  Also, if you can lobby hard enough, Turkey would ideally like to see:

F1901
:Turkey: F ARM - SEV, A BUL - RUM, A CON - BUL
:Russia: A WAR - GAL, A UKR S A WAR - GAL, F BLA - CON

This can be justified by claiming Turkey needs to build an additional unit in ANK in W1901 to quickly secure ION.  Russia can always capture RUM in 1902 or 1903, by which time Turkey should have captured GRE, and probably SER too.  Meanwhile, securing GAL is a strong medium-term strategic blow to Austria, who soon be surrounded by units in GAL, RUM, BUL, and GRE.  GAL is then a stepping-off point for Russia's attack on Austria.  A direct Turk will tell Russia he knows Russia often gets the upper hand in a RT, and that Turkey needs to expand as quickly as possible (i.e., as fast or a little faster than Russia) in the beginning to compensate for the difficulty he will have in capturing additional centers later.

==Black Sea Strategy==
The Black Sea is an important sea space for Turkey--a Turkey that loses the Black Sea is usually gone within a year or two.  However, many Russias (both friendly and enemy) will demand that Turkey not enter BLA in S1901 as part of an alliance.  It is much safer for Turkey to arrange a bounce, but most Russias consider it advantageous to grab RUM as quickly and as surely as possible, which is facilitated by the lack of a Turkish fleet in BLA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==

The game of Diplomacy was developed by [[w:Allan B. Calhamer|Allan B. Calhamer]] while he was a student at [[w:Harvard Law School|Harvard Law School]] during the 1950's.  While only a minor commercial success, Diplomacy has a small, devoted fanbase. Many famous politicians have stated that Diplomacy was their favorite game.  [[w:John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and [[w:Henry Kissinger|Henry Kissinger]] were both fans of the game, as was news anchor [[w:Walter Cronkite|Walter Cronkite]].

The major difficulty for playing the game is finding the seven players required.  The game also takes a very long time to complete--usually three to six hours, or even longer if time for diplomacy is not capped.  Although face-to-face diplomacy provides a more nuanced and exciting game, as players can actually see the [[../Negotiation|discussions]] between two powers, if not overhear them, the difficulty of finding seven players in one's area has made mail, and now e-mail, the two most popular ways to play Diplomacy.

There has been a push in the past decade for better Artificial Intelligence for the game.  Computers continue to improve, and have even become pretty good at no-press variants of the game, but cannot yet compete with humans in games with communication.

==Overview==

Diplomacy is a [[w:Zero–sum game|w:zero-sum]], turn-based, strategy wargame played by seven people, each taking the role of a Great Power in Europe during the World War I era.  The seven countries are [[../Austria/]] (or Austria-Hungary), [[../England/]], [[../France/]], [[../Germany/]], [[../Italy/]], [[../Russia/]], and [[../Turkey/]].  The game year is divided into five phases: Spring movements and retreats, Fall movements and retreats, and Winter adjustments.  Each power controls only two types of units: armies and fleets.  Fleets can occupy ocean spaces and coastal provinces, and can convoy armies across ocean spaces.  The board is divided into 75 spaces, 56 land and 19 sea.  34 land spaces are called supply centers.  Powers capture supply centers by having their troops occupy the territory after fall retreats.  Powers maintain ownership over every province they have conquered until another power is able to move one of his or her own units into the province during the fall (although keeping track of the ownership of non-supply center provinces is essentially irrelevant).  Owning more supply centers than units after the fall retreats allows a player to build a unit in one of his or her unoccupied home centers during the winter adjustments.  A player wins by taking 18 supply centers.  Achieving solo victory is extremely difficult, and most games end in draws ranging in size from two to four players.

      <comment>upDateMarquee:  --- Mark area occupied by the updated Marquee rectangle as needing display</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Wikidraw%27s_view_class|Previous Page: Wikidraw's view class]] | [[../An_Inspector_calls|Next Page: An Inspector calls]]

Before we can act upon the different tools, we'll need the classes that implement the different shapes. We have four tool buttons at the moment, so it would be nice to have one being a selection tool, and three being shape drawing tools. We already have the rectangle shape so we need two more. We'll create an oval shape and a slightly more complex polygonal shape. You can go on to create any number of additional shapes if you want, and just extend the tool palette to access them.

Select WKDShape.m and choose File-&gt;New File... Choose Objective-C class, and set its name to &quot;WKDOvalShape.m&quot;. By the way the only reason to select the WKDShape file before you do this is to make sure the new files go in the same group - unfortunately Xcode doesn't automatically subclass existing classes, so we'll have to do that by hand.

Open the WKDOvalShape.h file and add #import &quot;WKDShape.h&quot; to the top of the file. Then change NSObject to WKDShape. Your class definition looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
#import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;
#import &quot;WKDShape.h&quot;

@interface WKDOvalShape : WKDShape
{
}

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

The only method to be implemented is 'path', and we don't need to declare it. Just add it to the implementation, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
@implementation WKDOvalShape

- (NSBezierPath*)	path
{
	return [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithOvalInRect:[self bounds]];
}

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now repeat the whole exercise again, this time making files for a class called 'WKDPolyShape'. Here's the implementation we need:

&lt;pre&gt;
@implementation WKDPolyShape

- (NSBezierPath*)	path
{
	NSBezierPath* path = [NSBezierPath bezierPath];
	NSRect	br = [self bounds];
	NSPoint p;
	
	[path moveToPoint:br.origin];
	
	p.x = NSMidX( br );
	p.y = NSMidY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	
	p.x = NSMaxX( br );
	p.y = NSMinY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	
	p.x = NSMaxX( br );
	p.y = NSMaxY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];

	p.x = NSMidX( br );
	p.y = NSMidY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	
	p.x = NSMinX( br );
	p.y = NSMaxY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	[path closePath];
	
	return path;
}
@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now return to WKDDrawView.m. Add imports for both of these new files to the top of the file. Add the following to the method 'shapeForCurrentTool'.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (WKDShape*)	shapeForCurrentTool
{
	switch([self currentTool])
	{
		default:
			return nil;
	
		case 1:
			return [[[WKDShape alloc] init] autorelease];
			
		case 2:
			return [[[WKDOvalShape alloc] init] autorelease];
			
		case 3:
			return [[[WKDPolyShape alloc] init] autorelease];
	}
}


- (int)			currentTool
{
	return sCurrentTool;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's simple - depending on the current tool, we make one of the three different kinds of shapes. We return 'nil' as the default case, which we'll use to mean the selection tool. Build and Go and check that three kinds of shapes can be drawn. The tool with ID 0 currently will log an error because we haven't adjusted our mouseDown: method to handle the nil case as a selection yet. Let's fix that next.

==Selection marquee==

The idea of a selection marquee is very simple - the user clicks in the view with the selection tool, and drags a rectangular box over a set of objects. Any objects that the box touches are selected, and any others outside the box are deselected.

To make this work, we'll need a way to tell which objects are touched by the marquee and which are not. This is straightforward, as the utility function NSIntersectsRect, which we've already seen, will figure it out. We just need to iterate over our objects, retrieve their bounds (or more accurately, the drawBounds) and test for an intersection with the marquee. If it intersects, it's selected, if not, it isn't.

To draw the marquee itself, we'll need to track its original anchor point, and use this to form a rectangle. All of the required code goes in the view class. We also add a pair of NSPoint data members, _anchor and _marquee, to track the current size of the marquee.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		updateMarquee:(NSPoint) newPoint
{
	_marquee = newPoint;
	
	NSRect mr = NSRectFromTwoPoints( _anchor, _marquee );
	NSEnumerator* iter = [[[self delegate] objects] objectEnumerator];
	WKDShape* obj;
	NSRect		br;
	
	[[self delegate] deselectAll];
	
	while ( obj = [iter nextObject])
	{
		br = [obj drawBounds];
		
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( mr, br ))
			[[self delegate] selectObject:obj];
	}
        [self setNeedsDisplayInRect:mr];
}


- (void)		drawMarquee
{
	NSRect mr = NSInsetRect( NSRectFromTwoPoints( _anchor, _marquee ), 1, 1 );
	
	[[NSColor grayColor] set];
	NSFrameRect( mr );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

updateMarquee: does most of the work. It sets the _marquee data member, and then uses this and _anchor to calculate the rectangle of the marquee. Then it deselects everything, and iterates over the objects, testing each one's drawBounds against the marquee rect. If they intersect, the object is selected.

drawMarquee also calculates the marquee rectangle, and frames it in grey. Both of these methods call the utility NSRectFromTwoPoints. In fact Cocoa doesn't provide this function, so instead we define it ourselves. Note that this is a plain C function, outside of the class implementation. It should be placed above the @implementation declaration in WKDDrawView.m.

&lt;pre&gt;
NSRect	NSRectFromTwoPoints( NSPoint a, NSPoint b )
{
	NSRect r;
	
	r.origin.x = MIN( a.x, b.x );
	r.origin.y = MIN( a.y, b.y );
	
	r.size.width = ABS( a.x - b.x );
	r.size.height = ABS( a.y - b.y );
	
	return r;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we need to modify our mousing methods to handle the marquee. All three methods are affected, but mouseDown: is the most complex. The logic of the method needs to be changed so that a more consistent behaviour is implemented, now we have a working tool palette. Rather than immediately locate the object under the mouse, we need to determine the current tool first - we only need to look for an object under the mouse if the selection tool is active. Otherwise, we are creating a new object. Thus the order of the logic at the top of the method needs to be altered. Here's the modified method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	mouseDown:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	_dragShape = [self shapeForCurrentTool];
	
	if (_dragShape == nil)
	{
		_dragShape = [[self delegate] objectUnderMousePoint:pt];
		
		if ( _dragShape == nil )
		{
			// marquee drag
			
			_anchor = pt;
			[self updateMarquee:pt];
			return;
		}
	}
	else
	{
		[[self delegate] addObject:_dragShape];
		[_dragShape setLocation:pt];
	}
	
	if (([evt modifierFlags] &amp; NSShiftKeyMask) == 0)
	{
		[[self delegate] deselectAll];
		[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	else
	{
		if ([[[self delegate] selection] containsObject:_dragShape])
		{
			[[self delegate] deselectObject:_dragShape];
			_dragShape = nil;
		}
		else
			[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
	[_dragShape mouseDown:pt];
}


- (void)	mouseDragged:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	NSRect update = [_dragShape drawBounds];
	
	if ( _dragShape )
		[_dragShape mouseDragged:pt];
	else
		[self updateMarquee:pt];
		
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:NSUnionRect([_dragShape drawBounds], update)];
}


- (void)	mouseUp:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	
	if ( _dragShape )
		[_dragShape mouseUp:pt];
	else
	{
		[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:NSRectFromTwoPoints( _anchor, _marquee )];
		_anchor = _marquee = NSZeroPoint;
	}	
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:[_dragShape drawBounds]];
	_dragShape = nil;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the selection tool is current, we will have a nil dragShape, so we use that to subsequently detect the marquee case by testing if the mouse hit empty space or an existing object. For mouseDown:, we set the value of _anchor, then call for an update of the marquee. On mouseDragged:, we detect the marquee case and update it again, changing the selection as needed. On mouseUp:, we refresh the marquee area and set the marquee points to zero. This will erase the marquee, leaving anything it selected still selected. The only remaining task is to make the marquee visible. To do this, we simply add a call to drawMarquee to our drawRect: method.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	drawRect:(NSRect) rect
{
	[[NSColor whiteColor] set];
	NSRectFill( rect );
	
	NSArray*		drawList = [[self delegate] objects];
	NSArray*		selection = [[self delegate] selection];
	NSEnumerator*	iter = [drawList objectEnumerator];
	WKDShape*		shape;
	
	while( shape = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( rect, [shape drawBounds]))
			[shape drawWithSelection:[selection containsObject:shape]];
	}
	
	[self drawMarquee];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we'll find that when we compile and run the application, we have a much more standard behaviour for the selection tool.

There are some fairly serious inefficiencies here - every time the marquee size changes, the selection is recalculated entirely from scratch. For a few objects this isn't a problem, but if our drawing became complex it could well be. Once we add the inspector which will respond to selection changes, performance could suffer even more. We won't be worrying about this now, but perhaps you could think of a few simple ways to improve the efficiency?

This section won't really introduce anything new about Cocoa, but it will help consolidate what we've learned already. The idea is to provide an inspector type interface for Wikidraw so that we can set the properties of the objects we have drawn, such as the colours, stroke widths, etc.

From what we learned about notifications, we can see how we might achieve this. Whenever the selection changes, a notification can be broadcast indicating that fact. The inspector can listen for these, and find out what the current selection is, then simply update its interface to match the selected object's properties.

When the user changes the interface, the new properties are applied to the objects in the selection.

The process of creating the Inspector is similar to the one for the tool palette. A single global inspector is used, and so it can go in the 'MainMenu.nib' file. We'll need a new controller object to act as the go-between between the interface elements and the document. Now at this point it should be pointed out that in a real application, you would probably make separate .nib files for interface elements like this, simply to keep things manageable and even reusable in other applications. However, doing this brings in a number of complications that don't really help us get to know about Cocoa's features, so for now we won't do this. But bear in mind that there are better ways to do things than what we are about to do.

==Inspector design==

Most of the inspector design we can accomplish in Interface Builder, though this is a moderately complex piece of user interface.

The user is able to select different objects in the main document; the inspector is there to display the properties of the selected object and allow them to be changed interactively. However the user is also able to select more than one object, or none. What should we do in these cases? In this design, we take a simple approach - if there are no objects selected the inspector will hide the controls that edit the properties and display 'No selection'. For a multiple selection, we do the same thing, except display 'Multiple selection'. Only if there is only one object selected do we display the edit controls. This is not as sophisticated as some applications - perhaps you would design a real application so that multiple objects could be edited at once. However, this approach is simple and makes it clear how to go about handling the different cases.

A good way of arranging sets of controls to appear and disappear  in the described fashion is to use a tabbed interface, but without actually having the tabs themselves. As we detect each case, we switch to the appropriate pane of the tab which we have already set up with our desired controls. This way, we do not have to worry about individually hiding or showing particular controls, which is certainly possible, but requires more complex code.

To detect each case, we need only look at the count of objects in the selection array. If the count is zero, we know there is nothing selected. If it is one, we have a single object, and if it is any other number, we have a multiple selection. Thus the code to determine the selection state is very simple indeed.

==Building the interface==

In IB, open the 'MainMenu.nib' file. Add a Panel window to the file and use IB's inspector to make it a utility window with the title 'Inspector'.

Drag an NSTabView to the window. Initially it will have visible tabs, which makes it easier to handle. Later we will hide these. We need three tabs - use the inspector to set this. Size the tab view so that it is comfortably within the window. The first tab will be for the 'No selection' case, so select this tab and drag a text item into the window. Change the text to 'No selection', and set its colour to light grey. Change the ''identifier'' of the tab to the string 'none'. In our code we will be selecting the displayed tab using these identifiers.

Switch to tab 3. This will be the multiple selection case, so drag a text item as before and set its text to 'Multiple selection'. Set the identifier for this tab view to 'multi'.

Switch to tab 2. This will be our actual edit controls tab, and we need quite a few. Set the identifier for this tab to 'std'. As shown in the screenshot, I divided it up into two sections, ''stroke'' and ''fill''. Each section contains a radio button selection and a colour well. The stroke section also contains a slider control used for setting the stroke line width. Find all of these controls and drag them in. Arrange them neatly. The stroke width slider is set to have a range of 0.3 to 20.0 - this will eventually become the line width value. Set the number of markers to 21 and to be above the slider. Also check the 'send action continuously while sliding' and make sure the 'stop on tick marks only' is unchecked.

Finally, select the tab view again and set it to have hidden tabs. Position and size the tab view so that it fills the panel window and that each tab looks as you want it, and that you can see all of the controls and they are positioned neatly.

Now we need to create a controller for the inspector panel. Switch to the 'classes' tab in the main window, and select the NSWindowController class. Choose Classes-&gt;Subclass NSWindowController. Give the new class the name of 'InspectorController'. We need to add all of our actions and outlets now. Double-click the new class name to display the actions and outlets editor in the IB inspector. Add the following actions:

* fillColourButtonAction:
* fillColourDidChange:
* strokeColourButtonAction:
* strokeColourDidChange:
* strokeWidthDidChange:

Switch to the outlets editor. Add the following outlets:

*panelTabControl
*fillColourButtons
*fillColourWell
*strokeColourButtons
*strokeColourWell
*strokeWidthSlider

Now we can generate the code files for the InspectorController. Choose Classes-&gt;Create files for InspectorController. Accept the defaults and click Choose in the subsequent dialogue.

Next, instantiate the controller. Select the new class and Choose Classes-&gt;Instantiate InspectorController. A new instance is added to the main window.

Finally, we need to hook up all of the outlets and actions. Switch to the 'Instances' tab in the main window. First the outlets: control-drag FROM the box representing the InspectorController instance to the various controls in the panel. It should be clear from the names which controls are meant to be connected to which outlet. The tab pane itself might be tricky - you may need to show the tabs again temporarily to be able to highlight the tab view as a target. It is important that the 'panelTabControl' outlet connects to the NSTabView and not to the NSView that is inside it. Also, connect the outlet 'window' to the panel window itself.

Next connect the actions. Control-drag FROM each of the active controls TO the InspectorController instance. Again, the names should indicate which actions go with which controls. Only active controls need an action - the text you added to the other panes in the tab view are passive and have no actions.

Finally, add a menu command to the main menu bar under 'Window' for the 'Show Inspector' command. Its action should be the showWindow: action in the InspectorController.

Once you are satisfied that you have connected every action and outlet correctly, SAVE the file and return to Xcode.

==Coding the inspector==

The first thing we need to do is to add a notification to our document so that when the selection changes, any interested objects get to know about it. The inspector will listen for this notification, and respond accordingly. There are four methods that affect the selection state in MyDocument:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		selectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		deselectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		selectAll;
- (void)		deselectAll;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We will need to make a small modification to the code of all four to make sure that the inspector 'keeps up' with selection changes. Since a notification needs a name, let's define one.

 extern NSString* notifyObjectSelectionDidChange;

This goes outside of the class definition, below the '@end' statement in MyDocument.h

In MyDocument.m, add the following:

 NSString* notifyObjectSelectionDidChange = @&quot;objectSelectionDidChange&quot;;

This goes before the '@implementation' statement. All we are doing is declaring a global string that represents this particular event. By declaring it 'extern' in our .h file, we allow other code to know about this string without having to care where it actually is. Our .m file actually gives the string its real substance.

Now, change the selection methods as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		selectObject:(id) object
{
	if([_objects containsObject:object] &amp;&amp; ![_selection containsObject:object])
	{
		[_selection addObject:object];
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
	}
}

- (void)		deselectObject:(id) object
{
	[_selection removeObject:object];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
}

- (void)		selectAll
{
	[_selection setArray:_objects];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
}

- (void)		deselectAll
{
	[_selection removeAllObjects];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we have done is add a line to each that posts a notification with the name we declared whenever the selection changes. Note that we don't bother trying to notify what sort of change was made, only that it has changed. The receiver of the message can call us back to get further information if it needs to.

At this stage, it may be worth compiling and running the application to check that it still works OK. So far we haven't added any visible new functionality.

The code for the inspector itself will be added in InspectorController.m. This is one of the files that IB made for us in the last section. If you select this file, you will see that it has already expanded the action methods for us. We do need two other however, so set things up initially and tear them down properly. Here are the awakeFromNib method and the dealloc method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	awakeFromNib
{
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setFloatingPanel:YES];
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setBecomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded:YES];
	
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
										selector:@selector(selectionChanged:)
										name:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange
										object:nil];
										
}

- (void)	dealloc {
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
	[super dealloc];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

As with our tools palette, we first just make sure that the panel window floats and doesn't become key unless absolutely necessary. Then, we subscribe to the notification from MyDocument that we set up above. In order for this file to know about our notification name and the methods of MyDocument, also add '#import &quot;MyDocument.h&quot;' to the top of the file.

Switch to InspectorController.h and add this method to the class definition:

 - (void)		selectionChanged:(NSNotification*) note;

Back in the .m file, expand this method as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		selectionChanged:(NSNotification*) note
{
	MyDocument* doc = (MyDocument*)[note object];
	NSArray*	sel = [doc selection];
	NSString*	tab;
	
	NSLog(@&quot;selection changed, objects selected = %d&quot;, [sel count]);
	
	switch([sel count])
	{
		case 0:
			tab = @&quot;none&quot;;
			break;
			
		case 1:
			tab = @&quot;std&quot;;
			break;
			
		default:
			tab = @&quot;multi&quot;;
			break;
	}
	
	[panelTabControl selectTabViewItemWithIdentifier:tab];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is where the notification of selections changing gets actually responded to. It is called every time the selection state in the main document changes. The first thing it does is to find out which document the message came from. The sender of the message is part of the notification itself, obtained using the doc = [note object] message. Next, we need the selection, so we ask the document for it, sel = [doc selection]. Then we can simply count the number of objects to figure out which pane of our inspector we need to display. According to whether 0, 1 or more objects are selected, we set up the string 'tab' with the required identifier (which you will recall we established in Interface Builder - if this doesn't work check that the identifiers match). Finally, we simply set the tab using the identifier. We have a reference to the tab view because it's one of our outlets, and it was set up automatically.

Now we can test this. Compile and run the application. Show the tools palette and the inspector palettes using the menu commands. Create a few objects in the main document. Use the selection tool to select different objects, more than one object and no objects - verify that the inspector displays the appropriate controls according to the selection state.

The next step is to hook up the edit controls to the selected object so we can edit the object's properties. First we write some code to set the state of the controls to match the selected object's state. Then we fill in the action methods so that the object's state can be changed.

In the InspectorController.h file, add the following method definition:

 - (void)		setupWithShape:(WKDShape*) shape;

Now, because we declare this to take a WKDShape* parameter, we'll need this file to 'know about' that class. We could #import WKDShape.h here, but that would mean that any file that only needed to know about the inspector would also pull in the shape file, which it might not need. So instead, for efficiency and to reduce interdependency, we 'forward declare' the class at this stage. This is simple:

 @class WKDShape;

Add that line above the '@interface' statement. All it says is that there is a class, somewhere, called WKDShape. At this point it doesn't need any internal details of WKDShape, so it avoids the inefficiency of importing the entire file.

Back in the .m file, we flesh out this method as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setupWithShape:(WKDShape*) shape
{
	NSColor* fill = [shape fillColour];
	NSColor* strk = [shape strokeColour];
	
	if ( fill )
	{
		[fillColourButtons selectCellWithTag:0];
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[fillColourWell setColor:fill];
	}
	else
	{
		[fillColourButtons selectCellWithTag:1];
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}

	if ( strk )
	{
		[strokeColourButtons selectCellWithTag:0];
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[strokeColourWell setColor:strk];
	}
	else
	{
		[strokeColourButtons selectCellWithTag:1];
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}
	
	[strokeWidthSlider setFloatValue:[shape strokeWidth]];

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's quite obvious really - it simply gets the fill and stroke properties of the shape object passed in, and uses them to set the states of the controls via the outlets in the controller. If there is no colour associated with the stroke or fill, this is used to select the 'none' option by using the tag of the radio button. In that case, the colour well is also disabled.

Because this code does need the internal details of WKDShape, the .m file does need to #import WKDShape.h, so add that line to the top of the file.

Now, hook up this method by modifying the 'selectionChanged:' method:

&lt;pre&gt;
		case 1:
			tab = @&quot;std&quot;;
			[self setupWithShape:[sel objectAtIndex:0]];
			break;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Because in this case we know that the selection contains only one object, it must be the object at index 0 in that array. We can set up the controls before the tab panel actually switches to them without any problems.

Compile and run the application and verify that now when an object is selected, the inspector displays the default colours which are black stroke and white fill.

Finally, let's make the inspector interactively edit the selected object.

==Editing the shape==

There are a couple of things we'll need to do first. We have a bunch of different action methods all hooked up to various inspector controls, but they all affect the same selected object. We'll therefore need to track which object this is so that we can edit it at any time, as long as it remains selected. To do this, we'll add a reference to it as a data member of the inspector class. So in InspectorController.h, add:

 	WKDShape*	editShape;

as a data member. For safety, we'll also add a method called setShape:, which handles the usual retain/release of a shape as the selection changes. We could set this up so that a retain isn't required, but then we'd have to be careful that there could never be any circumstances that a stale reference could exist. This way is more straightforward, safer and 'the Cocoa way'. So expand setShape as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setShape:(WKDShape*) shape
{
	[shape retain];
	[editShape release];
	editShape = shape;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add a call to [self setShape:shape] at the top of the setupWithShape: method. Now we can simply refer to editShape safely at any time.

One more thing we need to do to prepare. You'll recall that the view that displays the shapes is responsible for drawing them, but we will be editing the shape's properties directly. In order for the changes to be visible immediately, there needs to be a way to tell the view to refresh the shape's bounds rectangle whenever something changes. We don't want to encumber the inspector with this task, as it then sets up an unnecessary dependency between the inspector and our view class. Instead, the shapes themselves need to be able to flag the necessary refresh of the view that is drawing them. To accomplish this, we need another notification. When a shape's state changes, it posts a notification. The view responds to this by obtaining the shape's bounds and refreshing that region of the screen. Because the view originally created the shape, establishing the notification is very straightforward, and the inspector plays no part.

In WKDShape.m, add the method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		repaint
{
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyShapeRequiresRefresh object:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

in the .h file, declare this method and also an extern NSString* for 'notifyShapeRequiresRefresh'. In the .m file, make this string take some suitable value - I used the string @&quot;repaintMe!&quot; - but it can be anything unique.

In each method that changes a property, we need to add a call to [self repaint]; so that the notification gets posted.

Now in WKDDrawView, we need to add a responder for this notification. Add the following method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		repaintNotification:(NSNotification*) note
{
	WKDShape* shape = (WKDShape*)[note object];
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:[shape drawBounds]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, add a line to the initWithFrame: method of WKDDrawView so that it subscribes to these notifications:

&lt;pre&gt;
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
											  selector:@selector(repaintNotification:)
											  name:notifyShapeRequiresRefresh
											  object:nil];
&lt;/pre&gt;

This allows the view to respond to a refresh request from any shape object whenever that shape's properties are changed. There is a small flaw in this scheme as written; sharp-eyed readers may have noticed it. It has to do with multiple documents. At present, a view can't tell whether the shape really belongs to it or not. The effect is however, harmless - it just means more refreshes going on than really necessary if there are multiple documents. You might like to think about how to solve this problem.

Back to the inspector. Now a shape can refresh itself when needed, and we have a way to track the object we are editing, it's a simple matter of hooking up the action methods for each control so they do the right thing.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	fillColourButtonAction:(id) sender
{
	int tag = [[sender selectedCell] tag];
	
	if ( tag == 1 )
	{
		[editShape setFillColour:nil];
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}
	else
	{
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[editShape setFillColour:[fillColourWell color]];
	}
}

- (IBAction)	fillColourDidChange:(id) sender
{
	[editShape setFillColour:[sender color]];
}

- (IBAction)	strokeColourButtonAction:(id) sender
{
	int tag = [[sender selectedCell] tag];
	
	if ( tag == 1 )
	{
		[editShape setStrokeColour:nil];
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}
	else
	{
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[editShape setStrokeColour:[strokeColourWell color]];
	}
}

- (IBAction)	strokeColourDidChange:(id) sender
{
	[editShape setStrokeColour:[sender color]];
}

- (IBAction)	strokeWidthDidChange:(id) sender
{
	[editShape setStrokeWidth:[sender floatValue]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This should be clear - we extract the value of the sender and pass it along to the relevant property. For the radio buttons, we pass along nil if the 'none' button is selected (tag == 1), otherwise the current well colour. We also implement some UI state here, disabling the colour well if the 'none' option is chosen.

Compile and run to test - you should find that the inspector is now fully interactive. The selected object refreshes itself using the repaint notification, so the inspector is free to simply set the relevant property without caring how it handles the display. This is the correct separation of functionality - the controller (inspector) changes the data model (shape) which flags the change to the view which obtains whatever it needs from the data model to update the screen. This is how MVC is meant to work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you still have your finger exercise up, do a File New. Don't bother to save the tooth, unless you really want it. Now let's build a dog house.

Start with a primitive cube. Select the lower and upper edge on one of the sides. Then Connect them (remember to right click to bring up the Edge menu). Hit the Space Bar to deselect the new edge. Repeat the operation on the opposite side of the cube. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.a.

Select the three vertical edges on one of the sides. Connect. Hit the Space Bar to deselect the new edge. Repeat on the other side. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure
10.b. 

Move the horizontal mid-edges up in the Y direction on both sides by 0.50 units. Then Move the vertical mid-edges forward in the Z direction on both sides by 0.50 units. You can see the units change in the Status Bar at the bottom of the Wings window, below the Icon Bar. Simply stop dragging when the value reads 0.50 and left click the mouse. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.c.

Figure 10. Roughing in the basic form. The top and bottom edges have been Connected in (a). The new edge and the two side edges were then Connected in (b). Do this on both sides of the model. In c the edges have been Moved. Do both sides of the model at the same time to ensure symmetry. In (d) the sides have been Extruded. The vertices on the front face have been Connected in (e). In (f) the new edge and the bottom edge were Cut by 3 and the resulting vertices then Connected.

Select the two large faces, one on each side, and Extrude Normal by 1.0. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.d. Then Select the two vertices on the front face and Connect them as shown in Figure 10.e. Select the two long edges on the front face and Cut by 3. Connect the resulting vertices. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.f.
Select the front faces of the side sections and Inset some windows as seen in Figure 11.a Move the front three edges that run horizontally across the front of the main cube down in Y by 0.50 to square up the door as shown in 11.b. Then select the two windows and Scale them down in Y by 0.50 units to square them up as well. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 11.c. Select the door, windows, and the three floor faces as shown in 11.e. Now Intrude to hollow out the shell of the dog house. Figure 11.f shows the results of the Intrude operation. The thickness of the walls is determined by how much you move the mouse while Intruding. Figure 11. More basic construction. New faces have been Inset in (a). The three edges on the front face were then Moved down in Y (b) to resize the door face. The windows are then resized in c. Select all the faces that will be used for the Intrude command in (e) and Intrude. The results of the Intrude are shown in (f).

Select the two edges that go from the side sections to the main roof and Dissolve them (Figure 12.a). Switch to Vertex Mode. Select the two left over vertices on the roof lines and Collapse them (Figure 12.b). Then select the top face and Inset by 75% (Figure 12.c). Now Move the inset roof face up in the Y direction for 0.50 units (Figure 12.d). Now Inset the top face outward by 30% then Extrude it up in Y by 0.25 units (Figure 12.e) and then Scale it down Uniform by 90% to form a little roof cap. The house should resemble that shown in Figure 12.f.

Figure 12. Building the main roof. Dissolve the edges (a) and Collapse the vertices (b) that disrupt the roof face. Then Inset the roof c. Move the center face up in Y (d) then Inset outward and Extrude Y to form the roof cap(e). Then Scale the top of the cap (f).

Select the top faces of the side sections and Inset outward by 40% (Figure 13.a). Then Extrude Normal up by 0.10 units (Figure 13.b). Switch to Edge Mode. Deselect the front and back edges with the mouse. This will leave the inside and outside edges still selected as in Figure 13.c. (I just rotated the house so you can see the back side and see that four edges remain selected.) Connect the side edges (Figure 13.d). Move the new edges up in Y 0.53 units to form gables. Hit the Space Bar to deselect everything and switch to Vertex Mode. Then select the vertices on the outside of the two gables and Scale X by -25% to bring them in as seen in Figure 13.e. Then Connect the vertices on the top outside edges on the sides of the gables.

Figure 13.The side roofs. Select the two side roofs and Inset outward (a) and then Extrude Normal up (b). Select the four edges (two on each roof) and Connect (c). Move the new edges up (e). Switch to Vertex Mode and Scale the two outer most vertices in X to form the gables (f).

Connect the front side top edges (Figure 14.a). Then select the two lower edges of the front top and Connect them (Figure 14.b). Switch to Vertex Mode (Figure 14.c) and Scale the vertices down in Y to bring the two lines close together and then Move them down in Y to bring them closer to the door (Figure 14.d). Select the two edges we just positioned (Figure 14.e) and Cut them by 3, then do a Connect on the resultant vertices (Figure 14.f). Scale them apart in X by

Figure 14. The porch overhang. Connect the side edges of the top front face (a) and then Connect the lower set again (b). Select the vertices and scale them down in Y to bring the edges closer together c. Then Move them all down closer to the door (d). Cut the edges by 3 (e) and Connect the resulting vertices (f) and scale them apart (g) to form a face that will become the porch roof (h). Then Extrude that face (i).
40% (Figure 14.g). Select the new face (Figure 14.h) and Extrude it Normal by 0.5 (Figure 14.i).
Select the top back edge of the porch roof (Figure 15.a) and Cut it by 2. Connect the resulting vertex with the two front top corner vertices as show in Figure 15.b. Move the back center vertex up in Y by 0.5 (Figure 15.c). Now dolly the camera so that you can see the underside of the porch (as in Figure 15.d).
Connect the bottom side edges of the porch roof (15.e). Move it forward in Z by 0.15 units (15.f). Select the front and back bottom edges of the porch roof too. Cut all three edges by 3 (15.g). Connect the vertices (15.h). Scale them apart in X 130% to form small square shaped faces at the front bottom corners of the porch roof (15.i). Now select the two intersecting vertices and Bevel to 0.07 units (15.j).

Select the resulting edges and Cut by 2 (15.k). Scale the resulting vertices from one side Uniform by 40% to form a roundish face (15.l). Now select the four vertices on the other side and do an Edit | Repeat Drag to form an exact copy of the rounded face on the other side of the porch. Select the two round faces and Extrude Y by -1.10 units which will make them even with the bottom of the house.

Figure 15. Under the porch. Cut the back edge of the porch roof by 2 (a) and connect that vertex up with the two at the top front corners (b). Then Move the center vertex up in Y (c). Now roll the house over so that you can see the underside of the porch (d). Connect the two side edges (e) and Move the new edge towards the front. Select the three long edges (g) and Cut by 3 and then Connect the resulting vertices (h). Bevel the intersecting vertices (i). Then select the edges of the new boxes and Cut by 2. One one side only, Scale the new vertices Uniform to form a circle (j). Then use Repeat Drag (k) to create another circle (l) on the other side of the porch.

Switch to Body Mode and select the house by clicking on it. Then switch to Edge Mode and all the edges will be selected. Right click to bring up the Edge Operations menu and set Hardness to Hard. Pick faces and set materials to your liking. Select all the roof top faces. Right click for the Face Operations menu and choose Set Material. You will be prompted for a material name. Call it Roof. The Material Editor will come up. Change the settings until you get a roof color you like on the preview globe on the left. Then click OK.

Figure 16. Completing the project. Select the two circles (a) and position your model so that you can see it from the front with all the bottom edges lined up (b). Then Extrude Y to create the columns. After assigning materials your model should resemble the one depicted in c. Remember to hit the Tab key to see the colors in Smooth Shaded mode.

While you can see the materials on the shaded wireframe in Workmode you can get a better idea of how things will look in Smooth Shaded Mode.To see the results deselect the roof faces and hit the Tab key for a shaded preview. You should see the new roof color. Now repeat material assignments as you did for the roof until your dog is happy (Figure 16.c).
Save the model. Optionally, Export the model into one of the formats your renderer can accept and render the dog house to see how it turned out. Here is mine (Figure 17)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

User blocking is perhaps one of the most heavy-handed things you can do as an administrator, and the one that can cause the most damage.  An administrator must therefore be cautious in using this power.  Often a user will spend quite a bit of time building up a reputation under a particular user name, and by blocking that user they will not be able to edit from their account. Blocked users can still edit their user talk page (and user talk sub-pages?) unless these pages are protected and the user doesn't have sysop or higher privileges.

It is also possible to block IP addresses from being able to edit text.  This does not stop a registered user on that IP address from being able to log in, but only stops anonymous users from using the edit functions.  If there is a problem where a registered user is unable to access the Wiki due to an anonymous IP block, then the user must unblock that IP and reblock with ''anonymous users only'' checked.

== Performing the Block ==

The actual process of performing the block is rather straight forward.  You can either go directly to [[Special:Blockip]] and get the page, or you can use your administrator's tools on the sidebar and then clicking on the Block User link.  This is only visible when you are viewing either a user page or a user talk page.

[[Image:BlockUser2.png]]

All this does is simply fill in the name of the user account or IP address so you don't have to worry about misspellings or getting the wrong IP address.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{split}}

The [[w:Koran|Koran]] is the [[w:Islam|Islamic]] holy book, and contains extensive descriptions and claims regardings &quot;Sunnatullah&quot;, which roughly translates to the English &quot;Law of Nature&quot;. The Koranic Law of Nature expounds the Islamic view of the universe and how it was notionally created and is maintained by [[w:Allah|Allah]], the Islamic supreme being.

Many scholars of Islam assert that the Koranic Law of Nature states properties of the universe that have only recently been discovered by the modern scientific process, predating some discoveries by up to 1400 years. Furthermore, many scholars will go as far as to claim that the Koranic version is more correct than the versions found in alternative religions' texts. The Koran, like many religious texts, is open to varying interpretation, and therefore one cannot simply state the veracity or fallacy of the claims therein.

This book aims to demonstrate how the Koran presents these claims and discusses the various interpretations that have been made over the centuries by Islamic scholars, and relates these discussions to the counterparts from other religions, as well as the standings of the claims relative to modern and historical scientific and philosophical opinion. The relationship between the Koranic Law of Nature and the Christian and Jewish Laws of Nature is of particular interest, due to these Abrahamic religions having much common ancestry.

The apparent agreement of certain interpretations of the Koran to modern science is also of interest, however one should bear in mind that it is easy to find the interpretation that fits current opinion and ignore others. Likewise it is easy to formulate an interpretation ''a posteriori'', picking only the parts that appear in agreement and claiming flawless prediction when, in fact, the correlation is bound to occur because it has been created by the interpreter to meet that precise end!

It is the aim of this book to present the claims of the Koran with a neutral point-of-view, that is, neither endorsing nor condemning any side of any argument, unless that argument can be shown to be unequivocally right or wrong. Contribution to this book is encouraged, but vandalism (such as removing passages that you do not agree with) and false or unsubstantiated additions will be removed. The subject matter of this book is highly sensitive to some people and contributions should be measured and verifiable. If in doubt, ask on the [[Talk:Koranic_Law_of_Nature|discussion page]] before making edits.

== The Creation of Universe ==
=== Gaseous Mass to Heavens &amp; Earth ===

''Then He settled to the heaven, while it was still '''smoke''', and He said to it, and to the Earth: &quot;Come willingly or unwillingly.&quot; They said: &quot;We come willingly.&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/41#9-18 | 41:11]])

Koran claims that this universe was a gaseous mass before it forms planets and galaxies.

=== Fusing &amp; Separating, Big Bang ===

''Did those who reject not see that the heavens and the Earth were '''one piece''' and We '''tore them apart'''? And that We made from the water everything that lives. Will they not believe?'' ([[s:Quran/21#30-41 | 21:30]])

the Koran claims that the universe was fused into one piece before expanding and separating.

=== Avoiding the Mistake of Genesis ===

The universe is not created in sequence, as mentioned in the Bible in the Book of Genesis. Book of Genesis believes that the Sun was created in the fourth day. This is strange because vegetables/plants which need the sun were created earlier. Koran does not support such sequence.

=== 6 Days or Periods of Creation ===

''And We have created the heavens and the Earth and what is between them in '''six days''', and '''no fatigue''' touched Us.'' ([[s:Quran/50#30-45 | 50:38]])

The Quranic vocabulary used to describe the length of time is nearly identical in pronunciation to the Hebrew word for day, &quot;yom.&quot;
However, the Arabic context in which it is used in the opening chapter of the Islamic scripture denotes an indefinite period of time. Contemporary English does not place a definitive upper bound on such temporal terminology; for example, the well-known colloquial phrase &quot;back in my day&quot; isn't intended to mean some twenty-four hours. In conclusion, the creation of our planet may have taken a thousand or 50,000 human years or neither.  

''God is the One who created the heavens and the Earth, and everything between them '''in six days''', then He settled to the Throne. You do not have beside Him any Lord, nor intercessor. Will you not then remember? 	He arranges matters from the heaven to the Earth, then it ascends to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''one thousand of the years''' which you count.'' ([[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:4-5]])

''The Angels and the Spirit ascent to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''fifty thousand years'''.'' ([[s:Quran/70#1-35 | 70:4]])

All of the preceding verses are infused with God's natural names, attributes and methodology which never change. He is the Creator, the Ever-Living, the All-Knowing, Irresistible, etc. A comparative analysis with the book of Genesis demonstrates a contrast with the Qu'ranic description of the Creator and the Creation's nature. The second chapter of Genesis alludes to God rested after the creation of the heavens and the earth which is against his/her&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; nature according to the Qu'ran.  

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Note: Since God is genderless in the Qu'ran, any generic pronoun is irrelevant. Regardless, &quot;He&quot; is typically the chosen one in translated scriptural texts used by religions that revere Moses; in Islam, it is out of respect since the Creator is an active force. Academic speculation regarding the English usage of the pronoun &quot;he&quot; in reference to the Almighty Lord holds that it may stem from many hundreds of years past in which women had very few rights in religious matters and society as a whole.

=== Organization of the Universe ===

''The sun and the moon are '''perfectly calculated'''.'' ([[s:Quran/55#1-25 | 55:5]])

''For you (God) subjected the sun and the moon, both diligently '''pursuing their courses'''.'' ([[s:Quran/14#28-34 | 14:33]])

''And He committed for you the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, and the stars are '''committed by His command'''. In that are signs for a people who comprehend.'' ([[s:Quran/16#10-21 | 16:12]])

the Koran claims that this universe is perfectly organized.

== The Earth ==  
=== What Shape is the Earth? ===

''Have you not seen that God merges the night into the day and '''merges''' the day into the night, and that He has committed the sun and the moon, each running to a predetermined term; and that God is expert of everything you do?'' ([[s:Quran/31#20-30 | 31:29]])

''He created the heavens and the Earth with truth. He '''rolls''' the night over the day, and He '''rolls''' the day over the night. And He committed the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. Absolutely, He is the Noble, the Forgiving.'' ([[s:Quran/39#1-9 | 39:5]])

the Koran implies that the Earth is a rolling/round sphere.

=== Expansion of the Universe ===

''And We constructed the universe using matter, and We will '''expand''' it.'' ([[s:Quran/51#47-60 | 51:47]])

the Koran claims that the Universe is currently expanding.

=== How Many Earths are There? ===

''God who created seven universes and '''the same number of Earths'''. His command descends between them, that you may know that God is capable of all things, and that God has encompassed all things with His knowledge.'' (65:12)

the Koran claims that currently there are many Earth-like planets.

=== The origin of life in water ===

''Did those who reject not see that the heavens and the Earth were one piece and We tore them apart? And that We made '''from the water''' everything that lives. Will they not believe?'' ([[s:Quran/21#30-41 | 21:30]])

''And God created every moving creature '''from water'''. So some of them move on their bellies, and some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. God creates whatever He wills. God is capable of all things.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:45]])

the Koran claims that all living things where created out of water as a component.

=== What Holds up the Sky? ===

''And He '''raised the sky''' and He established '''the balance'''.'' ([[s:Quran/55#1-25 | 55:7]])

''... And He '''holds the sky''' so that it would '''not collapse''' upon the Earth, except by His leave. Indeed, God is Kind towards mankind, Merciful.'' ([[s:Quran/22#65-72 | 22:65]])

''He created the skies '''without pillars''' that you can see....'' ([[s:Quran/31#1-11 | 31:10]], also [[s:Quran/13#1-7 | 13:2]]) 

The Koran claims that God supports the sky from falling, without visible pillars.

== The Sky == 

=== Difference between the sun and the moon ===

''&quot;And He made the moon to '''illuminate''' in them, and He made the sun to be '''a lit flame'''?&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/71#1-20 | 71:16]])

the Koran claims that the sun is the source of light in relation to the moons illumination or reflection.

=== Astronomy ===

''And the sun runs to a '''specific destination''', such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable. And the moon We have measured it to '''appear in stages''', until it returns to being like an old curved sheath. The sun is '''not to overtake''' the moon, nor will the night precede the day; each of them is '''swimming in its own orbit'''.'' ([[s:Quran/36#33-50 | 36:38-40]])

the Koran claims that the sun and the moon are swimming in thier own orbits. The Koran claims that the &quot;swimming&quot; has ups and downs and the sun has limited timespan.

=== 'Comets Of Ice' ===

''Do you not see that God '''drives the clouds''', then He '''gathers''' them together, then He '''piles''' them upon each other, then you see the soft '''rain coming''' out of them? And He sends down hail from the sky from the mountains to afflict whomever He wills, and He diverts it from whomever He wills, the brightness of the snow almost blinds the eyes.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:43]])

the Koran claims that rain is formed from the clouds through several stages. But where did the water came from to this Earth originally?

''...He sent down '''from the sky''' water...'' ([[s:QQuran/2#21-29 | 2:22]], also [[s:Quran/14#28-34 | 14:32]] and [[s:Quran/16#61-65 | 16:65]]) 

the Koran claims that originally the water came as a hail or ice comets from the space.

=== Two Easts and Two Wests ===
''...the Lord of the '''east''' and the '''west'''...'' ([[s:Quran/70#36-44 | 70:40]])

''...the Lord of the '''two east''' and the '''two west'''...'' ([[s:Quran/55#1-25 | 55:17]])

''...the distance of the '''two easts'''...'' ([[s:Quran/43#36-45 | 43:38]])

the Koran implies that the sun does not rise and set on single location throughout the season.

=== Interstellar Galactic Material ===

''To Him is what is in the heavens and what is in the Earth, and what is '''in between''', and what is underneath the soil.'' ([[s:Quran/20#1-24 | 20:6]], also [[s:Quran/25#45-60 | 25:59]], [[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:4]] and [[s:Quran/50#30-45 | 50:38]]))

the Koran claims that there are some materials in between galaxies.

=== Sun is swimming in orbit ===
&quot;...the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit.&quot; ([[s:Quran/21#30-41 | 21:33]], also [[s:Quran/36#33-50 |  36:40]]).

the Koran claims that the sun is not fixed in its place.

==Aliens?==

''...and of his signs, the creation of the skies and the earth and the animals that are divided between them, and he can call upon them whenever he wishes.'' ''Shora, ayeye 29''

claiming that there is life spread between the skies (probably space) and the earth.

== Biology ==  
=== The ongoing process of creation ===

''... And He creates what you '''do not know'''.'' ([[s:Quran/16#1-9 | 16:8]])

''... God creates '''whatever He wills'''. God is capable of all things.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:45]])

the Koran implies that God does not stop creating.

=== Embryological &amp; Fetal Development ===

''&quot;While He created you '''in stages'''?&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/71#1-20 | 71:14]])

''And God created you from '''dust''', then from a '''seed''', then He made you into pairs. And no female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth, without His knowledge. Nor does anyone have his life extended, or his life is shortened, except in a record. This is easy for God.'' ([[s:Quran/35#8-14 | 35:11]])

Koran claims that the first man is created from dust and the rest is created from a seed.

''You'' might also mean life and god is referring to Evolution, Bacteria in the earth being ''the earth'', ''seeds'' referring to mushrooms and plants, and ''pairs'' meaning the evolution of males and females. 

''Was he not a seed from '''sperm put forth'''?'' ([[s:Quran/75#31-40 | 75:37]])

''He was created from '''water that gushes forth'''. It comes out from between the spine and the testicles.'' ([[s:Quran/86 | 86:7-8]]) 

''Was there not a time in the past when the human being was nothing to even be mentioned? We have created the human from a '''seed that is mixed''', We test him, so We made him hear and see. '' ([[s:Quran/76#1-22 | 76:1-2]])

''The One who perfected everything He created and He began the creation of the human from mud. Then He made his offspring from a structure derived from a '''lowly liquid'''. Then He evolved him, and blew into him from His spirit. And He made for you the hearing, the eyesight, and the hearts; rarely are you thankful.'' ([[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:7-9]])

the Koran claims that man are created from a small drop of sperm.

''Was he not a seed from sperm put forth? Then he was a clot, so he was created and developed.'' ([[s:Quran/75#31-40 | 75:37-38]]) 

the Koran claims that the first stage of embryological development is comparable to a clot, in shape, in how he clings and in how it draws substance from his host.

''Then We created the seed into an '''embryo''', then We created the embryo into a '''fetus''', then We created the fetus into '''bone''', then We covered the bone with '''flesh''', then We brought forth a '''new creation'''. So glory be to God, the best of creators.'' ([[s:Quran/23#1-22 | 23:14]])

''... then from an embryo, then from a fetus developed and undeveloped so that We make it clear to you. And We settle in the wombs what We wish to an appointed time, then We bring you out a child... '' ([[s:Quran/22#1-10 | 22:5]])

the Koran claims that second stage of embryological development looks like a ragged piece of meat to the naked eye. The later stages is organs development starting with bones. In this stage the development could be uneven.

=== Pollution &amp; wasting natural resources ===

'''''Pollution''' has appeared in '''the land and the sea''' '''by the hands of mankind''' for what they earned. He will make them taste some of what they have done, perhaps they will revert. Say: &quot;Roam the Earth and see how the end was for those before. Most of them had set up partners.&quot; '' ([[s:Quran/30#41-53 | 30:41-42]])

''O Children of Adam, dress nicely at every temple, and eat and drink and '''do not indulge'''; He does not like the indulgers.'' ([[s:Quran/7#26-31 | 7:31]])

the Koran claims that mankind polutes the earth and it is possible to be more environmentally friendly.

=== Clouds Formation ===

''Do you not see that God '''drives the clouds''', then He '''gathers''' them together, then He '''piles''' them upon each other, then you see the soft '''rain coming''' out of them? And He sends down hail from the sky from the mountains to afflict whomever He wills, and He diverts it from whomever He wills, the brightness of the snow almost blinds the eyes.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:43]])

the Koran claims that clouds can form  mountain-size piles in the sky. This gigantic clouds formation creates a supercooled hail which causes electron flows that could produce lighting. This is the first clouds formation capable to produce rain.

''God Who sends the '''winds''', so they '''raise''' clouds, and He '''spreads''' them in the sky as He wishes, then He turns them into '''joined pieces''', then you see the '''rain''' drops come forth from their midst. Then when He makes them fall on whomever He wills of His servants, they rejoice!'' ([[s:Quran/30#41-53 | 30:48]])

the Koran claims that there is a second clouds formation that capable to produce rain which might not capable of producing lighting.

''And if they see a '''spectacle''' from the sky, they will Say: &quot;'''Piled clouds'''!&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/52#29-49 | 52:44]])

the Koran claims that clouds are '''not''' solid as some might think.

=== The Water Cycle ===

''And We '''sent down''' from the sky water in due measure, then We let it '''reside''' in the land, and We are capable of '''taking it away'''.'' ([[s:Quran/23#1-22 | 23:18]])

the Koran claims that rainfall can be absorbed in to the ground and that it can eventually be removed (drained). 

''He '''sent down''' water from the sky, so valleys '''flowed''' according to their capacity...'' ([[s:Quran/13#8-18 | 13:17]])

''Do you not see that God '''sends down '''water from the sky, and causes it to become '''streams through the land''', then He produces with it plants of various colors...'' ([[s:Quran/39#10-21 | 39:21]])

the Koran claims that water moves through surface or underground rivers.

''Have you noted the water you drink? Did '''you''' send it down from the clouds, or was it '''We''' who sent it down?'' ([[s:Quran/56#39-74 | 56:68-69]])

the Koran implies that even the most sophisticated rain-control techniques depends on presence clouds in vicinity and its readiness to produce rain.

''And He is the One who '''merges''' the two bodies of water. This is fresh and palatable and this is salty and bitter. And He made between them a '''partition''' and an '''inviolable barrier'''.'' ([[s:Quran/25#45-60 | 25:53]])

the Koran claims that large rivers has invisible barriers between salt water and fresh water.

=== The diversity of mankind ===

''And from His signs are the creation of the heavens and the Earth, and the difference of your '''languages''' and your '''colors'''. In that are signs for the world.'' ([[s:Quran/30#20-27 | 30:22]])

''O mankind, We created you from a male and female, and We made you into '''nations''' and '''tribes''', that you may know one another. Surely, the most honourable among you in the sight of God is the most righteous. God is Knowledgeable, Expert.'' ([[s:Quran/49#11-18 | 49:13]])

the Koran claims that variation in language, nations and races are inevitable and better to be embraced.

=== The Cerebrum ===


:''Have you seen if he lied and turned away? Did he not know that God can see? Alas, if he does not cease, We will strike the frontal lobe. A frontal lobe which sees and hears.''
::&lt;sub&gt;[96:15]&lt;/sub&gt;

This translation of the Koran appears to claim that the front part of the brain, the [[w:frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] controls the eyes and ears of a man.

:''Seest thou if he denies and turns away? Knows he not that Allah sees? Nay, if he desist not, We will seize him by the forelock - a lying, sinful forelock!''
::[[s:Quran/96 |96:13-16]] The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)

This translation, however, refers to a &quot;forelock&quot;, a lock of hair at the front of the head, rather than a lobe of the brain, and does not make any claims to the function of the lock, but rather the characteristics of lock as an extension of a sinful person.

====Modern scientific evidence====

The regions of the brain responsible for various functions of the human body are relatively well known, due to extensive research and modern imaging techniques which can map activity in the brain for a given action.

The [[w:auditory cortex|auditory cortex]] is the primary centre of the brain responsible for sound processing. It is located in the [[w:temporal lobe|temporal lobes]] on the sides of the brain. It is known to interact with various other areas of the brain, mostly also in the temporal lobe or in the [[w:parietal lobe|parietal lobe]], towards the top of the brain, but one of them, [[w:Broca's area|Broca's area]], is located in the frontal lobe. This area is known to be involved in speech interpretation and production.

The [[w:visual cortex|visual cortex]] is located at the back of the brain, in the [[w:occipital lobe|occipital lobe]]. It strongly interacts along two pathways. The &quot;dorsal stream&quot;, shown in green below, sends the information to the parietal lobe, when the responses to the stimulus, such as movements of the arms or legs, are co-ordinated. The &quot;ventral stream&quot; (purple) sends data to the temporal lobe, where the meaning of the visual data is decoded and objects are recognised. This stream is also associated with the long-term memory of the information.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|[[File:Brain_Surface_Gyri.SVG|300px|thumb|The primary auditory cortex is shown here in pink. It is known to interact with the other shaded areas. Broca's area, in blue, is located at the rear of the frontal lobe.]]
|[[File:Ventral-dorsal_streams.svg|300px|thumb|The primary visual cortex is shown here in blue. The two arrows show the two paths of information through the brain: to the temporal lobe (purple), and to the parietal lobe (green).]]
|}

The frontal lobe of the brain is mostly involved in the ability to recognize future consequences resulting from current actions, to choose between good and bad actions (or better and best), override and suppress unacceptable social responses, and determine similarities and differences between things or events. Therefore, it is involved in higher mental functions, and if frequently implicated in the formation of personality.

====Discussion====

In contrast to the Koranic assertions, modern scientific opinion does not place much value on the function of the frontal lobe with respect to vision and hearing, although some areas of the frontal lobe are used to help process language. However, the argument could be made that &quot;vision&quot; in the Koran refers metaphorically to the foresight of an individual rather than the literal meaning of visual processing.

The function of the frontal lobe in formation of social response could also be seen to be referenced by the &quot;lying and turning away&quot;, in which case the Koran obliquely notes this relationship.

== Physics ==
=== Relativity of Time ===

''He arranges matters from the heaven to the Earth, then it ascends to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''one thousand of the years''' which you count.'' ([[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:5]])

''The Angels and the Spirit ascent to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''fifty thousand years'''.'' ([[s:Quran/70#1-35 | 70:4]])

the Koran implies that time is relative to the speed of moving subject.

== Conclusion ==
The Koran claims that God does exist and actively interacting with humankind through Nature, His Creation. Koran claims that only knowledgable people can recognize it and take advantage of it. 

There are doubts about it, thanks to poor translations and limited number of scientists collectively improving the interpretation of the Koran. Such efforts are possible due to preservations and wide distributions of the original Arabic manuscripts. This book serves as a collection point of their efforts.

Averroës (ibn Rushd) declared, &quot;Truth does not contradict truth but rather is consistent with it and bears witness to it&quot;, thereby dispelling any concerns about the issue of a double truth, one for religion and one for philosophy/science. Where conflict between religion and reason arises, particularly concerning scriptural interpretation, reason's method of demonstration of truth is primary in determining the need for allegorical interpretation of otherwise conflicting explanations.

If God exists, what to do about it? There are at least three alternatives:
# I don't care
# Let's serve Him. Believe in Him and doing good acts is enough. More on this ancient, inclusive and fundamentalist point-of-view in [[Islam Way of Life]].
# Let's worship Him. God is Love. Koran is Guidance. Prophet Muhammad is the most perfect human. More on this modern, exclusive, idealist and official point-of-view in [[Islam Way of Life]].

=== Disclaimer ===
''He is the One who sent down to you the Scripture, from which there are '''firm verses'''; they are the essence of the Scripture; and others which are similar to each other. As for those who have disease in their hearts, they will follow what is '''similar''' from it seeking to '''confuse''', and seeking to derive an '''interpretation'''. But none know its interpretation except God and those who are '''well founded in knowledge''', they Say: &quot;We believe in it, '''all''' is from our Lord.&quot; And none will remember except the people of understanding.'' ([[s:Quran/3#1-9 | 3:7]])

Koran disclaims that it can be used for good intention only, contrary to some people believes. Koran claims that it can be used for bad intentions as well. Fortunately, this bad intention, or to lesser degree bad interpretations and translations, can be exposed overtime by the experts via a consistent and holistic approach. The [[Islam Way of Life]] book is a summary of all '''firm verses''', the essence of the Scripture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arimaa strategy involves straightforward concepts which overlap in complex ways. Very different styles of play remain popular; some players are very aggressive, quickly attacking enemy territory with the aim of taking over one or both of the enemy's home traps. Others prefer to play a &quot;home game&quot;, and try to capture enemy pieces mainly by pulling them down. It is not yet clear what is the optimal balance between offense and defense.

In such an environment, it pays to become somewhat familiar with all of the basic concepts, before focusing on fine detail.  After gaining some experience and seeing different strategies in action, you can revisit this material for a closer reading, and perhaps even bring it up to date.

Wings is probably the only 3D application (besides Nendo that was big inspiration for Wings developers) where you can learn just by using it, because the tools are accessed by right click menus rather than being spread out in toolbars. Only the tools you are currently able to use will be in the right click menu, depending on what selection mode your in. Wings is a box modeling application, which means polygonal modeling that grows out from a primitive object (usually a cube, hence box modeling) where you use four basic actions: move, extrude, scale and rotate. The geometry you create from these actions can be further refined by things like beveling, cutting edges, etc. Wings also has a smoothing function more popularly known as subdividing or sub-d. This not only gives you more geometry by dividing faces in half, but also smooths the shape of your model by rounding corners depending on closeness of edges.

===[[Second Life]]===
Wings can be used to make ''sculpties'' (also known as &quot;sculpted primitives&quot;) in Second Life.  Currently, the best information is in the [http://www.secondlife.com  Second Life] forums. If it becomes wider used, information specific to Second Life should be developed here.

This WikiBook needs a '''table of contents'''. Without it, nobody knows what this WikiBook will encompass. To see an example of how a table of contents should be laid out, see the WikiBook [[Mac OS X Tiger]].

In addition, this WikiBook needs an introduction (in plain english) and needs to be less dense.

See the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Macintosh|WikiProject Macintosh]] oage for more information.

Does &gt;console still work in Tiger? I thought many people were having trouble with it...

Console works alright ...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">David, some good thinking here.
Another component to this is the harsh reality of survival. The human race will be extinct within another 500 years simply because it is rapidly destroying it's host, planet Earth.

A part of the moral redevelopment of the human race needs to take into account the behaviors we have exhibited to create this situation - and then provide an antidote. The keys behaviours that have created such a problem revolve primarily around selfishness and greed. As you have correctly stated elsewhere, our drive to produce more and more personal wealth and accumulation is causing much of our problems. Nature will eventually create balance if we do not take responsibility. The difficulty is getting the incredibly stupid and de-evolving human race to understand, or care about, the long term effects. This must begin by teaching the cause and effect at a very early age in schools and having children take it upon themselves to make a difference.

I put this in discussion because it really does need some discussion on methodologies before it is enshrined in the book. Garyj

* Yes, Garyj: teaching children at a very early age will certainly help to indoctrinate beliefs and behaviours.
* However, adults must first agree that this is a desired thing to do, then decide what to teach. I think that an adult-formed, long term goal comes first; then what practices to follow may come second. (A goal provides a guiding focus, can help to formulate strategies toward reaching that gaol, and then help to decide what behaviours to follow. Many of which, I assume, would include teaching the behaviours The Fellowship of Peace endorses.) [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 18:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

Absolutely! The trick is to develop a group of parents that has the ear of governments and the education authorities. The project will unfortunatly need to be presented to governments pretty much as a business plan, since it will be the money involved in educating populations that will carry the day. Strong lobbying of political parties (and or starting a party) will be necessary?

Gary

*Yes, Gary. I think that strong lobbying (and lots of finance) will be needed! [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 21:39, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You can sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* Check out our [[Wikibooks:Help|help]] page if you need additional help.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
* See [[Wikibooks:Template messages|list of templates]] which can save your time
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

Good luck! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

==Naming policy==
Please read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and rename [[Algebra I- For the Rest of Us]]. If you have any questions, leave a message on my talk page. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

==Welcome Again==

Welcome, and I mean this sincerly, welcome to Wikibooks.  It is fantastic to see somebody like you to come here and try to take on the incredibly huge task of trying to write a textbook.  And to take on a subject like Algebra!  This is something that really does need to be accomplished.

Take some time to poke around here on Wikibooks as well.  Excuse some of the messes that you will find, and it is still a little bit confusing to people not quite familiar with Wikimedia projects.  While Wikibooks is over three years old now, we have recently experienced a huge increase in just about every sort of number you can use to measure websites like this, and we are showing those growing pains as well.  If you need some advise, feel free to contact any one of [[Wikibooks:Administrators|the project administrators]] for some help.  They are all experienced users and are here to help people like you to succeed.

One reason I'm dropping a line to you is that you recently deleted a page by removing the content.  Don't worry, I understand that you are new here, but for future reference I would like to encourage you to instead use a special markup symbol that we call a template tag.  The specific tag for removing content is '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', where you replace the word reason with the justification for removing the content.  The bracket symbols (&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;) indicate a special command or a template that the Wiki software will insert into the text at the point you put this into text you are editing here.  All content on Wikibooks and similar project must be manually deleted as we don't trust a computer to be able to make accurate judgement calls to remove content like this, and only an administrator can really delete content.  The reasons for this is to keep potential mischief makers from really messing things up, but allow some trusted individuals to help keep things under control.

I hope that your experience here on Wikibooks is productive and I also hope to see more of your contributions soon!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:50, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

== Management Is The Key To Success ==

If you give yourself a goal or objective and you want to seriously contribute towards it, then the first thing you'll want to do is manage what to do first. Management is the key to success, no matter what you are trying to achieve. Management in simple terms is a noun that is related to the word &quot;manage&quot; which means:

''1. To direct or be in charge of.''

''2. To handle or control, to force.''

''3. To succeed at an attempt.'' 

In a computer, you sometimes defragment your hard drive in order to arrange the data so it can be accessed easily. This is similar to management. Project management is another type of management and so on. Management is not always on the same scale, sometimes at a bigger level there will be times when certain tasks become increasingly difficult, especially in such demanding environments such as the workplace. You may find that you will spend a large amount of your life worrying about these issues. Effective management can greatly reduce this stress.

Management for students is different from management for working adults. Students manage not only their routine but their behavior and many other responsibilities. Fortunately, these things are not as demanding as they are for adults, and a student has ample time to sort out a plan.

== Types and Methods of Management ==

There are various kinds of management:

'''1.) Crisis Management'''

Management done at a critical moment with quickness and accuracy.
e.g. If somebody attacks you, your body will need to quickly react by taking in the surroundings and deciding on a course of action. This type of life-threatening problem will probably not occur too often, but there are other types of crises which may provoke similar reactions out of your body, even if they are not needed. Do you ever feel that sinking feeling in your heart when you have a lot of assignments due at once? That is a type of problem which your body will react to in a similar way to a life-threatening danger. Your body's reaction is rarely needed when this happens, so it is best to avoid it altogether. Stress management and also long-term management will help to prevent this.

'''2.) Life Management'''

A form of long-term management which occurs on a daily, weekly, or even yearly basis. Some people refer to this as a 'routine', and that's the general idea behind life management. Organizing events into a predictable schedule may not sound very exciting, but it makes it easier to tackle one problem at a time. For this kind of management you may want a calendar which you can write on so that you can mark all of the important obstacles in your life, and work around them.

'''3.) Project/Task Management'''

Management done to complete a certain task. In your school you may be required to write an assignment on a certain topic, which may be due by the end of the week. When you are working on it, you will need to figure out what to do, what order to do it in, and the amount of time you should allocate to each smaller task.

Management becomes much easier when you are relaxed and able to sit back and outline what should be done. If you are tired you may find this difficult, so remember to get lots of rest at night, and also practice those relaxation techniques we showed you earlier. Your mind works much like a computer. It prefers information to be in an orderly fashion, this is why your brain rearranges itself while you sleep. You can make things a lot easier for your mind if you order things before you put them in. This is why planning is so useful for getting work done.

===1. Crisis Management===

===2. Life Management===

===3. Project/Task Management===
In order to produce an exceptional Project, it's helpful to ask these six questions. If you want, you can put them on a piece of paper to use as your plan.

'''1. &quot;What is the task I need to complete?&quot;'''

If you don't know where you're going, you won't arrive where you need to be.  For example: I need to write a 5-page paper on Environmental Pollution. Write this at the top of your paper.

'''2. &quot;What information do I need?&quot;'''

If your paper is on Environmental Pollution, you need to find out what types of pollution there are and collect details about the subject. Now would be a good time to plan subheadings for your plan so that you know exactly what areas of the topic you are going to cover. For example:


''What is pollution?''

This will introduce your topic in general. Normally you would want something more catchy than this.


''What kinds of pollution are there?''

This will make your topic more specific, and zoom in on what you want to cover. This is where you will introduce 'Environmental Pollution'.


''Dealing with environmental pollution.'''

One of your focus questions. There may be thousands of possible focus questions for each topic. Choose the ones that interest you most. Here are some other focus questions:

''  The future impacts of environmental pollution.''

''  The impact of environmental pollution on animals.''

''The impact of environmental pollution on global warming.''


If you are lucky, a teacher will let you choose these focus questions yourself, but sometimes you will be given a list that you must choose from. In this case it is not a good idea to go for the most interesting one, as everyone else will go for that. Instead, go for the most difficult one. I assure you, the teacher will appreciate reading something different after reading twenty essays on the same topic, and will award you with good grades, even if your essay wasn't as good as the others.

'''3.  &quot;What are the resources I have at my disposal to complete my task?&quot;'''

You might use the Internet, library, magazines, or go to a book store.  Maybe one of your friends works at a water treatment Plant. You could interview this friend.  Many other sources of help are usually available: teachers or supervisors may be able to direct you to helpful sources. Remember, teachers will reward creativity, and an essay with quotes from your friend who works at a water treatment plant will most definitely get very good marks, as it will be something different from all of the other essays that teachers are forced to sit through.

'''4.  &quot;What is the end product going to look like?&quot;'''

Is it a presentation, a written paper, a website, a physical construction like a model?  What were the teacher's / supervisor's guidelines on this assignment?  If the directions were not clear, this is the time to go back and ask questions.

'''5.  &quot;Now that I have the information, what do I do with it?&quot;'''

Take notes, make a chart, highlight, collect citation information. In essence, you have everything you need. Anything from now on will just build on from what you have collected.

'''6.  Evaluate the product before turning it in / presenting it.'''

&quot;Does it meet the requirements that were given to me?&quot;  If something was left out, fix it before submitting it. Remember to proof-read your work. I assure you that you will have made at least a couple a spelling errors somewhere in your work. Reading over your work, even just skim-reading, will help you to find and remove those small errors.

For more information and tips on studying, have a look at the [[Study_Skills]] Wikibook.


That's enough management for now as a student. Now let's learn to help others and advise them next.

One of the things I am noticing is that we are getting some variations in the enabling objectives across the courses. We may want to think of a way to standardize these. Great job on creating them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">First remove at least the seconds and minute hands, the hour hand if desired.  

Timex dials are usually held with tabs that bend over the movement plate.  Lift the tabs as little as possible. 

Some inexpensive pinlevers have tiny screws on the edge of the face. 
[[Image:BwcDialScrew02678.jpg]]

Most good watches will have two dial feet or posts with some sort of screw to retain them.  

A common method on Swiss watches is a cam screw--this will have a very tall head, and a sharp ridge between the threads and the head.  There is a flat removed from the ridge.  These will be screwed in until almost snug, with the flat lined up with the dial hole.  The dial is installed, then these screws are backed out--The ridge will bite into the dial foot, and backing the screw out will tighten the dial. To remove, turn clockwise until the flat aligns with the post.
[[Image:BwcDialscrew2676.jpg]]

The screws may be simple setscrews around the edge--Sometimes straight in towards the center, sometimes at an angle. 
[[Image:BwcDialscrew2674.jpg]]

 

A third, commonly found on Japanese watches is a cam near the edge.  This will be pried away from the foot. (Picture will come later)

*[[/Questions#Hexadecimal|Questions]]
As you know, the number system we normally count in is '''base 10''', and the number system that computers use, binary, is '''base 2'''. '''Hexadecimal''' is a '''base 16''' number system. In hexadecimal, the numbers 0-9 are used, just like in denary, but the letters A-F are also used to represent the numbers 10-15. The table below shows the numbers 0-16 in denary, and their binary and hexadecimal equivalents:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Hexadecimal !! Binary !! Denary
|-
| 0 || 0000 ||  0
|-
| 1 || 0001 ||  1
|-
| 2 || 0010 ||  2
|-
| 3 || 0011 ||  3
 |-
| 4 || 0100 ||  4
|-
| 5 || 0101 ||  5
|-
| 6 || 0110 ||  6
|-

| E || 1110 || 14
|-
| F || 1111 || 15
|-
| 10 || 10000 || 16
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

You may notice from the table that one hexadecimal digit can represent exactly 4 binary bits. Hexadecimal is useful to us as a shorthand way of writing binary, and makes it easier to work with long binary numbers.

===Converting Between Bases===

Since 4 binary bits are represented by one hexadecimal digit, it is simple to convert between the two. You can group binary bits into groups of 4, starting from the right, and adding extra 0's to the left if required, and then convert each group to their hexadecimal equivalent. For example, the number 110110011110101 can be written like this:

0110 1100 1111 0101

and then by using the table above, you can convert each group of 4 bits into hexadecimal:

6 C F 5.

So the binary number 0110110011110101 is 6CF5 in hexadecimal. We can check this by converting both to denary. First we'll convert the binary number, since you already know how to do this:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!32768 ||16384 ||8192 ||4096 ||2048 ||1024 ||512 ||256 ||128 ||64 ||32 ||16 ||8 ||4 ||2 ||1
|-
|0 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||1 ||0 ||1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

By multiplying the columns and then adding the results, the answer is 27893.

Notice that the column headings are all 2 raised to a power, &lt;math&gt;1 = 2^0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2 = 2^1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4 = 2^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;8 = 2^3&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. To convert from hexadecimal to denary, we must use column headings that are powers with the base 16, like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!&lt;math&gt;16^3=&lt;/math&gt;4096 ||&lt;math&gt;16^2=&lt;/math&gt;256 ||&lt;math&gt;16^1=&lt;/math&gt;16 ||&lt;math&gt;16^0=&lt;/math&gt;1
|-
||6 ||C ||F ||5
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5 \times 1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;15 \times 16 = 240&lt;/math&gt; (You should memorize the values A-F)

&lt;math&gt;12 \times 256 = 3072&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;6 \times 4096 = 24576&lt;/math&gt;

Totalling them all up gives us 27893, showing that 0110110011110101 is equal to 6CF5.

To convert from denary to hexadecimal, it is recommended to just convert the number to binary first, and then use the simple method above to convert from binary to hexadecimal.

:''NOTE: Hexadecimal is used as it is easier for people to understand than pure binary.  It '''DOES NOT''' take up less space in memory, only on paper!''

==Negative Binary Numbers==
*[[/Questions#Negative Binary Numbers|Questions]]
A computer works purely in binary. That means that it only uses ones and zeros, and there's no - or + symbol that the computer can use. The computer must represent negative numbers in a different way.

===Twos Complement===
We can represent a negative number in binary by making the most significant bit a '''sign bit''', which will tell us whether the number is positive or negative. The column headings for an 8 bit number will look like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!-128 ||64 ||32 ||16 ||8 ||4 ||2 ||1
|-
|1 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Here, the most significant bit is negative, and the other bits are positive. You start with -128, and add the other bits as normal. The example above is -67 in denary. -1 in binary is 11111111.

Note that you only use the most significant bit as a sign bit if the number is specified as '''signed'''. If the number is '''unsigned''', then the msb is positive.

===Converting Negative Numbers===
To find out the value of a two's complement number we must first make note of its sign bit (the most significant, left most bit).  If 0 then the number is positive, if 1 then the number is negative. 

 '''0'''000 0101 (positive)
 '''1'''111 1011 (negative)

To find the value of the negative number we must find and keep the right most 1 and all bits to its right, and then flip everything to its left.  Here is an example:

 1111 101'''1''' find the right most one
 
 '''1111 101'''1 
 '''0000 010'''1 flip all the bits to its left

We can now work out the value of this new number which is:

 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1 
   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   1
                       4   +   1 = &amp;minus;5   ('''remember the sign you worked out earlier!''')

How about a more complex example?

 1111 1'''1'''00 find the right most one
 
 '''1111 1'''100
 '''0000 0'''100 flip all the bits to its left

 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1 
   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0
                       4         = &amp;minus;4   ('''remember the sign you worked out earlier!''')


So we know how to work out the value of a negative number that has been given to us.  How do we go about working out the negative version of a positive number?  Like this, that's how...

Take the binary version of the positive number

 0000 0101 (5)
 0000 010'''1''' find the right most one
 
 '''0000 010'''1 
 '''1111 101'''1 flip all the bits to its left

So now we can see the difference between a positive and a negative number

 '''0'''000 0101 (5)
 '''1'''111 1011 (&amp;minus;5)

===Binary Subtraction===
When it comes to subtracting one number from another in binary things can get very messy.
 X (82 denary) 0101 0010
 Y (78 denary) 0100 1110 &amp;minus;

An easier way to subtract Y from X is to ''add'' the negative value of Y to the value of X
 X&amp;minus;Y = X+(&amp;minus;Y)

To do this we first need to find the negative value of Y

 0100 11'''1'''0 find the right most one
 
 '''0100 11'''10 
 '''1011 00'''10 flip all the bits to its left

Now try the sum again
    0101 0010     X( 82 denary) 
    1011 0010 +   Y(&amp;minus;78 denary)
    0000 0100
 (¹)¹¹¹   ¹       the one carried over the bit 9 is ignored

Which comes out as
 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1 
   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0
                       4         = 4 = 82-78

==Binary Fractions==
*[[/Questions#Binary_Fractions|Questions]]
Up until now, we have only been working with whole numbers, or '''integers'''. We need a way to store '''real numbers''' on a computer system.

===Fixed Point Numbers===
First, we should have a look at one of the ways that we can represent fractions in denary:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!10 ||1 || ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{10}&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{100}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|1 ||2 ||. ||7 ||5
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

As you can see, the column headings have been extended to &lt;math&gt;10^{-1}=\frac {1}{10}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{-2}=\frac {1}{100}&lt;/math&gt;. We can do the same thing in binary with the column headings &lt;math&gt;2^{-1}=\frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2^{-2}=\frac {1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. The number 12.75 in binary is therefore:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!8 ||4 ||2 ||1 || ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|1 ||1 ||0 ||0 ||. ||1 ||1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Notice that for the same number of bits after the point, the binary number is less accurate. It can only take 4 different values, whereas the denary number can have 100 different divisions with two digits.

===Floating Point Numbers===

If you study other subjects such as Physics or Chemistry, you may come across Floating Point numbers like this
  &lt;math&gt;6.63_{10} \times 10^{-34}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]])
The first bit defines the non-zero part of the number and is called the '''Mantissa''', the second part defines how many positions we want to move the decinal point, this is known as the '''Exponent''' and can be positive when moving the decimal point to the right and negative when moving to the left.
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \underbrace{6.63} \\ Mantissa \end{matrix} \times \begin{matrix}  \underbrace{10^{-34}} \\ Exponent \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If you wanted to write out that number in full you would have to move the decimal point in the exponent 34 places to the left, resulting in:
 &lt;math&gt;0.00\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;663_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
Which would take a lot of time to write and is very hard for the human eye to see how many zeros there are.  There for, when we can accept a certain level of accuracy (6.63 = 3 significant figures), we can store a many digit number like planks constant in a small number of digits.  You are always weighing up the scope (or range) of the number against its accuracy (number of significant bits).

The same is true with binary numbers and is even more important.  When you are dealing with numbers and their computational representation you must always be aware of how much space the numbers will take up in memory.  As we saw with the above example, the non floating point representation of a number can take up an unfeasible number of digits, imagine how many digits you would need to store.
&lt;math&gt;0.00\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;663_{10}&lt;/math&gt; in binary?  (don't worry this question is rhetorical)

A binary floating point number may consist of 2, 3 or 4 bytes, however the only ones you need to worry about are the 2 byte (16 bit) variety.  The first 10 bits are the Mantissa, the last 6 bits are the exponent.

&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\overbrace{0}^\text{sign bit} \cdot 101010101}_\text{mantissa} \times \underbrace{010101}_\text{exponent}&lt;/math&gt;

Just like the denary floating point representation, a binary floating point number will have a mantissa and an exponent, though as you are dealing with binary (base 2) you must remember that that instead of having &lt;math&gt;\times 10^{xy}&lt;/math&gt; you will have to use &lt;math&gt;\times 2^{xy}&lt;/math&gt;



Fixed point binary allows a computer to hold fractions but due to its nature is very limited in its scope. Even using 4 bytes to hold each number, with 8 bits for the fractional part after the point, the largest number that can be held is just over 8 million. Another format is needed for holding very large numbers. 

In decimal, very large numbers can be shown with a mantissa and an exponent. i.e. 0.12² Here the 0.12 is the mantissa and the ² is the exponent. the mantissa holds the main digits and the exponents defines where the decimal point should be placed.

The same technique can be used for binary numbers. For example two bytes could be split so that 10 bits are used for the mantissa and the remaining 6 for the exponent. This allows a much greater scope of numbers to be used.

There are several stages to take when working out a floating point number in binary.  In fact it is much like a disco dance routine - known on this page as the Noorgat Dance, Kemp variation (but you wont be tested on name but it should help you to remember)
#'''Sign''' - find the sign of the mantissa (make a note of this)
#'''Slide''' - find the value of the exponent and whether it is positive or negative
#'''Bounce''' - move the decimal the distance the exponent asks, left for a negative exponent, right for a positive 
#'''Flip''' - If the mantissa is negative perform twos complement on it
#'''Swim''' - starting at the decimal point work out the values of the mantissa.  Now make sure you refer back to the sign you recorded on the sign move.

Lets try it out.  We are given the following 16 bit floating point number, with 10 bits for the mantissa, and 6 bits for the exponent.  Remember the decimal point is between the first and second most significant bits
 &lt;math&gt;0100\;0000\;0000\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
The first action we need to perform is the '''sign''', find out the sign of the exponent
 &lt;math&gt;\underline{0}.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 It is 0 so the mantissa is positive
The second step in the Noorgat dance is the '''slide''', we need to find the value of the exponent, that is the last 6 bits of the number
 &lt;math&gt;0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;\underline{00\;0001}&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 32 &amp; 16 &amp; 8 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
 So we know that the exponent is of size positive one and we will have to move the decimal point 
 one place to the right.
The third step in the Noorgat dance is the '''bounce''' that is moving the decimal point of the Mantissa the number of positions specified by the slide, which was one position to the right.  Like so:
 &lt;math&gt;0.\vec 1 00\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;01.00\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
The fourth step is the optional '''flip'''.  Check back to the sign stage and see if the Mantissa is negative.  It isn't? Oh well you can skip past this stage then as we only flip the number if the mantissa is negative.

The fifth and final step is the '''swim'''.  Taking the mantissa on its own we can now work out the value of the floating point number.  Start at the centre and label each number to the left &lt;math&gt;1, 2, 4, 8, 16&lt;/math&gt; and so on.  The each number on the right &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{8}\frac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt; and so on.
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; . &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{4} &amp; \frac{1}{8} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; . &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} = 1 = 0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 
 Voila! the answer is 1

==Normalising Numbers==
When dealing with Floating point numbers in binary you must make sure that the first two bits are different.  That is:
 &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;1.0&lt;/math&gt;
And most definitely '''NOT'''
 &lt;math&gt;1.1&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;0.0&lt;/math&gt;
This is because we must make sure the space we are using is being used the greatest efficiency.  For instance if we take a denary floating point number such as
  &lt;math&gt;6.63_{10} \times 10^{-34}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]])
If we were to rewrite it as:
  &lt;math&gt;0.0663_{10} \times 10^{-32}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]])
Then you can see the representation takes up an extra 2 characters, the two extra 0's, even though it represents exactly the same number.  This may be acceptable when you are not worried about how many characters a number makes up, but in binary and with computers the space that numbers take up is very important, and we need the most efficient representation we can. With a fixed number of bits, a normalised representation of a number will display the number to the greatest accuracy possible. '''You must make sure that your normalisation does not change the sign of the mantissa. '''Taking a binary floating point number:
 &lt;math&gt;0.010\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0011&lt;/math&gt;
We can see that the number starts with &lt;math&gt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;.  We need to change this to &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt; for it be normalised.  To do this we need to move the decimal place one position to the right, and to retain the same number represented by the unnormalised number we need to change the exponent accordingly.  With a movement one place right to normalise the number we need to change the exponent to move the decimal point one place left to compensate.  Thus negating one from the current exponent.
 &lt;math&gt;0.010\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0010&lt;/math&gt;
To make sure you have normalised it correctly, check that
 &lt;math&gt;0.010\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0010 = 0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0011&lt;/math&gt;
Lets try a more complicated example:
 &lt;math&gt;1.110\;0000\;00\;\mid\;11\;1110&lt;/math&gt;
To get the mantissa normalised we need to move the decimal point two places to the right.  To maintain the same value as the original floating point number we need to adjust the exponent to be two smaller.
 &lt;math&gt;1.000\;0000\;00\;\mid\;11\;1100&lt;/math&gt;
Now check that the new normalised value has the same value as the original.

      <comment>Mac OS X Tiger Story</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey John...

I agree that my story on the Mac OS X Tiger page wasn't as good as it could have been... no offense taken that you reverted it (I helped write the original one). However, I think the original one has a bit too much info in it. I'm going to write another new one and over the course of a few days, try to get it up to snuff. So don't re-revert it until, say, February. 


Thanks,

Np. Go ahead and edit the story, but make sure you keep it short and to-the-point. I just want it to be concise, well-balanced, and jargon-free. [[User:Hyperpasta|Hyperpasta]] 16:34, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

{{Subpages}}


When developing training materials, the critical element is the learning objective. The ''learning objective'' defines the outcome or the result of the training or lesson. If you were to think of a course as a bicycle wheel. You have components of it: the tire, the rim, the spokes, and the shaft. All must work together for the wheel to turn. However, everything is centered around the shaft of the wheel. In this analogy, the shaft is the learning objective. No matter how well the other parts work, if the shaft doesn't work then the wheel is ineffective. Much like the bicycle shaft, the learning objective is critical and imperative to the rest of the training. Understanding this, we look at how to develop a learning objective.



== Types of Learning Objectives ==

There are two primary types of learning objectives we will be working with:

*Terminal Objective: The outcome or the final product. What should the student &quot;look like&quot; when the training is complete? What should they be able to?
*Enabling Objective: Defines the steps to accomplishing the terminal objective. How is the terminal objective going to be accomplished?

== Components and Developing a Learning Objective ==

Working on the assumption that we are utilizing the [[w:Instructional Systems Design|Instructional Systems Design]] model for course development, creating learning objectives does not have to be a complex process. While there are many models to follow, and one should look for one that best suits their style, the simplest to work with is the C-B-S model. The C-B-S model follows the format:

*(C)Condition- Under what circumstances or ''conditions'' should the student perform the task.

*(B)Behavior- Specifically explains what task the student should be able to do.

*(S)Standard- To what level of proficiency should the student perform the task.


Utilizing an example from the [[Wikiversity:School of Fire and Emergency Management/Fire Officer IV|Fire Officer IV]] course:

''Terminal Objective: Given appropriate community demographic data, appraise the department's human resource demographics to determine if the recruitment, selection, and placement of human resources is effective and consistent with law and current best practices.''


Our objective is sectioned as follows:

*Condition: ''Given appropriate community demographic data...''

*Behavior: ''...appraise the department's human resource demographics...'' 

*Standard: ''...to determine if the recruitment, selection, and placement of human resources is effective and consistent with law and current best practices.''

== Conclusions ==

Developing learning objectives does not have to be complex nor a complicated process. However, consistency and comprehension is important.

In all subjects, please add a 'Scope' section with a legal disclaimer.  Also, add links to the 1L study guide, wikiversity school of law, and a link to US Law.

The preliminary work should be in outlining the topic.  In depth discussion of the topics of the outline should be limited and very broad.  

Also, a request for legal accuracy is requested.  Proper citation formatting according to ALWD is requested.  Thus, it is recommended that a copy of ALWD, a reliable reference on the topic of law is in front of you (computer screen or book) as you are writing.  Try to avoid broad, over-reaching statements like &quot;past consideration cannot be used as consideration&quot;.  This is true, in general.  There are exceptions such as promises to pay a past debt.  A more correct statement would be &quot;past consideration is generally not part of an enforceable contract, however, there are exceptions&quot;.

Contributions are appreciated, but please be accurate and precise.  If there is a dispute on the subject matter, please discuss prior to changing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==England/British Empire/United Kingdom (English)==

Leader at 1901: Prime Minister Marquess of Salisbury and King Edward VII

Color: Dark Blue or Pink, in some versions (webDiplomacy.net, etc.)

Neighbors: France, Germany, Russia

Home supply centers: London, Liverpool, Edinburgh

England's defensive position is the strongest in the game besides Turkey, and landing an army on the British Isles will usually require at least three units--one convoyed army, one fleet to convoy, and one fleet to support the convoy.  England's &quot;back door&quot; in the North Atlantic is, however, much more difficult to defend than Turkey's back door in Syria.  England's position as an island means that it will have to maintain a large navy in order to achieve victory.  England's position causes a bottleneck similar but less severe than the one Turkey faces, because sea routes can get troops quickly from the home centers to the Mediterranean to Germany to St. Petersburg.

England has a limited choice of centers to make 18.  Most simply, three home, Bre and Par, Bel, Hol, Den, Swe, Nwy, StP, Kie, and Ber are the 13 easiest, leaving 5 centers to get out of Spa, Por, Tun, Mun, Mar, Mos, and War.  Mos and War are very difficult to get without German or Turkish help, and any centers further south are possible only with an extremely committed French ally.

==Opening Strategy==

England can choose between commitment to an attack against France or to calmly pick up builds from Norway and possibly Belgium, and wait for 1902 to choose a side.

==18 Center Goal==

3 home centers, Scandinavia, St. Petersburg, The Low Countries, Kiel, Berlin, Brest, Paris, and Iberia makes 15.  Then three out of Munich, Marseilles, Tunis, Moscow, and Warsaw are required to convert to a victory.  Any other supply centers are much too far away to be part of a normal victory--although once in a while, England will break into Italy or capture Sevastopol.

England's main choice is where to send her two fleets.

===F LON - ENG, F EDI - NTH (Southern Opening)===
Provides the best anti-French possibilities.
====Wales Variation====
A LPL - WAL

Unequivocally anti-French. This move is risky, as failure to acquire the Channel in the spring will make this army useless in the autumn. Useful only when you expect to acquire the Channel, this move provides the strongest set of moves for a French campaign, as the army may be convoyed to Brest or Picardy (usually while NTH acquires Norway) OR may be used in a supported convoy to Belgium.

====Yorkshire Variation====
A LPL - YOR

A much safer prospect than the Wales Variation, and similarly less profitable as an anti-French maneuver. This opening is the opening of choice for an England only wishing to bounce in the Channel, as the army may then be convoyed to Norway or to Belgium. As an offensive opening, the Channel pressures the French homeland while providing support for a convoy to Belgium... or, perhaps, the opportunity to claim Norway with a convoy and Belgium with a fleet!

===F LON - NTH, F EDI - NWG (Northern Opening)===
====Yorkshire Variation (AKA &quot;The Churchill Opening&quot;)====
A LPL - YOR

The soundest opening from the classical perspective of maximizing minimum gains, this is the only English opening that guarantees a build against all opposition. In brighter times, one may convoy with support to Norway or convoy to Belgium and claim Norway with a fleet; if France, Germany and Russia are determined to stop you, Yorkshire can cover London when France moves to the English Channel, and Norwegian Sea can support North Sea to Norway despite a Russian move Mos -&gt; Stp -&gt; Nor (though a German in this case would seize the North Sea, F Kie -&gt; Den -&gt; NTH; whether or not this is desirable is up for debate).

====Edinburgh Variation====
A LPL - EDI

This opening sacrifices the ability to cover London for more convoying options in the autumn. For an England looking for two builds in a favorable diplomatic situation, this allows for Norway to be captured with an army and Belgium/Holland/Denmark with a fleet. London may still be covered by the North Sea, but Norway cannot be secured against Russian resistance if this happens. This move is superior to the Yorkshire Variation if and only if one guesses correctly on French intentions; if they go to the Channel, a build isn't guaranteed, but if they don't, England's options are greater.

===F LON - ENG, F EDI - NWG (The Splits)===
====Wales Variation====
A LPL - WAL

The anti-French Split opening. If France goes to the Channel, England is in a very awkward position, having a useless army in Wales and facing the possibility of a German fleet standing it out of the North Sea in the autumn.

====Edinburgh Variation====
A LPL - EDI

The pro-French Split opening (or, at least, as pro-French as an opening to the Channel can be). Allows convoy to Norway, with England using the Channel fleet to influence Belgium or pressure Brest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== France/French Third Republic/La Troisième République (French)==

Leader at 1901: President of the Council of Ministers Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau

Color: Light Blue

Neighbors: England, Germany, Italy

Home supply centers: Paris, Brest, Marseilles

France is the easiest country to play.  While not as defensively sound as England or Turkey, France is able to move troops quickly through Europe without the burden of a long convoy chain required by Turkey or England. France also has better ''long-term'' survival prospects than either, since while England and Turkey are often forced into a corner and survive until midgame after a long, hopeless war, if France survives the initial possibility of attack from an England-Germany alliance (or, more rarely, an attack from Italy), they can do very well in the mid- and late-games (France has very high end-survival and draw records, as well as a fair amount of wins).  Iberia provides two quick and easy builds early, and profitable alliances can be undertaken with either England or Germany, or both. However, England is not suggested, since England has a better chance of stabbing than Germany or Italy does.

==18 Center Goal==

France has a much greater choice of winning combinations than England.  France is also stronger for being able to build fleets on both sides of the MAO bottleneck--although even this is sometimes not enough to break a stalemate in TYS necessary to grab TUN for a victory.

The most common French winning combination is: 3 home centers, Iberia (2), England (3), the Low Countries (2), Germany (3), Scandinavia (3), St. Petersburg, and one of WAR, MOS, and TUN.

However, France also has a good shot at conquering Italy, especially TUN, ROM, NAP, and possibly VEN if he strikes early.  This allows France to win without getting STP or SWE, and gives France a good foothold across the major stalemate line.

==Opening Strategy==

France has more safe and non-committing openings that can almost guarantee quite a few (usually two, sometimes three) builds during the winter of 1901.  France is the only power able to reach the centers in Iberia in 1901, and can choose to take them calmly, or expend less effort capturing Spain and Portugal to attack Germany or England.

France's major choice is whether to try for the Channel.  If France manages to occupy the Channel, he can almost guarantee himself BEL by force, as long as he has another unit in PIC or BUR.  However, forcing one's way into BEL is against most French theory, which says that France can (and should) play as docilely as possibly during the first year, playing England and Germany off each other, and choosing a side in 1902.  

===F BRE - ENG, The English Attack===
This move is more aggressive than the English move to the Channel in S1901, which, although pointing right into French territory, is usually just for support of F NTH C A YOR - BEL.

If you can guarantee a supportive Germany and a relaxed Russia, this move can kill England, who will suffer terribly if the move to the Channel does not work.  A French fleet in the Channel can support or be supported by a German fleet in Denmark into the North Sea, quickly ending England.

====A MAR - BUR, A PAR - PIC: The Northern Dash====
The most aggressive possible opening for France, it leaves Iberia completely untouched if the move succeeds.  Obviously anti-English and possibly anti-German, this opening may leave you with no friends in Western Europe, and a very hungry-looking Italy in the east.  It provides the maximum possible force on BEL, as well as the possibility of a convoy to WAL or LON.

====A MAR - SPA, A PAR - GAS: The English Defense====
The opposite of the Northern Dash, this opening guarantees two builds from Iberia, while allowing Germany to make a quick strike into BUR if he so desires.

===F BRE - MAO: The Atlantic Opening===

The calmer alternative to the Channel is MAO, which allows France great flexibility in befriending either England or Germany.  Although it gives up the Channel to England, many times England will try desperately to woo France during the opening years by opening to NWG and NTH.  The Mid-Atlantic fleet also gives France a chance for a quick break into the Med by sailing F MAO to Spain's South Coast, which borders WMS.  Adding another fleet with F MAR can mount a powerful early attack on Italy, who usually focuses on the East for the first few years.

====A PAR - BUR, A MAR S A PAR - BUR: The Maginot Opening====
By far the most common French opening, it allows France a finger in each of his three possible neutrals.  It protects against an early German incursion, and the three moves are guaranteed to succeed.  This is the most anti-German opening in France's repertoire as it guarantees a threat on MUN in the fall.  Germany is usually not an early threat to France, and angering him by forcing yourself into BUR may not be the best policy.  If England's friendship can be guaranteed, however, this opening can be extremely powerful by getting close to Germany rapidly.

====A PAR - BUR, A MAR - SPA: The Burgundy Variation====
Second in popularity only to the Maginot Opening is the Burgundy variation.  France claims SPA, and can guarantee himself POR, while still having a stake in the argument over BEL or at least keeping Germany out of BUR.  The Burgundy bothers England a little over BEL and Germany a little over the move to BUR, but antagonizes neither too strongly.  An extremely strong, theoretical opening.

====A MAR - BUR, A PAR - PIC: The Belgian Variation====
More aggressive than the Burgundy Variation, this opening guarantees France a shot at BEL in the fall, in addition to picking up an Iberian neutral.  Somewhat anti-German, this opening aims to get armies to the German border as rapidly as possible.

For time immemorial, humans have been intrigued by creation. Where did we, and the universe in which we live, come from? In the ''Rig Veda'', it was proposed that before creation there was &quot;neither existence nor non-existence.&quot; The Latin phrase ''ex nihilo nihil fit'' (&quot;out of nothing comes nothing&quot;) sums up current human beliefs about origins.

The Qur'an contains the following verse regarding
the origin of the universe:
“Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of Creation), before We clove them asunder?” [Al-Qu’ran 21:30]

Many possibilities have been considered by scientists over the millennia. Did the universe &quot;happen&quot; suddenly, was it created quickly by God, has it existed forever, or is it in a constant state of creation, even now?

Just as we can use size scales to make rough comparisons of the sizes of objects in the universe, we can also use '''time scales''' to compare the periods of time over which events occur. For example, Comet Halley takes about 75 years to complete its orbit around the Sun, so we can say that the period of Comet Halley's orbit has about the same time scale as the human lifespan.

[[Image:Montinari Milano.jpg|thumb|150px|right]]
== The Origin of the Universe according to the Big Bang theory ==

The universe is big in space, but it's also big in time. The age of the universe appears to be 13.7 billion years old. Like huge space scales, a span of 14 billion years is hard to imagine for a person who will have a much shorter lifespan than that. To better understand very long time scales, we can &quot;compress&quot; long periods of time like the age of the universe into shorter periods such as a human lifetime.

A typical person will live around 80 years. That means that the Earth will go around the Sun eighty times over the course of an average lifetime. The human life time scale and the time scale of human history are far smaller than the time scale of changes in the universe. Astronomers have learned about how the universe as a whole came to be the way it is by studying only an instant of its existence. To get a clearer picture of how the cosmological time scales fit together, let's consider an imaginary astronomer whose life is &quot;stretched out&quot; to fill the entire history of the universe.

If a human lifetime were vastly longer than it is, the orbit of the Earth around the Sun might be too fast to be a useful way to measure age. Instead, it might be more practical measure time from something slower. The Sun takes 230 million years to complete an orbit around the Milky Way Galaxy. That means that a &quot;Milky Way year&quot; will be 230 million times longer than an ordinary year.

Let's suppose our old astronomer has a lifespan of 80 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; instead of 80 normal years. That way, the astronomer will live long enough to see events that happen on cosmological time scales rather than human time scales. The astronomer's life happens in extreme slow motion. His growth and his actions are slowed by a factor of 230 million. At this rate, it takes four normal months for the astronomer just to ''blink''.

[[Image:Milky Way Year.png|thumb|360px|left|A year is defined to be the time it takes for the Earth to make a complete orbit around the Sun. We will define a new measure of time inspired by the year, which we'll call the &quot;Milky Way year.&quot; The &quot;Milky Way year&quot; is the time it takes for the Sun to make a complete orbit around the Milky Way, 230 million times longer than an ordinary year. If we imagine stretching a human lifetime 230 million times, a person born at the big bang would live long enough to see the death of the Sun.]]

Astronomers have theorized that the universe was very small, hot, and dense when it began. Since then, it has expanded and cooled. At first, the universe contained almost entirely hydrogen and helium gas. The universe was very uniform, with no galaxies, stars or planets. We'll place our protagonist's birth at the time of the big bang. 

Our astronomer was much too young to remember the early development of the universe after the big bang. By the time the astronomer was only two days old, atoms had formed in the universe and the universe had cooled enough for structure to begin forming in the gas that uniformly filled all of space. Remember, the imaginary long-lived astronomer measures time much more slowly &amp;mdash; what the astronomer sees as two days amount to a million years of time on a normal clock. While a million years seems like an extremely long time, that's only a tiny part of the history of the universe.

Our astronomer's earliest memories of childhood will include the first formation of stars and galaxies, which began to occur when the astronomer was around five &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old. Galaxies would continue forming and developing well into the astronomer's teenage years, when the universe was billions of years old. Today, galaxies continue to evolve and change.

There are two schools of thought on how the Universe formed: &quot;top down&quot; and &quot;bottom up&quot;. Top down theorists think that large clusters formed after the Big Bang, which later broke down into stars and galaxies. &quot;Bottom up&quot; theorists instead pose the theory that matter was originally dispersed fairly evenly by the Big Bang, later accumulating into stars and galaxies. Recent data from Hubble Deep Field photographs appear to support &quot;bottom up&quot; theories. The photos show young galaxies from up to 11 billion light-years away. These young, small galaxies, from early in the universe's history, support the theory that large structures formed out of smaller ones. The galaxies appear as faint blue blobs with vague spiral structures, 2000 to 3000 light-years across. 

An important necessity for the appearance of life is heavy elements. Since only hydrogen and Helium gas were formed during the big bang, everything heavier than that had to be made in stars later. These other elements &amp;mdash; all of the elements on the periodic table &amp;mdash; were made in stars.

Stars use light elements like Hydrogen and Helium as their fuel. Like nuclear bombs, they use the power of the atom for energy. Stars are unlike nuclear bombs, however, in that most nuclear bombs get their energy from heavy atoms like Plutonium and Uranium. In a nuclear bomb, the energy comes from converting heavy elements into lighter elements. This process is called '''fission'''. In a star, the energy comes from converting the light elements into heavier elements. This process is called '''fusion'''. All of the material in the universe heavier than Hydrogen and Helium were made by fusion in a star.

An ordinary star can make many of the elements, especially the most important ones for life. It can't make all of the elements, though; it can't make anything heavier than Iron. The heavier elements were made in '''supernovae'''. A supernova occurs when a massive star reaches the end of its life. Supernovae are extremely bright and extremely hot. This is where the heaviest elements in the universe are made. 

All of the material needed to make rocky planets was made in stars, and some of it was made in supernovae. This means that planets couldn't exist until there had been enough time for a star to completely go through its life cycle and become a supernova. The material would then be ejected back into space, and would form a new star, possibly with planets. It also means that everything in the world, including you, came from a star. As the astronomer Carl Sagan said, &quot;We are star stuff.&quot;

[[Image:Protoplanetary disk.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This illustration shows how the Solar System might have appeared while it was forming. The disk around the Sun contains gas and dust which will eventually be swept up by the gravity of the planets. Although the newborn Solar System resembles a galaxy, it is much, much smaller.]]

The Sun and the Earth formed about four and a half billion years ago, when our long-lived astronomer was 37 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old. A solar system forms relatively quickly, and ours probably took only about 100 million years. The Sun and the planets formed from a cloud of sparse gas in the Milky Way, which condensed down and coalesced. After this happened, the Earth was very hot. It was a completely molten ball of rock, and had melted so thoroughly that its consistency was similar to water. Certainly, no life could  have existed on the very young Earth.

Soon, however, the conditions on Earth became suitable for life. For our carbon-based type of life to develop, a planet needs to have
# organic matter (the material from which DNA is made),
# liquid water,
# a source of energy, and
# appropriate temperatures.
Earth had all of these fairly early in its history. Scientists aren't sure when life first appeared on Earth, but some evidence dates the earliest life at three and a half billion years ago, when our astronomer was 47 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old.

Evidence suggests that life appeared almost immediately once the necessary conditions were satisfied on the young Earth, but the first inhabitants of the new planet showed no strong predisposition for evolution to more advanced life forms. More than two billion years passed before primitive, single celled microbial organisms advanced to become multicellular life. Once it did, however, advanced life took rapid hold. This period of rapid development in the complexity of life is called the '''Cambrian Explosion'''.

The Cambrian Explosion occurred when our astronomer was 56 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old. Ten years had passed on our slowed cosmological clock. This period of history was, in some sense, the most profound step in the development of intelligence on Earth.

[[Image:Allosaurus_skeleton_2.jpg|thumb|233px|left|The extinction of the dinosaurs was very recent by cosmological standards.]]

Since the Cambrian Explosion, things have become very interesting on Earth. The astronomer was barely a year older by the time the primitive multicellular creatures had developed to become the dinosaurs, which were unimaginably more complex and advanced by comparison. We have now come into recent times, as the appearance of the dinosaurs occurred only twelve months before this instant in our astronomer's life.

We can see now that we must occupy a tiny, tiny part of the cosmic timeline. By what standard could the time of the dinosaurs ''possibly'' be considered recent? By a cosmological standard. The dinosaurs had a short stay on Earth. They disappeared 65 million years ago, or four months ago by the astronomer's clock. This gave mammals the chance to rise to dominance.

The first humans appeared on Earth only ''eight hours'' ago by our astronomer's clock. Civilization accounts for only a small fraction of this time. The first system of writing, and the first evidence of civilization, dates to only 6000 years ago, or fifteen minutes ago by our astronomer's clock. In the lifetime of the universe, all of culture and all of written history could fit into a coffee break!

Periods more similar to the human life span become even smaller in our comparison with the cosmic timescale. It was only very recently that people first endeavored to learn about the world using science in the way we understand it today. These first scientists, who considered observation and experimentation to give the last word on the nature of the universe, lived only about four hundred years ago, or one minute ago on our cosmic clock.

As we come progressively closer to the present, our lives seem progressively more ephemeral and fleeting. How long will our society, our culture, and our ideas endure in the long run? Only time will tell. At the current rate, it does not appear to be long before something must happen to stop the downgrade of society.

We can say little about what might happen on Earth in the next thousand years, let alone the next million years or the next billion years. Meanwhile, the Milky Way will continue on its normal course, a course which happens to be headed straight for a collision with the nearest neighboring galaxy in about 12 &quot;Milky Way years.&quot; This is unlikely to be the disaster for Earth it might appear to be &amp;mdash; a collision between any stars during a galactic merger is actually extremely improbable. The Solar System will simply take up residence in the new galaxy created in the aftermath of the collision.

Five billion years from now, the Sun will have used up its fuel and will die. At this point, about 20 billion years after the big bang, the long-lived astronomer will be 80 years old. The Earth will no longer be able to support life after the Sun dies, and the Solar System will become rather desolate. The universe as a whole will continue long after the death of both the Sun and our astronomer, but it too will slowly die, eventually becoming cold and empty as it continues to expand.

Looking back over the scales of the universe and seeing humanity's role, unimaginably small in both space and time, one might wonder whether science has painted a bleak, depressing, and hopeless picture for humanity. Some would say so, while others find comfort in the majesty and grandeur of the universe, and the possibilities that the future might bring. For now, the future of humanity in this universe, as chaotic and vast as it is, remains uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tennis is a game played between two single players, in the singles game, or two teams of two players each, in the doubles game. To play, the players use a strung racquet to hit the tennis ball and send it over the net into the opponent's court. The purpose of the game is to either send the ball into the opponent's court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it fairly into your own court. This would include not being able to return it at all, causing the opponent to return it low and into the net, or returning it outside of the boundaries of your own court. The game is played all over the world, professionally and by amateurs. The simplicity of the game makes it possible for anyone who can hold a racquet, including those in wheelchairs and the very old and very young, to participate.

Remember, in order to have a nice clean house or life, you must always organize and prevent certain things from happening. as my parents were very clean, here is some general advice for staying clean. Also you have to diagnose what kind of cleaning problem you have.

Warnings: if you have any allergies to any cleaning products, do not use them.

Take off your shoes so the carpets stay clean,
Use newspaper when eating on the table,easy to clean up.
Keep all cleaning supplies in a safe place
Replace crayons with non-toxic, washable markers
Do not buy any soda with artificial colorizers (such as Sunny Delight, etc.)

'''5.1 The Main Menu Figure 33. The main menu bar.'''

The Main Menu consists of logically organized functions that are generally global in nature throughout Wings3D, that is they apply to vertices, edges, faces and objects or general environmental settings such as user preferences and camera manipulation. The exception to this general rule is the Objects Menu, which contains functions relevant to objects only. The Main Menu items include File, Edit, View, Select, Tools, Objects, and Help. Each of these will be covered in this section individually. 5.1.1 The File Menu File Menu – General The File Menu contains file handling options, most of which are common to almost all applications, but some warrant a little discussion. Each option is described in its own section below. File | New (Ctrl-N) Default when starting the program, giving you a clear workspace to work in. When invoked later Wings will ask if you want to save your changes with the standard Yes, No, Cancel options. If you answer No Wings3D will delete all objects in a current workspace. File | Open (Ctrl-O) Will load a previously saved .wings model into the workspace. When invoked, Wings will ask if you want to save your changes with the standard Yes, No, Cancel options. If you answer No Wings3D will present you with a File Open dialog box. You can then navigate to your file and load it by typing in the name or double clicking on it from the list of available models. If you cancel at this point, 46 DRAFT 1.6

Wings will keep what was in your workspace, otherwise all objects in your workspace will


'''File''' | '''Merge...''' (Ctrl-L) Adds the contents of another .wings file to your current scene. When invoked, the Windows file open dialog appears. By default, it is set to add a .wings file, but the option all files is available. The &quot;All Files&quot; option will only load a native Wings file such as one with the wrong extension (or no extension). Therefore, trying to bring in anything but a wings file returns the error message: 'Read failed: no such file or directory&quot; as this command is for loading native Wings files only. One handy use for the File | Merge command is to load up a previously saved set of lights. If you create a lighting environment you are particularly fond of delete all the non-light objects from the scene and do a Save As. Call it something like lights.wings. Then after doing a file new you can merge the lights into your current scene. Note that File|Import implicitly always merges if you want to add an non-native format model to your scene.

'''File''' | '''Save''' (Ctrl-S) Saves the current workspace as a .wings file. If the model is new, a Save File dialog box will come up allowing you to specify the path and file name to be saved. If it is a previously existing file, it will save to that file, permanently incorporating any changes you have made since loading it.

'''File''' | '''Save As...''' (Ctrl-Shift-S)

Allows you to save the current workspace as a .wings file under a new file name. A Save As File dialog box will come up allowing you to specify the path and file name to be saved. This can save hours of labor, being particularly useful whenever you either come to a point where undoing will become a problem if further work does not pan out, or at a point that you want to come back to, for expanding in a different direction altogether.

'''File''' | '''Save Selected...'''

Allows you to save the currently selected object or objects in the workspace as a .wings file under a new file name. A Save

be deleted before the requested file is opened. dialog box will come up allowing you to specify the path and file name to be saved.

'''File''' | '''Revert'''

Clears all work done since last save and restores last saved. It does not clear the Undo history. The idea is that you should be able to undo a Revert if did it by mistake. Thus there is no question asking for confirmation.

'''File''' | '''Import'''

Nendo® (.ndo)

3D Studio (.3ds) [import scale] [export scale] [ok] [cancel]

Adobe® Illustrator (.ai)

Wavefront® (.obj) [import scale] [export scale] [ok] [cancel]

Import files of selected format in current project. Wings supports the importation of Nendo® (.ndo), 3DS Max® (.3ds) Adobe® Illustrator (.ai) and Wavefront® (.obj) format files. Import has no limits on file size other than system resources. Import implicitly always merges therefore you can add nonnative format models to your scene without loosing your current work.

The 3DS Max® and Wavefront® import commands both have option boxes on the right of the menu item. The option boxes allow you to specify an Import Scale. This is useful since many models will be very small or absolutely huge when imported into Wings. By experimentation you can find the right scaling factor and then apply it each time you import models from another program. Simply apply the inverse scale upon export if you wish to take the model back to the originating program.

The Nendo® import works much better than the others because it is a one-to-one translation. This is because both Nendo® and Wings use winged-edge data structures. Import of other formats is trickier. The other formats contains triangle or polygon meshes. To import them, Wings must combine the polygons into one or more closed objects that can be represented by the winged-edge

==Section 5.1==
The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL structure. Combining gets tricky if the mesh contains defects, and many meshes do since the defects usually are not a problem in other modelers or renderers.

Also, if you import a model that has a texture associated with it you may get a Wings message box when attempting to modify it, telling you that the operation can not be performed on a textured model. This is because texture support in Wings is under development. In a future release of Wings, the question will be if you want to convert the texture to colors (just as in Nendo®). But currently, the workaround is to use the Strip Texture command in the Body pop-up menu. Or you can save the model as a Wings file and reload it.

One thing new users may find helpful is the knowledge that Wings and Nendo® work well in tandem since Wings supports both the import and export of .ndo files. So you can model in Wings, take the model into Nendo® to do color assignments, and save the model with colors. Then you can use Wings File | Import (.ndo) and bring the model in with all the color assignments intact. Some Wings operations still cannot work with color assignments but you can smooth the model to a greater degree than is possible in Nendo® for a smoother looking model while still retaining the colors.

Currently, Wings only import textures from the OBJ format, not 3DS. Acceptable file formats for textures are 24 bit BMP, TGA®, and TIFF.

FILE | EXPORT

Nendo® (.ndo) 3D Studio (.3ds) Hash Model (.mdl) Wavefront (.obj) VRML 2.0 (.wrl) YafRay (.xml)) Optional


Saves all objects in workspace in Nendo® (.ndo), 3D Studio (3ds), Animation Master (.mdl), Wavefront (.obj), or VRML 2.0 (.wrl) format. When YafRay rendering software is installed this option will appear. There are option boxes for .3ds, .and obj, exporters

which bring up sub-menus for specifying parameters. The option box for .3ds allows you to enter an export scale. The option box for .obj allows this and a check box to create one group per material. YafRay uses the options setup under the File &gt; Render &gt; Yafray panel.

Quick Tip: Rendering with YafRay

On the PC side you can send a file to render in YafRay right from wings, but on the mac side you are limited to exporting the model and rendering from the command line. See section 7.1 YafRay.

FILE | EXPORT SELECTED

Saves selected elements in one of the export formats (see FILE | EXPORT). Note that the selection can be of any type (e.g. face selection).

FILE | RENDER

Renders the workspace using either the default OpenGL® render routine or YafRay if you have installed it correctly. Support for other rendering engines may be added in the future. The Option Button on the right will bring up a sub-menu for several parameters you can set. Before you can send the file to render in YafRay make sure you have added at least one light or you won’t see anything. The image is rendered from the point of view of the camera

FILE | HISTORY

If you have opened files previously you will see their filenames listed below File | Export. Clicking one will open that file (provided it is still in the same location where you had it at the time). The history list is currently limited to 4 files.

FILE | EXIT (Ctrl-Q) Exits Wings3D. If changes have been made since your last save Wings will ask you if you want to save them before shutting down.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.3 The View Menu Figure 40: The View Menu. VIEW MENU – GENERAL

The View Menu contains functions that set and control how you view your work; i.e.

camera and work environment settings.

VIEW | GROUND PLANE

Toggles the ground plane visibility on/off. Each grid cell of the ground plane represents one &quot;unit&quot; in Wings. A unit can be whatever you want it to be.

VIEW | AXES

Toggles axes visibility on/off.

VIEW | WORKMODE (Tab) Toggles the display between work mode and smoothed mode.


VIEW | SMOOTH PREVIEW (Shift- Tab)

Sets the view mode to shaded and performs one level of smoothing on a temporary basis so that you can see what your model will look like after smoothing. You cannot model in this mode.

VIEW | WIREFRAME

Sets the display mode to wireframe. If you want to extrude a face into the model, set your model to wireframe mode first and you will be able to see how far into the model you are going.

VIEW | SHADE

Sets the display mode to solid flat shading. Toggles between smooth shaded view and solid view on your model. In smooth shaded view the materials being used become visible. This is sometimes referred to as a Wings render.

VIEW | TOGGLE WIREFRAMED/SHADED (W) Toggles between wireframe and shaded

views of the model. This is a handy toggle to use in conjunction with the Tab key. Tab will show you a temporarily smooth-shaded version of your model which you can then overlay with the wireframe by hitting the W key. This wire on smoothed view can be helpful to see how edges affect the overall form of the subject while modeling.

DRAFT 1.6 55

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL VIEW | SHOW SAVED BB

Shows/hides the bounding box set in the Tools Menu. If set on, a dashed wireframe outline shows the extent of the box. Wings can save a single vertex or single edge as a bounding box. Bounding Boxes can be very useful for proportionally scaling and moving a large imported object to a desired volume and position, and can also be used as reference points with vector, magnet, and “snap-to” operations.

VIEW | SHOW EDGES

In flat shaded mode, toggles the edges on/off. This can be useful for very large models, as some otherwise fast graphics cards display edges slowly.

VIEW | SHOW NORMALS

A toggle that shows/hides the normals of every face, edge or vertex (depending on which selection mode you are in) of the model, as a short thick blue line. Handy for planning how things will be moved, as a visual aid if rotating faces around an edge, and to see the normals on an imported model which may have some or all of the normals inverted.

VIEW | SHOW WIREFRAME BACKFACES

Lets you see the wireframe from both front and back in wireframe mode. This can be very useful when trying to position edges to match up on the inside and outside of a wall, for example, prior to using Bridge to cut in a window.


VIEW | RESET VIEW (R) Resets the camera to default location and zoom. Great if you get lost.


VIEW | AIM (A) Points camera directly at selected objects, faces, edges or vertices. Then when you pan and zoom in on the selected the item, it will stay centered in the work space. If there is no selection, the aim point will be reset to the origin (0, 0, 0). This is very handy when doing detailed work and for doing high aspect ratio stuff, such as a giraffe. When working on the head, select a face on the head and Aim. Then all camera movement will be centered on the head. Then when working on the feet select a face there and Aim there, and the point of focus will be on the foot.

VIEW | FRAME (Shift+A) View | Frame works similarly to Aim except that it adjusts the distance to the selection so that the selection will be visible in the Wings window. If there is no selection, the distance will be chosen so that all objects will be visible.

VIEW | ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW (O) Toggles orthographic/perspective views on/off. Orthographic views are the same as those traditionally used for engineering or technical drawing purposes – i.e. front, side and plan views. Since there is essentially no single point of view (as in perspective) all lines and faces are seen in their true lengths and shapes - provided they lie on a plane that is at right angles to the viewing direction. This can offer an advantage when moving or editing geometry that, for example 'bulges out' towards the viewer. The use of Orthographic View is well married with the use of Move | Free, allowing you to freely move selected items while automatically constraining such movement to only two directions at a time.

VIEW | SCENE LIGHTS

Turns on any lights you may have added to the scene via the Lights primitive.

VIEW | ONE/TWO LIGHTS

Toggles one or two standard lights on in the scene. To avoid confusion consider this menu item as a request. That is, if the menu reads One Light, then two lights are currently on, and vice versa. Note that Scene lights negate the One Light/Two Light option.

VIEW | SHOW COLORS

Vertex colors can be imported on pre-existing models (such as from Nendo®). To see the vertex colors use this option.

56 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus VIEW | SHOW MATERIALS

Materials can be created and assigned in Wings per face with the Face | Set Material command. They can also be present on models you have imported. To show materials use this option.

VIEW | SHOW TEXTURES

Models with pre-existing textures can be imported into Wings. The textures are retained after import and can be seen via this option.

VIEW | VIEW ALONG (X, Y, Z, Shift-X, Shift-Y, Shift-Z)

+X X

+Y Y

+Z Z

-X Shift+X

-Y Shift+Y

-Z Shift+Z 

Sets the camera to view along the selected axis. It is recommended that you look at your model from various angles as you go, to get a good feel for how it is developing. Using the X, Y, Z (etc.) hot keys is a very quick and easy way to do this. It is also very handy to view along a major axis while scaling, as you can scale two vertices along a cross axis to spread them apart or move them towards each other. Useful in conjunction with orthographic mode for certain tasks where precise movement / alignment is required.

VIEW | ALIGN TO SELECTION

Turns the camera to point in same direction as selected elements. Wings then orientates the model such that you are viewing along the selected element's normal. This can be very useful if a single (flat) face is selected and Align to Selection is used. The face is then seen in its true shape, since the viewer is looking at it from a right angle. Selecting geometry forming that face (edges or vertices) and using Move -&gt; Free (for example) allows movement on the same plane as the face. This keeps the face flat, which is required for clean geometry.

This is also useful in situations where you want to maintain a reference face, so that other geometry not linked to that reference

face can easily be moved on planes parallel to the reference face. To accomplish further editing of this 'external' geometry, select the reference face, use Align To Selection, and the model re-aligns to the correct position. For example, Align To Selection can be used on a flat face, then an edge can be Cut by 2 to create a new vertex. It is then possible to 'slide' the new vertex along the edge to a new position. The edge can either be kept straight via vector moves (discussed later) or 'distorted' by moving the vertex accordingly to form a new apex. In either case, by first using Align To Selection, the face will remain flat. Similar operations can be preformed via other methods as well, such as the Slide plug-in which will be discussed later.

VIEW | AUTO ROTATE (U) This will fly your camera around the model, so that it appears to rotate. The angle and speed of rotation can be set via the Edit | Preferences menu. Rotating gives you a good overall view of the model, and can be used in conjunction with screen capture software to create an AVI to show off your model. Left click to stop the rotation. You can change the aspect of the camera with the middle mouse button during rotation and the rotation will continue.

Quick Tip: View Orthographic in Wireframe Mode.

Sometimes it is not all that obvious what the difference between Orthographic and Perspective views do for you. To see this graphically, create a cube and hit the X key to look at it straight on. Then hit the O key a couple of times. It does not seem to do much other than change sizes, right? Now hit the W key to put the cube into Wireframe Mode and repeat the exercise. You can definitely see the effects of perspective now, even when looking dead on. Now use the marquee select function (drag a box) to select the top left vertex of the cube while still in perspective view. You get one vertex selected. Clear the selection and go into Orthographic View. Select the top left vertex via marquee drag. Rotate the camera a little and you will see that you got both the front and back vertices because you were in Orthographic view. This can be very useful

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.4 The Select Menu Figure 41: The Select Menu. SELECT MENU – GENERAL

The Select Menu is one of the most important items in Wings3D as it contains many operations that lead to fast and efficient modeling. By being able to quickly select the elements you need to work with, and even combine (or subtract) that selection with another selection set you can quickly achieve the results you desire.

SELECT | DESELECT (Space) Deselect all selected items.

SELECT | MORE (+) Grows the selection set to include all the adjacent items (vertices, edges, or faces) of

the same type on a given object. For example, if a face is selected all adjacent faces will become selected as well. If there are multiple objects in a scene, it will not cause more objects to be selected, however, each object with a selection set active will have it's selection set grow.

SELECT | LESS (-) Shrinks the selection set in reverse order of it's growth. If working with an initial selection set, this will cause nothing to be selected. As with More, selection sets on multiple objects can be manipulated at the same time.

SELECT | REGION (Shift-L) Select | Region works in conjunction with a properly selected closed edge loop. Given a properly selected edge loop, Select | Region will then select all the faces contained by that loop. If a single edge is selected, or if the loop is not closed, then all the faces become selected. Select|Region will also handle multiple loops. For instance, you can select both hands or both legs. Select|Region and Select|Edge Loop are the inverse of each other.

SELECT | EDGE LOOP (L) Selects edges that flow in a line until a pole is encountered. A pole is a non-4way intersection (i.e. it has 3 edges or 5 or more edges joining at a single vertex).

SELECT | EDGE RING (G) Selects a set of edges that run between two edge loops. These cross edges are sometimes referred to as &quot;struts&quot;. If you think of the lines of latitude on a globe as edge loops, then the lines of longitude between any two parallels would constitute an Edge Ring. In Wings, simply select one such &quot;strut&quot; then Select | Edge Ring, and the entire set of edges will become selected, until the model is completely encircled, or until a pole is encountered. This can result in big time savings when modeling.

DRAFT 1.6 59

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL SELECT | PREVIOUS EDGE LOOP

(F3)

This will &quot;step&quot; down the model from one closed edge loop to the next, deselecting the originally selected loop in favor of the next one it encounters. Repeated use of F3 continues on down the model until it no longer finds another loop to select, then it reverses order and comes back up the model. This is very powerful and when used in conjunction with other functions (such as Scale, Move, Rotate, etc.) and can greatly increase the efficiency of your modeling work flow.

SELECT | NEXT EDGE LOOP (F4) This will &quot;step&quot; up the model from one closed edge loop to the next, deselecting the originally selected loop in favor of the next one it encounters. Works just like F3, except it goes in the opposite direction, so that you can use the two function keys to toggle back and forth between two edge loops, or change directions at will.

SELECT | SIMILAR (I) Selects items similar to the currently selected item. Select | Similar is not that useful for organic modeling. Its main strength is in what Jakob Cederlund calls geometric art (i.e. objects that are highly symmetrical). It is good for selecting faces widely apart. The rules for similarity are as follows.

Faces - Same number of edges. Sum of edge lengths approximately equal. Sum of angles between each pair of edges approximately equal.

Edges -Approximate length of edge equal. Angle and length of the nearest four edges approximately equal.

Vertices - Angle and length of edges going out from the vertex approximately equal. This may be the least useful of the bunch, as it seldom finds many hits.

Note that Less does not deselect items selected via Similar; i.e. it does not revert to the original selection set.

SELECT | ADJACENT

VERTICES – selects vertices adjacent to the currently selected vertex/vertices.

EDGES – selects edges adjacent to the currently selected edge(s).

FACES – selects faces adjacent to the currently selected face(s). If you press the same key several times, the selection will grow each time. In vertex selection mode, pressing the &quot;v&quot; will grow the selection in exactly the same way as does SELECT | MORE. However, in edge selection mode, pressing &quot;e&quot; will grow the selection by selecting the four edges nearest each edge. SELECT | MORE, on the other hand, will select all edges that share a vertex with a selected edge. To see the difference, select one edge on an icosahedron or a grid and try both commands. In face selection mode, all faces that share an edge with a selected face will become selected. SELECT | MORE, on the other hand, will select all faces that share a vertex with a selected face. Try it out on a grid to understand the difference.

Note that if there is no current selection set the keys v, e, f (and b) simply change selection mode to vertex, edge, face and body, respectively.

Select | By offers a wide variety of methodology to choose selection sets. These selections can be stored (as discussed later) and then used in conjunction with other selection sets via Union, Subtract, and Intersection (also discussed later).

Hard Edges selects all Hard Edges in the selected object.

Vertices with (2, 3, 4, and 5) selects faces that have the given number of vertices as designated by the number. This is helpful in trying to maintain quads.

Select | By | Faces With | 5 Or More has a hot key, F5, so that you can quickly find any non quad or tri sided polygons. Such polygons can cause problems in some 3D modeling and rendering packages and should therefore be resolved.

Material is used to select faces by their assigned materials. Any user-defined material will automatically be added to the Material sub-menu and become available for selection.

Random (10 – 90%) selects a random subset of the current selection type (vertices, edges, faces or objects) for manipulation.

Short Edges selects any edges that are too short, as determined by the option box to the right of the command. Short edges are often responsible for display anomalies and difficulties in continued modeling. Often these edges will be so short and located such that you can not see them, even after selecting them. You can Extrude them to find them, or simply Collapse them to eliminate them.

Id. You can also select any item (vertex, edge, or face) by its ID number, which can be gleaned from the Wings status bar when the item is selected. So, if you record an ID number you know you want to come back to, you can later Select it then Aim at it to continue working in that area.

SELECT | LIGHTS

Will select all the lights in your scene.

SELECT | ALL [Vertices, Edges, Faces, Objects] (Ctrl+A) Selects all the vertices, edges, faces, or


objects, dependent on the current selection mode. For objects, it selects all within the scene that have not been hidden or locked (via Object | [object name] | Hide or Lock (to be discussed later)).

SELECT | INVERSE (Ctrl-Shift-I) Inverts the selected set. That which was selected becomes unselected and vice versa.

SELECT | STORE SELECTION

Stores a selection set so that it can be used in conjunction with other selection sets.

SELECT | RECALL SELECTION

Recalls a selection set so that it can be used in conjunction with other selection sets.

DRAFT 1.6 61

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL SELECT | EXCHANGE SELECTION

Exchanges a selection set so that it can be used in conjunction with other selection sets. The current selection set becomes the stored selection set while the stored selection set becomes the active one.

SELECT | UNION WITH STORED

Creates a new selection set by combining the current selection set with one that has been stored.

SELECT | SUBTRACT WITH STORED

Creates a new selection set by subtracting the stored selection set from the current selection set. That is, all items in common

between the two sets are deselected from the current selection set.

SELECT | INTERSECTION WITH STORED

Creates a new selection set intersecting the current and stored selection sets. That is, only those items that are common to both sets remain selected. This can be used very effectively to add noise to an organic model. You can store all the vertices on a tree trunk, for example, then Select | By | Random | 30% which will select vertices on trunk, branches and leaves. Then do a Intersection With Stored and only random vertices on the trunk will remain selected which you can then Move | Normal to make knobs.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.5 The Tools Menu Figure 42: The Tools Menu. Tools Menu – General

The tools menu contains some functions that will interact with other Wings commands.

TOOLS | ALIGN

All 

X Y Z Radial X (YZ) Radial Y (XZ) Radial Z (XY)


Aligns all selected objects based on the bounding box of the selection for each element. This can be useful to line things up once they have gotten off center. For example by using a series of Aligns, you could get wheels on a model that have become misaligned back into proper positions relative to each other. It does not align vertices, edges or faces to an axis on the same model.

TOOLS | CENTER

All 

X Y Z Radial X (YZ) Radial Y (XZ) Radial Z (XY)


Centers objects in the workspace based on the bounding box of all selected items. If you work on a large model that has sort of &quot;grown&quot; off in one direction, you can quickly center it in the workspace again. Also, if you have multiple objects in a complex model, and you've lost track of one of them, you can select it (via the Objects Menu – to be discussed latter) and then Center to find it again.

TOOLS | SAVE BOUNDING BOX

Saves the bonding box of selected items, from one or more objects, for later use. Use Save Bounding Box without any selection to clear the bounding box. An outline of the current bounding box is displayed if so chosen in the users' preferences.

TOOLS | SCALE TO SAVED BB

All 

X

Y

Z

Radial X (YZ)

Radial Y (XZ)

Radial Z (XY) Scales the selected object(s) to the bounding box that has been previously saved. This command will scale each selected object, along one, two, or three axes. The amount to scale could be different along each axis, meaning that this command can distort the proportions of the objects (i.e. a cube might no longer remain a cube). The scale factor for each axis is computed by comparing the saved bounding box with the bounding box for

DRAFT 1.6 63

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL the selection. To avoid distorting the objects, use Scale to Saved BB Proportionally.

TOOLS | SAVE TO SAVED BB PROPORTIONALLY

All 

X

Y

Z

Radial X (YZ)

Radial Y (XZ)

Radial Z (XY) Similar to Scale to Saved Bounding Box, but the idea with this one is that it should preserve the proportions of the selected objects, i.e. all axes will be scaled the same amount. This command will keep the scaled objects inside the saved bounding box.

TOOLS | MOVE TO SAVED BB

All 

X

Y

Z Will move the selected object(s) based on the center of their aggregate bounding box to the center of the saved bounding box.

TOOLS | SET DEFAULT AXIS

Sets the default axis for vertex commands.

TOOLS | VIRTUAL MIRROR

The Virtual Mirror tool puts you into a special modeling mode for creating perfectly symmetrical models. To use it select a face to mirror around and then select Virtual Mirror. The model will be mirrored from the selected face so that as you make changes on either side of the model they will be reflected on the other side of the model. This has the potential for cutting your modeling time in half and can be used to do some things that are otherwise sometimes difficult to achieve, such as rotating two surfaces in opposite directions. Note that if you want your model to stay centered in the workspace it is best to loop cut the model down the middle, delete half the model,

select the resulting face, and then start Virtual Mirror.

Create – Creates the virtual half of the model which mirrors the real half. Note that you can work with either the virtual or real half and actions will be reflected on the counterpart.

Break – Destroys the virtual mirror so that only the real half of the model remains.

Freeze – Makes the virtual half of the model into real geometry, thus creating a perfectly symmetrical full model.

TOOLS | TWEAK

Tweak is a special modeling mode that allows you to drag vertices freely for fine movements. It is a very useful and powerful tool that warrants getting used to. Most of the controls are clearly explained on the status bar at the bottom of the workspace, as outlined here:

(L) – Left mouse button; Drag vertices freely (R) – Right mouse button; Exit tweak mode (M) – Middle mouse button; Tumble (Shift-M) – Shift plus the middle mouse button; Track (Ctrl-Shift-M) – Control plus Shift plus the Middle mouse button; Dolly

(1) – Turns the magnets on or off. You can use Tweak with standard moves, or with magnetic moves. To turn on the magnets press the 1 (the number 1) key. Doing so will cause the status bar to change. While in magnet mode L will drag and R will exit Tweak mode. The + key will increase the fall-off zone while the – (minus) key will decrease the fall-off zone. The 2, 3, and 4 keys will change the type of magnet in use. Pressing the 1 key will turn the magnets off again.

These controls effectively turn Tweak into an interactive magnet with the area of influence for the magnet defined by the fall-off zone. Tweak was originally a plug-in designed by Howard Trickey and has since been incorporated into the Wings3D core.

64 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus Quick Tip: Additional Tools

Note that some very useful tools for Wings will appear in the Tools Menu if you have installed the available plug-ins. These include Draw Loop, Locked, Slide, and Tweak_s from Clacos. They are available at:

http://members.lycos.co.uk/clacos/ 

I highly recommend them. Apologies to any other tool makers if I'm missing any.

Quick Tip: Bounding Boxes

Don't overlook the usefulness of bounding boxes. You can use them to place an object at any given location, such as putting a hat on a hat rack. To do so select a vertex on the hook of the hat rack and do a Save Bounding Box. Then select a vertex on the inside of the hat and do a Move To Saved BB. The hat will snap right into place.

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.1.6 The Objects Menu Figure 43: The Object Menu. Objects Menu – General

The Objects Menu presents you with options limited specifically to whole objects.

OBJECTS | SHOW AND UNLOCK ALL

Pretty self explanatory. It shows all objects in the workspace, and if any of them were locked, unlocks them, making all objects eligible for further manipulation.

OBJECTS | HIDE SELECTED

Hides any object or multiple objects that are currently selected. This is handy to hide a large, easily selected object, so as to be able to get to and manipulated a smaller object that his mostly or completely obscured by the larger object. Once hidden, the objects are locked and therefore protected from any changes.

OBJECTS | HIDE UNSELECTED

Hides any object that is not currently selected. Hidden objects are automatically locked and protected from any geometry/orientation changes.

OBJECTS | LOCK UNSELECTED

Locks unselected objects, but leaves them visible in the workspace as reference objects.

OBJECTS | {OBJECT LIST} (object1 would be cube1 for the example shown above.) [] object1

Select

Hide

Hide Others

Lock

Rename [] object2

Select

Hide

Hide Others

Lock

Rename [] object3

Select

Hide

Hide Others

Lock

Rename and so on...

The bottom part of the Objects Menu shows a list of all the current objects in the workspace. They will initially have default names based on how they were created. For example, when a cube primitive is added to the workspace when Wings is first started, it will be named cube1. Note that if you do a File | New, the item numbers are not reinitialized. So if you then added a cube to the new workspace it would be listed as cube2. The open eye icon to the left of the name (represented in this document as [] brackets) will show if it is currently visible and change to a closed eye icon if it is hidden. Each object in the list has a sidebar menu from which you can do many handy things. From this menu an object can be Selected/Deselected, Hidden/Shown (note, if hidden Show is the only option in the side bar menu), Locked/Unlocked, and Renamed.

66 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus Objects retain the name assigned to them upon Save and Export, which is very useful in texture mapping applications later on. Hide Others (the middle option in the menu) does not work on the selected object. Rather, it hides all the rest of them. This is very useful when working in a multi object scene. As mentioned elsewhere, the Object Menu can be used to find objects you've lost track of, or

to recenter around a specific object. To do this simply choose Object | Select and then use Tools | Center | All to find/recenter on the elusive object. Currently this is a single column, non-scrollable list, so if your scene has a lot of objects in it, they may not all be accessible via this menu.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus The key to the Wings3D user interface is the use of context sensitive pop-up menus. These menus are accessed by right clicking in the workspace. There are a total of five context sensitive menus; the Primitives Menu, the Vertex Menu, the Edge Menu, the Face Menu and the Object Menu, not to be confused with the Objects Menu on the Main

Menu). Depending on what is selected, different menus will pop up presenting the user with operations that are applicable to the current situation only. In this way the interface is kept clean and simple, a joy to work with compared to many overly complex user interfaces found in some graphics and modeling packages.

5.2.1 The Primitives Menu Primitives Menu – General

Figure 45: The Primitives pop-up menu. To bring up the Primitives Menu, right click on the empty

workspace, or on a workspace where nothing is selected. You will be presented with a list of
available primitives to add to your workspace. Left click on one of the primitives to add it. It will be added to the center of the scene as an unselected object at it's default size. You may need to turn other objects' visibility off (via the Objects Menu) in order to find the newly added object. The complete list of standard primitives is given below. Notice that some primitives have a little box icon to the right of their name. This is the Options Box for that primitive. If you click on the primitive name you will add a default primitive, whereas, if you click on the options icon you will be presented with some options (number of sections, number of slices, etc.) that you can change.

Tetrahedron – a four sided object; a triangular pyramid. Octrahedron – an eight sided object. Octotoad – A twenty-six sided object, unique to Wings. Designed by Mike (roadtoad), the host of the Wings discussion forum, and added to the Wings primitives as a tribute to the great service this board provided in the further development of Wings3D. Dodecahedron – a solid object with twelve faces. Icosahedron – a solid object with twenty faces. Cube – Plain and simple. What most models start out as. Cylinder – Click on the options button (the little box on the right) for the Sections option. A Windows dialog box will come up showing the number of sections in the cylinder (16 by default). You may change this and then click OK, or click Cancel. If you do not click on the options button, but simply click on the name Cylinder, then a default cylinder will be added (with 16 sides). Cone – Sections (16 by default). Sphere – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default). Torus – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default).

===The Title Bar===

*The '''Title Bar''' along the top of the application window identifies the program's name (Wings 3D).  At the far right of the Title Bar are the standard GUI widgets for '''Minimize''', '''Restore''', and '''Close'''.  If a previously saved file is open in Wings 3D,  the Title Bar will display its file name.  When a file is ''Auto-Saved'' the title bar displays that the file has been auto-saved.

[[Image:Auto_Save_Pref.png|frame|''Auto-save option and iteration settings found in'' '''Edit/Preferences/Misc''''' from the Menu Bar.'']]
*The '''Auto-Save''' feature can be turned on and set to the number of minutes the user desires between auto-saves and can be found in '''Edit|Preferences|Misc'''.  The default setting is 10 minutes between auto-saves.  Auto-save will only save that has been previously saved.  Auto-save creates a separate file from the one the user saved and overwriting the auto-save file for each iteration.  If Wings is closed during an auto-save session without the user saving changes manually, the next time Wings is asked to opens that file may prompt the query: [[Image:Auto_Save_Open.png|frame|left]]

==The Menu Bar==

Below the '''Title Bar''' and inside the '''Geometry''' window is the '''Menu Bar'''.
Here you will find options more common to Wings in general such as settings and tools that are not specific to any one Selection Mode.

*'''Edit, File, View, Select, Tools, Windows, Help'''.

Each Menu item will be discussed fully in Section 5, The Wings3D Command Reference Guide.

'''2.4 The Toolbar'''

There are three sets of Icons above the workspace as illustrated here.

The two on the left determine what Display Mode your model is in. They are, from left to right, Wire-shaded on/off, and Perspective on/off. These are used to toggle on and off these features as you work. Perspective off, also called Orthogonal view, is useful for lining an object up to a reference image plane.

The next four icons display what Edit/Selection Mode you are in. They are Vertex, Edge, Face and Body. The red highlighting gives you a quick visual key as to just what elements are affected in each mode and the white outline box indicate which mode you are currently in. In the above illustration we are in Face selection mode. Your Edit Mode will be important when it comes to using any of the modeling tools, since most tools are presented in context sensitive menus within the Workspace. The context of those menus is determined by the current Edit Mode.

The last two are Ground Plane and Reference Axes. These icons are used to quickly toggle on or off these features as needed.

=== Reference ===
To use the commands in the menu, select one or more edges and press RMB.
==== Axes ====
Many commands require that you select an axis from the menu. This axis defines the direction or orientation for the command.

In addition to the three world axes—X, Y and Z—many commands work with edge normals, custom axes, default axes and most recently used axes.

If you specify edge normals as the axis (by selecting '''Normal'''), each group of connected edges uses the average normal of its vertices.

Custom axes can be specified only when advanced menus are enabled. For details about this feature, see [[/The Wings3D Command Reference Guide/Advanced Menus|Advanced Menus]].

A default axis is an axis that you define in advance to use later. To define the default axis, use the '''Tools''' | '''Set Default Axis''' in the main menu. This is done in two stages: first you specify the actual axis, and then the point of origin for that axis. A default axis is stored until you redefine it. To recall the default axis for an edge operation, such as '''Move''', select '''Default Axis''' from the edge operations menu.

The '''Last Axis''' menu item recalls the axis you used during your most recent operation.
==== Move, Rotate and Scale ====
Moving, rotating or scaling are straightforward operations.

To move the selection, specify the axis you want to move it along. For details about axes, see above.

To rotate the selection, specify the pivot axis. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (center of rotation) is set automatically as well.

'''Scale Uniform''' scales the selection in all directions at once. If you right-click the command, the secondary selection specifies the pivot point (scaling center).

'''Scale Axis''' scales the selection along the axis you specify.

'''Scale Radial''' scales sideways around the axis you specify, but not along it. Each vertex in the selection of stays on the plane perpendicular to the specified axis.

The effect of edge rotation and scaling depends on whether you let Wings set the center automatically or specify it with a secondary selection.

By default, each isolated edge and group of connected edges gets its own transformation center. This means, for example, that default scaling of multiple isolated edges is different from scaling their vertices. To see the difference, try scaling an edge ring, then undoing, converting the selection to vertices and scaling the vertices.

==== Slide ====
Slides the selected edges, shifting the border between the edges that they connect.

==== Extrude ====
Creates an edge loop that runs around the selected edges, and moves the selection along the axis you specify, creating a &quot;ridge&quot;. Use the + and - numpad keys to slide the new edges.

==== Cut ====
Splits the selected edges by creating vertices along their length. Click '''Cut''' to select a predefined number of divisions (2, 3, 4, 5 or 10) or specify a custom number. If advanced menus are enabled, you can right-click '''Cut''' to perform a precise split.

==== Connect ====
Creates edges that connect the centers of the selected edges.

==== Bevel ====
Creates a face in place of the selected edges, putting the vertices of the new face on the edges that were connected to the original edge. Drag the mouse to slide the face along those edges.

==== Dissolve ====
Removes the edge or edges and joins the faces that shared them.

==== Collapse ====
Collapses each isolated edge or group of connected edges to a single vertex; switches to vertex selection mode. This command can be used very effectively in conjunction with '''Select | By | Short Edges''' to remove microscopic edges that are interfering with your modeling.

==== Hardness ====
Makes the selected edge or edges '''Hard''' or '''Soft'''. Edge hardness affects two things: the way edges appear in the geometry window and the way the model is smoothed.

'''Soft'''
Edges are smooth by default. Soft edges do not look sharp in preview mode (when you toggle off work mode with Tab). In other words, Gouraud shading is used for soft edges—the normals of connected faces are interpolated smoothly across the edge.
Soft edges are fully affected by the '''Smooth''' operation.

'''Hard'''
Hard edges look sharp in preview mode, as if the faces they connect belong to different models.

The '''Smooth''' operation in Wings produces different results on smooth and hard edges. Smoothing actually happens in two stages: first, the model is subdivided; then the resulting vertices are displaced to make a smooth shape. Edge hardness does not affect the subdivision, but has an effect on the displacement.

Smoothing considers the surrounding geometry when vertices are displaced after subdivision. Hard edges mark boundaries for displacement. After a face is subdivided, displacement calculations ignore geometry beyond a hard edge.

You can use edge hardness as a modeling aid to retain sharp features when you perform smoothing. The effect is most pronounced when you harden edges that form a closed shape.

Note that it doesn't normally make sense to leave hard edges in your finished model. Not all file formats and renderers support hard edges, and they don't look natural when rendered. It's generally better to replace them with small bevels.

&lt;!--THAT'S A WEIRD TIP, I THINK IT SHOULD GO
Quick Tip: Creating round eyes from square holes.
You can create roundish eyes from the results of a Vertex | Bevel by using a combination of Edge | Dissolve and Face | Smooth commands. To demonstrate this, create a cube and connect the left and right edges of one of its sides. Then Connect the three horizontal edges of that side to form a square cross intersection in the middle of the face. Select the vertex of the intersection and Bevel it to form a diamond shape in the middle of the face. With the face selected do a Smooth. Now select the four edges within the smoothed area and Dissolve them. You now have a roundish single face in the middle of the cube from which you can now extrude and scale several times to create an eye.
--&gt;
==== Loop Cut ====
Use this command when the selected edges form one or more closed shapes on the surface of the model. '''Loop Cut''' splits the model into as many objects as these shapes divide the model into.

One obvious use case is to loop cut an asymmetrical model in half and mirror it.

==== Vertex Color ====
Opens a dialog box where you can specify a color for the vertices belonging to the selected edges. The specified color is strongest at the target vertices and fades out towards surrounding vertices.

'''Note:''' A vertex cannot have a color and a UV coordinate at the same time.

==== Intersect ====
Extends the selected edge or edges to the points where they intersect the specified plane. Requires advanced menus.

'''Intersect''' has three modes depending on which mouse button you click the command with:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;LMB—Intersect standard planes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RMB—Pick plane&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MMB—Pick plane and ref point on plane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
===== Intersect standard planes =====
Extend the edges till they intersect with the plane perpendicular to one of the following axes:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;X&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Y&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Z&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Last Axis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;DefaultAxis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
For details on axes, see above.

Clicking an axis label with LMB specifies that the plane passes through the world origin. Clicking with RMB lets you specify the point that this plane passes through.

===== Pick plane =====
Extend the edges till they intersect with a custom plane. Specify the plane by selecting the components that define it.

===== Pick plane and ref point on plane =====
Extend the edges till they intersect with a custom plane passing through a custom point. First specify the direction of the plane's normal, and then the point that the plane passes through. This mode is a step forward from the RMB mode. It is useful when some components conveniently specify the direction of the normal, but the plane must pass elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Face Operations Menu==
===Commands===

===Reference===
If one or more faces are selected, right clicking in the workspace will display the Face Operations Menu. This will allow you to perform functions unique to face manipulations.

====Move====

'''Normal''' – moves the selected face or faces along their normal(s).

'''Free''' – Will move the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.&lt;br&gt;
Since all movement takes place on planes that are parallel to the monitor screen, some care is needed to avoid problems when used in a general 'tumbled' view.&lt;br&gt;
This command is especially useful when used in conjunction with View | X,Y or Z, as it allows the user to keep moved faces on the 2D axial planes associated with the relevant viewing direction.&lt;br&gt;
If working with background reference images, Ortho should also be used (with View | XYZ) to eliminate perspective distortion issues.

'''X''' – constrains movement along the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains movement along the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains movement along the z axis.


====Rotate====

Connected faces (Regions) will rotate about their collective center of mass. Non connected, isolated faces will rotate about their individual centers of mass.

'''Free''' – Will rotate the selected faces in the direction of mouse movement.&lt;br&gt;
Note that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the monitor screen. 

'''X''' – constrains rotation about the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains rotation about the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains rotation about the z axis.

====Scale====

'''Uniform''' – Scales the face uniformly in all directions at once.

'''X''' – Scales the face in the x axis.

'''Y''' – Scales the face in the y axis.

'''Z''' – Scales the face in the z axis.

'''Radial X (YZ)''' – Scales the face radially from the x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

'''Radial Y (XZ)''' – Scales the face radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

'''Radial Z (XY)''' – Scales the face radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.

====Extrude====

'''Normal''' – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s). By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils.

'''Free''' – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

'''X''' – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.


====Extrude Region====

'''Normal''' – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s) as a unit. By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils. By using Extrude Region on a group of faces rather than simply using Extrude, you keep the faces joined together into one coherent surface, which is often preferable to having distinct stems &quot;growing&quot; out of the object.

'''Free''' – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

'''X''' – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.


====Extract Region====

'''Normal''' – extract faces and then move the faces along the regions normal.

'''Free''' – extract faces and then move faces freely in all directions.

'''X''' – extract faces and then move them along the X axis.

'''Y''' – extract faces and then move them along the Y axis.

'''Z''' – extract faces and then move them along the Z axis. Extracts a region, or group of faces, from the parent object to create a completely new object. Note that the faces do not have to be contiguous. To create a new object that abuts the original object do an Extract Region and immediately left click without moving the mouse, to lock it in place. You probably will not be able to successfully select the new object due to the underlying original and may have to use the Hide function in the Object enu to hide the parent object so that you can work with the new object. If you have created a new object from non abutting faces and want to work with them as separate objects, then use the Separate command to break them into their component parts.


====Flatten====

'''Normal'''

'''X'''

'''Y'''

'''Z'''

'''Last Axis'''

'''Default Axis'''

Region Sometimes faces can become non-planar as you work with your model, especially if you Move vertices. This can cause problems latter. One way to fix a non-planar face is to Flatten it, i.e., get all of its vertices onto the same plane. Smoothing the model will also create planar faces, but if you do not want to smooth your model, you can Flatten offending faces. It is also good for setting up geometry for further manipulation, so that extrusions go in the direction you want them to go, for example.

If you have a default axis defined (see Tools | Set Default Axis) you can flatten to that axis or you can flatten to the last axis used. Flatten Region will flatten the edge loop, the boundary between selected and non-selected faces, of the selected faces. Note that the vertices on the edge loop become planar, not the faces contained therein.

====Inset====

This creates a new face, of the same shape, inside the selected face. It works on one or more faces at a time, creating a new face for each of the selected faces. This could be used, for example, to create a picture inside a picture frame. The inner face could then be extruded in the negative direction to cause the frame to stand out. You can also Inset and make the new face larger than the original face. See the Dog House Tutorial in Section 3 of this manual for an example of this in action.


====Intrude====

You can make some very cool models very quickly with the intrude function. It is especially handy for making lattice work type of objects, such as the Eiffel Tower or a bird cage. It works by creating an inverted copy of the entire object, then doing a Bridge on all pairs of selected faces. The thickness of the walls is controlled by how far you move the mouse during the operation. The Dog House tutorial in this manual demonstrates the Intrude function quite nicely.

====Bevel====

Bevels all the edges of the selected face or faces simultaneously, thus creating a smaller selected face and small surrounding faces.


====Bridge====

Causes two co-planer or nearly co-planar faces to snap together, thus fusing new geometry between them. Only two faces can be selected at a time for Bridge. The faces must have the exact same number of edges and vertices but can be shaped differently. This can be used to attach one object to another, one part of the same object to another part of the same object, or to create holes in an object if the selected faces are on opposite sides of the object.


====Bump====

Moves selected faces out along their normals while at the same time creating new faces that meld into the existing geometry via newly beveled faces that are created. This is great for building up muscle tone on a model.


====Lift====

The Lift Command is only available if Advanced Menus are activated. Therefore, Lift will be discussed in the Advanced Menus section.


====Put on====

The Put On command allows you to drop one object onto another, much like dropping a box to the ground. Select the face you want to put onto another object then select Put On from the Face Menu. The Icon Bar will change to show you that you can select a vertex, edge or face to put the object on. Select the vertex, edge, or face you want and then Right Click to execute. The first object will jump into place right on the vertex, edge, or face you selected on the second object. This can be very useful when you go to weld parts together with the Bridge command.

Quick Tip – Put On and Bridge

To perform a bridge-like function at the same time, select both faces prior to Put On and Store | Selection. Use Put On, then Recall | Selection, Bridge, Cleanup, etc. This is quite quick, especially if on hot keys.


====Mirror====

Mirrors an object around one or more selected faces. By choosing multiple faces to perform Mirror multiple mirrors are performed simultaneously in the direction each face points. Thus care must be exercised on complex models least self colliding geometry be created. The Mirror command is most effective for doing symmetrical modeling, wherein only half of a model is built, then a mid model face is selected and Mirror used to create the other half of the model. If you maintain a clean central edge loop while modeling you can model, Mirror, continue to model, select the middle edge loop and do a Loop Cut, Delete the half of the model that needs to be updated, and then Mirror again.

Quick Tip: Fix that mirror plane.

If you use the Loop Cut, model, and Mirror method described above you will sometimes find that the object does not Mirror back together properly. This is often caused by the mirror face getting out of kilter i.e. non- planar, while modeling. Mirroring in such cases will cause a real mess. To fix it up, select the mirror face and do a Flatten on the appropriate axis to make it planar again. Then do the Mirror to make a whole object from the half. Finally, select Tools | Center All to get the whole thing re-centered in the workspace.


====Dissolve====

Deletes inner faces in a region of faces. You can also slice an object into several parts with the Dissolve command by selecting the faces that would separate the parts and doing a Dissolve. The parts will still be grouped as one object until you use the Separate command (in Object selection mode) to separate them.

DRAFT 1.6 83

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL FACE MENU | COLLAPSE

Deletes the selected faces, replacing each face with a vertex. The selection mode will be changed to Vertex, and the newly created vertices will be selected, allowing you to apply further commands.


====Smooth====
Connects all the edges of a face and tightens up the vertices so as to form a smoother shape from the original face. You can make round eyes from square faces with Smooth.

Quick Tip: Smooth To Check For Anomalies.

To check for self colliding 'internal' geometry smooth once and eyeball in wireframe mode, as it won't usually be obvious as an unsmoothed wireframe.


====Set Material====

'''New''' – Will prompt you for a Material Name in a pop-up dialog. Type in a new name of your choice and click OK. This will bring up the Material Editor as pictured here.

Here you can custom design a material to be applied to the selected face by setting the properties Diffuse, Ambient, Specular, Emission, Shininess, and Opacity. The ball on the left will show a preview of your material design and starts out as a neutral gray. To change any of the first four settings simply click on the box to bring up a color mixer. In the color mixer you can type in the RGB values in the fields on the left or use the slider bars to interactively mix the color. Once satisfied, click on OK. The ball on the left will immediately change to reflect your settings. Click OK again when you have finished adjusting all the settings to your liking. The new material will be added to the list of materials along with Default and Hole, with the name that you gave it. This new material can then be applied to any face selection you choose with the Face | Set Material command. The materials are saved with the model. In order to see it properly you will need to look at your model as Smooth Shaded, which you can do by pressing the Tab key. Note that a File | New will purge the materials list.

'''Default''' – will set the selected faces to the Default material color.

'''Hole''' – will set the selected faces to the Hole material color.


====Tesselate====

'''Triangulate''' – Will convert all the polygons in the selected faces to triangles. Some programs, such as game engines, expect models to be triangulated before import.

'''Quadrangulate''' – Will fix n-gon faces by converting them to quads whenever possible or to triangles if necessary. An ngon is a polygon with more than four edges. These are generally considered bad things to have in your model. This is often useful following a Face | Smooth since that type of smooth operation can result in adjoining ngon faces.

'''Figure 52''': The Wings Material Editor. Materials are assigned to faces, and therefore initially defined with the Material Editor accessed under the Face Menu. They can later be edited via the Material Editor accessed under the Edit Menu. 84 DRAFT 1.6

If one or more objects are selected, right clicking in the workspace will bring up the Object Operations Menu. This will allow you to Object Operations Menu – General

OBJECT MENU | MOVE

Free – Will move the selected object or objects in the direction of mouse movement. This can be very useful when in Orthographic mode, since it allows you to use the mouse to move objects in two cardinal directions while &quot;locking&quot; out movement in the third.

X – constrains movement along the x axis.

Y – constrains movement along the y axis.

Z – constrains movement along the z axis.

OBJECT MENU | ROTATE

Free – Will rotate the selected object(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains rotation about the x axis.

Y – constrains rotation about the y axis.

Z – constrains rotation about the z axis.

OBJECT MENU | SCALE

Uniform – Scales the object uniformly in all directions at once.

X – Scales the object along the x axis.

Y – Scales the object along the y axis.

Z – Scales the object along the z axis.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the object radially from the x axis; i.e. The size in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the object radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the object radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant. Figure 53: The Body or Object Menu.

OBJECT MENU | FLIP

X – will flip the object on the X axis. Y – will flip the object on the X axis. Z – will flip the object on the X axis.

OBJECT MENU | INVERT

Invert will flip all the normals of the model, in effect turning it inside out. This can be useful if an imported model loads into Wings inverted, i.e., the normals all pointing inwards instead of outwards. Invert will fix the normals so that they all point outward. It can also be useful to fix model parts that are created via Extract Region on inward facing

DRAFT 1.6 85

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL regions, though it may take some getting used to working inverted.

Quick Tip: A way to create the juice object inside a glass and have it line up.

On the inside of a glass or jug create a loop that defines the height of the liquid. Then select the loop, do a Shift-L to select the region next to it (Ctrl-Shift-I if it selects the wrong side). Do an Extract Region, Normal, and click without moving. This will separate off that area and make it solid. Switch to Body Mode (B), then do an Invert, which will flip the normals to align correctly. You now have a separate juice object that fits the jug exactly.

Tip provided by Mestela.

Quick Tip: Invert vs. Intrude.

With Intrude you can create a hollow object but the inside will be the same shape as the outside. Invert, on the other hand, can be useful to create an object that has a different shape on the inside than on the outside, connected via a bridged tunnel. Using invert, can put a totally different object inside another, invert the inner object, and bridge a tunnel between inner and outer objects, to get different inner/outer volumes. Tip provided by PuzzledPaul

OBJECT MENU | TIGHTEN

This will move all the vertices of an object towards each other, or away from each other. The effect is to round out or &quot;soften&quot; the model with a slight Tighten, or exaggerate the angles if you &quot;un-tighten&quot;.

OBJECT MENU | SMOOTH (S) This smoothes the model by performing a Catmull-Clarke subdivision on all the faces. This will have the effect of smoothing out angles between faces if they have not been set to hard, and eliminates poles by creating clean quad topology. If you want to maintain sharp angles in your model be sure to set the necessary edges to hard, either via the Edge Menu Hardness command, or by first doing an Auto-Smooth.

OBJECT MENU | COMBINE

This will combine the selected objects into one object. Unlike Mirror, it does not actually fuse or change any geometry. This can be very useful if you have a model composed of several parts and want to Scale, or Rotate them as a single entity. If you scale such a model without first using Combine, the parts will either pull away from each other or collide with each other since they all have their own local origins. Combine will allow you to scale everything together as if it were all one object, because they do indeed become one object. Objects need not be touching or even near each other to be combined. Object names previously assigned are lost.

OBJECT MENU | SEPARATE

If two or more objects have been fused via the Combine command, this will Separate them into their component parts. Former names will not be reestablished. Bodies that were separated by a Face | Dissolve operation can also be separated into separate bodies.

OBJECT MENU | CLEANUP

This command will find all non-intersecting vertices in the model and Collapse them. Good for maintaining the topological integrity of the model.

OBJECT MENU | AUTO-SMOOTH

This command will find all edges formed by sharp angels and automatically set them to be hard edges. Then when you Smooth the object, it will retain much of the original form and detail. By default the edge will be set to hard if the angle between the faces is more than 60 degrees. However you can set the crease angle by clicking on the parameters box to the right on the menu to suite your own needs.

86 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus OBJECT MENU | DUPLICATE

Creates a copy of the selected object. Moving the mouse before doing another click will move the copy in the desired direction as chosen in the sub-menu; Free, X, Y, or Z.

Free – Moves the newly created object in the direction of mouse movement.

X – The newly created object will move in +X or -X directions only.

Y – The newly created object will move in +Y or -Y directions only.

Z – The newly created object will move in +Z or -Z directions only.

OBJECT MENU | DELETE (Bksp or Del)

Will delete one or more selected objects. They can be recalled via Undo.

OBJECT MENU | MODE

This lets you shift from Vertex Color mode to Material mode on selected objects. Note that objects that have UV Texture coordinates cannot be shown with vertex colors.

OBJECT MENU | STRIP TEXTURE

This will strip the textures from an imported model.

OBJECT MENU | UV MAPPING (experimental)

This brings up the AutoUV utility, a subprogram to Wings3D. To execute AutoUV select the whole object you want to map and then choose UV Mapping (experimental) from the Object menu. The Wings geometry window will change to have only three icons at the top; Vertex, Edge, and Face selection icons. Furthermore, right clicking in the workspace will bring up a new menu (the AutoUV Menu). It is not immediately apparent what you need to do to work with AutoUV, so this and the next several posts will explore what the AutoUV options are and how to use them. Since AutoUV is experimental, all of this is, of course, subject to change. The next section will explain the use of this complex tool.

� Section 5.3 Advanced Men WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.3 Advanced Menus We have put off discussion of advanced menus because it is generally agreed that new uses are best off leaving them alone until they have a firm grasp of basic Wings operations. However, I strongly recommend that you become proficient with the basic operations quickly and turn Advanced Menus on, and then leave them on forever since they offer so much additional modeling capability. Here we will discuss the Advanced Menu system, explain the mechanics of their use, and detail the advanced menu options available to you.

You can turn on the Advanced Menus by selecting that option in the Edit | Preferences Menu. After doing so you will see some changes to the Wings pop-up context sensitive menus. Most notably, the small sub-menu indicators on the right side of the menus change from small arrowheads to

small dots. This is your visual clue that Advanced Menus are enabled. Also, the Lift command becomes available in the Face Operations menu.

What Advanced Menus do for you is enable secondary selections. This does not sound all that significant at first, but it is. Just what a &quot;secondary selection&quot; is may need a little explanation. After making your primary selection, say you select an edge, normally you will be given options to manipulate that edge along its normal, free, or along the positive or negative X, Y, Z axis only. Sometimes you would like to use another axis, or vector, to work from. This is what enabling secondary selections does for you. It allows you to define just about any vector as the axis of operation for a given command. Consider the simple example presented in Figure 54.

88 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.3 Advanced Men Figure 54: Standard vs. Advanced Menus.

In the top two panels are screen shots taken with the standard menus on. In 54.a you can see that we can move the selected vertex along its Normal, Free, or in the X, Y or Z directions only. 54.b shows the result of moving the vertex along X by 0.5 units. Now take a look at panel 54.c, where Advanced Menus have been turned on, and compare it to panel 54.a. Notice two things

immediately. First the arrowheads in 54.a have become small dots in 54.c. Second, the messages on the status bar have changed dramatically. Be sure to pay attention to the status bar when modeling in Wings, especially when you have Advanced Menus on, for very important instructions are given there. In this case the status bar is telling you that a Left mouse click [L] will allow you

DRAFT 1.6 89

� Section 5.3 Advanced Men WINGS3D USER MANUAL to move along the standard axis, just like normal, but that a Right mouse click [R] will allow you to select a user defined axis to move along. In panel 54.c we have clicked the Right mouse button and are now presented with a new interface which will allow us to make our secondary selections,

meaning that you can define virtually any vector with a bit of set up. It is also handy to note that if you only need one selection to define your vector you can use a single right click to select it and then drag to execute all at once.


Figure 55: The Wings magnets.

which in turn, will define our new axis (often referred to as a vector). Notice that the icon bar has changed to indicate that you can select vertices, edges or even faces to define this vector and the status bar is giving you new instructions (Panel 54.d). Make your selections (you can use more than one element to define the vector) with the Left mouse button and then Execute with the Right mouse button. Panel 54.e shows the newly defined axis as a thick blue line passing through the vertex we chose as the vector. Finally panel 54.f shows the result of a move along that axis, also by 0.5 units. As you can see, you get very different results. Note that you can use another object completely on which to make your secondary selections,

But that is not all that Advanced Menus do for you. By enabling Advanced Menus you also get access to the magnets in Wings. Remember in the example above we Right clicked on the Move command to enable secondary selections. We said if we left click we would get to work on standard axis only. But we also would see the magnets suddenly appear, as seen in Figure 55 below.

With Advanced Menus enabled, on many of the commands a Left click will reveal the Wings magnets as seen in Figure 55.a above. If you click on the actual command (Normal, Free, X, Y, or Z) you will work as normal without the magnets. But if you click on the little magnet icon to the right of the

90 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.3 Advanced Men command, then you will enable the magnets. Also notice that important instructions are being passed to you via the status bar once again.

In panel 55.a we have a vertex selected that we want to move but we want the movement to affect some of the surrounding vertices as well. So we left click on Move, which brings up the Move menu with magnets enabled. Then we hover over the magnet icon next to the X option and read the status line. The status bar tells us that we must use the left mouse button to define an area of influence, or fall off zone, for the magnet to affect, that a Middle mouse button click would allow us to enter a numeric radius as seen in Figure 56, and that a Right mouse button would use the last radius used. We then use the Left mouse button and select a set of vertices not too far from the initial selection, in this case three (one hidden from our current view) which results in a big blue dot as seen in panel 55.c. This dot indicates the center of the extent of our fall off zone. Now the status bar is giving new instructions, specifically, that you can begin the magnetic move with the Right click of the mouse. Panel 55.d shows the result of doing a magnetic Move. Keep in mind that you can use of the Middle mouse button to dolly around during this operation to get a good look at things as you go.

Further more, you can combine these two types of operations. You can define a vector and then Alt-Right Click to bring up a Vector+Magnet operation. Doing so bring up this little gem:


Figure 57: Vector Magnets revealed.


Just click on the little magnet icon and set up magnets as described before. You get the power of both vectors and magnets combined. Note that for users of Maya camera mode, Hold Ctrl instead of Alt while right-clicking. (This is shown in the help prompt in the status line.)

Finally, there is the new Face command, Lift, that becomes available when Advanced Menus are activated. The reasons Lift is only available with Advanced Menus is that it requires a secondary selection to use as the pivot for performing the lift. And secondary selections is what Advanced Menus are all about. Lift is explained in more detail in the following section.


Figure 56: The Influence Menu. Numeric entry of the magnetic fall off zone is accessed via the Middle mouse button.

� Section 5.3 Advanced Men WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.4 A little tutorial. The first thing you need to do is make sure that you have Advanced Menus activated. Under Edit | Preferences make sure the Advanced Menus option (near the bottom of the form) is checked. Then click OK to return to the workspace.

Create a cube and select the top face. Then right click in the workspace to bring up the Face Operations Menu. Now hover over Move. Don't click anything!

Read the status bar and notice that a left click will use the standard axes whereas a right click will use custom vectors. I hope you have realized by now just how important the message passing in the status bar is. I cannot emphasis it enough. Click the Right Mouse Button to begin using vector operations.

At the right of the status bar Wings will tell you to Select Axis for Face Move. This is how you will define the vector. Click on the positive Z face and notice the appearance of a blue vector. Now click on the positive X face and notice that the direction of the vector changed. You can continue to select and deselect faces until you get the vector going the way you want it to. You can even use a remote object for this vector definition process.

Once you are happy with the direction of your vector then click the Right Mouse Button. Now you can move the mouse and watch the face move along the vector you just defined. Notice the instructions on the status bar as you are dragging. It now tells you that you can constrain the movement by holding down modifier keys while dragging. Dragging with the Shift key depressed will cause movement to be constrained to whole units, while the Ctrl key will cause movement to be constrained to tenths of units. That's it. You now know how to use Wings vector operations. Just try doing this a couple of times then try a few of the other commands. You'll have the routine down in no time.

Now let's practice a little with magnets.

Delete your cube and bring up a Grid primitive; right click to bring up the Primitives menu and look for Grid in the list of primitives. Don't click it, instead, click the option box on the right to specify how big we want our grid to be. A little pop-up box will ask you to specify the number of Rows/cols. Enter 20 and click OK. Grids are great for seeing the effects of magnets.

Select a vertex four in from the +Z/+X corner as shown below (Figure 58.a). Now Right Click to bring up the Vertex Operations menu. Then Left Click on Move to bring up the options sub-menu (Figure 58.b). Click on the little magnet icon to the right of Normal. Now read the status bar and notice the icon bar has changed. At the right of the status bar Wings is telling you what you need to do while to the left it is telling you how to do it. Right now it is telling you that you need to select the magnet influence (fall-off zone) for the move operation and that you do this by Left Clicking some elements. The Icon bar is telling you that those elements can be vertices, edges or faces (with vertices being the default).

The fall-off zone is defined as a radius from the initial selection point, so we only need to pick one other vertex to define it. Pick one that is four vertices away from the initial selection (Figure 58.c). It shows up as a big blue square on the +X edge of my grid in this case.

Notice that the status bar is still telling us that a Right Click will execute the command. So let's Right Click now and see what happens when we move the mouse around. As you move the mouse around watch the status bar again. It will tell you by how much the original vertex is moving, but it also tells you the radius of the fall-off zone. But we already defined the radius, so what is that for? Well, you can change the fall-off zone radius interactively as you drag by using the plus and minus (+ -) keys as indicated on the right side of the status bar. Go ahead and press the Plus key a couple of times and see

The UV Mapping Segmenting Mode window. Note the new menu available in this mode. Here you will divide up your model into slices called charts which will be laid out on a texture map. You can hand create the charts or have wings do it for you.

UV MAPPING | SEGMENTING MODE

There is a new step in the autoUV, called 'segmenting'. You use the segmenting step to create charts and cuts. A chart is an area (a set of connected faces) of your model that will be mapped to a 2d surface as a separated area. You can let Wings do the work for you by clicking continue or if you want more control you can do it yourself in this window. This sections explains how.

When you enter the segmenting step, you'll have the model’s materials as your charts, you can use them as your charts by pressing 'continue'. You can also do it by hand to have more control over how the charts are

created. Select faces and choose one of the AuvChart[1-9] charts. If two, or more, groups of selected faces use the same AuvChartX they will treated as two, or more, charts if they share no edges. In this way you can create more than 9 charts.

Continue

Despite being on top of the list Continue will be the last thing you will do. When your satisfied with your charts (and cuts if your are going to use the unfold algorithm). Press 'continue' and choose the 3d to 2d mapper; method. Projection or Unfolding.

DRAFT 1.6 103

� Section 5.2 6 AutoUV Mapping WINGS3D USER MANUAL Continue | Projection

Projection computes the weighted normal for the chart (larger faces contribute more to the normal than smaller faces) and projects the 3d to chart on a 2d plane (This was the method used in the old autouv). Projection needs almost flat charts (2d planes) to be able to create a good 2d mapping. It will also use your materials as a guide to breaking up your model into smaller charts.

SEGMENT BY | PROJECTION

Continue | Unfolding

Unfolding computes a 2d drawing by unfolding the model mathematically, this method should be used when your charts isn't flat (close a 2d plane). If you have bad charts and cuts the unfolding algorithm may produce strange results, but provided good charts and cuts in the right places, the result should be acceptable.

When the mapping 3d to 2d is done you end up in the autouv window, which works as before.


There are basically three ways you can segment (or cut up) your model for UV mapping. Two of them are so fast and easy as to truly merit the name AutoUV. The third method is not much harder, once you get the feel for it, and much more suited for complex models. We will discuss the first two methods first, and save the third for last.

If your model is fairly simple in nature (such as my smoothed cube) it is a good candidate

for using one of the truly automated methods of segmentation. If you choose Segment By you will be given the choices of Projection or Feature Detection. Choosing Projection will segment the model so that faces are chosen based on which of the six primary axes they most closely approximate. Below you can see that my smoothed cube has been assigned six materials based on their orientation. This should minimize stretching in the UV map.

This option will automatically segment your model into the minimum number of charts necessary; often just two. Below you can see that my smoothed cube has been assigned two materials, breaking the model into two nearly equal sections. While this is very fast and easy, it could lead to layout and/or stretching problems later, when trying to paint the texture on the resulting map.

AuvChart1~9

Charts should be created with care, they should be used to minimize the stretching and still contain something that you are able to paint. Fewer charts is better from a user perspective because they are easier to paint on, but more charts will lay flatter so they will have less texture stretching. You will have to deside how best to divide the surface so that it is as flat as possible.



Note that I picked up where I left off, that the smoothed cube starts out here projected. You can switch back and forth between the two as long as you do not choose Continue.

The Segmenting Right Click Menu

The third option is to segment your model by hand. The task is to break up your model into as many charts as you need in order to make your model lay flat. A flat model will not have texture stretching, but if you make too many charts you will not be able to easily paint your textures. The art of proper chart number to ease of painting is a skill learned with practice. Once you have finished making your charts and appropriate cuts you click Continue | Unfolding

Mark edges for Cuts

A 'Cut' is used to simplify a chart for the UV Mapper to correctly spread out your charts on the texture. If you want to unfold a cube in one chart, you can do that by cutting the correct edges, or if you want a spherical or cylindrical mapping you must have cuts. A spherical mapping is done by making a cut between the poles of the sphere. And a cylindrical mapping is done by making three charts, two discs, one with a cut. See the image on the right.

Quick Tip: Using Cuts

In the cube example, there is only one chart. I selected the edges that are green and used


the command &quot;Mark Edge for Cut&quot;. I then choose &quot;Continue | Unfolding&quot;.

In the cylinder example, there are three charts. To have the middle part of the cylinder unfold properly, I have marked a single cut along one vertical edge. In this case I simply used &quot;Segment by | Feature Detection&quot; which created the charts and the cut automatically. I can keep the layout it gave me or do some minor edits. Once done I click the Continue | Unfolding.

Once you have decided on how to segment your model (via Projection, Feature Detection, or by hand) then you can use the Continue option. This will bring up a new window titled AutoUV, which will contain the

Quick Tip: Is having more charts better

I think the general rule is that fewer charts gives more stretching per chart but are easier to paint. Both these ops gives the user an initial suggestion, which they can alter, but feature detection shouldn't be used together with projection parameterization. Projection segmentation often gives more charts than feature detection.

Quick tip: Updating the UV Maps after edits to the mesh

Here is a tip that might not be obvious.

Let's assume that you have done some changes in the segmenting phase. You might have recolored faces or cut edges. You then do &quot;Continue | Unfolding&quot; and find that the

result is not quite what you expected. For instance, you might want to have chart cut or split in two.

Currently, there is no way to go back to the segmenting phase directly. But the following trick will work:

1) Quit and save all changes. 2) Use the &quot;UV Mapping&quot; command again. 3) You will be asked whether you want to edit the current UV mapping or discard the current UV mapping and start over. 4) Choose the second alternative -to DISCARD the UV mapping. The texture and UV coordinates will be discarded, but before they are discarded, AutoUV will use them pre-color faces and insert cuts according to the UV coordinates. 5) Do the needed changes.

The '''''Order of Operations''''' is used when doing expressions with more than one operation (e.g., &amp;times;, +, -). These are rules so you only get one answer all the time.

Example: When faced with &lt;math&gt;4+2 \times 3&lt;/math&gt;, how do you proceed?  

There are two ways:

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = (4 + 2) \times 3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 6 \times 3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3= 18&lt;/math&gt;
 
'''or'''

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 4 + (2 \times 3)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 4 + 6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 10&lt;/math&gt;

This is confusing, so which is correct? (Parentheses, &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; are used to show what to do first)

In order to communicate using mathematical expressions we must agree on an ''order of operations'' so that each expression has only one value.

For the above example all mathematicians agree the correct answer is 10.

You're probably wondering what this order is.

==The Standard Order of Operations==

Evaluate expressions in this order.

*Parentheses (evaluate what's inside them)
*Exponents
*Multiplication and/or division from left to right
*Addition and/or subtraction from left to right

===An Easy Way of Remembering===
Use this memory tool to help remember the order!

== Playing with Mathematics ==

To get yourself thinking about this, try this simple mathematical game:

Take the numbers 1 through 10 on the left side of an equation, and pick a number for the right side.

Example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 = 1

Now put operators between those numbers.  Only use parentheses when necessary. 

Example:
1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 - 10 = 1

Change the number on the right-hand side. Can you generate an expression for this number?  If not, can you prove why not?

Does this change if you change the order of the numbers?</text>

== A Quick Review... ==

What is the Cartesian Plane?

Named for &quot;the father of analytical geometry,&quot; 17th century French mathematician [[w:Descartes|René Descartes (Cartesius)]], uniform regular grid (Cartesian) coordinates is one system used for graphing.  Many algebraic expressions lend themselves to graphical analysis. The location of a point's [[w:Cartesian_coordinate_system | Cartesian]] plot is found by indexing numerical values (coordinates) along numbered grid lines. The trivial single '''R''' number line comprises a one dimensional, single ordinate, system  with all locations existing &lt;u&gt;only on&lt;/u&gt; that line. This study begins with graphing in two dimensions (see the two diagrams below).  Plots and points are located and labeled with the offsets of their 'projections' from two number lines ('''R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' axes) anywhere on the page and plane.  

[[Image:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|324px|thumb|left|The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system. The arrows on the axes indicate that they extend forever in their respective directions (i.e. infinitely).]]

We choose the values or ordinates for points on the Cartesian plane using two perpendicular numbered axes.  By convention the point where the two axes cross is labeled as 0 on each axis, making the ordinate for their intersection a special point called the origin and labeled (0,0). Generally, the horizontal axis is labeled ''x'' and the vertical axis ''y''.  An ''ordered pair'' (x,y) specifies the location of a point P on the plane.  If we don't want to talk about ordered pairs as x and y we can refer to the first variable in the ordered pair as the abscissa and the second as the ordinate.  The axes cross where the abscissa is 0 and the ordinate is 0.  We can generalize about the signs of the abscissa and ordinate in ordered pairs because the two axes form four ''quadrants'' when they cross. Moving counter clockwise, starting in the upper right quadrant, the quadrants are labeled I, II, III, and IV. In quadrant I, all x- and y-values are positive, in II, x is negative and y positive, in III, all values are negative, and only x is positive in IV. The ordered pair (0,0) represents the '''origin''' where the axes intersect.

We use the axes to define relationships between two sets of numbers for which we substitute variables.  A relationship implies that changing the value of one variable determines the value of the other. We call the variable that is changing the independent variable and the variable whose value changes the dependent variable.  Generally we let ''x'' represent the independent variable, ''y'' represent the dependent variable so that we can model the relationship between x and y with mathematical symbols.  The set of numbers represented by the independent variable is called the domain.  The set of numbers represented by the dependent variable is called the range.  A special kind of relationship is called a function.  A function is a relationship where any value in the domain maps onto one and only one value in the range.  

When we graph the points of a relationship on a Cartesian plane then we can determine if the relationship is a function--'''all''' vertical lines of the plane cross our graph once and only once.  Functions are useful for modeling cause and effect relationships - where the cause is the independent variable and the effect is the dependent variable.

| I || Positive || Positive
|- align=center
| II || Negative || Positive

| III || Negative || Negative
|- align=center
| IV || Positive || Negative
|}

Note that the only thing unique about the Cartesian plane is that it contains a point that we call &quot;the origin&quot; and have labeled (0,0)  If we draw another axis perpendicular to the two dimensional graph through the origin we can graph 3 dimensional objects ('''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''').  Imagine a thin extensible numbered wire through the origin of the two dimensional graph.  By using a 3rd coordinate this line (X, Y, Z) we can locate points that are above or below the page in space. This idea can be expanded to higher dimensions (including time) and is the basis for a field of theoretical physics called [[w:String_theory| string theory

==Determining Points==

Continuous sets of points can be represented by lines or curves on a graph showing how continuous paired quantities relate to each other.  Such numbers or quantities are called '''variables'''.  A function, relation, or equation can define how, as an input quantity varies, a related output quantity can vary. A graph can then illustrate  how these variables are related to each other. The '''independent variable''' is one which is sent to the function because a person can control or vary it at will. The dependent variable is the one that comes out of the function.  The definition of the function determines the value of the dependent variable depending on the value of the independent variable. 

Any equation which has two variables can effectively define a relation between the two variables and the relation can be plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate graph.  In  any particular equation, relation, or function definition, numbers which stay the same, i. e. which are not variables, are often called '''constants'''.  Even if someone does not know much fancy algebra, a person may start getting an idea of what a function or a two-variable equation or relation looks like in a graph by choosing various numbers for one of the variables from the domain and calculating corresponding numbers of the other variable (in the range) to determine as many ordered pairs as practical and plotting those points on a graph.  After enough points are plotted, one may be able to estimate what a continuous relation looks like by connecting the calculated points by a straight or curved line, depending on the situation.  


'''Exercise''':  For the function y = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1, set up a table so that you pick values for x (the independent value) and then calculate the value for y (the dependent variable)


&lt;center&gt;'''Table for various values of x and y : ''' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cell padding = &quot;2&quot;
 !width=&quot;30&quot;| x !!width=&quot;30&quot;| y 
 |- align=center
 | 0 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | 1 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | -1 || ?

 | -3 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | ? || ? 
 |- align=center
 | ? || ? 
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;etc. &lt;/center&gt;


Determine as many points as you feel comfortable to make a plot of this equation on a graph.  Then on graph paper draw x and y axes on a grid of squares.  Then plot the (x,y) ordered pairs as points on the graph.  Finally, when you think you have plotted enough points to get a feel for the shape of the function, connect the points to see what the function graph looks like.  If you are not sure in a part of the graph, you can always calculate more points to fill in that place.

==Plotting Points on a Graph==
A formula, equation or inequality that is solved for just a single instance of one variable is an '''implicit relation''' of, and '''dependent''' in, that variable in terms of the remaining and '''independent''' variable(s). An '''explicit''' relation is one noting which variable(s) is(are) independent. A '''point''' solution is a group of values (one for each independent variable) together with a corresponding calculated dependent value. Consensus-notation comma-separates these with the dependent variable's value last in an '''ordered group''' (parenthesis are optional '''iff''' there's no ambiguity). The independent variable's(s') valid-values solution '''set(s)''' constitutes the relation's '''domain''' and the dependent's its '''range'''. &lt;u&gt;A '''function''' is a relation restricted to independent value(s) which generate '''unique''' dependent values&lt;/u&gt;.

[[Image:Point_in_2D_Cartesian_coordinates.PNG|300px|left|thumb|In this plot the locus for (''x'',''y'') is the point (3,4).]]

A complete plot depicts all possible point solutions to a relation. 'One' independent variable plus 'the' dependent variable presents a 'two' dimensional map (graph) with 'two' '''perpendicular''' ('''orthogonal''') number lines ('''axes''') which cross ('''intercept''') at the '''origin''' ('''O'''). By consensus the first coordinate relates to offset along the horizontal axis and the second to the vertical (an '''ordered pair''').

This '''Function Graphing (section)''' uses a two-dimensional '''rectangular''' Cartesian coordinate system, the first coordinate is [[Wikipedia:abscissa|abscissa]] and commonly references an '''''x''-axis''' and the second is [[Wikipedia:ordinate|ordinate]] for a '''''y''-axis'''. The axes values are numbers and are elements of and '''closed''' to '''R''' and together constitute '''R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The origin point is the number pair '''0,0'''. Positive numbers increment to the right and up and negative numbers decrement to the left and down. The notation '''''x'',''y''''' is the common form/formula of an ordered-pair point and is plotted on/in the following graph.  

To remember the '''order''' of coordinates think of a roller coaster--&quot;If you do it '''RIGHT''', you might throw '''UP'''&quot;; or if the graph were a street with tall buildings--you have to go along the street (RIGHT/LEFT) before you can enter and go '''UP''' the stairs; or you crawl (RIGHT/LEFT) before you walk (Stand '''UP''').



The axes and '''plane''' '''field''' extend out as close to infinity (positive and negative) as is necessary for any analysis. In practice graphs are abbreviated to areas of examination. In our example the generic point ''x'',''y'' is assigned to number values (x = 3, y =4) by plotting it at point 3,4. A line and a dotted line show that this position is located by starting at (0,0), moving 3 '''units''' in the positive ''x'' direction (right), and moving 4 units in the positive ''y'' direction (upwards).</text>

{{Guide to Social Activity:toc}}

{{wikipedia|Courtship}}
[[Image:Daniele da Volterra 004.jpg|right|200px|&quot;Don't cry, love. He's really not worth all that.&quot;]]
&quot;'''Courtship''' or '''dating''' is the process of selecting and attracting a mate for [[w:marriage|marriage]], [[w:sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]], or other [[w:intimate|intimate]] activities.&quot; So claims Wikipedia.

In some parts of the [[w:United States|United States]], at least, the &quot;dating&quot; concept is very important. Dating is commonly featured in US music and movies, and is also a major feature of bars serving [[../Alcohol|alcohol]]. Some persons who give much attention to dating give almost no attention to other social activity.

The phrase &quot;[[wikt:getting|getting]] a [[wikt:date|date]]&quot; (and variants like &quot;getting a girl&quot;) has a variety of meanings in English. This text attempts to document the process of courtship, which is sometimes described (well or not) as the getting of a date.

=== Disclaimer ===
Though drawn from thorough research and established authorities, this module is at best a rough guide, and any courtship situation will be highly specific to both the courting party and the courted.  No single piece of advice will be appropriate for all people under the relevant circumstances.  Everything contained herein should be taken in with a good dose of scepticism as most of the advice when carried out ''will'' have unexpected results.  Any advice carried out without the exercise of good judgement could have harmful or undesired effects.

So you have a girl that is compatible. You know she likes you, or was attracted to you at some point in time, but things just went sour at some point and it is now awkward to talk to each other. Even though two people like each other, it can still be awkward if there isn't clear communication.
You are either not reading her signal to approach, not approaching her right away (taking too long), not starting with a leading comment (not saying the right thing). 

The simplest mistake and easiest to correct is taking too long. Use the three second rule. As soon as you know she's sending you a signal approach her right away and start with the right comment. Of course you'll need to know how to read signals and what to say. That is what we talk about next.

== Pick Up Her Signals ==

She will be giving out flirting signals. She will look at you, make an open circle with her girlfriends or brush her hair when you look at her. She might walk by you or loosen her blouse when you are around. Other less direct signals are when she stands alone and not busy and makes herself captive (captive audience).

She will go somewhere where she's alone and not doing anything in particular. It is somewhere in an open space where you can easily approach her. She might be looking at a board, or looking out the window or standing at the door, or sitting by a table in the middle of the room, or sitting in a sofa in the middle of the room. The area is very accessible. If no one is approaching her, that means it's for you. She shouldn't be busy with anything, only something trivial as an excuse to stand in that place. If she's really busy and still in a central location, just look at her and make eye contact instead of approaching her all the way.

She will make herself captive. Girls want you to come on to them to see your intentions and you have to do this or else she will not feel appreciated enough. But she doesn't want to look like a slut for being with you, or talking to you so forward. So what she will do is put herself into a situation where she can not leave, so that she has an excuse to listen to you. The key here is to not chase her away. Stop doing your spiel before she has a chance to leave and disengage before your time is up.

For example. This girl likes you, she moves into a cubicle next to yours in the office. She's made herself captive because now you can talk to her in between tasks. Let's say you work a nine to five day. You get off at lunch and at five o'clock. Lay off the lingo half an hour before lunch and half an hour before five. All the other time you are going to be flirtatious, forward even mischievous. Remember, she moved next to you to make herself captive. It's up to you to make a move. She will be calling you fresh and bad and calling your comments annoying and inappropriate which is ok as long they are flirtatious and not rude and as long as you cool off before you leave, half hour before lunch and half hour before five.

Girls make themselves captive in all sorts of ways. When they do, that means they want you to approach them and be a little too forward and use her being captive. Being too forward is ok as long as you keep it flirtatious and sexual as opposed to obnoxious or anything rude, no put downs. And as long as you disengage before your time is up, as a cool off. If you chase her away she will not come back, but if you cool off before the time is up, the cool off will make is seem ok to come back and she will make herself captive for you again.

Some examples of girls making themselves captive: sitting next to you during a class, sitting next to you in church during a sermon, sitting next to you during a bible study, sitting next to you during a shift at work. Two things. First she is the one who set's up the situation, she is the one who comes near you and sits with you no the other way around. Second, there is a particular duration so you know when your time is coming close so you know when to cool off.

Girls also crouch, they sit down on steps, or sit in an open space to read a news paper for fun. Psychologically it is harder to stop doing something to get up and walk away. As long as she's not actually busy with an assignment on the article in the newspaper, she's making herself captive. Use that opportunity, because if you don't she will feel neglected and not come back again.

Sometimes a girl would be on her way to walk past you, and just as she's next to you she kneels down to tie her shoes. Make a witty remark to be flirtation, something about how the thicker the show laces the harder it is to get them in the holes. And turn away to disengage before she has a chance to leave. This way you are not chasing her away and she will come by you again.

==Approach Right Away==

The next thing to know is once you have detected those signals from her, to move in right way and start talking. as long as you know that you have to respond right away, it shouldn't be a problem. If it doesn't go smooth just walk away. As a matter of fact it will not go smooth the first couple of times: you will have to approach a girl several times before she's comfortable. Move in right away and leave right away to give her personal space. Move out of her territory and turn away from her to cool things off. Mean while keep glancing back at her every couple of minutes or so for another signal. When you see the signal, you move in again and so on.

== Say The Right Thing ==

Sometimes things get awkward just because you are not saying the right thing. What ever the reason is, if it's awkward leave and wait for your signal again. It helps a lot knowing what to say. One of the worst mistakes is with a yes or no question. The only time you start with a yes or no question is when you approach her first without her giving you a signal, such as at a party when you first see her. If she already gave you a signal to move in, that is your yes, ask open ended questions.

One of the best things to say is a leading phrase. A leading phrase implies that there is move information and it directs where the conversation will go. For example: how awesome is this party? That is a leading question because it directs you to talk about the party being awesome. It doesn't ask are you enjoying this party? It verifies with confidence that this party is awesome.

Even better than a leading question is a leading phrase. A leading phrase is based on what you know about one word or one thing that the girl is doing at the present time. If a girl is next to you tying her shoes she is thinking one thing: shoe laces. Of course she's also thinking about work, dinner, the next assignment dues date, what ever. But at this point right now the one thing in her mind is shoelaces. Say one line, what ever you know about shoelaces.  Some of them are too thick and it's hard to get them into the holes. Add a little sexual connotation and you have got your self pick up line.

To figure out what to talk about look at what she doing. She might be stretching, eating, drinking etc. If she's not doing anything in particular notice what she's looking at. She could be looking at a picture on the wall, a puppy, a rose. Do not talk about this one particular rose, it's not an opinion. Say something what ever comes to mind that you know about flowers because that is her connection with you.

If she's not doing anything in particular, and she's not looking at anything in particular, notice what she's doing with her hands. She might be holding something, like playing around with a pen, then talk about that.
So the ingredients are to find the one thing that's on her mind right now at the present time. Some trivial simple little thing. Talk about what ever you know about those things, nothing related to the actual thing, but something from your own knowledge. Add sexual connotation. The whole process puts her and you together with sex involved and you've got the recipe for attraction.

It's not really that hard to approach women. Once you have figured out the formula for coming up with one liners breaking the ice will be easy. The hardest step is to do it right away, as soon as you get the signal from the woman. And the solution for that is off course to leave right away so you can wait for the signal and try again.

=== Complexity of dating ===
Men and women are remarkable creatures, and in some respects, easily predictable. The one most important thing they want, trumping all other concerns, is ''[[wikt:proximity|proximity]]''.

Or is it?

Generalisations are dangerous here. To suggest that persons are predictable or are seeking &quot;only one thing&quot; is to underestimate the complexity of modern dating.

From the anthropological or historical perspectives, courtship ought not to be difficult. After some initial tough competition, the male wins a female and their joining forms the basis of future progeny. Arranged marriages, marriages of convenience, inter-tribal relationships designed to seal a political connection (as with the Campbells and MacDonalds on the eve of the [[w:Glencoe Massacre|Glencoe Massacre]]) all suggest a time when the matter was out of the hands of the young man or woman.

On the basis of many of the greatest writings in the history of English literature, some claim that courtship should be natural, free and almost dreamlike, as fate guides two uplifted hearts together breathlessly. Others suggest that dating in contemporary society has become mechanical and deterministic.

=== Example process ===
Here is an example process:
# Locate a man or woman
# Get within ten metres
# Smile, make eye contact
# Prepare for the consequences

This oversimplification might not result in dating, but only social contact.

For the purposes of this text, the term '''partner''' is applied to each of the two persons that are dating. If the two partners remain in courtship after the first meeting, then they enter a day-to-day phase. For some partners, this is a time to explain their love to each other while investigating how or why the other person loves them. That is, you investigate the mystery of why your partner loves you. Also, you be honest and explain how, when, where, and why you like your partner. This means talking about oneself, and not what one does. (FIXME is there a difference?)

Both persons should maintain their extraneous interests, such as friends, careers, etcetera, but should also enjoy themselves together. The maintenance of these other interests supplies new topics to discuss with a partner, but the cessation of these activities can limit potential conversation topics, and appear needy and insecure. By making oneself available ''all'' the time, one removes the element of scarcity that is a component of attraction.

=== Where To Meet Women ===

To attract women takes exposure. Where ever you are, to get a woman to like you and to spend time with you will take time and work getting to know one another. That is why most places where people meet are where men and women frequent automatically because they don't have a choice. Women have no choice about going to work. The work place is the number one area where people meet often.
Everyone has to work. Even the most beautiful women have to make a living somehow. They go to work and they have to talk to the people that are there. At work you will encounter women as you carry on with the tasks of the day.  This brings us to the number one spot to meet women:

'''1. At Work'''

Statistics show that some 70 percent of married people got together at work. The key ingredients are time, getting to know each other and similar interests. Women search for men with similar talents to their own and none of the flaws in what is called compatibility. We all have flaws, but we try to limit those by meeting a person with different flaws of our own. When it comes to aptitudes and natural talents women look for men similar to themselves. This insured the dissolution of bad genes and concentration of good genes. At the same work place people tend to have similarities in their abilities, especially when is comes to the same lines of work. Combined with time and the opportunity to get to thoroughly know one another, the right people automatically click together. That is why it's so important to work at something you are good at and really enjoy.

'''2. Church'''

Church is supposed to be a spiritual place and not a dating service and yet it's a known fact that a lot of people meet and get married through church. The kind of church to join is one with similar background to yourself as well as your faith. The more similar people are the more chances there are for compatibility. Even in one denomination there are different locations. Join the one with people the most similar to yourself. The more you like the people there the more you will be eager to help out and as a result you will get noticed.

'''3. School'''

Studies show that people build special emotional bonds at an early age. The girls you have met in high school, especially near the age of sixteen usually will have a special memory of you. People were not meant to get married and have kids as late as they do in today's day and age. In the old times, girls used to get pregnant in their teens. Nature equipped girls with a special imprinting during those early years. Keep in touch with a girl you knew in high school. She probably has deeper feelings for you than you knew.

'''4. Friends'''

Needless to say, every group has their own spots they like to hang out at. It's different for every group of friends, but the facts are that a lot of people meet through a friend or a friend of a friend. It could be a buddies ex or a friend of your ex girlfriends friend, whatever the case. Most people consider it immoral to date your friends ex girlfriends, but look at it this way, statistically most people end up doing it anyway. Just don't hit on your friends current girlfriend or somebody that he is currently dating. Chances are she is more interested in him, and in this case jeopardizing the relationship is more than it's worth. 

The way to get access to your buddies girls is to be facilitating with you own female friends. This does two things. It makes you popular with the ladies because they want to meet guys just as much as we want them. Second, it gets your buddy to be less possessive. When he's involved with someone, she's not going to like him being jealous over someone else. This is when all of his female contacts become fair game.

'''5. Sports Teams'''

Gym memberships are increasing world wide. However, it's not in the gym or the wait room where couples tend to meet. Instead consider joining a team that gets together once or twice a week on a regular basis. Good sports are volleyball, soccer and Frisbee. These are usually stand alone organizations you just have to find them. The idea is that team sports set the tone for interaction. Also, body smell such as from sweating during physical activity helps females determine genetic compatibility from pheromones and Androstenone smell. To recap, yes most successful marriages do start off in the work place or from the high school years. However, with the right ingredients of time, compatibility and interaction other places could be an opportunity for meeting women as well.

'''6. Grocery Stores'''

As with work, everyone has to go to the grocery store or supermarket.  Again, this includes even the most beautiful women.  One advantage of supermarkets is that single men and women, as well as single parents, must shop there.  Also, visits to the supermarket are likely to be very frequent, as frequent as for example going to church services.  It is thus possible to meet and get to know men or women by regularly visiting your local supermarket.  In the UK, Sainsbury's stores are particularly good for meeting potential partners.

So can you meet a woman just about anywhere? Successful pickups have happened at bars, clubs, coffee shops, mall, elevator you name it. It's not a question of getting a date. To find the right woman takes time with her and getting to know her.  Meanwhile, all those other places are great practice.

== A World on Two Wheels ==

[[File:Oxford bikes.jpg|thumbnail|350px|right|Welcome to the Bicycles Wikibook!]]

Bicycles are one of the most ubiquitous forms of transportation in the world. Most children remember their first bike; with it came the chance to explore their world with more freedom than ever before.  As we grow, however, bicycling becomes more than just a childhood rite of passage. Wind in our hair and feet on the pedals, we have several good reasons to climb on and take a trip. Much of the world uses bicycles as a primary form of daily transportation. What would take several hours of travel on foot becomes faster and more efficient on two wheels. Some cyclists take trips across entire states or cross-country solely on a bicycle. Reaching speeds of 15-19 miles an hour(24-30 km an hour) is achievable by even beginning cyclists, while more experienced riders can reach speeds equivalent to automobile travel. &quot;Century riders&quot; travel 100 miles or more within a typical day. Not to be constrained by simple transportation, bicycles (stationary and otherwise) have helped people become healthier by losing excess weight and improving cardiovascular fitness. The exercise benefits of cycling are well known. Using the largest muscles in the body, bicycling allows riders to reach aerobic heart rates that drive up metabolism, and give a good workout. With the relative newcomer in the bicycle world, mountain bikes, this form of transportation is taking us on rugged terrain once thought impassable by anything other than hiking boots or pack animals. Extreme sport enthusiasts have adapted the bicycle to perform gravity defying stunts, such as flips and mid air acrobatics, in a style known as BMX (Bicycle Motorcross). In short, bikes remain a popular way to get people between points A and B, whether those destinations are found on a map, from one state of health to another, or to explore the unknown.

Bicycles have become an important part of the landscape. Most people understand the saying, &quot;as easy as riding a bike.&quot; Or we understand that some dormant skill is easy to pick back up if it's &quot;just like riding a bike.&quot;  Likewise, many immediately think of bicycles when we make an allusion to &quot;coasting&quot;, &quot;picking up speed&quot;, or &quot;going downhill&quot;.

==''Wikibook'' Bicycles==
This wikibook will examine bicycles from various perspectives. The book aims to appeal to the complete beginner, the potential cyclist, and budding or seasoned bicycle mechanics. We will look at choosing the &quot;right bike&quot; for what you want. We will also examine the kind of gear you might want for your bike. Then we will see how to maintain and repair your investment. Unlike automobiles which require knowledge of the internal combustion engine, electrical systems, and a series of other intricate assemblies, bicycles are relatively easy to diagnose and (oftentimes) fix.  Many road riders include a small mechanic's kit that fixes many roadside mishaps.  Likewise upgrading a bike is relatively pain free, with the exception of some more exotic parts. Many bikes can be upgraded by changing out a few key components such as brakes or shifters. Furthermore, many bicycles can be modified by the owner to better fit their cycling needs.

== New Page ==
I'm new to WikiBooks but I just created my first page on accidentals. I do not know if it fits the WikiBook format but I tried my best! 
-Sage Jim

==Purpose==
What is the intent of this wikibook? Is the Piano wikibook, as it is, aiming for a more informative angle - telling readers ''about'' the piano? If so, we wouldn't need chapters on improvisation and practice. 
I want the book to slant toward teaching readers how to actually play the instrument, eventually going into deeper music and complicated techniques. I don't think duplicating the 'structure of the piano' and 'how it works' is really necessary, because that's already on Pedia.
I'm new to Books, so I'd appreciate if someone could clean up the Pedal page I've started as well.
--[[User:Zen.|Zen]] 10:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
:Yeah, I would like it if this book teaches how to play it as well, just like the language wikibooks. --'''''&amp;nbsp;[[User:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:125%;color:#00CC00&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#AAAAAA&quot;&gt;YSON&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;1991&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''''' 03:40, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

==Chords==
The chords are wrong. They all should be in same inversion, or otherwise it will be confusing for the beginners.

[[User:Masahiko|Masahiko]] 11:18, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

In Response:
Actually, the author is trying to show a simple chord progresson. This is one of the basic chord progressions. He/She is also showing that chords don't always have to be the same three notes in the same basic pattern. But I do agree with you Masahiko, this would be very confusing for beginners and the chords should be shown in their &quot;natural&quot; state and not in a inversion until the inversion has been taught and explained. 
--[[User:CherryT|CherryT]] 00:40, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

==Improv?==
How about chapters on basic and intermediate improvisation techniques, the pedals and pedaling techniques, stylistic concerns (like... not using pedal in baroque pieces). Maybe we could even include simple drills for learning chords and getting the hands comfortable on the keyboard? Fun ways to play with scales? Learning piece suggestions? I could make some basic animations, given time. But I think this book needs a lot of work. :)
--[[User:Akashayi|Akashayi]] 18:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

Great Ideas! I need to do something for them! I will begin to work now. But I will not do anything related to improvisation, because I am myself dull and boring in it.
[[User:Masahiko|Masahiko]] 20:59, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

Improvisation can be applied if some theory is known by using pentatonic scales. I think the scales section needs some work as well. you can introduce the dorian, frigian or locrian scales but i don't see the notes that you play for them. i would first explain the basic scales (major and minor) and then go onto intervals and making people see the relationship and importance of intervals for identifying scales and the construction of chords. Then I could move onto playing some chords and then we can come to augmented and diminished chords, adding &quot;blue notes&quot; to some of them and such. The problem is that piano usually is the basis for musical theory and you have to introduce it wether you like theory or not.

== Sections for deletion? ==

i was confused about the categorizing of some well constructed chapters as part of the new &quot;categories to be incorporated or deleted&quot;. The titles seem to be worthy of their own page and i could not find another article which would easily mesh with them. does anyone know why they were categorized like this?

I think improvisation could be on this book, although if this book aims at beginers we must introduce music theory as well. You really cannot play piano without the theory. If you have your hands on theory your improvisational skills will surely improve. You can also listen to recordings and learn from them if you can pick out the pieces by ear, or even better to see notes separately, use midi. I have introduced most concepts into the intervals chapter but if this is aimed to play for the beginer then I don't see why we need to explain chord progressions and other stuff. Piano is really difficult to understand at length because the diversity of styles and how broad the music theory is. Many atempt to learn piano and want to play like proffesional pianists such as Michael Camilo or the more famous classical pieces by mozzart. Unfrtunately many will be frustrated because of lack of practice and mostly patience. I think we could separate books by levels: Beginners, intermediate and advanced. I still strongly suggest the addition to music theory as it makes the piano more suitable for mostly everything. If you do have the talent to improvise naturally and mix theory along with your playing (like I do) you will eventually find out that theory can help you when you don't have things on mind to call for improvisation. Learning classical music first is a really good basis to develop finger dexterity and will really help you playing many styles, especially montunos. In fact, playing such styles can be considered as a language that has to be spoken, but mostly felt. That is why music theory can sound really boring to many but knowing some theory and having experience playing really does help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Habitat creation as a distinct ecological movement can be traced to the choice of the topic of 'Ecology and the Industrial Society' by the British Ecological Society for its fifth symposium, held at the University College of Wales, Swansea, on 13 - 16th April, 1964 (Goodman, Edwards and Lambert, 1965). It was a time in the 1960s when ecologists became aware of the contribution they could make to solve the special environmental problems created by urban and industrial living.  Academics were stepping tentatively out of their ivory towers into the real world.  Ecologists emerged into a decade when it had became clear on many fronts that the United Kingdom had passed through the 'industrial revolution phase' of economic development.  Unwanted side effects of the use of land and water for mass production had become obvious, such as the disposal of industrial and urban wastes, and had clearly brought about land dereliction on a scale and severity that was previously unknown. These impacts serious created large-scale problems of pollution, erosion, flooding, loss of wildlife, and unsightliness.

The organisers of the Swansea conference felt that ecologists had something important to offer in the recognition, analysis and solution of these problems.  In applying ecological thinking that was traditionally derived from investigating more &quot;natural&quot; communities, it is clear that ecologists can often forecast the likely outcome of a particular urban or industrial development on the local biological processes. This, in turn, may lead to ways of modifying further developments, and cleaning up past outcomes, so as to avoid any economically or aesthetically undesirable long-term side effects in the environment. It was recognised that although restoration of derelict land and polluted water was an important part of modern planning, applied ecology could produce new industrial operations aimed at solving the problems and at the same time create stable diverse habitats.

In his opening address, the botanist, A. R. Clapham, outlined the main theme of the conference as the solution of problems involved in shaping new ecosystems or restoring old ones. In other words it would involve the deliberate determination of a recipe for the correct floristic composition and structure as a starting point for producing a viable ecosystem.  This prescription had to meet a new objective for purposes other than agricultural.  In Clapham's view, these 'contrived ecosystems' would be needed more and more, as the principles of multi-purpose land-use become more widely understood and accepted, especially for recreation and amenity.  

The conference recognised that there would often be great difficulty in achieving a permanently satisfactory result, other than by prolonged trial-and-error, unless applied ecologists played a part in planning the operation and continued to give advice.   Otherwise there would be danger of a situation in which technological expertise might outstrip ecological understanding, or in which the technologist went ahead without prior consultation with the ecologist. What was needed for the future was a synthesis of an ecological technology, for which there would need to be some strategic preparation, and long-term conservation management systems.

Among the chief factors causing the formation of industrial wasteland are the production and disposal of industrial and domestic refuse and the creation of post-industrial barren land, such as unsightly heaps and pits by mining, and quarrying activities, and the sites of former factories and industrial infrastructure. 

Even in the 1960s, in many countries throughout the world, attempts were being made to prevent this misuse of land and, where it has happened, to reclaim it. Ecological studies had indicated that the absence of vegetation on this type of land was mainly due to either fresh disturbance by machines, or the detrimental effects of persistent site factors.  These factors were toxic ingredients, the unstable nature of the waste material, erosion, or air pollution.  Reclamation schemes were being undertaken in all European countries, from Hungary to the United Kingdom and also across the Atlantic Ocean, and in South Africa and Malaysia.  There was extensive forestation on American strip-mines; the Danish 'Desert Arboretum' was founded on lignite spoil banks, topsoil management was underway in Czechoslovakia, and there were rehabilitation schemes in UK county of Lancashire.   Some of the biggest projects involved forestation of colliery waste in the Ruhr basin, and the combination of mining, agriculture, and forestry to build up new land in the Rhineland. From these very beginnings, ecological principles and experimental evidence have been further developed to return wasteland to economic or recreational use.  The over riding objective was been the production of an ecosystem that restores a productive and visual amenity 

Since the 1960s ecology applied to habitat creation has been exended to intensive agricultural systems where it has encompassed meadows, ponds and wetlands.  The term ‘wilding’ has recently been given to large-scale projects to created contrived ecosystems on land previously used for agriculture or forestry. These schemes are taking place on a suck-it-and see approach with minimum interference except for controlling visitors. Wildings cannot replace primeval systems that have been lost through economic development, but they have the potential to act as more stable refuges for wildlife and offer the right scale for offering people spiritual and aesthetic contacts with ‘big nature’.  Most landscape architects regard ecological science as an important source of principles.  Planting native trees and shrubs on a housing or industrial estate is of more value than filling in with a collection of Japanese Cherries and ornamental-leafed Maples.  Applied ecology is also becoming a force in garden design, where urban gardeners are starting to care about what kind of an impact they have on the environment. For example, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection website advises gardeners to: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Use Native Plants: A built green landscape uses native vegetation that competes well with weeds and other pests. These plants are native to your region and climate. Emphasize plant diversity with a palette of plants that naturally grow together, are reseeding, and spread without much maintenance. This strengthens the ecology of your yard requiring less fertilizer and pest control. Native plants also attract more birds, butterflies and other wildlife.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since urban dwellers are now in the majority, the parks and gardens in towns and cities have major potential for increasing biodiversity, and what the town gardener decides to plant in a container or garden, is a very important factor in determining local biodiversity.  
 
The choice of Swansea for the Ecological Society's meeting in 1964 was significant in that a large area to the north, in the lower valley of the River Tawe, was one of the most extensive areas of industrial wasteland in Britain. Of about 300 ha of derelict land, around half was covered by almost bare waste-tips between 3-30 metres high.  These were composed of slags derived from ores after extraction for heavy metals.  A pioneer cross-disciplineary research project in the University, involving ecologists, microbiologists and conservators, had been investigating the area with a view to total rehabilitation.  These pioneer ecological studies have long since been applied to create a new, clean, and ecologically productive environment in the Tawe valley and have been duplicated in similar areas of industrial dereliction elsewhere. By and large knowledge and experience has been directed towards the following four approaches:

# Accepting the site conditions as they are after the wasteland has been left by industry, and planting the area with pioneer plants of low requirements.
# Changing infertile or polluted sites by re-shaping the contours and by adding soil amendments before or after planting.
# Planning the future land use before displacing the waste, and following this by restoring fertility to the site to a state that may easily become productive once more.
# Allowing former farmland and plantation forest develop as large contrived ‘wildings’, gathering information on the processes involved through surveillance with minimum habitat management.

The first three approaches are bound up with the flows of industrial and domestic waste through the human food chain.  All wastes are now a significant part of the planetary system.  Ecological knowledge is required for application at all levels of their disposal, from finding sites, coping with mining wastes, hazardous wastes, air pollution, water pollution, pesticides, waste heat, radioactive wastes, and coping with the greenhouse effect and breaks in the ozone layer. Sound scientific knowledge is required not only to minimise undesirable effects but also to get an accurate and balanced picture of threats and future risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Current state of the book==

This wikibook project is in its first stage, which is to decide the chapters to be included and summarise what they should contain.  At the present time, editorial effort is directed towards the writing of introductions to each chapter. This is also a process of selecting the main subsections for each chapter.  These will eventually appear as ‘pages’ indented in the table of contents.  

Contributors are reminded that it is a textbook to provide an up to date review of important areas of applied ecological knowledge for advanced level university students and site managers.

==Definition==
Applied ecology is a framework  for the application of knowledge about ecosystems so that actions can be taken to create a better balance and harmony between people and nature in order to reduce human impact on other beings and their habitats.

==Scope==

===In situ and ex situ conservation systems===

With respect to scope, it is intended that the book should contain a body of knowledge about the use of ecological theory and principles to solve problems associated with the intensive human use of the environment.  It is beyond our capacity to return Earth to a primeval state, but what we can do is build a technological ‘ark’ to retain as much ecological integrity as possible. To achieve this, many aspects of ecology have to be applied to manage conservation systems where the maintenance, restoration, and creation of diverse and healthy ecosystems are principal objectives.  

Some conservation systems may be broadly classified as in situ operations.  These include:

*protection of rare species and habitats;
*restoration of industrial wasteland and the mitigative creation of new ecosystems;
*using wetland ecosystems for treating wastewater;
*environmental valuation in relation to the needs for conservation and development to go hand in hand;
*integration of sustainable ecosystems with commercial enterprises, such as agriculture and nature tourism;
* study of the ecology of human diseases in relation to their control.  

Other kinds of conservation systems are classified as ex situ. These include operations in zoos, botanical gardens, museums, and germ plasm stores.  The objectives are to provide breeding populations of plants and animals for reintroductions, and maintain a classified biodiversity inventory of specimens and genetic resources.

===Conservation management===

These conservation systems all overlap with each other, but they broadly define topics that most people would recognise as covering distinct applications of management practices to ecosystems, where the outcomes benefit humankind.  Each one could be developed as a chapter of this book, but it is important to think hard before initiating a new chapter, because its principles may fall into an existing one. The unifying principle that brings the topics together is that they all centre on the management of species and habitats. A common objective is long-term sustainability, and it is in this sense that the planning and operation of conservation management systems is the practical point of focus.

===The endangered resources===

In 1974 Norman Myers estimated the annual loss of tropical ecosystems to be about 240,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This was the outcome of commercial timber extraction, farming operations and fuel gathering; a combination of economic objectives and the subsistence behaviour of native peoples.  Biodiversity represents the very foundation of human existence.  Besides its profound ethical and aesthetic implications, a loss of biodiversity has serious economic and social costs.  As an essential resource, future changes should be tracked through the collection and dissemination of scientific knowledge on a global scale.  It was in this spirit that UNEP commissioned the Global Biodiversity Assessment (GBA) project, which reported in 1995 as a first step to assemble an inventory of Earth’s endangered biological resources.

===New societies and cultures===

The application of ecological principles and knowledge to environmental issues of world development is changing the way societies value natural resources.  This new understanding is having a cultural impact through changes in the behaviour of governments, communities and families.  This is mainly the result of a combination of publicity and legislation.  For example, in 1977 the Countryside Commission for England and Wales organised a national campaign to persuade farmers to enhance the wildlife and scenic value of agricultural land.  Although this particular campaign did not halt the destructive ecological outcomes of intensive agriculture, it marked the beginning of a process of change in agrarian culture.  This is now obvious throughout Britain, largely because of a shift in the system of farm subsidies away from production towards the creation of environmental goods.  

Education is another important factor in creating a culture of sustainable development. This requires the promotion of a knowledge system linking culture and ecology.  The aim is to present economic development alongside the work of organisations in society that are promoting the conservation of natural resources.

� Section 8: Plug ins WINGS3D USER MANUAL 8.7 Books 3D Modeling and Surfacing by Bill Fleming, © 1999 by Academic Press; 340 pp. This is the best general introduction to 3D Modeling I have found. Over half the book is dedicated to principles of polygon modeling in one form or another, plus he explains NURBS based modeling, and the principles that deal with texturing. This is not a tutorial, it is a general discussion of principals and practices. Well worth while.

Principles of Three-Dimensional Computer Animation by Michael O'Rourke, © 1998 by Michael O'Rourke; 285 pp. I found the modeling portion of this book to be too elementary to be of much use, but am finding the sections on Rendering and Animation very informative since I have little background in those areas. He explains the theories behind lighting, texturing, atmospheric effects, keyframing, and inverse kinematics among other things. It reads much more like a text book than I would like, but it is very informative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">YafRay is an external ray-trace renderer you can download from;

http://www.yafray.org

There is an article about Wings/YafRay integration on the YafRay wiki which you can access here: 

http://wiki.yafray.org/bin/view.pl/UserDoc/Wings3DMihnea

Follow the directions to install it to your hard drive. Once installed you will need to add it’s location to your path. The path is a list of locations that will be searched for software.

WINDOWS

In windows 98 you edit your autoexec.bat. in it you will see a line that reads something like Path=C:\; C:\windows; C:\windows\system; etc… At the end of this list of locations add a semicolon, a space and c:\yafray

When you restart your machine it will be added to the paths.

Windows 2000/Windows XP uses the same convention but in a different place. you right click on My Computer Click the advanced tab. Then click on the variables button. Here you will find two windows with various settings. Look in the lower one labeled System Variables. You should see a variable named path. Double-click it and it will open a property panel to change it. Add ; C:\yafray to the end of the list of paths (only use one ; between each path) If no Path variable is there add it by clicking the New button under system Variables.

Variable Name is Path Value is C:\yafray . A YafRay plug-in comes with Wings3D, when Wings3D starts the plug-in looks to see if the YafRay software is installed. If Wings3D can find YafRay in the path then it will add it as a render choice as shown in the image above.

Also, if Wings3D finds YafRay as noted above, you can go to the Wings '''''Edit menu -&gt; Plug-in Preferences''''' and '''''YafRay''''' will appear as an option.

Selecting the YafRay Plug-in Preferences menu results in the following dialogue box:

[[Image:Wings3D YafRay prefs.png]]

Dialogue dropdown list: ''later''

Executable: This should be where YafRay is installed on your system. If it is not correct, use the ''Browse'' button to navigate to it's actual location.

Options: This is where you can enter additional command line options for Wings3D to feed the YafRay command line renderer. They are as follows:
        -s Render using the specified strategy.  Valid values are
                &quot;threaded&quot;: Multi-threaded (default)
                &quot;mono&quot;: Single process
                &quot;fork&quot;: Multi-process

        -c N    Number of threads/processes to use
        -z      Use Net optimized

        -p PATH YafRay's installation path

        -r min_x:max_x:min_y:max_y      Render region, values between -1 and 1
                                        whole image is -r -1:1:-1:1

        -v      YafRay Version

In the above image you can see the ''-c'' option is set to the value of ''2''
This will cause the YafRay renderer to use both processors of a dual CPU system or both &quot;sides&quot; of an Intel HyperThreaded (HT) processor.

Be warned, however. Do NOT use this option unless you want to surrender any further use of the computer while it's rendering. Using this option will peg both processes to 100% CPU utilization while rendering, so forget about doing anything else while rendering. It's useful for speeding up quick previews, or for speeding up those long &quot;set it &amp; forget it&quot; renders, but if you want to get caught up on your e-mail or surf the 'net while rendering, stick with the default setting (put nothing in the &quot;Options&quot; field or the YafRay Options dialogue box).

The ''-p'', and ''-r'' options are set by Wings3D's YafRay render dialogue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus The key to the Wings3D user interface is the use of context sensitive pop-up menus. These menus are accessed by right clicking in the workspace. There are a total of five context sensitive menus; the Primitives Menu, the Vertex Menu, the Edge Menu, the Face Menu and the Object Menu, not to be confused with the Objects Menu on the Main

Menu). Depending on what is selected, different menus will pop up presenting the user with operations that are applicable to the current situation only. In this way the interface is kept clean and simple, a joy to work with compared to many overly complex user interfaces found in some graphics and modeling packages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">5.2.1 The Primitives Menu Primitives Menu – General

Figure 45: The Primitives pop-up menu. To bring up the Primitives Menu, right click on the empty workspace, or on a workspace where nothing is selected. You will be presented with a list of available primitives to add to your workspace. Left click on one of the primitives to add it. It will be added to the center of the scene as an unselected object at it's default size. You may need to turn other objects' visibility off (via the Objects Menu) in order to find the newly added object. The complete list of standard primitives is given below. Notice that some primitives have a little box icon to the right of their name. This is the Options Box for that primitive. If you click on the primitive name you will add a default primitive, whereas, if you click on the options icon you will be presented with some options (number of sections, number of slices, etc.) that you can change.

Tetrahedron – a four sided object; a triangular pyramid. Octrahedron – an eight sided object. Octotoad – A twenty-six sided object, unique to Wings. Designed by Mike (roadtoad), the host of the Wings discussion forum, and added to the Wings primitives as a tribute to the great service this board provided in the further development of Wings3D. Dodecahedron – a solid object with twelve faces. Icosahedron – a solid object with twenty faces. Cube – Plain and simple. What most models start out as. Cylinder – Click on the options button (the little box on the right) for the Sections option. A Windows dialog box will come up showing the number of sections in the cylinder (16 by default). You may change this and then click OK, or click Cancel. If you do not click on the options button, but simply click on the name Cylinder, then a default cylinder will be added (with 16 sides). Cone – Sections (16 by default). Sphere – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default). Torus – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default).

DRAFT 1.6 69

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Grid – Rows/Cols (10 by default). There is only one variable, so you must have the same number of rows and columns in your grid. After it is added you can change this by Dissolving some of the edges or by Connecting some of the edges to suite your needs. The default thickness of the grid is

0.2 units. Light – Adds a light to the scene. Wings supports four types of lights; Infinite, Point, Spot, and Ambient. Infinite lights act much as the sun, so that the light rays are essentially parallel as they pass equally throughout the workspace in the same direction. A point light is like a light bulb, radiating light equally in all directions from it's source. A spotlight casts light in a cone shape, in a general direction but spreading out so that the rays are not parallel. Finally, ambient light is the general background light present everywhere. It has no locational source nor direction. Since ambient light is everywhere from all directions it can cause your model to look completely flat if used by itself. So always use ambient lights in conjunction with other light sources.4 Lights in Wings are further explained in the Help Menu under Light Basics. Light parameters are adjusted by selecting a light and then right clicking to bring up the Light Operations Menu. Image – The Image Primitive is simply a plane that has an image pasted on it. The image can be a BMP, TIFF, or Targa file all of which must be 24 bits deep. Simply select Image, then select the type of image from the sub-menu, then navigate to the image file you want to use. Be aware that Wings works with images sized by powers of 2 (1024x1024 or 64x128 for example). This does not mean that Wings will not load your image if it is not so sized, but it will pad it to be powers of two prior to displaying it. This should be transparent to the user. Once you load the image a plane will appear centered on the screen standing up vertical on the Z axis. You can use this as a reference plane to assist you in your modeling. You can use two Image primitives to perform a modeling technique know as Rotoscoping, where one 4Principles of Three-Dimensional Computer Animation, Revised Edition; Michael O'Rourke; W.W. Norton &amp; Company, © 1998; pp. 89-92.

image is from the front and the other from the side of a given subject. You can then arrange the image planes into an L shape and use Orthogonal views to sculpt your model to fit the images. Text – Adds a text string as a 3D object. If you click on the box to the right of Text you will get a pop-up options box. Here you can enter your text string, the name of any TrueType font you have on your system, the directory where the font resides (C:\windows\fonts for example) and the number of edge bisections to make. The more bisections you make, the more complex the model will be. I recommend you leave it set to zero at least for starters. OK will create the text as a fully 3D model in your workspace. Cancel will abort the operation. MORE – This brings up a sub-menu of additional primitives available in Wings.

Torus Knot – Originally a plug-in by Anthony D'Agostino (scorpius) it is now included as part of the standard Wings distribution. This simple plug-in creates a torus knot with the absolute minimum possible number of faces and vertices. It is meant to be used as an input &quot;cage&quot; for the Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm. The knot was created with Blender by extruding a Bezier circle along the path of a NURBS curve.

Spiral – Loops (2 by default), segments (16 by default), Sections (8 by default). You can change the number of Loops, Segments and Sections by clicking on the Options Box on the right side of the menu.

Spring – Loops (2 by default), segments (16 by default), Sections (8 by default). You can change the number of Loops by clicking on the Options Box to the right.

UV Torus – A more sophisticated version of the torus. Here you can specify the U Resolution (80 by default), the V Resolution (16 by default), the Major Radius

(1.0 by default) and the Minor Radius (0.2 by default) by clicking on the box on the right of the menu. Lumpy Torus – A variant of the UV Torus that adds two more parameters; Lumps (8 by default) and Lump Amplitude (0.5).

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.2.3 The Edge Operations Menu Edge Operations Menu – General

If one or more edges are selected, right

Figure 50: The Edge Menu. clicking in the workspace will bring up the Edge

Context Sensitive Menu. This will allow you to perform operations unique to edge manipulations.

EDGE MENU | MOVE

Normal – moves the selected edge/edges along their normal.

Free – Will move the selected edge/edges in the direction of mouse movement. This can be very useful when in Orthographic mode, since it allows you to use the mouse to move edges in two cardinal directions while &quot;locking&quot; out movement in the third.

X – constrains movement along the x axis.

Y – constrains movement along the y axis.

Z – constrains movement along the z axis.

EDGE MENU | ROTATE

Connected edges will rotate about their collective center of mass. Non-connected edges will rotate about their individual centers of mass.

Free – Will rotate the selected edge/edges in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains rotation about the x axis.

Y – constrains rotation about the y axis.

Z – constrains rotation about the z axis.

EDGE MENU | SCALE

Increases or decreases the length of the selected edges.

Uniform – Scales the selected edges uniformly in all three directions at once.

X – Scales the distance of the edges along the x axis.

Y – Scales the distance of the edges along the y axis.

Z – Scales the distance of the edges along the z axis.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the length of selected edges radially from the x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the length of selected edges radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the length of selected edges radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.

EDGE MENU | EXTRUDE

As with vertex extrusions you can use the plus and minus (+ -) keys to increase or decrease the base area of the extrusion.

78 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus Normal – extrudes the selected edge or edges along their normal(s).

Free – Will extrude the selected edge/edges in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

Y – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

Z – constrains the extrusion along the z axis. When you extrude an edge, new faces are created to connect the line to the main body of the object it is being extruded from. That is to say, the result will have thickness, you cannot create a &quot;sheet&quot; that protrudes from the object.

EDGE MENU | CUT

2 – one edge is cut into two edges.

3 – one edge is cut into three edges.

4 – one edge is cut into four edges.

5 – one edge is cut into five edges.

10 – one edge is cut into ten edges. Cuts the selected edge(s) into the number of equally sized segments as specified by the number chosen from the side bar menu. Note that the number keys on the main keyboard can be used in lieu of the Cut command. The keys allow for an edge to be cut into 2 – 10 (0 being 10) segments by the simple press of a key.

EDGE MENU | CONNECT C

New edges are created that connect the selected edges together. Multiple edges can be connected at a time.

EDGE MENU | BEVEL

Creates a bevel, or chamfer, on selected edges. If used on an edge in the middle of a flat face, Bevel will open up a new face within the original face, on the same plane. Bevels interact with one another, so that if you have adjacent edges selected and then Bevel them, the new chamfered edges will join properly. Many renderers do not work well with large flat straight edged surfaces, causing artifacts to show up in textures and cast shadows. These side effects can be reduced, or even completely eliminated, if you apply a very slight bevel to all such harsh edges. Slight bevels will also help maintain

the objects shape when you subdivide the object with the Smooth command.

EDGE MENU | DISSOLVE (Bksp) Dissolve can be used to eliminate unwanted edges to refine your model or in preparation for other commands. Be careful in the use of Dissolve, for it can destroy the topological relationships between elements (and thus the model) very easily.

Quick Tip: Creating round eyes from square holes.

You can create roundish eyes from the results of a Vertex | Bevel by using a combination of Edge | Dissolve and Face | Smooth commands. To demonstrate this, create a cube and connect the left and right edges of one of its sides. Then Connect the three horizontal edges of that side to form a square cross intersection in the middle of the face. Select the vertex of the intersection and Bevel it to form a diamond shape in the middle of the face. With the face selected do a Smooth. Now select the four edges within the smoothed area and Dissolve them. You now have a roundish single face in the middle of the cube from which you can now extrude and scale several times to create an eye.

EDGE MENU | COLLAPSE

Collapse will eliminate an edge by snapping the vertices on each end together. This is the same effect of Weld Vertices found in many modeling programs. It can be used very effectively in conjunction with Select | By | Short Edges to remove microscopic edges that are interfering with your modeling.

EDGE MENU | HARDNESS

Hard

Soft Edges can be Hard or Soft. They are soft by default. Hard edges are not moved when a model is smoothed, and therefore are handy for maintaining sharp edges where they are needed in a model to maintain overall shape. To make an edge hard, select it then from the Edge Menu choose Hard. To set it back to soft, choose Soft. If you have a lot of edges you want to make Hard, you can use the Object Menu | Auto Smooth which sets

DRAFT 1.6 79

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL all edges at sharp angles to hard, then use the Edge Menu | Soft to set selected edges back to soft.

Quick Tip: Replace your hard edges with bevels.

Not all renderers or other modeling programs can handle hard edges. Therefore it is generally agreed that they should not be used, especially in the final model. But that does not mean that they can not be used effectively during the modeling process. It is sometimes useful to set some edges as hard to hold the local form on a given area of a model and the do a Smooth. You can then continue to work the model. Once you are done, do a Select By | Hard Edges and then apply a slight Bevel. If you find that your bevels do not hold the form true after a sample smooth it probably indicates an area of the model in need of more geometry. Try adding some additional edges near the bevels and do another test smooth. Now the bevels should hold the form of the model true while eliminating the hard edges from the final model.

EDGE MENU | LOOP CUT

This is one of the most important commands in Wings. If you have a complete edge loop that closes on itself you can cut the model in two with Loop Cut. For example, if you have an edge loop that completely encircles the

arm at the shoulder, you can select that edge loop, and do a Loop Cut to sever the arm from the model. Then you can work with both parts independent of one another or even save one part out as a separate model. This can also be useful in symmetrical modeling. If you create your rough model with a clean central edge loop, you can develop detail on one side of the model, then periodically Loop Cut the model, delete the non detailed side, and then Mirror the detailed side to quickly duplicate all the detail from one side to the other. This can be a great time saver.

EDGE MENU | TURN

This command is intended to be used on models that have been triangulated. It can easily destroy models made of quads, so be careful when and how you use it. Some programs, such as game engines, expect models to be composed entirely of triangles. But the overall shape of a model can be determined by how those triangles are laid out. Turn lets you create a better flow for the edges so that you can fine tune triangulated models.

EDGE MENU | OPTIMIZED TURN

Optimized Turn will triangulate your model by finding the shortest edges possible to create the triangles.

their collective center of mass. Non connected faces will rotate about their individual centers of mass.

Free – Will rotate the selected faces in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains rotation about the x axis.

Y – constrains rotation about the y axis.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the face radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.

FACE MENU | EXTRUDE

Normal – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s). By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils.

Free – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

DRAFT 1.6 81

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Y – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

Z – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.

FACE MENU | Extrude Region

Normal – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s) as a unit. By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils. By using Extrude Region on a group of faces rather than simply using Extrude, you keep the faces joined together into one coherent surface, which is often preferable to having distinct stems &quot;growing&quot; out of the object.

Free – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

Y – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

Z – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.

FACE MENU | EXTRACT REGION

Normal – extract faces and then move the faces along the regions normal.

Free – extract faces and then move faces freely in all directions.

X – extract faces and then move them along the X axis.

Y – extract faces and then move them along the Y axis.

Z – extract faces and then move them along the Z axis. Extracts a region, or group of faces, from the parent object to create a completely new object. Note that the faces do not have to be contiguous. To create a new object that abuts the original object do an Extract Region and immediately left click without moving the mouse, to lock it in place. You probably will not be able to successfully select the new object due to the underlying original and may have to use the Hide function in the Object enu to hide the parent object so that you can work with the new object. If you have created a new object from non abutting faces and want to work with them as separate objects, then use the Separate command to break them into their component parts.

FACE MENU | FLATTEN

Normal

X

Y

Z

Last Axis

Default Axis

Region Sometimes faces can become non-planar as you work with your model, especially if you Move vertices. This can cause problems latter. One way to fix a non-planar face is to Flatten it, i.e., get all of its vertices onto the same plane. Smoothing the model will also create planar faces, but if you do not want to smooth your model, you can Flatten offending faces. It is also good for setting up geometry for further manipulation, so that extrusions go in the direction you want them to go, for example.

If you have a default axis defined (see Tools | Set Default Axis) you can flatten to that axis or you can flatten to the last axis used. Flatten Region will flatten the edge loop, the boundary between selected and non-selected faces, of the selected faces. Note that the vertices on the edge loop become planar, not the faces contained therein.

FACE MENU | INSET

This creates a new face, of the same shape, inside the selected face. It works on one or more faces at a time, creating a new face for each of the selected faces. This could be used, for example, to create a picture inside a picture frame. The inner face could then be extruded in the negative direction to cause the frame to stand out. You can also Inset and make the new face larger than the original face. See the Dog House Tutorial in Section 3 of this manual for an example of this in action.

FACE MENU | INTRUDE

You can make some very cool models very quickly with the intrude function. It is especially handy for making lattice work type of objects, such as the Eiffel Tower or a bird cage. It works by creating an inverted copy of the entire object, then doing a Bridge on all pairs of selected faces. The thickness of the walls is controlled by how far you move the

82 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus mouse during the operation. The Dog House tutorial in this manual demonstrates the Intrude function quite nicely.

FACE MENU | BEVEL

Bevels all the edges of the selected face or faces simultaneously, thus creating a smaller selected face and small surrounding faces.

FACE MENU | BRIDGE

Causes two co-planer or nearly co-planar faces to snap together, thus fusing new geometry between them. Only two faces can be selected at a time for Bridge. The faces must have the exact same number of edges and vertices but can be shaped differently. This can be used to attach one object to another, one part of the same object to another part of the same object, or to create holes in an object if the selected faces are on opposite sides of the object.

FACE MENU | BUMP

Moves selected faces out along their normals while at the same time creating new faces that meld into the existing geometry via newly beveled faces that are created. This is great for building up muscle tone on a model.

FACE | LIFT

The Lift Command is only available if Advanced Menus are activated. Therefore, Lift will be discussed in the Advanced Menus section.

FACE | PUT ON

The Put On command allows you to drop one object onto another, much like dropping a box to the ground. Select the face you want to put onto another object then select Put On from the Face Menu. The Icon Bar will change to show you that you can select a vertex, edge or face to put the object on. Select the vertex, edge, or face you want and then Right Click to execute. The first object will jump into place right on the vertex, edge, or face you selected on the second object. This can be very useful when you go to weld parts together with the Bridge command.

Quick Tip – Put On and Bridge

To perform a bridge-like function at the same time, select both faces prior to Put On and Store | Selection. Use Put On, then Recall | Selection, Bridge, Cleanup, etc. This is quite quick, especially if on hot keys.

Tip provided by puzzeled paul.

FACE MENU | MIRROR

Mirrors an object around one or more selected faces. By choosing multiple faces to perform Mirror multiple mirrors are performed simultaneously in the direction each face points. Thus care must be exercised on complex models least self colliding geometry be created. The Mirror command is most effective for doing symmetrical modeling, wherein only half of a model is built, then a mid model face is selected and Mirror used to create the other half of the model. If you maintain a clean central edge loop while modeling you can model, Mirror, continue to model, select the middle edge loop and do a Loop Cut, Delete the half of the model that needs to be updated, and then Mirror again.

Quick Tip: Fix that mirror plane.

If you use the Loop Cut, model, and Mirror method described above you will sometimes find that the object does not Mirror back together properly. This is often caused by the mirror face getting out of kilter i.e. non- planar, while modeling. Mirroring in such cases will cause a real mess. To fix it up, select the mirror face and do a Flatten on the appropriate axis to make it planar again. Then do the Mirror to make a whole object from the half. Finally, select Tools | Center All to get the whole thing re-centered in the workspace.

FACE MENU | DISSOLVE (Bksp) Deletes inner faces in a region of faces. You can also slice an object into several parts with the Dissolve command by selecting the faces that would separate the parts and doing a Dissolve. The parts will still be grouped as one object until you use the Separate command (in Object selection mode) to separate them.

DRAFT 1.6 83

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL FACE MENU | COLLAPSE

Deletes the selected faces, replacing each face with a vertex. The selection mode will be changed to Vertex, and the newly created vertices will be selected, allowing you to apply further commands.

FACE MENU | SMOOTH (S) Connects all the edges of a face and tightens up the vertices so as to form a smoother shape from the original face. You can make round eyes from square faces with Smooth.

Quick Tip: Smooth To Check For Anomalies.

To check for self colliding 'internal' geometry smooth once and eyeball in wireframe mode, as it won't usually be obvious as an unsmoothed wireframe.

Tip provided by puzzeled paul.

FACE MENU | SET MATERIAL

New – Will prompt you for a Material Name in a pop-up dialog. Type in a new name of your choice and click OK. This will bring up the Material Editor as pictured here.

Here you can custom design a material to be applied to the selected face by setting the properties Diffuse, Ambient, Specular, Emission, Shininess, and Opacity. The ball on the left will show a preview of your material design and starts out as a neutral gray. To change any of the first four settings simply click on the box to bring up a color mixer. In the color mixer you can type in the RGB values in the fields on the left or use the slider bars to

interactively mix the color. Once satisfied, click on OK. The ball on the left will immediately change to reflect your settings. Click OK again when you have finished adjusting all the settings to your liking. The new material will be added to the list of materials along with Default and Hole, with the name that you gave it. This new material can then be applied to any face selection you choose with the Face | Set Material command. The materials are saved with the model. In order to see it properly you will need to look at your model as Smooth Shaded, which you can do by pressing the Tab key. Note that a File | New will purge the materials list.

Default – will set the selected faces to the Default material color.

Hole – will set the selected faces to the Hole material color.

FACE | TESSELATE

Triangulate – Will convert all the polygons in the selected faces to triangles. Some programs, such as game engines, expect models to be triangulated before import.

Quadrangulate – Will fix n-gon faces by converting them to quads whenever possible or to triangles if necessary. An ngon is a polygon with more than four edges. These are generally considered bad things to have in your model. This is often useful following a Face | Smooth since that type of smooth operation can result in adjoining ngon faces.

Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus&lt;br&gt; 
5.2.2 The Vertex Operations Menu –


Figure 46: The Vertex Operations pop-up menu.

'''General'''

If one or more vertices are selected, right clicking in the workspace will display the Vertex Operations Menu. Some of these operations are unique to Vertex selection mode and all operations are referenced to a single common datum.&lt;br&gt;(Compare rotating several isolated faces with rotating any type of vert selection.)


Enabling Advanced Mode (via Edit | Prefs.) provides the following additional features over the basic menu.

Magnet operations for supported commands (use Alt (+ any mouse button) to access magnets in the default Mirai camera mode)&lt;br&gt;
Greater functionality (specifying custom vectors / axes and origins) for all major commands.&lt;br&gt;
3 completely new commands:&lt;br&gt;
Bend&lt;br&gt;
Bend Clamped&lt;br&gt;
Shift


The underlying common feature which provides the extra functionality is that of 'secondary selections' - which allows the user to specify many 'custom actions' similar to the following examples:

Modify geometry as if with a 'magnet', to obtain smooth transformations.&lt;br&gt;
Moving in a direction that isn't parallel to the XYZ axes.&lt;br&gt;
Rotating around an axis that isn't parallel to the XYZ axes - and also to have that rotate axis pass through a particular point. (eg Having a door rotate around its correct hinge axis, rather than through the middle of the door)&lt;br&gt;
Scaling from a specified point (origin) rather than the default one that wings works out, based on the selected geometry.&lt;br&gt;
Specifying a particular location for a Flatten plane to pass through&lt;br&gt;


A typical workflow using secondary selections for a basic vector move might be -

Select geometry to be altered (some verts on a sphere, say)&lt;br&gt;
R - Clk to display menu (note new options on the lower info line, which weren't present for 'basic' menu mode).&lt;br&gt;
R - Clk to choose the 'Pick axis to move along' option.&lt;br&gt;
L - Clk on any edge to specify the move direction - note how wings displays a blue arrow, confirming this.&lt;br&gt;
R - Clk to execute the operation, drag as required.&lt;br&gt;
L - Clk to complete the move, once the object is where you want it to be.&lt;br&gt;

In the above example, the 'secondary' selection is the one done to specify the direction of movement, ie selecting the edge, whilst the 'primary' selection is that of choosing the geometry to be modified.

Wings will also let you use very complex selections when defining / specifying parameters for secondary purposes.




 





VERTEX MENU | MOVE

Normal – moves the selected vertex/vertices along their normal. A normal is a vector (line of direction) that runs out perpendicular to the reference element (applying View | Show Normals will display them if needed)

Free – Will move the selected vertex(es) in the direction of mouse movement.
Since all movement takes place on planes that are parallel to the monitor screen, some care is needed to avoid problems when used in a general 'tumbled' view.
This command is especially useful when used in conjunction with View | X,Y or Z, as it allows the user to keep moved vertexes on the 2D axial planes associated with the relevant viewing direction.
If working with background reference images, Ortho should also be used (with View | XYZ) to eliminate perspective distortion issues.

X – Movement is parallel to the X axis.

Y – Movement is parallel to the Y axis.

Z – Movement is parallel to the Z axis.


VERTEX MENU | ROTATE – Vertices will rotate about a single center for the entire selected set whether or not they are adjacent.&lt;br&gt; 
Note that this works fundamentally differently than how faces or edges rotate. At least two vertices must be selected for this to have any effect at all.

Free – Will rotate the selected vertices in the direction of mouse movement.

X – Rotation is around an axis parallel to the X axis.

Y – Rotation is around an axis parallel to the Y axis.

Z – Rotation is around an axis parallel to the Z axis.



VERTEX MENU | SCALE - Scales the dimension between each vertex and a common reference in accordance with the chosen option.&lt;br&gt;
The nature of the common reference used depends on the scale option chosen but is always located where Scale = 0%.&lt;br&gt;
Uniform - is a single point (selection center)&lt;br&gt;
Axis - is a plane (perpendicular to chosen axis) passing through the selection center.&lt;br&gt;
Radial - is a line (parallel to chosen axis) passing through the selection center.

Requires two or more vertices to have any effect.

Uniform – Scales the distance between each vertex and the selection center.

X – Scales the distance along the X axis between each vertex and the reference plane.

Y – Scales the distance along the Y axis between each vertex and the reference plane.

Z – Scales the distance along the Z axis between each vertex and the reference plane.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the distance between the vertices radially from their local geometric x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are affected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the distance between the vertices radially from their local geometric y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the distance between the vertices radially from their local geometric z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.



Section 5.2 6&lt;br&gt;
The Context Sensitive Menus

VERTEX MENU | EXTRUDE

Can be performed on one or more vertices. During the extrusion process you can use the plus and minus (+ -) keys to change the size of the extruded spike's base.

Normal – a &quot;spike&quot; type feature is extruded from each selected vertex along the vertex normals, thus creating new faces.

Free – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created in the direction of mouse movement.

X – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created along the X axis.

Y – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created along the Y axis.

Z – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created along the Z axis.




VERTEX MENU | FLATTEN

Requires two or more vertices to have any effect.&lt;br&gt;
All selected verticies are moved parallel to the specified axis until they all lie on a single common axial plane, appropriate to the axis option chosen. By default, wings computes the position of this common plane but using advanced menus allows the user to specify a particular location for this plane to pass through (use RMB option).

Flatten and Scale | Axis &gt; 0% produce the same results. 

X – Flattens the selected vertices by averaging their position in the X direction. This has the effect of aligning selected vertices in the X plane.

Y – Flattens the selected vertices by averaging their position in the Y direction.

Z – Flattens the selected vertices by averaging their position in the Z direction.




VERTEX MENU | CONNECT (C)

Connects selected vertices with edges if they have a common face, or if the faces between vertices is contiguous. More than one set of connects can be performed at a time. Some applications require triangles, rather than quads on import. You can convert your Wings quads to triangles very simply by selecting the Body, then pressing V to switch to vertex mode. All vertices on the model will then be selected. Then just do a Connect, and all the quads will be turned into triangles.

VERTEX MENU | TIGHTEN

Tighten deserves a bit of explanation as it is not immediately obvious just what it does. Tighten looks at each vertex and works out the direction they need to move in so as to create the most tension-free surface. It then allows you to interactively move those vertices along that direction by dragging the mouse left and right.

Another way to think of it is as a tool to get all the edges as similar in length as possible. It will eventually smooth out your model into an amorphous blob.

You can use it to gently smooth out regions where you've made changes in the surface too harsh, by tightening select areas by small amounts.

You can get your model into a more UV- friendly paintable state by tightening a lot, thus avoiding areas where there's overhang or creases.

Alternatively, you can tighten in the opposite direction (un-tighten) by small amounts where your surface is too smooth. It will make differences in edge length more extreme. If you find a model is coming out too gooey when smoothed, un-tighten it a bit before smoothing, it might help.

Tighten may work slightly differently from Nendo®. Wings calculates all directions once, before the drag is started. Nendo® might recalculate all directions after every mouse move. (It would probably make a difference if adjacent vertices are selected, which they usually are.)

VERTEX MENU | BEVEL

Bevels corners at selected vertices, thus creating new faces. It has no effect on isolated vertices where two edges fail to intersect with any other (a single edge cut in two). Such vertices should be eliminated, by the way, via the Collapse tool.

VERTEX MENU | COLLAPSE (Bksp) Removes the vertex, adjusting the faces and edges associated with it accordingly and leaves you in Face Selection Mode.

VERTEX MENU | DISSOLVE

Removes the vertex. Unlike Collapse, Dissolve leaves you in Vertex Selection Mode so that you can continue to select and eliminate vertices without having to switch back from Face Mode.

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL VERTEX MENU | DEFORM

Wings3D has several deformation tools available, as listed below.

Crumple – moves selected vertices randomly. Good for adding &quot;noise&quot;.

Inflate – moves selected vertices along their normal out from the center of mass of the selection. If you have a hollow object and select vertices on the inside as well as the outside of the object, Inflate will cause the vertices on the inside and outside to move outward just as if you were inflating a balloon. In other words, the outside vertices move on their positive normals while the inside vertices move on their negative normals. This can be a very powerful modeling tool. Note however that Inflate can cause faces to collide with each other, and can therefore ruin a model rather quickly. Be judicious in its use, especially in areas of dense geometry that may be oriented towards other parts of the model.

Taper (X, Y, Z) – will evenly spread the vertices apart radially along the selected axis. Note that the reference point for the Taper operation is at the middle of the model.

Twist (X, Y, Z) – This twists the selected vertices around an axis parallel to the chosen major axis. The axis will be pass through the center of bounding box for the selected vertices. Note that the 'anchor / stationary' end of the model always faces the negative side of any axis chosen. To twist round the other way, the model has to be rotated 180 degrees first.

Torque (X, Y, Z) – This twists the selected vertices around the chosen major axis (X, Y, or Z). Note that as with standard Twist, the 'anchor / stationary' end of the model always faces the negative side of any axis chosen. To twist round the other way, the model has to be rotated 180 degrees first.

Some Examples:

In the image below, Twist|Y and Torque|Y will do exactly the same thing. Both will twist the cylinder around the Y axis, because the cylinder is exactly centered in the middle of the workspace.


Figure 47: Twist and Torque. A cylinder placed in the center of the workspace (a) exhibits exactly the same result (b) when subjected to either Twist|Y or Torque|Y.

74 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus In the image below, Twist|Y twists the off-around the workspace Y axis, yielding center cylinder around a vertical axis passing different results. through the center of the cylinder. Torque|Y on the other hand will twist the cylinder


Figure 48: Twist vs. Torque. A cylinder is moved off center in Z by 1 unit (a). Then a Twist|Y by 180 is applied. The result is exactly as in Figure 47. An Undo converts it back to a standard cylinder (a), and then Torque|Y by 180 is applied. The results are completely different.

You can achieve dramatically different results asymmetrical (a). In (b) we have applied a between Twist and Torque on asymmetrical Twist | Y by 180 degrees. You can see that objects. In the example below we have a it caused the cylinder itself to become bent. cylinder that is centered in the workspace. In (c) we have applied a Torque | Y by 180 One set faces has had an Extrude Region | degrees and get an interesting screw like Normal applied to make the object object with a straight shaft.


Figure 49: Other factors. If your object is asymmetrical, Torque can give you better results.

The above examples were kindly provided by Björn Gustavsson.

DRAFT 1.6 75

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Quick Tip: Experiment with Deformers

Deliberately moving models off center and experimenting with Twist and Torque can give 'interesting' results. In my opinion, ensuring you have sufficient 'sections' along the length of your model is essential for producing satisfactory results. For non-organic / technical models, careful choice (and matching) of the number of linear and radial sectors can result in geometry that offers considerable scope for polygon reduction after twisting is complete. Experimentation and keeping away from prime numbers can pay dividends in this area if low polygon counts are needed. Rotating the model off a main axis and twisting at right angles to the models main axis can often prove an entertaining (and fruitful) exercise. If you

want to 'dirty up' an object that's been twisted (for maybe a more 'organic' look) try selecting sections of the twisted item (rather than the whole) and re-applying a bit more twist. Taper operates from the center of the selection set along the axis chosen. One end will Taper up while the other end Tapers down. Like twist, experiment with selecting parts rather than the whole of the model - it is quite easy to get useful shapes this way. Successive applications of taper should also be tried - e.g. tapering a multi-sectioned cylinder 100% in Y and then repeating the op will produce a concave spike, like a Chinese hat whereas, if you perform the second taper by -100% you get a beer barrel shape.

Examples of engineered wetlands are those currently constructed for remediation applications:  as surface flow systems for the removal of pollutants from liquid effluents such as sewage and petroleum wastes. The systems rely primarily on microbial communities, which grow as biofilms in the plant root zone. Their construction relies on an understanding of the relationship between the selection of vegetative species and soil, hydrology, grading/site preparation, and installation methods.  Construction of wetlands involves an understanding of the various scientific, legal, and technical components of wetland ecology.

An engineered wetland with areas of open water is similar to that of a natural marsh. These systems are typically designed to support the growth of emergent wetland plants, interspersed with lagoons.  These surface flow systems are more tolerant of wastewaters with high suspended solid concentrations than gravel-bed systems, and they support a higher biodiversity than subsurface flow water treatment systems.  They model the ecology of natural habitats such as salt scrub, pine savannahs, estuarine tidal marshes, forested wetlands, shrub-scrub wetlands, emergent wetlands, freshwater tidal wetlands, brackish tidal wetlands, and open marshes. Construction requires an understanding of the relationship between the selection of vegetative species and soil, hydrology, grading/site preparation, and installation methods. The management system involves an ecological rationale for maintaining a high clearance rate of pollutants.

Credibility refers to the trustworthiness of a witness.&lt;ref&gt; 
Raymond v. Bosanquet (1919) 59 S.C.R. 452 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1919/1919canlii11/1919canlii11.html 1919 CanLII 11] at p.460&lt;br&gt;
see discussion on credibility and reliability in R. v. C. (H.), [http://canlii.ca/t/225zl 2009 ONCA 56], at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Credibility evidence comprises evidence admitted for the purposes of strengthening or weakening the testimony of a witness or an accused. Credibility evidence that is used to impeach a witness can be submitted at any point from the time the witness takes the stand. The rule is that a witness always puts their credibility at issue whenever they testify and so it is open to attack. Evidence that bolsters a witness's credibility, however, is not admittable until the credibility of that witness has been impeached.

Whenever testimony is given the trier of fact must determine whether the testimony is to be believed. There is no presumption of honesty among witnesses in a criminal trial&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Thain 2009 ONCA 223 (CanLII), (2009), 243 C.C.C. (3d) 230 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several approaches to determining credibility. One school of thought believes that credibility is determined primarily by ''demeanour and conduct'' in trial.&lt;ReF&gt;
Raymond v. Bosanquet, supra &lt;br&gt;
R. v. White, [1947] S.C.R. 268 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1947/1947canlii1/1947canlii1.html] at 272
&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach says that demeanour and conduct are too subjective,&lt;ref&gt;
Tatarchuk v. Sidor (1951), 1 W.W.R. (N.S.) 435 at 448 (Alta. C.A.), &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. P. (R.) 1994 CanLII 6250, (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 571 (Que. C.A.); [http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qcca/doc/1994/1994canlii6250/1994canlii6250.html]  &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Norman 1993 CanLII 3387, (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 295 (C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1993/1993canlii3387/1993canlii3387.html] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marzan (1982), 18 Man. R. (2d) 240 at 246&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Neary, 2000 NFCA 22 [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2000/2000nfca22/2000nfca22.html] at 27&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and so the best approach is to consider the ''consistency''  of testimony when compared to reliable facts.&lt;ref&gt;
Faryna v. Chorny [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.) at 357:
:In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.
Whitehouse v. Reimer, (1980), 116 D.L.R.(3d) 594 at 595
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oath-helping==
It is generally prohibited to adduce any evidence for the sole purpose of bolstering or increasing a witnesses credibility, suggesting they are more likely to be telling truth. Evidence that is adduced for another reason and also has the effect of bolstering credibility can be permitted. The judge must balance the probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effect.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Llorenz, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb75 2000 CanLII 5745] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reasons for adducing oath-helping evidence includes showing corroboration with other extrinsic evidence and narrative.

The Crown cannot introduce evidence showing that their witness has testified in court previously resulting in convictions.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mallory, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qbmx 2007 ONCA 46]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defence cannot adduce evidence establishing that the accused passed a polygraph test.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Thorne, (1988), 82 N.S.R. (2d) 442 (S.C.A.D.)&lt;br&gt;

==Failure to Call Witnesses==
It is dangerous to draw an adverse inference from the failure of the accused to call evidence.&lt;ref&gt;

A judge should only draw an adverse inference be done &quot;with the greatest of caution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Privilege protects certain information from being revealed by a witness on the stand.

==Solicitor Client Privilege==
Solicitor-client privilege is a class privilege and are presumed inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;R v McClure, [http://canlii.ca/t/5228 2001 SCC 14], [2001] 1 SCR 445&lt;/ref&gt;

This privilege is the &quot;highest privilege recognized by the courts&quot; which is &quot;fundamental to the administration of justice&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Smith v Jones [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp9 1999 CanLII 674] (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 455, at para 44 and 50&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of this privilege can &quot;erode the public's confidence in fairness of the criminal justice system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Lavallee, Rackel &amp; Heintz v Canada (AG) [http://canlii.ca/t/51rj 2002 SCC 61] (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 209 at para 49&lt;/ref&gt; As accused persons must have confidential access to advice to made properly informed decisions.

The privilege exists where a written or oral communication is :&lt;ref&gt;R v Campbell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp4 1999 CanLII 676], [1999] 1 SCR 565 at para 49 [also referred to as R v Shirose] Solosky v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mjtq 1979 CanLII 9] (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821 at p. 835 &lt;/ref&gt;
#made in confidence or be of a confidential in nature; 
#made to a professional legal advisor; 
#for the purpose of giving and receiving legal advice.

This privilege applies not only between and a lawyer and their retained client, but can also apply between a Crown attorney and a police officer seeking legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Caines,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2011/2011abqb660/2011abqb660.html 2011 ABQB 660]&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements taken by an investigator on behalf of the defence is privileged and cannot be subject of disclosure to the crown.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Peruta; R v Brouillette (1992) 78 CCC (3d) 350  [http://canlii.ca/t/1pf0f 1992 CanLII 3597] (QCCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following have been considered privileged information:
* Emails between counsel and clients&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. 1496956 Ontario Inc. (Stoneridge Inc.), [http://canlii.ca/t/22v6x 2009 CanLII 12328] (ON SC)
at para 12&lt;/ref&gt;
* conversations between counsel and client in the courtroom even if caught on recording device.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Higham, [http://canlii.ca/t/1rnx3 2007 CanLII 20103] (ON SC) at para. 21 to 22
&lt;/ref&gt;
* phone wiretap between counsel and client &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Martin, [http://canlii.ca/t/2b3ls 2010 NBCA 41] (CanLII) at para. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;
* identity of person paying legal fees&lt;ref&gt;
Kaiser (Re), [http://canlii.ca/t/ftz2s 2012 ONCA 838] (CanLII) at para. 44 to 45&lt;/ref&gt;
* lawyer bills and statement of accounts regarding clients&lt;ref&gt;
Maranda v. Richer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1rz 2003 SCC 67] (CanLII), [2003] 3 SCR 193 at paras 21-34&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Exemptions from Solicitor-Client Privilege==
There are three occasions when solicitor‑client privilege may be overruled, namely when innocence at stake is engaged, the client's communications are themselves criminal, or it is necessary to protect public safety.&lt;ref&gt;
Smith v. Jones, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp9 1999 CanLII 674] (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 45
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{reflist|2}}
===Innocence at Stake===

The threshold test for innocence at stake exemption from privilege was set out in R v McClure [http://canlii.ca/t/5228 2001 SCC 445]  and summarized in R. v. Brown, 2002 SCC 32 as a two-step process. The accused must establish that:
* the information he seeks from the solicitor-client communication is not available from any other source; and
* he is otherwise unable to raise a reasonable doubt.
* If the threshold has been satisfied, the judge should proceed to the innocence at stake test, which has two stages.
** Stage #1: The accused seeking production of the solicitor-client communication has to demonstrate an evidentiary basis to conclude that a communication exists that could raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
** Stage #2: If such an evidentiary basis exists, the trial judge should examine the communication to determine whether, in fact, it is likely to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
* It is important to distinguish that the burden in the second stage of the innocence at stake test (likely to raise a reasonable doubt) is stricter than that in the first stage (could raise a reasonable doubt).
* If the innocence at stake test is satisfied, the judge should order disclosure of the communications that are likely to raise a reasonable doubt, in accordance with the guiding principles discussed.

==Litigation Privilege==
The purpose of litigation privilege is to create a &quot;zone of privacy&quot; around documents that were made in &quot;relation to pending or apprehended litigation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [2006] 2 S.C.R. 319, at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Litigation privilege protects documents that were should be created in the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;
Kennedy v. McKenzie, [2005] O.J. No 2060 (S.C.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1kw6d 2005 CanLII 18295] (ON SC), per Ducharme J. at 20&lt;/ref&gt;
# where the dominant purpose of the document is for existing, contemplated or anticipated litigation; and 
## was created in answer to inquiries made by an agent for the party's solicitor; or
## was created at the request or suggestion of the party's solicitor; or 
## was created for the purpose of giving them to counsel in order to obtain advice; or
## was created to enable counsel to prosecute or defence an action or prepare a brief.
{{reflist|2}}

==Settlement/Negotiation Privilege==

The parties need the ability to have &quot;full and frank discourse&quot; in order for agreements to take place. Without protection these discussions may not take place.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pabani, [http://canlii.ca/t/231td 1994 CanLII 8723] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege protects the public interest in favouring settlement. It &quot;promotes the interests of litigants generally by saving them the expense of trial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Kelvin Energy Ltd. v. Lee 1992 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 235 at para. 48&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The disclosure of &quot;without prejudice&quot; communications has a tendancy to promote litigation.&lt;ref&gt; 
Pirie v. Wyld (1886), 11 O.R. 422, [1886] O.J. No. 188 (QL) (Ont. H.C.), at para. 18 (“... letters written or communications made without prejudice, or offers made for the sake of buying peace, or to effect a compromise, are inadmissible in evidence. It seemingly being considered against public policy as having a tendency to promote litigation, and to prevent amicable settlements.”)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege applies where the following criteria are established:&lt;ref&gt;
Calgary (City) v. Costello, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6lz 1997 ABCA 281] (CanLII) at para. 60&lt;br&gt;
John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman &amp; Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 3rd ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2009) at para. 14.322&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# A litigious dispute must be in existence or within contemplation.
# The communication must be made with the express or implied intention that it would not be disclosed to the court in the event negotiations failed.
# The purpose of the communication must be to attempt to effect a settlement.

Where settlement fails the privilege is invoked and the communications cannot be used in the course of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;
Hansraj v. Ao, [http://canlii.ca/t/4zlp 2002 ABQB 385] (CanLII) at para. 13&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, if settlement is successful, the communications may be used to prove the existence of a settlement contract.&lt;ref&gt;
Hansraj v Ao at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege is possessed by both parties to the litigation and cannot be unilaterally waived by one party.&lt;ref&gt;
Hansraj v Ao at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term &quot;without prejudice&quot; alone is not determinative of whether settlement privilege applies.&lt;ref&gt;
TDL Group Ltd. v. Zabco Holdings Inc. et al., [http://canlii.ca/t/1wcht 2008 MBQB 86] (CanLII) at para. 30&lt;br&gt;
Flegel Construction Ltd. v. Cambac Financial Projects Ltd., [http://canlii.ca/t/27rg8&gt; 1983 CanLII 1019] (AB QB)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Plea Negotiations===
Communications regarding plea negotiations fall under the category of &quot;public interest privilege&quot; and so cannot be used in court. This includes negotiations regarding bail hearing&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bernard, [2002] A.J. No. 1007, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m30l 2002 ABQB 747] (CanLII) (Alta. Q.B.)&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sentencing hearings.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Roberts, [2001] A.J. No. 772 
(Alta. Q.B.)) &lt;/ref&gt;

This privilege exists to permit &quot;frank and full discussions between counsel for the accused and counsel for the Crown.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Bernardo, [1994] O.J. No. 1718, (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para 16&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Delorme, [2005] N.W.T.J. No. 51 (N.W.T. S.C.), 2005 NWTSC 34 at para 18 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Roberts, supra, at para 60&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Griffin, [2009] A.J. No. 1455, [http://canlii.ca/t/274zn 2009 ABQB 696] (CanLII) (Alta. Q.B.) at para. 65&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of privilege cannot be waived by one party alone.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bernard, supra, at para 39 &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Griffin, supra, at para 54&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Informer Privilege==
Informer privilege is intended to protect informants and &quot;promote the giving of assistance to the police by citizens in the investigation and prevention of crime&quot;. It further encourages &quot;other persons to provide assistance which would not likely otherwise be provided because of the extreme risks associated with disclosure of the identity of the source of the information.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;R. v. X and Y, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqff1 2012 BCSC 326] at at 18, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally said that the prosecution does not need to disclose the identity of the police informer or provide information that may disclose the identity.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Grey, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jd5 1996 CanLII 35] (ON C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case in drug trafficking cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Scott [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsp3 1990 CanLII 27] (S.C.C.), (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The court will only order the disclosure of the identity if it is needed to show the innocence of an accused person, known as the &quot;innocence at stake&quot; exception.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. X and Y, 2012 BCSC 326 at 20&lt;br&gt;
Bisaillon v. Keable, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpdn 1983 CanLII 26] (SCC), [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Leipert, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr41 1997 CanLII 367] (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281&lt;br&gt; 
Named Person v. Vancouver Sun, [http://canlii.ca/t/1t55c 2007 SCC 43] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Basi, [http://canlii.ca/t/26mxq 2009 SCC 52] (CanLII) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. X and Y, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqfdv 2012 BCSC 325]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  
This can apply where the informer is a material witness to the offence. The determination requires balancing of the relevance of the identity of the informer and the prejudice to the informer and public interest in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Garofoli [http://canlii.ca/t/1fss5 1990 CanLII 52] (S.C.C.), (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts have permitted defence counsel to ask a witness whether they have been an informer in the past and details about any history as an informer to support the theory that the witness invented the allegation of a drug rip off against the accused in expectation of receiving money.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Toews et al [http://canlii.ca/t/1ld2q 2005 BCSC 727]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Public Interest Privilege and Investigative Techniques==

The following have been recognized as privileged as an investigative technique:
* simulated ingestion of controlled substances&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mueckon, (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* location of a surveillance or observation post&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lam [http://canlii.ca/t/1fngl 2000 BCCA 545] (CanLII), (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 379 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Richards [http://canlii.ca/t/6h8f 1997 CanLII 3364] (ON CA), (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the location of tracking devices&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Guilbride, [2003] B.C.J. No.1245 (Prov.Ct.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the location and methods of examining of secondary VINs &lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Boomer [http://canlii.ca/t/1f169 2000 CanLII 4176] (NS SC), (2000), 182 N.S.R. (2d) 49 (S.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/22xks 2009 ABPC 88] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Spousal Privilege==
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Testimonial Evidence/Competence and Compellability#Spousal Immunity]]''

Spousal privilege is a class protection of certain communications between husband and wife. It is a protection that is separate and apart from spousal competency.&lt;ref&gt;
See McWilliams' Canadian Criminal Evidence, 4th ed., vol. 1, looseleaf (Aurora, ON: Canada Law Book, 2010) at para. 13:40.10&lt;/ref&gt;

A spouse who is found to be competent and compellable may still invoke privilege to protect their communications.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Zylstra, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jk6 1995 CanLII 893] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

This class of privilege does not exist at common law, but rather was created by way of s. 4(3) of the Evidence Act, which states:
{{quotation|
4 (3) No husband is compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife is compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage. 
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf5#sec4 CEA]
}}

Third parties may &quot;testify to communications between husband and wife that were overheard, intercepted, or otherwise discovered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. R.R.W. (No. 2), [http://canlii.ca/t/2c840 2010 NLTD 137] (CanLII) citing McWilliams’ at para. 13:40.50
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Case-by-Case Privilege==
A communication that does not fit into one of the class privileges may nonetheless be protected under the &quot;case-by-case privilege&quot; that can be applied to communications on an ad-hoc basis where the requisite criteria are met.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gruenke, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsjh 1991 CanLII 40] (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 263
&lt;/ref&gt;

Case-by-case privilege can be invoked where:&lt;ref&gt;Gruenke&lt;/ref&gt;
#The communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.
# This element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties.
# The relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered.
# The injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.

{{reflist|2}}
==Confidentiality==

===Journalist Sources===
Where appropriate, &quot;the courts will respect a promise of confidentiality given to a secret source by a journalist or an editor.&quot;However, where the public's interest in protecting sources is outweighed by other interests promises of secrecy cannot be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;R v National Post [http://canlii.ca/t/29l77 2010 SCC 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidentiality of journalistic sources can be measured on a case-by-case basis based on the &quot;Wigmore criteria&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
Confidentiality will be upheld if:&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# the communication originates in a confidence that the identity of the informant will not be disclosed;
# the confidence is essential to the relationship in which the communication arises; 
# the relationship is one which should be sedulously fostered in the public good; and 
# the public interest in protecting the identity of the informant from disclosure outweighs the public interest in getting at the truth. 
 
In R v National Post [http://canlii.ca/t/29l77 2010 SCC 16], the Court found that the fourth criteria was not made out where a journalist would not reveal a source who had potentially forged documents implicating a former prime minister in a illegal transaction.
{{reflist|2}}

==Waiver of Privilege==

Inadvertently disclosing privileged information does not automatically result in a waiver of privilege. Implied waiver could be established by knowledge of disclosure of the information and silence in response to disclosing the documents. The court must look at all the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Chapelstone Developments Inc. [http://canlii.ca/t/1jchb 2004 NBCA 96] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Solicitor-Client Privilege===
Only the client can waive solicitor-client privilege.&lt;Ref&gt;McClure at para 37&lt;/ref&gt; It must be waived intentionally.

The client cannot be compelled to waive privilege by answering questions in the course of litigation.
&lt;ref&gt; R v Creswell, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2000/2000bcca583/2000bcca583.html 2000 BCCA 583], 149 CCC (3d) 268&lt;/ref&gt;

A waiver of privilege can arise from an accused making allegations attacking competency of counsel using what would otherwise be privileged information.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Hobbs [http://canlii.ca/t/25jsm 2009 NSCA 90] at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
R v West [http://canlii.ca/t/25nf8 2009 NSCA 94] at para. 16&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The waiver of privilege only covers evidence concerning the issue alleged.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Dunbar [1982] OJ No 581 (ONCA) at 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Saya is not very formal everywhere, in Makassar we always used 'saya' as a child.

Unfortunately I'm not intimately familiar versions of Indonesian spoken outside Jakarta so I only put the variations I'm familiar with, feel free to add to the lesson if you have any corrections/additions. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 13:30, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

The '''''Deluminator''''', also referred to as a &quot;Put-Outer&quot;, is a small magical device that looks like a cigarette lighter. It captures and stores a light source, like a streetlight, and can later be used to restore the light to its original place.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Deluminator [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|was used]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] to &quot;put out&quot; the surrounding streetlights to make it harder to see the proceedings while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] was being delivered to the Dursleys. Once the wizards had left Privet Drive, Dumbledore released the lights from the Deluminator to restore the street to its normal night-time illumination. We note that the author refers to it three times as a Put-Outer; Dumbledore does not name it while he is using it.

It was later used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] to darken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] while the Advance Guard was landing in the square. Moody again restored the streetlights once all the wizards were inside the house, before closing the front door. The author here twice refers to it as a &quot;Put-Outer&quot;, though neither Harry nor Moody uses that term.

Again, the Deluminator appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows'']]. First named in Dumbledore's will, it is given by the Minister of Magic to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] once the Ministry has duly examined it. Ron later discovers that, as well as being able to remove and replace light, the Deluminator has the ability to track Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], despite their magical shields. It seems to key on the use of his name, picking up their conversation from the point at which they mention Ron. Having started tracking their conversation, it seems to be able to provide some sort of transport to their vicinity; it is never entirely clear how this is managed, exactly, but it produces a ball of light which, when it contacts Ron's chest, allows him to Apparate to Harry and Hermione's vicinity. Finally, in the basement of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Ron discovers that captured lights will simply float in the air, if they are released in a place distant from their original sources.

== Analysis ==

Dumbledore, as we can see by even a casual inspection of his office, is very fond of creating magical / mechanical hybrid devices. Given that Moody says he &quot;borrowed&quot; the Deluminator from Dumbledore, we can assume that it is a rare device in the Wizarding world; it is entirely possible that it is, in fact, a unique artifact, possibly an invention of Dumbledore's.

In the real world the closest analogue to the Deluminator is a device called the TV-B-Gone, which works on most, if not all, TV sets by generating a sequence of &quot;Off&quot; codes. This has been documented to also jam the light sensors on some street lamps. A hypothetical variant of this which has yet to be further developed uses a hybrid frequency detector to resonate with the 30-80 kHz ballasts used on many CCFLs and high pressure sodium street lights, and generates an inverse signal that causes a false event in the controller causing the light to go out as if the tube had quenched. Such a device would need to generate field strengths of several tens of kV per metre to travel up the (typically iron) pole and interfere with the ballast. Neither of these devices, however, has the ability to recreate the captured light source in a separate location, as the Deluminator does in the cellars of Malfoy Manor.

==Acids==
* Acids from animal and plant material are called Organic acids.
* Acids that chemists have found ways of creating are Mineral acids.
* Solutions of acids can be either dilute or concentrated.
* An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions when dissolved in water.

Properties:
* Acids have a sour taste.
* Acids change the colour of indicators: Acids turn blue litmus paper red.
* Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen and salt of the metal.
: &gt; Some metals react slowly, for example copper, and some react very fast, such as sodium.
::Metal + acid -&gt; metal salt + hydrogen
::Zinc + Sulphuric Acid -&gt; Zinc Sulphate + Hydrogen
::Zn (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)
: &gt; Metal replaces the hydrogen contained in acid.
* Acids react with carbonates to give carbon dioxide, a salt and water.
::Magnesium Carbonate + Hydrochloric Acid -&gt; Carbon Dioxide + Magnesium Chloride + Water
::MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + 2HCl (aq) -&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* Acids neutralize bases to form a salt and water only.
* Acids have H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions which combine with OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions in bases to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a result of the neutralization reaction.

==Bases==

* A base is a substance that reacts with an acid to form a salt and water only.
::Acid + Base -&gt; Salt + Water
::Calcium Hydroxide + Nitric acid -&gt; Calcium nitrate + Water
* Alkalis are soluble bases
::Sodium Hydroxide + hydrochloric acid -&gt; Sodium Chloride + Water
::NaOH (aq) + HCl (aq) -&gt; NaCl (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)
::Limewater is an alkali (calcium hydroxide). It goes milky white when Carbon Dioxide is bubbled through it. The precipitate is Calcium Carbonate.
::Carbon Dioxide + Calcium Hydroxide -&gt; Calcium Carbonate + water

Properties:
* Bases neutralize acids to form salt and water only.
* Soluble bases change the colour of indicators (e.g. turns red litmus paper blue)
* Soluble bases feel soapy (they convert some oil on your skin into soap). Decreasing agents; convert oil and grease into soap.
* A solution of an alkali in water contains hydroxide ions OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (aq). Because most metal hydroxides are insoluble, an alkali added to a solution of a metal salt will precipitate an insoluble metal hydroxide.

=== Weak and Strong Acids ===
* Acids that contain more hydrogen ions (ionize to a larger extent) react faster (e.g. HCl)
* This is a strong acid (nearly all acid molecules form ions)
* In weak acids, only some of the acid molecules form ions
* Strong acids have lower pH numbers than weak acids of the same concentration

::{|
|''Strong Acids''   || ''Weak Acids''
|-
|Hydrochloric Acid  ||  Ethanoic Acid
|-
|Sulphuric Acid     ||  Citric Acid
|-
|Nitric Acid        ||  Carbonic Acid
|}

=== Weak and Strong Alkalis ===
* A strong alkali exists almost completely as ions in solution.
* A weak alkali, only some of the molecules will form ions in solution

::{|
|''Strong Alkalis'' ||   ''Weak Alkalis''
|-
|Sodium Hydroxide   ||        Ammonia
|-
|Potassium Hydroxide||
|-
|Calcium Hydroxide  ||
|}


== pH/Universal Indicator paper ==

* pH is the level of acidity or alkalinity in an aqueous solution or a liquid.
* Universal Indicator turns different colors in strongly acidic and weakly acidic solutions.
* It comes as both a liquid and as a solution.
* Acids have a pH value of less than 7.
* Alkalis have a pH value of more than 7.
* Neutral Substances have a value of pH 7.

=== Other Indicators ===

::{|
| ''Indicator'' ||  ''Acidic Colour'' || ''Neutral Colour'' ||  ''Alkaline Colour''
|-
|Litmus   ||      Red    ||             Purple    ||         Blue
|-
|Phenolphtalein || Colorless  ||        Colorless   ||       Pink
|-
|Methyl Orange ||  Red  ||              Yellow   ||      Yellow
|}

== Acidity in Soil ==
* Most plants grow best when the pH of the soil is close to 7.
* If the soil is too acidic, or too alkaline, plants will grow badly or not at all.
* Chemicals are added to the soil to adjust the pH level.
* Most often, soil is too acidic so it is treated with quicklime (calcium oxide), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate). These are all cheap bases.

 

== TYPES OF OXIDES ==

=== Metallic/Basic Oxides ===

* Basic Oxide + Alkali -&gt; no visible reaction
* Basic Oxide + Acid -&gt; Salt + Water Only
* Basic Oxide + Water -&gt; alkalis
* CaO, MgO, CuO, Na2O, K2O
* Oxides of P + K form peroxides on heating, others decompose.

=== Non-Metallic/Acidic Oxide ===

* Acidic Oxide + Alkali à Salt -&gt; water only [SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2NaOH(aq) -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)]
* Acidic Oxide + Acid -&gt; no visible reaction [NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl -&gt; no reaction]
* Acidic Oxide + Water -&gt; Acid [2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] *exception: mixed anhydride
* Exception: 2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH -&gt; NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O *mixed anhydride
* SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (pentaoxide), P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Neutral Oxide ===

* Non-metallic oxides (but not acidic)
* CO (Carbon Monoxide), NO (Nitrogen Monoxide), N&lt;sub&gt;­2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Dinitrogen Oxide), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Water)
* No reaction with anything
 
=== Amphoteric Oxides (both basic/acidic) ===

* Ampho Oxide + Acid -&gt; Salt + Water only
* Ampho Oxide + Alkali (+ water) -&gt; Complex Salt
* ZnO (s) + 2NaOH (aq) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Sodium Zincate)
* Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; 2NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Sodium Aluminate)
* PbO + 2NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Sodium Plumbate)

 
=== Preparation of Basic Oxides ===

* For Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, Al, HEAT THE METALLIC nitrate, hydroxide or carbonate

(a)    2Cu(NO3)2 (s)  -∆-&gt; 2CUO (s) + 4NO2(g) + O2 (g)

*identifiable with brown nitrogen dioxide gas

(b) Cu(OH)2 (s) -∆-&gt; CuO (s) + H2O (g/l)

(c) CuCO3 (s) -∆-&gt; CuO (s) + CO2 (g)

== Salts ==

* Substance formed when either all or part of the hydrogen ions in an acid is replaced by a metallic or ammonium ion.
* Made when acid is neutralized by base (water is also formed)
* Anhydrous – salts with no water
* Hydrated – salts with a fixed % of water (water of crystallization or water of hydration) – important for shape and color of salt
* Soluble salts dissolve to leave a clear solution
* Insoluble salt precipitate

|}
 

=== Preparation of Soluble Salt ===

* Acid + Metal -&gt; Salt + Hydrogen

Warm acid, add metal in excess and wait till no more hydrogen is evolved

* Acid + Metal Oxide -&gt; Salt + Water

Add excess of metal oxide to acid. Wait till solution no longer turns blue litmus red

* Acid + Metal carbonate -&gt; salt + water + carbon dioxide

Add excess of metal carbonate to acid. Wait until no more CO2 evolved

* Acid + Alkali -&gt; Salt + Water

* Solid is added in excess to make sure no acid has been left over

After the above has been conducted, the excess solid in solution is filtered out. The filtrate is left to evaporate on the water bath. When crystals form on the rod, it can be taken off. Solution cools to crystals. Then solution can be separated by filtering, washing crystals with distilled water and then leaving crystals to dry.

=== Preparation of Insoluble Salt ===

* All insoluble salts will go through double decomposition reaction

* More reactive metals will displace less reactive metals in solution

Lead (II) Iodide, is an insoluble salt, will be prepared from Sodium Iodide. Lead (II) Nitrate is added to the solution (all nitrates soluble in water). A precipitate of Lead (II) Iodide forms as Sodium displaces Lead.

NaI (aq) + Pb (NO3­)2 (aq) -&gt; PbI2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq)

The solution with the precipitate is filtered and washed with distilled water to dissolve any NaNO­3 still present. Residue is dried with over or dessicator to obtain insoluble salt.

= (about this placeholder) =

Since there has been nothing written on this page for a while, I asked for some basic information on another forum.  I'll just quote what I learned from that forum, and this can be massaged into a real page of documentation over time.  I won't attribute the individual various quotes, but thank you all for helping out.  Remember, ANYONE can edit a Wiki, so create an account and make this thing better.

= The NLA Window =

== Forum Notes ==

It's quite easy and maybe that's why there's no specific tutorial. Let's say you want to make two actions, AC:Hit and AC:Kick. Start with posing Hit and an Action will automatically be created in the Action Editor consisting of all the Bones that use Action IPO's. That's done so return to Frame 1 which will be your default Stance of AC:Hit.
 
Now, in the Action Editor, click the X (delete) next to AC:Hit and the datablock menu will disappear. (If you Add New instead of deleting then it will copy selected bones to the new action and you don't always want that). If you want a new default pose for AC:Kick, then Pose it or the same stance will be used as was the default in AC:Hit. Pose and Keyframe your Kick action and name it.
 
Over in the NLA Editor you can now use Shift-A to add NLA-Strips of your Actions, Grab and Scale them and use the Transform Properties tab to input how they Blend.

If you select an Action with the dropdown menu, at first its name will appear in the NLA window along with its keys. To make this Action into an NLA strip, point at the Action's name in the NLA and press CKEY.
 
Close any open Actions by clicking the scary X in the Action Editor. If you don't do this, only this action will play. Now in the NLA editor, play the animation. 
 
If you see any keys (diamonds) in the NLA window, instead of strips (rectangles), you're still editing an action. It's so much easier if you have both the Action and NLA windows open so you can see whether an Action is open or not. (Edited by CD38 23 Feb 2006)

== Walkthrough ==

With no Actions selected, both the Action Editor and the NLA Editor appear empty.  Here, the NLA Editor window does list one Object called '''-Empty''' because that object is not an armature but it has some IPO curves attached.

[[image:action-1.jpg|none|thumb|300px|empty action window]]
{{clr}}

Select an Action you've already made.  Here, an Armature named '''Yui''' has bones involved in a one-frame action called '''-AtEase'''.

[[image:nla-2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|nla window with action]][[image:action-2.jpg|none|thumb|300px|action window with action]]
{{clr}}

Convert the listed Action to an NLA Strip in the NLA Editor by pressing the CKEY with the mouse hovering over the Action to be converted.  No change in the Action Editor; it is still available as an Action.

[[image:nla-3.jpg|left|thumb|300px|nla window converting to a strip]][[image:nla-4.jpg|none|thumb|300px|nla window after conversion]]
{{clr}}

Once converted, note the changes in the NLA Editor.  The Action icon appears next to the Armature's name: [[Image:toggle-nla-pose.jpg]].  This is actually a button though it does not look like it, and you can toggle it between the Action and NLA Strips icon by clicking on it: [[Image:toggle-nla-strips.jpg]].

More soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Internet access is everywhere, so this is pretty easy to take care of. Membership at the local library will give you some time of free internet access. If you have the money to patronize the business, many coffeeshops and delis will have one or two computers for their customers to use.

If you can afford it, a laptop computer with a WiFi card will guarantee you in most major cities. Hotel lobbies, many restaurants, and increasingly today some areas just out on the street have WiFi internet access in them.  Purchasing a high gain directional wireless antenna can make it easier to acquire signals.  There is a recent (as of 20060528) case however of someone being arrested for connecting through someones wireless access point without permission.  I prefer to ask people first, but this complicates parking.  Some people have recommended that owners of WAPs add &quot;please use&quot; or something to the ESSID string that identifies the network in order to give explicit permission.

The ultimate solution is a laptop with a satellite modem, enabling you to connect from anywhere in the world. However, this can cost some money, particuarly with an ISP to deal with.

There are also some cellular internet options that are increasingly cheap and fast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}

==Passive Subjunctive System==
Having examined Lessons 15 and 23, forming the passive subjunctive should be quite simple.
===Present===
Modify the verb stem appropriately with a vowel change (as learned in Lesson 15), then add the present passive endings (Lesson 23).

{| style=&quot;width:500px&quot; border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 
| parer || manear || regar || capiar || audiar
|-
| pareris || manearis || regaris || capiaris || audiares
|-
| paretur || maneatur || regatur || capiatur || audiatur
|-
| paremur || maneamur || regamur || capiamur || audiamur
|-
| paremini || maneamini || regamini || capiamini || audiamini
|-
| parentur || maneantur || regantur || capiantur || audiantur
|}

===Imperfect===
The passive endings added to the present active infinitive.

{| style=&quot;width:500px&quot; border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 
| pararer || manerer || regerer || caperer || audirer
|-
| parareris || manereris || regereris || capereris || audireris
|-
| pararetur || maneretur || regeretur || caperetur || audiretur
|-
| pararemur || maneremur || regeremur || caperemur || audiremur
|-
| pararemini || maneremini || regeremini || caperemini || audiremini
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">Looks like this has been sitting here as a stub for six months.  I'm very new to magic, but I'm going to build a bit of an outline and maybe add a little content in the hopes that someone smarter than me will fill in the blanks! [[User:PeterHutnick|PeterHutnick]] 21:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

:I support that effort completely.  Have fun!

:As a suggestion, I would recommend that you enlist some help from some of the people who are working on the Magic Wikiproject at [[w:Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Magic]].  It would also help if you adding a link from the Wikipedia article at [[w:Magic (illusion)]] to this Wikibook, to see if anybody reading that article might be interested in some more in depth content about the topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I read some of that stuff.  Controversy knows no bounds.  My position is that the contents of my head belong to me, and I may do with them as I please.  That said, I only intend to describe &quot;secrets&quot; that one may find in any large public library (or on Amazon.com!).  [[User:PeterHutnick|PeterHutnick]] 22:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I'll try to help out where possible. I've been performing magic for about 13 years so far, and just plan on including the basics that are easy to find in common magic books, like the other people here. I primarily focus on cards, so that's where I'll try to do the most work. --[[User:essie|Essie]]  11 July 2007

      <text xml:space="preserve">The magician's duty is twofold.  First, he must create some ''effect'' that surprises and delights his audience.  Second, he must convince them to, at least superficially, accept a magical explanation for the effect. 

The superficial ''acceptance'' is not enough. Nor does one wish for the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;. Magic will always be strong if one understands that emotions and intellect are separate things. 

''&quot;I do not believe in ghosts, yet I am afraid of them&quot;''

Misdirection provides the primary mechanism for hiding the true cause of an effect.  Novices often confuse simple distraction with misdirection.  Snapping the fingers of one's right hand while ''ditching'' a coin held in the left ''is'' an example of distraction as a form of misdirection.  Misdirection, however, covers a much larger class of actions and conditions.  A magician might wish to create the appearance that he has made a chosen card &quot;rise&quot; to the top of a deck.  He might riffle the pack and tap the top card creating the impression that these actions ''caused'' the card to rise.  The card was at the top of the pack for some time prior to this action, but the magician's actions ''cover'' the method used.

Misdirection, then, has everything to do with the magician influencing the audience member's state of mind or thought process.  ''This'' (and only this) form of ''mentalism'' is real!

==What is a Magician?==

A magician is anyone who entertains through the use of magic, illusion, sleight of hand, mentalism, or trickery. Although anyone can do tricks, a magician is more: he is skilled at the art of deception, a master of language, and an apparent manipulator of the laws of physics.

It takes more than knowing the secrets to the tricks to be an effective magician...it takes understanding the thinking of the audience. It takes practice and patience to master illusions and sleights as well as the patter used in tricks. Often, the patter itself is a major tool in the misdirection needed to accomplish a sleight or illusion.  The effective magicians has at least an elementary understanding of psychology. The magicians worthy of respect also treats his audience with respect. Performing magic effectively requires dedication. Anyone can buy a trick at a magic dealer and perform it without any practice; all they will succeed in doing is diminishing the art of magic. If you think that revealing how a trick is done doesn’t matter then you do not understand one of the basic tenets of magic: never reveal your secrets.  If a magician reveals her secrets either on purpose or by ineptitude, the audience loses respect for magic.  Magicians are not here to merely deceive people, but to inspire people that may have no other realm of hope to continue clinging to.

Also, a magician is frequently trying to make a living performing magic and entertaining people. Would-be amateurs who do not have the dedication to practice their craft can take the hope and belief away from the audience due to mishandling of their props, causing professional magicians to lose credibility. 

Magic entertains, which is something people want in their lives. You should always leave your audience wanting more.  Performing the same trick two or three times in the same show may reveal the secret behind the magic and can  cause the audience to lose interest. Give your audience a polished performance...make it entertaining, fun, energetic, exciting, and mysterious! Always give your audience their money’s worth, even if they aren’t paying for the privilege of seeing you perform. Your audience is investing their time to watch you, so make it count. 

==A magician's tools==
The beginning magician focuses on what his ''hands'' are ''doing''.....the experienced magician focuses on what his ''mouth'' is ''saying''. Never underestimate the power of verbal misdirection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linking Rings==

Linking Rings are a standard effect within the magician's repertroire.  Modern sets of rings are available from nearly every magic dealer throughout the world.  Commonly, the set utilize a &quot;key ring&quot; which is a gimmicked ring allowing the various rings to link together.

==Cups and Balls==

Within magic literature (and well before it's genesis), Cups and Balls were a hallmark of a magician.

==Knowing the Ropes==

Rope tricks come in many varieties some using normal rope, some using gimmicked or gaffed rope. If you plan to do rope tricks, you must choose the right rope for the trick. Cotton rope works best for most tricks, especially those that require the rope to be cut in any way, or for tricks where the ends need to be tight and not unraveled. Nylon works well if the rope is not going to be cut, as the ends can be heated to prevent them from raveling. Avoid stiff ropes such as ski ropes and hemp ropes.

===Cut and Restored Rope===

This version of the cut and restored rope uses a non gimicked rope. Hold both ends of the rope in the left hand between the thumb and fore finger, the middle of the rope dangling down below the hand. Bring the bottom, middle of the rope up into the hand holding the two ends, to hold the middle loop steady to cut. A magic pass and the rope is restored, well, except for the knot in the middle. Just a pull on the knot and it comes off, and wa la, the rope is restored.

It is a trick you have seen many times on television. How is it accomplished? For this we need to understand misdirection and sleight of hand. The misdirection is the patter, that is to say the words you use to describe what you are doing. The patter for this is simply &quot;I bring the center of the rope up to form a loop, take the scissors and cut the center of the rope making two pieces.&quot; Which is the truth, you actually do cut the rope into two pieces. The hard part is to make it look like the two pieces are the same or nearly the same length. In actuality, the pieces are very different in length, one is very short and the other is very long.

To do this, when you pick up the center of the rope at the bottom, you pick it up with the first finger of the right hand. As you are lifting the center to the left hand, your middle finger goes through the rope and grabs the far side while the first finger drops the rope that it held. When done at speed, it looks as if you just lifted the center of the rope to the other hand forming a loop to cut. What actually happens is that you form a second loop around the first one, a much shorter loop it is this loop that is cut. When the ends are dropped the short piece of rope is close to the center of the long piece of rope and your hand is covering the point where the two loops come together. Tie a knot with the short loop around the rope. Now all you do is slide the knot off the rope as you wind the rope up in your hand. You can also try to tie the knot around a loop of the rope, so you can pull the knot directly off the center of the rope.

==Stacks==

Stacking the cards is not in itself a magical effect; however with the right presentation you can perform some very cool tricks. As a simple example, a packet of cards is held in the left hand. The top card is removed and placed on the bottom; the next card is turned face up on the table. The card is the Ace. The next card is removed and placed on the bottom with the next card turned face up to the table. This card is the King. This continues until there are no more cards in the hand. On the table are the A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3, and 2 in order. Not impressive but adequate for an example. In order to perform this feat the cards must be in a particular order. In this case the order is as follows:
      8,A,3,K,7,Q,4,J,6,10,2,9, and 5.
The method for stacking a packet or the deck differs from trick to trick, however one thing is the same for all stacked deck tricks. It is the finished product that is of importance, so knowing what you are after in the effect and working backwards will give you an easy method for stacking the deck. The trick becomes more impressive if it appears that the deck wasn't stacked, so being able to stack a deck in front of the audience without them knowing it is a definite plus. With this in mind, let’s take our example above. If you look at the sequence of numbers above, you will notice that one half of the cards are in order and placed every other card (the Ace through the Nine.) The other half (OK you got me, 13 cards can not be evenly halved) are also divided into half, and they are inserted between every other card in the first half (Sort of.) The bottom 3 cards are shuffled before they are shuffled into this pack. Again if you work backwards this can be done in just three shuffles. First take the bottom three cards and shuffle them. Since there are only three, basically just take the top card of the three and put it between the others. Then take those three and the next four and shuffle the three cards between the other four. Next take those seven cards and shuffle the remaining six in between the shuffled seven, and you're now in the right order to perform.

This can get a little confusing until you have done it a few times, but once you learn to stack cards for a particular trick you are ready to move into doing a routine with the stack trick as a finisher. This can really blow people away as they are not expecting a trick that gives the appearance of such card control after having witnessed the deck being used for other things as well. For example if the above stack was expanded to include the entire deck of cards, a series of tricks that might include a lost and found card, a mentalist type trick and then the finale of rearranging the deck in order. Once the cards are stacked for the finale, the order of the cards is known (at least to the magician) and thus a card can be picked by the spectator from the deck, returned to the deck, lost and then miraculously found. The magician could name the card by prediction, and finally the cards could be handed over to the spectator to deal the cards out surprisingly in order.

That took a lot longer to write about than it would to perform, but that's ok: it's about to get longer! Let’s look at the sequence above and see how a routine can be formed from such a stack. First just as in the example above, start with the cards in the order you want them to end in, and work your way backwards to the starting order. Place this stacked deck in the card box and your ready to begin. When you perform a trick like this for a spectator, take the cards out and cut them. Don't draw attention to the cut by saying anything like &quot;Now I will cut the cards&quot; as the spectator seeing the cards cut will make the leap to the cards are now in an order that the magician couldn't know. (It’s all psychological.) Let the spectator choose a card (remember you actually know the order of the cards even though they were cut, so don't worry that you will mess up, because you have practiced this for hundreds of hour’s right.) When the spectator chooses the card, cut the deck at the point the card is at and place the top section (just above their card), on the bottom of the deck. As they look at their card, get a glimpse of the bottom card (the one that was just above theirs) and now you know what their card is by remembering the next card in the sequence (oh did I mention that you have to memorize the order of the cards?) Now comes the devilishly clever part. Have the spectator place the card back on the top of the deck, and simply cut the cards. This does two things, first it puts the cards back in their original order but shifted; second it &quot;looses&quot; their card. If I were performing this trick, I would use another spectator that the first one knows, and using the Magicians Force Mental Effect, have the other spectator reveal the chosen card. While you are doing the MFME, you have time to &quot;SEARCH&quot; for the chosen card. It is pretty easy to do since you already know what it is. Once you find the card, reverse it in the deck (make it face the other way i.e. face up in a face down deck) but leave it in the position that it was in. Once the MFME is complete, you can reveal the Face up Card in the Face Down Deck. Since the cards are still in order, reverse the direction of the card again, and looking at the face of the deck, cut the cards again to put them back in their original order. Hand the cards to the spectator and instruct them on how to deal the cards. The final magic happening in their hands, leaving the magician looking like.... well a magician!

When using stacked decks, the most difficult part is thinking of the ending. That is what you wish to accomplish, after that all you have to do is just work backwards to assemble the stack. After the stack is assembled, you might want to write down the order of the cards to make it easier to stack the next time, but once in order simply run through the deck as the spectator will and make sure that they fall where you want them to. Writing down the order will also help you to remember the sequence, which will help you in lost and found cards or mental effects. The only thing you must avoid when doing stacked decks is never drop the cards, or change the order by shuffling unless you are really good at reordering them in front of the spectators without them noticing. It really messes up the trick if you do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Naming convention ==

Can you rename some pages like [[Books]] which belong to your book? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:57, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

:I've sorted out all the renaming now, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:01, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

==Orphans==
This book has a lot of [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned pages]] (13 by my count at this time). Some of it looks like forked content, but in most cases they aren't direct forks, and I'm not sure if these just got lost in a renaming shuffle, or if they're not useful anymore at all, so I'll just list them:

The Urdu alphabet is derived from the [[Persian]] ([[Farsi]]) and the [[Arabic]] alphabet, where majority of the letters are borrowed from Arabic while only four alphabets are primarily borrowed from Persian. Very seldom, letters may be borrowed from [[w:Sanskirt|Sanskrit]]. Even though the letters actually are inherited from these languages, the names used for these letters differ in some cases, for instance, letters ‘bay’ and ‘tay’ in Urdu are called only ‘baa’ and ‘taa’ in Arabic.

Below is a table of all the Urdu alphabets along with their names and the phonetic pronunciation of their names. It is also specified as to which language the letter is borrowed from and the respective keys to press on a keyboard. For the purposes of following the text in this book, Latin alternatives are provided with the alphabet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structure of a civil action == 

'''1 - Advising a client'''

'''2 - Commencing an action'''
The plaintiff must submit an '''Originating Notice''' to the proper court.

'''3 - Pleadings'''

'''4 - Discovery'''
A &quot;discovery&quot; is where both parties perform their own investigations of the parties involved in the suit. This usually involves each side interviewing the opposing party under oath. Sometimes third-parties to the case will be interviewed as well. Once the investigations are complete the opposing parties must exchange their records so that both parties have the same knowledge of the facts.

'''5 - Settlement'''
At this stage it is required that both parties discuss the possibility of coming to a settlement. With the discoveries done, it is usually clear on what the trial would turn on and the outcome can often be anticipated. A majority of parties settle at this stage resulting in a &quot;disposition without trial&quot;.

In the unlikely event that the parties would like to continue with the lawsuit, the judge will set a trial date upon which the parties will be able to argue their case in front of the judge.

'''6 - Trial'''
The Trial process involves each side to present their evidence and argument in front of a judge. The exact ordering of events can vary on circumstances but typically the trial goes as follows:

# Plaintiff's opening statement
# Plaintiff calls evidence
# Possible motion to dismiss
# Defence's opening statement
# Defence calls evidence
# Defence closing statement
# Plaintiff's closing statement

'''7 - Decision'''
Once the judge had heard all the evidence, he or she will either give their opinion orally from the bench or else will &quot;reserve&quot; their judgement. A reserved judgement means that the judge will give the judgement in writing at a later date, within six months of the trial date.  

'''8 - Enforcement'''

'''9 - Appeal'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This text is divided into two types of immigration, temporary and permanent.  Temporary immigration consists of all categories of people who enter Canada on a temporary basis, be it a tourist, a visitor, a student, or a temporary worker. Certain types of temporary immigrants are able to extend their visits indefinitely which can effectively make them almost permanent.  Permanent immigration, however, are those who would like to settle in Canada and take advantage of government services. This includes those seeking permanent residency or citizenship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This text is intended as a reference manual to help those seeking a guide to help in the process of immigrating to Canada. The Government of Canada provides for a variety of avenues to enter Canada which vary from simple applications to very complex procedures. Figuring out the application on one's own, especially for those who's first language is not english, can very daunting. A good clear handbook for filing government applications can be invaluable for those who are planning to uproot their lives. It is a big choice for any person and there is always a shortage of good information. The guides provided by the government are always a useful starting point, however, they can often be confusing and there are plenty of gaps in their coverage. 

With the introduction of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2001, much of the immigration process has been revamped. Of particular note to those interested in applying to Canada is that the immigration officials are given significant discretion on evaluating many types of applications, so for filling out sponsorship forms, for example, there is an added responsibility to be clear, consistent, and comprehensive in the application. Again, the hope of this text is to provide detail into the added requirements that will make a strong application.

Much of the inspiration of this text is from my work with immigrants in helping them navigate the many government forms. Even after months working with them, the process can still become overwhelming. So a good reference book will always come in handy even for the most experienced. I hope to keep adding to this as I continue to learn more about the process.

      <comment>Added wayyyy more stuff to the Security Council page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Council Makeup'''

The United Nations Security Council is the most powerful branch of the UN and is the only one with the ability to threaten a country with repercussions for disobeying a resolution passed by it. The Council is made up of 5 permanent members with veto power (United States of America, United Kingdom, Russian Federation, France and China.) In addition it also consists of 10 other countries elected by the General Assembly to serve two year terms without veto power.

'''Requirements'''

Members of the Security Council must have a representative on location at the United Nations building in New York at all times in case an issue arises and needs to be dealt with rapidly. If an official UN emergency is declared, all Security Council Member nation representatives are required to assemble within a period of three hours. It is for this reason that a representative must be at the UN building in New York at all times. 

'''Purpose and Powers'''

The Council's purpose under the UN charter is to maintain international peace and security. The Security Council also recommends the next Secretary-General to the United Nations, in addition to recommendations for higher-up staff of the Secretariat. The Security Council also has the power to admit or reject a country into the UN as an official Member State.

The Council has the power to implement many consequences against a country which has acted against the interest of the UN or international community. The Council can issue sanctions, deploy peacekeeping troops and recommend that a state be expelled from the United Nations entirely.

The five winning Allied powers of World War II, (the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the Russian Federation) were awarded the right of '''veto power''' in 1945 shortly after the founding of the United Nations and the ratification of the UN Charter. Veto power dictates that if one of the five powers finds a '''resolution''' (a UN declaratory document) to be unsuitable for whatever reason, the negative vote of any one of the five powers can make a resolution unusable. Veto power has been debated from the conceiving of the UN to present day, and has been the reason for the lack of UN reform and for some controversial issues such as the admission of Taiwan into the UN as a Member State. 

'''Other Notes'''

If a country is not currently on the Council but is effected by the issue being discussed the representative from said country is allowed to participate in the Security Council's discussion but not vote. This protocol is in place to ensure that all voices are heard in the discussion.

Under Resolution 2758, the United Nations General Assembly officially removed Taiwan from the UN. However, under the UN Charter it is under the jurisdiction of the Security Council to determine which countries are to be admitted or rejected. Only in the event when the Security Council cannot meet can the General Assembly have temporal jurisdiction over such a matter. Taiwan was removed by the General Assembly when the topic of Taiwan should have been transferred to the Security Council, in compliance with the articles on UN administration, found in the UN Charter.

Although common denotation of the five allied powers can be used casually, (such as referring to the United Kingdom as &quot;Great Britain&quot;), the five powers registered into the UN under official names:

 United States of America
 United Kingdom
 France
 China
 Russian Federation

I'd hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot;. The &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; was a political idea which
has effectively gotten the boot after Croats' unrest in students' demonstrations in 1971.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Today's countryside has, worldwide, been shaped and maintained largely by farming activities, and most semi-natural areas are managed with agricultural production as a prime motivation. However, changes in farming practices have reduced the value to wildlife of many farms.

The first comprehensive national discussion on agri-ecological management to increase farm biodiversity in the United Kingdom was signalled by a conference organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group of Agricultural and Conservation Organisations.  This took place in July 1969 at the Silsoe Agricultural College, Bedfordshire.  For the first time farmers and conservationists met to make bridges between the two extremes of land management.  The weekend conference focused on the management of Pendley Grove Farm, a collection of farmed fields made available for delegates to suggest proposals to couple arable and livestock farming with management objectives in order to increase wildlife.  A report on the meeting, 'Farming &amp; Wildlife: A study in compromise', was published in 1971 (Barber, 1971). A most important event following the Silsoe weekend took place in Dorset on the 25th-26th July 1970. Here a 320-acre enterprise, East Farm, Hammoon in the Blackmore Vale, near Sturminster Newton, was surveyed in even greater detail than Pendley Grove, and the study in reconciliation between wildlife and farming widened to include forestry and hunting, as well as freshwater fishing interests.

At East Farm a fundamental issue, which arose at Silsoe, again came well to the fore in the Dorset discussions. It's an issue of applied ecology which relates to the 'strategy' of planning a farm for wildlife interests, in contrast to a series of ad hoc measures carried out by a farmer, which might suitably be referred to as 'tactics'.

There is a wealth of difference between a number of unrelated actions on a farm, such as leaving hedges for the sake of leaving hedges (however desirable the retention of any hedge might be) and the planting of an odd clump of trees to improve the view, and an integrated conservation plan for a farm based on a full understanding of how to provide the most valuable and varied habitats. For it is very desirable that there is a connection between the various physical features. Mammals, many birds - particularly game birds - and some insects need to use connecting lines, travel-ways, flyways, stepping stones, between isolated parcels of trees; and hedges in most instances, wild patches become much more valuable as habitats if they form uninterrupted links.

Reference was made at the Dorset meeting to the extraordinary amount of activity, which the Silsoe conference had triggered off and which coincided with all the publicity attaching to European Conservation Year in 1971. There was now, it was said, a steadily increasing interest in planting patches of woodland, shelter belts and field corners, and one prominent agriculturalist stated that he had no doubt that farmers would be planting thousands of acres throughout the country during the next decade.  However, the sponsors of the conferences were not so optimistic. It seemed pertinent to ask whether the trees would always be planted in the most appropriate place and whether full acknowledgement would be made of the need to ensure, farm requirements permitting, that this relatively new concept of providing connecting ecological links will be applied.

In many cases a series of unrelated actions on a farm was all that was hoped for, but the importance of this particular issue of integrating physical features was an important matter of applied ecology.  It was considered to be a vital part of the conservation message going out to the farming and land-owning community.

In fact it took another twenty years before the Silsoe proposals developed as an integrated government policy, which was set out in the 1994 UK Biodiversity Action Plan.  In the meantime pilot schemes had been organised and several national programmes were developed, but the loss of farmland habitats continued, with government subsidies for drainage and hedgerow removal. Between 1984 and 1990 there was a net loss of 23% of hedges (about 130,000 km) in Great Britain. The net loss of hedges was the result of a combination of hedge removal and hedge degradation, and it occurred despite the planting/ regeneration of about 50,000 km of hedges. In addition to the reduction in the extent of this important linear habitat, there was also a lost of quality. Between 1978 and 1990, on average one plant species was lost from each 10 metres of hedge, an 8% loss of plant species diversity.

Nevertheless, at the time the strategy was published, Silsoe and other initiatives had resulted in several integrated farming and conservation programmes initiated by government agencies.  These were initiatives in applied ecology to integrate agricultural and environmental objectives designed to conserve and enhance wildlife habitats in the farmed countryside. They were targeted at selected areas and habitats to help secure biodiversity objectives.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) were run by the territorial agricultural departments, this scheme was targeted on areas of high conservation value. It provided incentives to farmers and crofters to protect and enhance environmental features of their land and to prevent damage to landscapes and wildlife, which might result from some types of agricultural intensification.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A ‘Countryside Stewardship Scheme’ for England and ‘Tir Cymen’ a payment by results scheme being trialled in Wales (run by the Countryside Commission and the Countryside Council for Wales), were pilot projects offering a flexible system of incentives to farmers and land managers to conserve, enhance and in some instances recreate, selected important landscapes and their wildlife habitats in England and Wales.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Wildlife Enhancement Scheme’ aimed to develop a new and more positive working relationship with owners and occupiers of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and to make full use of their land management skills and experience of local conditions. English Nature launched this three-year pilot scheme in 1991. By the end of March 1993 the scheme had been extended to cover four areas. An essential part of the scheme required land managers to record what they had done on the land in a way that could be used by English Nature. This information was then used to fine tune management practices in the light of experience to achieve the best results for wildlife. Under the scheme a straightforward management agreement and management plan was agreed with English Nature in return for a fixed annual payment, which reflected the additional costs of managing the SSSI for wildlife. Provision was also made for fixed cost works such as fencing which are needed to allow grazing for conservation purposes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme’ was run by the territorial agricultural departments.  The scheme allowed grants to be paid to farmers for capital works, which have an environmental value including traditional field boundaries and shelterbelts, and heather management.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Farm Woodland Premium Scheme’ was also run by the territorial agricultural departments, this scheme offered incentives to farmers to plant and maintain primarily broad-leaved woodlands on farms, thereby contributing to biodiversity and providing other environmental benefits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Hedgerow Incentive Scheme’ was run by the Countryside Commission, this scheme offered incentives to secure the long-term well being and environmental value of threatened hedgerows, through the re-introduction of beneficial management. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In addition to these economic incentives, free technical advice was made available for farmers on pollution and conservation issues, in the form of on-farm visits and Codes of Practice, for example on ‘Good Upland Management’ and on ‘Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water, Air and Soil’. Opportunities for enhancing biodiversity include encouraging the use of traditional, long established livestock breeds that are adapted to the climate and topography of each region. Where necessary, regulations were also used to provide essential environmental safeguards, in connection with, for example, the approval of pesticides and the storage of slurry and agricultural fuelled oil. Underpinning all these initiatives was the Government's R&amp;D programme, designed to improve understanding of the complex interactions between UK agriculture and the environment (it received £67 million in 1992/3).

All of these initiative appeared in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. This was an important outcome from the Rio Environment Summit of 1992 and in effect it set out how ecology should be applied and integrated with agricultural production. The strategy emphasised the significance for eco-agricultural systems in relation to the fact that almost 77% of the UK land surface is in farming use.   Agriculture is, therefore, a key determinant of the Nation’s biodiversity, and farmers and landowners are key partners in implementing measures to further biodiversity. 

Within the relatively small area of the UK there is a great diversity of farming types. This reflects a varied climate, geology, soils and local traditions. Each farming type makes its own contribution to biodiversity, and many habitats and species depend upon traditional agricultural practices for their survival. Agricultural habitats may be highly diverse at the local level. Others may have relatively low local biodiversity, but nonetheless support unusual assemblages of species, which are nationally or internationally rare, and therefore contribute to global biodiversity.

Maintaining biodiversity can have commercial benefits for agriculture. For example, biological pest control - which has been developed through an understanding of ecosystems and predator/prey relationships - has in some cases allowed a reduction in the use of pesticides. An attractive countryside, rich in wildlife, is also a basis for farm diversification through the growth in farm tourism, and can bring benefits to the wider rural economy.

Biodiversity has played a vital role in enabling agriculture to develop to its current productive state. Genetic variation has allowed plant breeders to select desirable characteristics and manipulate plant character and productivity. Maintaining genetic diversity will be a significant factor in the stability and future development of agriculture, while modern biotechnology is likely to lead to the cultivation of new crops and crop strains for food and industrial use. On the other hand, a reduction in the variety of crops and livestock may result in greater vulnerability to disease and pest attack.

With regards threats and opportunities, the UK biodiversity strategy singled out three main concerns:

* the continuing loss and fragmentation of habitats such as chalk grassland, heather moorland, hay meadows and wetlands, as a result of such factors as intensified farming practices, land drainage and abstraction of water and road construction;
* the loss of habitats, linear features such as hedgerows, field margins and ditches, and individual species resulting from neglect or abandonment, and from the decline of traditional forms of management as they become increasingly uneconomic and difficult to sustain;
* damage to soils, water and ecosystems caused by inappropriate use of fertilisers and pesticides and atmospheric pollution.

Biodiversity is enhanced by policies, which encourage land management practices, which produce benefits for wildlife. The aim of such policies is to: 

* protect and maintain existing wildlife features and habitats, which are important for biodiversity; 
* enhance the wildlife value of farmland, which is of low biodiversity at present;
* take advantage of opportunities to establish new, permanent areas of conservation value, especially when identifying alternative uses for agricultural land.

Opportunities for enhancing biodiversity include:

* recognising and strengthening those regional and local farming and land management practices that enhance the national diversity of flora and fauna, habitats, landscapes, historical features and character, and which will help to strengthen links between land use and local community identity;
* improving livestock management to minimise pollution from wastes and establishing stocking densities on moors, heaths and semi-natural grasslands which are related more closely to the environmental carrying capacity of the land;
* improving crop management to reduce the need for fertilisers and pesticides;
* encouraging the use of traditional, long established livestock breeds and crop varieties, which are adapted to the climate, and topography of each region;
* recognising the importance of those traditional skills and practices used by those who manage land, and upon which many valued habitats depend.
* introducing greater diversity on the farm, for example through the encouragement of reversion of arable land to pastoral use in appropriate areas and the wider use of rotations in arable farming;
* maintaining hedges, where possible and appropriate to the area concerned;
* withdrawing from productive agriculture altogether in selected areas and allowing natural succession to take its course.

This broad review sets out scope of the field of agro-ecological systems.  Updates are required from the 1994 baseline with regards, legislation, policy, strategy and examples of operational management.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book arose from a discussion point in the Ecology Wikibook, which pointed to the need for 'conservation management' to be included.  I have close contact with university students and land managers, where the need seems to be for a text book on applied ecology that centres on the long-term sustainable management of the outcomes of things like, reclamation of industrial sites, and reintroductions of rare species.  This would obviously grow into a big project, with distinctive subject matter, so I decided to start it as a separate book.  It is at a very early stage, and I must say I miss the availability of integral Wiki software for making mind maps.  Its not so easy to reorganise what are essentially provisional basic topics, but 'there you go'--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 07:54, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scale of action==
[[Image:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|400px]]
Biological conservation management applies ecological '''evidence''' and practical '''experience''' to formulate and implement actions to maintain or attain a specific '''ecological objective''', which is agreed upon by consensus and/or prescribed by legislation. 

On a global scale the concept of  Earth being a '''single system''' is easy to comprehend. The material resources are '''finite''', and significant amounts of matter are neither lost nor gained across the boundary between atmosphere and space. Our planet is essentially a closed system with respect to matter but an open one so far as energy is concerned (Phillipson 1975). Radiant energy from the sun enters the biosphere and is re-radiated to space as heat. The maintenance of global stability requires that the biospheric inputs and outputs of energy equal each other over time; if this equality is severely disrupted then unstable conditions will persist until the changed amounts of input and output equalize and a new equilibrium is achieved. 

'''Global warming''' is a clear indication of unstable, non-equilibrium conditions.  A new equilibrium will eventually be reached but the question is whether, when it is reached, will conditions be suitable for human existence and well being.

The '''biosphere''' provides the scale on which global conservation strategies and management operations function.  The natural resources of the biosphere are, in effect, assets; as such they can be categorized as either fixed or current. The fixed assets are the non-living (abiotic) components, exemplified by gases (the atmosphere), water bodies (the hydrosphere), and solid inorganic matter (the lithosphere); together these constitute the physico-chemical environment. The current assets are the living (biotic) components—a potentially renewable stock of plants (flora) and animals (fauna). Transfers within and between the two major types of asset can, and do, take place; for example, the daily exchanges of heat energy between atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere and also the biological processes of photosynthesis and decomposition which involve energy transformations and exchange of chemical elements between abiotic and biotic parts of the biosphere.  

The virtually closed biosphere is clearly a mosaic of many interacting smaller systems in which the sum of the parts is more stable than any one of the constituent parts. Biospheric stability and local ecosystem stabilities are inextricably linked; on these grounds alone a strong case can be made for protecting the Earth's natural ability to regulate its own stability by maintaining habitat diversity.  Management of the biosphere's present habitat diversity and natural resources is multinational.  In 1973 it was estimated that 174 nations each had a  share of global assets, which included 1841 thousand million metric tonnes dry mass of plant material (Phillipson 1973).

On a smaller local or regional scale every ecosystem—be it on land or in the ocean—is, like the biosphere, a functioning system. Unlike the biosphere, however, significant amounts of matter can be lost or gained across boundaries (which are frequently difficult to define). Ecosystems smaller than the biosphere are essentially '''open systems''' with respect to matter as well as energy. Left unperturbed over ecological or evolutionary time the constituent ecosystems of the biosphere will, as a result of interactions between organisms and environment, also reach a state of equilibrium; classical examples of this are mature tropical forests and well-established coral reefs. Because of the dynamic nature of the interactions between living and non-living components,  ecosystems smaller than  the biosphere rarely achieve a fixed and lasting equilibrium, and instead exhibit varying degrees of fluctuation (Phillipson 1989a).

Commitment to conservation, including sustainable development objectives, appears to be strongest when:

*an influential leader declares it should be so;
*non-government agencies actively promote conservation;
*local people become involved in conservation projects;
*local people benefit either financially or in kind as a result of conservation activities;
*the country itself makes a substantial contribution in cash or kind to conservation.

==Systems thinking==
[[File:Ecosystem Componants.jpg|right]]
Ecological thinking is about studying organisms in space and time, classifying patterns of distribution and describing the response of populations to physical/biological factors and the impact of human exploitation.  This basic ecological knowledge is '''applied''' to make conservation management plans in order to predict the consequences of a particular action in a conservation management system.  

A conservation management system is based on evidence about:

* boundaries (e.g. the study of species area relationships)
* distributions of species (e.g. the study of effects of local variations in light)
* classification of communities (e.g. vegetation analysis)
* inputs and flows of energy (e.g. analysis of food chains)
* inputs and cycling of nutrients (e.g. measurement of nutrient reservoirs)
* behaviour of populations in response to: -
**physical factors such as climate, geography and soils;
**biological factors such as disease and predation;
**human factors connected with the use of land and water; such as pollution; 
**the exploitative management of species and habitats; such as hunting. 
**experience from management systems for the same species in similar habitats

Conservation management implies the control of environmental and socioeconomic factors in order:

*to make more efficient use of materials, 
*to recycle materials and energy that are vital to human survival, 
*to restore derelict land 
*and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems, which are the basis of all economies, to renew and grow.  

This is a vast area of applied science and technology, which is developing alongside new social organisations that are changing cultural attitudes towards the value of natural resources.  

Over the years, particularly at a governmental level, conservation management has come to focus on biological resources such as:

*Agriculture and pastoralism
*Fisheries
*Forest ecosystems
*Water
*Tourism and recreation
*Wildlife
*Genetic resources

From this perspective the aim is to foster attitudes in community and industry to the use of biological resources, changing from the 'maximum yield' approach to one of ecologically sustainable yield.  This new attitude recognises the need for conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecological integrity.

==Strategies and operations==

Since the first Earth Summit in 1992, national strategies are now commonly in place to integrate conservation management within and between industries and communities to meet appropriate environmental, economic and social objectives.  The practical aim is now to turn these strategies into operational systems and so balance exploitative management of natural resources with their conservation management.  The goal is to provide the principles and tools to soften the clash between Earth’s ability to sustain life and the character of its human occupancy.  This means developing methods for biological conservation management alongside softer technological organisations for production (natural economy) and ‘green’ legislative actions for the organisation of people for production (political economy).  

The global educational topic-framework, which links conservation management with exploitative management, has been defined as ‘cultural ecology’.  It is within this area of knowledge that conservation management systems can be seen to require more than the scientific input of conservation biology.  The essential feature of conservation management programmes is that they are part of the linkages between environmental, social and economic progress; between peace and security; between productivity of environment and community; and between sustainability and the renewal and extension of democracy. In this sense, conservation management is about working on behalf of ecosystems to restore a culture where people are engaged with their place on the planet for the long term future.

It is commonplace to hear conservation managers stress that they are really naturalists who do their best to apply good science to ecosystems that are unique in each case history.  No two sites share the same history and factors limiting their biodiversity. They will differ with respect to time lags and non-linear responses to a given intervention.  From this point of view conservation systems have much in common with the management systems of farmers and gardeners with regards uncertainties of the effects of inputs.  Because of the internal complexity of ecosystems, science has yet to answer fundamental question that were posed by Darwin regarding the factors that control relative abundance of species, with respect to space, time, pattern, food chains and population dynamics. There are fundamental questions in ecological science that underpin all conservation management systems.

[[File:East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve map (en).png|right|400px|East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve map (en)]]

Every nature reserve is likely to have some or all of the following questions unanswered:

* How do organisms change with space?
*: e.g. What constitutes and adequate size and shape of a reserve?
* How do organisms change with time?
*: e.g. To what extent is the site a successional process?
* How do organisms exist in patterns?
*: e.g. How many states or ‘ways to be’ are there for a particular compositional state of a habitat?
* How do organisms exist in food chains?
*: e.g. What is the importance of keystone resources in maintaining community structure?
* How do organisms exist in populations?
*: e.g. What is a sustainable population size for a particular species?

Answers to these questions are embedded in the conservation management system.  All environmental systems are '''open systems''' with throughputs of matter and energy whilst maintaining structure and permanence in the medium term.  A conservation management system will become part of this ecosystem with linkages to several feedback mechanisms, some positive and some negative, so that feedback loops can be unpredictable.  This situation makes it virtually impossible to map the system as a whole, and usually the feedback is only revealed as an unexpected response, once management has commenced.  It is in this sense that a management plan can be considered as the first stage of a research project, and the plan is adapted in response to its outcomes. 

The aim of this chapter is to exemplify the application of the above five pillars of ecology to conservation management systems.

== Conservation management systems ==

A conservation management system is a procedure for maintaining a species or habitat in a particular state. It is a means whereby humankind secures wildlife in a favourable condition for contemplation, education or research, in perpetuity. It is an important topic in cultural ecology, where conservation management counterbalances the unchecked exploitative management of natural resources. Conservation management systems are vital for turning sustainable development strategies into successful operations.

=== The UK experience ===
As a British idea the concept of a national conservation management system may be traced to an upsurge of sentiment after the Second World War that the world should be made a better place. It was the botanist Arthur Tansley who pleaded for organised nature conservation on the double ground of scientific value and beauty. He had advanced the concept of the ecosystem in 1935, and a number of key ideas of relevance to nature conservation stem from this. In the immediate post-war years, he hoped for an ‘Ecological Research Council’, and a ‘National Wildlife Service’. In this context, the idea of national standards of conservation management can be traced to the formation of the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), and its great survey of habitats and species, the Nature Conservation Review, published in 1977. From this time there was general agreement that the common purpose of conservation management systems was to transform situations of ecological confrontation between humans and non-humans into a system of mutual accommodation. The NCC’s first guidelines for managing its national resource was a pro forma to accommodate a description of the site, the goals of management, and a prescriptive section, in which the objectives of management were to be interpreted in a practical manner. Central to the latter section were lists of codified jobs to help wardens abide by best practice. The major shortcoming of the guidelines was the lack of a business philosophy to track value for the inputs of effort and resources.

Britain’s first proper conservation management system (CMS), which tied objectives to practical interventions with feedback from monitoring outcomes, coalesced around Mike Alexander (Warden of Skomer Island National Nature Reserve), Tim Read (staff member of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee) and James Perrins (an environmental/IT graduate of York University). This initiative in the 1980s led to the setting up of the CMS Partnership by the UK’s main conservation agencies, which produced a relational database for linking management objectives with scheduled on-site operational inputs. The database recorded all actions, particularly the results of monitoring against performance indicators. Over the years the software has improved greatly with respect to the user/screen interface, but the data model is still very much the same as in the original programme, which was produced with ‘Advanced Revelation’. Although the NCC has been replaced by four country agencies, in terms of the widespread uptake of the CMS across the UK, the current version, mounted on MS Access, is now, de facto, a national conservation management system. As its use becomes more widespread CMS plans are beginning to function as an evidence-based library of best practice for exchanging practical know how between users.

=== Data model of a conservation management system (CMS) ===
A CMS is simply a recording and filing tool that aids and improves the way in which heritage green assets are managed and kept in a favourable condition. Its prime function is to keep track of the inputs, outputs and outcomes of projects to meet measurable objectives. The aim is to promote efficient and effective operations, and allow recording of the work that was done and reporting on whether or not the objective was achieved. A CMS also enables the exchange of information about methods and achievements within and between organisations. These are essential components of a CMS of any scale, whether a national park, or a village pond.

Technically, a CMS is a project-based planning and recording system aimed at managing conservation features within acceptable limits of variation. A feature is any component of the environment that has to be managed e.g. a footpath or a species. A 'project' is simply a programme of work leading to an output e.g. 'construct a footpath', 'patrol an area' or 'record a species'. Projects are work plans that control specific factors that help or impede the attainment of management objectives. Each project includes a description of a process, e.g. the work to be done, when and where it is to be done and the inputs of resources required. When a project is completed, what was actually done is recorded. This is an output. The outcome of a CMS is the state of the feature at the end of the project and is measured by performance indicators. Performance indicators are quantitative or qualitative attributes of the features e.g. numbers of a species, and they are measured by special monitoring-projects in order to gauge success in reaching the management objectives. Copies of all projects with their inputs, outputs and outcomes are retained in the CMS to provide a progress- register, and an archive to support managerial continuity.

In summary, the prime function of a CMS is to enable conservation managers to control the operational functions of a management plan as a feedback system or work-cycle by:-

identifying and describing, in a standard way, all the tasks required to control the key factors (positive of negative), which influence the condition of the features, and thereby maintain the features in a favourable condition; 
producing and budgeting various work programmes to control the factors, for example five-year plans, rolling- plans, annual schedules, financial schedules, and work schedules for specified categories of staff; 
providing a site/species monitoring system to check the effectiveness of the plan against the specified objectives; 
facilitating the exchange of management information by reporting, within, and between, sites and organisations; 
using feedback from monitoring to improve the management system. 
The sequence of identifying features, setting objectives, and then selecting the factors to be controlled by projects with scheduled work plans, comprises a management plan.

The most effective way of organising a CMS is to assemble it as a set of interlinked forms as a relational database. However, it is also possible to operate a management plan with a spread sheet or a collection of hyperlinked ‘to-do’ lists.

== Scope of conservation management ==
Conservation management implies the control of environmental and socioeconomic factors in order:

* to make more efficient use of materials, 
* to recycle materials and energy that are vital to human survival, 
* to restore derelict land 
* and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems, which are the basis of all economies, to renew and grow. 

This is a vast area of applied science and technology, which is developing alongside new social attitudes towards the values of natural resources.

Over the years, particularly at a governmental level, conservation management has come to focus on biological resources such as:

* Agriculture and pastoralism 
* Fisheries 
* Forestry 
* Water 
* Tourism and recreation 
* Wildlife 
* Genetic resources 

From this perspective the aim is to foster attitudes in community and industry to the use of biological resources, changing from the 'maximum yield' approach to one of ecologically sustainable yield. This new attitude recognises the need for conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecological integrity.

Since the first Global Environment Summit in 1992, national strategies are now commonly in place to integrate regimes of conservation management within and between industry sectors and communities to meet appropriate environmental, economic and social objectives. The practical aim is now to turn these strategies into operational systems and so balance exploitative management of natural resources with their conservation management. The goal is to provide the principles and tools to soften the clash between Earth’s ability to sustain life and the character of its human occupancy.

The essential feature of conservation management programmes is that they are part of the linkages between environmental, social and economic progress; between peace and security; between productivity of environment and community; and between sustainability and the renewal and extension of democracy. This is a roundabout way of saying that conservation management is about working on behalf of the wild to restore a culture, where people live and think as if they were totally engaged with their place on the planet for the long future.

== Fundamental scientific questions ==
It is commonplace to hear conservation managers stress that they are really naturalists who do their best to apply good science to ecosystems that are unique in each case history. No two nature sites share the same history and factors limiting their biodiversity. They will differ with respect to time lags and non-linear responses to a given intervention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==High Level Languages==

High-level languages are usually problem-oriented. This means that most (but not all) high-level languages are written to solve problems in specific areas. As a result there are lots of different high-level languages available to the programmer - some sources on the Internet list over 2,000 of them. This can make the process of selecting the most suitable language a daunting task. 

There are several things which a programmer can use to select a suitable language. These include:
* Looking at the facilities offered by the language and comparing them to the problem
* How well the programme needs to interact with other existing programmes
* The suitability of the input or output to match the user's needs
* How experienced the programmer is with a particular language
* The cost of the necessary compiler/interpreter
* How long it will take to learn a new language if necessary

No programmer can have a good knowledge of all the current computer languages currently on the market. Existing languages are always being upgraded and added to and new ones are being developed to cope with new situations.

High level languages can be classified by the way in which they are organised. This method of organisation is beter known as a paradigm of which there are a recognised number.

===Imperative / Procedural Programming Languages===

An imperative is a command that must be obeyed and that is exactly how an imperative language works. Such a language consists of a long list of instructions that the computer will carry out. It will always carry out exactly the same process as long as exactly the same variables are inputted. The variables allow the user to exercise control over the programme but it will still be executed in a similar way.

Some examples of imperative languages include:
* '''Fortran''' - designed to help with mathematical and scientific products.
* '''COBOL''' (Common Business Oriented Language) - developed specifically to handle files of data and is supported by powerful search and report creation routines.
* '''BASIC''' (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) - originally created to allow students to create simple computer program. In recent years, Microsoft has derived Visual Basic from the original language and has taken it towards being object-oriented.
* '''Java''' - In recent years this language has become associated with the Internet and creating online applications but was originally used to programme the chips in mobile telephones and pagers. This language allows a developer to create standalone program called 'applets' which will run without the use of an interpreter.

===Logic and Declarative Languages===

A declaration is where a statement is made. In the context of programming languages, with a declarative you give facts and rules to the computer which can then be queried to give data back.

==Object-Oriented Programming==

Object-Orientated programs consist of a number of interacting objects. The objects each have properties and behaviours, much like physical objects. This similarity to the physical world is often used when modelling an existing system, or theorizing about the action of the program. The objects are similar to procedural programmes in that they have variables, methods and functions. 

A key difference between an object and a section of linear code is that the variables, methods and functions may have restrictions placed on their use. By not allowing direct access to the state but instead carrying out any changes itself the object can ensure the consistency of its own state. This property is called '''Object Encapsulation''', it is one of the primary reasons that object orientated programming is better suited to complex problems than linear code. In linear code it is common to store the state of the system in a series of global variables, accessible by any part of the program. Object encapsulation allows each object to be reasoned about without having to consider the problems of possible side-effects from code in another object. 

Objects have two parts, the state of the object and the behaviours. The state of the object is stored in a number of variables while the behaviour is defined within the methods and functions. An object is defined by a ‘class’. The ‘class’ is a definition of the variables needed and the code for the methods. When an object orientated program is running only a single copy of the class is required in memory, but multiple sets of state may be created. These sets of state are referred to as objects as the compiler, interpreter or runtime environment hides the sharing of class information.

When an object orientated program starts there are no objects, so how are objects created? The program loader is given an initial class to load into memory and an initial method to then start processing. This first method is then responsible for creating further objects, which may create more objects still.

Object orientated programmes also lend themselves to having one or more concurrent flows of processing within the collection of objects.

Instantiation, classes, inheritance, multiple inheritance, polymorphism.

Object-Oriented programming takes the idea of physical real life objects such as &quot;chairs&quot; and &quot;people&quot; and uses this concept within a programming language. It sets the basic foundation as the &quot;Object&quot; which can be assigned variables (e.g. a name, a persons age) and methods (e.g. a method to call to return the name stored within the object). These objects are then used together to build up a program.

==Declarative Programming==

In contrast to functional and object oriented languages a declarative language such as prolog contains assertions about the problem domain, often in the form of tuples.  The language runtime is most often interactive and allows queries to be entered.  The language then uses the declarations to deduce the answer.

==Data Structures==
Data Structures relates to Data Algorithms and Data Restructring for defining good data base management systems.

==Algorithms==

Algorithm is the step wise representation without any application of any particular logic .e.g.
in the programme to add 3 numbers
'''step1'''-start
'''step2'''-take numbers m1, m2, m3,temp.
'''step3'''-take m1=1,m2=2,m3=3.
'''step4'''- add the three numbers.
'''step5'''-temp=m1+m2+m3(value of addition goes to temp)
'''step6'''-print temp.
'''step7'''-stop

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Old discussion==
''This old discussion took place when the article was named [[How To Solve Any NxNxN Rubik's Cube]]. I have added timestamps and IP to the discussion below to make the flow intelligible. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:02, 7 September 2010 (UTC)''

I'm definitely no expert on the subject, but it seems to me there is no real information in this chapter/how to. To me, it only says: &quot;first solve the center, then solve the rest&quot;. I wonder what adds to the &quot;How to solve the Rubik's Cube&quot; how-to. &lt;small&gt;12:29, 23 January 2006 161.85.127.139&lt;/small&gt;

:That's true.  I'll try to elaborate on the method. [[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 23:35, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

The &quot;introduction&quot; needs rewriting to fit with the style of WikiBooks. [[User:218.102.220.129|218.102.220.129]] 02:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

:There is no instruction and the are cubes of side lengths much greater than five cubeis, for instance the various &quot;olypic cubes&quot; who's sides I know reach a length of at least 11 cubies. I suggest rather than doing sizs increasingly you do even as opposed to odd cubes, as they are solved quite a bit differently. And good luck, this is no small task.&lt;small&gt;23:43, 2 January 2008 71.98.44.37&lt;/small&gt;

A 2x2x2 is not solved the same way as a 3x3x3's corners would be solved assuming that 3x3x3's edges are solves. One must consider parity when solving a 2x2x2, which is not neccesary in a 3x3x3 whose edges are solved.&lt;small&gt;22:38, 23 October 2008 71.89.38.41&lt;/small&gt;

:This doesn't seem to tell how to pair the edges in a 4x4x4 or higher, just how to solve a 2x2x2 and 3x3x3, which I already know how to do &lt;small&gt;20:08, 27 October 2008 69.0.8.183&lt;/small&gt;

You are wrong on all accounts. I vote to remove your post here.

The guide (for solving a 3x3x3) is concise yet complete in a manner that a beginner could employ. So you're dead wrong there.

Your suggestion is horrid as well. The best way to teach how to solve an NxNxN cube is to teach the 3x3x3 solution, then to teach how to reduce the 4x4x4 to a 3x3x3 in a very general way. If you do it in a way specific to the 4x4x4 you will have to teach the 5x5x5 as well, if you teach center solving and edge pairing and the only two parity cases that can be forced in a general manner, then after the 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 are taught, anyone can solve any size of cube.

Again, you are incorrect. A 2x2x2 is indeed solved the same way as a 3x3x3's corners. There is no doubt about that. There is no parity on a 2x2x2. You are making an over generalization that parity occurs in all even-numbered cubes. That only holds for 4 and higher so you are completely wrong.

Olympic cubes only go up to 7 in size. Verdes might release 8 through 11 later on. It could be years.

I don't think you said one thing that was correct or true in any sense. &lt;small&gt;20:44, 31 March 2009 99.9.85.194&lt;/small&gt;

:My, my, my. Questions are not &quot;wrong.&quot; Asking for help or information is not &quot;wrong.&quot; And even incorrect answers, given in an attempt to be helpful, are not &quot;wrong,&quot; and correction of the errors then helps others who might have been under the same misapprehension. And we don't ordinarily remove discussion, even if &quot;wrong.&quot;

:I don't know who is correct here, on the substance, I don't know the Rubik's Cube, but I do know ordinary courtesy, and this wasn't it. This person, with all their knowledge (real or imagined), didn't take the opportunity to improve the page, at least not as IP. Maybe this was [[Special:Contributions/Tobad8]]? (Only one contribution, to the page, removing hints for solving a 2x2x2 cube. Too bad, but, I suppose, it takes all kinds. I'm restoring that, since it was removed without any discussion of it. Long ago. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:02, 7 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clear the rifle and make it safe. To avoid accidental firing, always look into the chamber after clearing the weapon to make sure it does not contain a round. Also, stick a finger into the ejection port and into the chamber (you may need to use your pinky if your hands are large) to feel if there is a round in the chamber. This is the method taught by the USMC: &quot;visually and physically inspect the chamber&quot;. This is a good habit to get into because the physical inspection acts as a nice check of the visual inspection, and it works when visibility is obscured (e.g. in the dark).

:1. Place selector level to safe (this can only be done when the weapon is cocked).
:2. Remove the magazine by depressing the magazine catch, and pull the magazine forward.
:3. Lock the bolt open by pulling the cocking handle to the rear and engaging the bolt catch.
:4. Ensure that the selector is at safe and check in the chamber to make sure that it contains no ammunition. With the selector still at safe, press the upper half of the bolt catch allowing the bolt to go forward.
:5. Place the selector to SEMI and squeeze the trigger to release the tension on the hammer spring.

== Stripping ==

:1. Remove the sling if attached.
:2. Stand the weapon butt upright on a firm surface and depress the slip ring at the chamber end of the hand guard.
:3. Remove both sections of the hand guard from the slip ring and pull down to unclip from the foresight sleeve.
:4. Use a pen to push out the two takedown pins located at the rear of the selector switch and the front of the magazine housing to separate the upper receiver from the lower receiver.
:5. Pull back the charging handle assembly to remove the bolt carrier assembly.
:6. Remove the charging handle by pulling back and down.
:7. Move bolt assembly forward to unlocking position and remove firing pin retaining pin. Do not lose the firing pin retaining pin.
:8. Push in the bolt assembly to put in the locked position.
:9. Catch firing pin as it drops out of the rear of the bolt carrier assembly.
:10. Give the square cam pin a quarter turn and lift out.
:11. Remove bolt assembly from the bolt carrier assembly.

It is possible to strip the weapon further by removing the extractor and spring assembly. The buffer spring can be removed from the butt, but this is not normally done during daily stripping. Reassembly is a straight reversal of the stripping steps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Controversy == 

I'm pretty sure that this article might cause a bit of a discussion, if not a controversy. Bear in mind that Wikibooks is a textbook guide for various practical applications, and there have been other articles that have been nominated for deletion, due to the question of when is something a textbook, and when is something written for it's own sake. 

That all being said, I would not at all mind if the article was deleted, but not for the sake of controversy, but for practicaltiy. Remember, it's an article on field stripping, not marksmanship or  how to fire such a weapon. [[User:Dessydes|Dessydes]]

*I Strongly support the keeping of this article, and particularly the improving of it with various pictures etc. Wikibooks is not censored to only tell you what the government wants people to hear, and there lies one of its significant merits.

I see that you are adding in a deletion tag (using the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template) in several modules.  It would be very useful if you added some comment either in the discussion section of the module or added a comment directly to the deletion tag itself such as this:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|obsolete content that has been replaced by [[XML:Some New Page]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

This gives us a better idea about why the content needs to be removed from Wikibooks and makes it easier to judge pages with a deletion request.  BTW, thank you for your contributions to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:33, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beer is made from four ingredients: water, grain, hops, and yeast. Each of these ingredients can have tremendous affect on the flavor, aroma, alcohol content, and &quot;mouth feel&quot; of the final beer. Sometimes, ''adjuncts'' are used to add characteristic flavors, and often nutrients and agents are used improve the life cycle of the yeast.

==Water==
Water is the largest ingredient (by volume or by weight) in the brewing process.

===Water chemistry===
If you are using tap water, boil the water for five minutes before using it to brewing to remove any chlorine. This will not be sufficient to remove chloramines. Potassium Metabisulfite can be used to remove chloramine.  A simple carbon filter will remove chloramines as well as other contaminants that may affect brewing or flavor.

Various minerals may be added to excessively soft water (e.g. rain water) for those recipes that require it: In particular, calcium is an essential cofactor for the enzyme alpha amylase, which is needed to turn the starch in the barley into sugars. Minerals which are often added to water include:
#Gypsum (Calcium sulfate)
#Epsom salts (Magnesium sulfate)
#Calcium Chloride
#Kosher Salt (Sodium chloride. Regular table salt is not used due to the presence of iodine.)
#Chalk (Calcium carbonate)



==Fermentables==
Fermentable sugars make up the primary ingredients of any beer, and are primarily obtained from grain, usually malted barley grain. Depending on the complexity of your brew, you may use barley malt, malt extract, and/or adjuncts to obtain the desired amount of fermentables in your wort (which is a sweet, unfermented liquid that can become beer, and is pronounced ''wert'').

=== Barley Malt ===
[[Image:malt-types.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Examples of malted barley]]
Barley grain, or seeds, are allowed to sprout for a short amount of time and then dried to prevent further growth. This process is called ''malting'' and allows the grain to convert part of its stored starches to starches that can easily be converted to fermentable sugars, and to produce enzymes and nutrients that are important later in the brewing process. Malts are often described as ''under modified'' or ''fully modified'' and this simply refers to how long the grain was allowed germinate, and thus how well the starches have been converted and most importantly how well those nutrients have developed. Sometimes, this malted barley will be further processed by roasting, toasting, or even smoking, to allow the brewmaster to add special characteristics or complement other flavors expected in the beer.

There are two main types of barley used to make malt; two row and six row. These terms refer to the number of barley corns in the sheaf. Six row barley tends to yield a larger amount of grain per measured area of farmland, but two row generally produces larger barley corns and thus a better yield of convertible starch per measured amount of grain. However, it is generally held that six row barley will have a higher ''enzymatic power'', which is important when using adjuncts without (or with very little of) the needed enzymes to convert their own starches during the brewing process (such as rice or corn).

Malt also varies in colour and its capacity to convert starch to sugar (diastatic power). This variation is determined by the modification level of the malt (described earlier) and by the length of time that the malt is heated after it has been germinated. Lagers and Pilseners tend to use undermodified malt, that is malt which the starch grains are relatively intact such as pale malt, while ales use more modified malts, such as crystal malts. Stouts use heavily modified malts such as chocolate, or roast barley (which technically is not a malt as it hasn't been germinated).

'' '''A note on enzymatic and diastatic powers''': enzymatic power refers to the ability of the malt to convert adjunct starches, diastatic refers to its ability to convert its own starches, which are roughly the same damn thing.''

=== Malt Extract ===
Malt extract is wort which has been concentrated, either by boiling down to a syrup (LME or Liquid Malt Extract) or by being spray-dried to a powder (DME or Dried Malt Extract). Depending on the source, your malt extract may be a self-contained wort concentrate, a single grain extract, or it can be described as something in between. Mountmellick Famous Irish Style Stout malt extract is an example of a self contained concentrated wort in that by simply dissolving the syrup into an appropriate amount of water you will have a fully developed wort, ready to be fermented. It has already gone through a process to extract the sugars from the grain and develop needed nutrients and flavor characteristics. Such prepared kits are invaluable to the first time homebrewer, since they will result in an acceptable beer while allowing the brewer to learn about the processes outside of the actual brewing.

However, to have more control of the flavor, body, alcohol content, and a host of other factors, a malt extract brewer will eventually start to mix and match differing amounts of different malt extracts that have been concentrated from liquid rich in fermentable sugars from differing amounts of barley malts and adjuncts. These malt extracts come from batches with varying degrees of plain malted barley, of varying degrees of modification, roasted barley malt, wheat malt and flakes, rice, corn, many other forms of grain, and even cane sugar. Often these extracts are sold without much indication of what went into them, merely saying &quot;Amber LME,&quot; &quot;dark LME,&quot; &quot;Light DME&quot; and so forth. While most extract recipes will also use such vague terminology, it might benefit the brewer to request information regarding the ingredients, since certain types of sugars can impart unwanted flavors in a beer if present in too large proportions.

=== Adjuncts ===
Adjuncts are sources of fermentable sugars that are not barley. Adjuncts should be used to add unique flavors, aromas, and head retention and body characteristics to a beer. Adjuncts can also be used to increase alcohol content, lower production costs, and add &quot;blanding&quot; characteristics. Major commercial breweries use adjuncts such as corn and rice to reduce production costs and, in conjunction with other techniques and additives, create a consistent but boring tasting beer. This allows them to produce a beer that will be accepted by a wider range of people, and keeping them, while using a minimal amount of capital. While this is good for business, as a home-brewer you are not going to sell your beer, so you should be concerned with what ''you'' like. You will likely find that you prefer unique flavors of your own devising to the lower cost of a simpler beer.

'''Commonly used adjuncts:'''
*Barley - Unmalted barley can contribute to head retention.
*Cane Sugar - Yes, cane sugar can be used to increase fermentables, but can (and usually will) impart a &quot;cidery&quot; taste to the finished beer.
*Corn - Corn starch can lighten the flavor and body of the beer. Some brewmasters claim it has a stabilizing affect on the flavor.
*Honey - If added at the beginning of the boil, the sugars in honey will break down become fermentable, however the most potent parts of the honey flavor will then be lost.
*Oats - Oats can add a meaty, heavy body flavor to a beer. Yes it will taste like oatmeal.
*Potato - A relatively neutral adjunct that can increase the amount of fermentables in the wort at low cost.
*Rice - Like corn, rice can lighten the flavor and body of the beer.
*Rye - Unmalted rye contributes a dry, crisp character.
*Wheat - Wheat malt can impart a sour flavor, unmalted wheat flour or flakes can assist head retention

==Hops==
The use of hops is one of, if not the most, important differences in the production of beer from the production of other alcoholic drinks. Without the bittering effect of hops, beer would be nothing more than a low alcohol wine made from barley (in fact, with a more alcohol-resistant strain of yeast and a slightly higher amount of fermentables, it ''would'' be a wine). Hops are used for three basic reasons: bittering, flavouring, and aroma. They also have somewhat of a preservative effect, although the extent of this effect is debated. In the days before refrigeration, shipments of beer on long voyages would often sour or spoil, due to bacterial or fungal infection or simply due to aging. Breweries often would steep herbs and plants in the unfermented wort to inhibit this spoilage and stabilize the flavour of the beer. Hops simply won out due to the popularity of the flavor, and the benefits it provided, such as improved head retention, clarification, and the counteraction to the sweet, sticky taste beer had otherwise.

Some examples of hop varieties are Hallertau Mittelfrueh, Tettnang, Spalt, Saaz, Mt. Hood, Perle, and Cascade, and they are available in whole form and pellets.

=== Bittering ===
The bitterness in a beer comes mainly from the ''alpha acid'' resins present in the hop flower, or cone. Hops are usually labelled according to % alpha acid, which can be used to determine the amount of a given kind of hops to produce a given level of bitterness.

Brewing scientists use International Bitterness Units (IBUs) in their calculations of the bitterness of a given beer. The units describe the amount of alpha acids per liter of wort. However, IBUs do not completely reflect the bitterness ''perceived'' in a beer because a given IBU in a light bodied beer will taste much more bitter than a heavy bodied beer with the same IBU. The alpha acids counteract the sweet flavors of the sugars, so the more sugars available, the more alpha acids required to counteract them.

A simpler method used in recipes is the Homebrew Bitterness Unit (HBU), which is simply the % alpha acid × the ounces of hops. Since hops of the same variety can vary from year to year in % alpha acid, this measurement can be useful to maintain consistency in the bitterness of a given recipe. Another unit that can be used is Metric Bitterness Units (MBU) which is calculated exactly as HBUs, but using grams instead of ounces.

Bitterness is extracted by boiling the hops in the wort for an hour or more. The alpha acids require the high temperature for so long to allow isomerization to occur, which is just a fancy word to describe the chemical reaction that causes the alpha acids to dissolve into the wort. The longer this reaction is allowed to occur, the better the utilization of the alpha acids will be, since more of it will be extracted.

=== Flavouring and Aroma ===
Hops also contain ''hop oils'' that have strong tastes and smells that many home-brewers find quite desirable. These oils, unlike alpha acids, ''are'' water soluble, and can quickly be extracted. However, because they are soluble, they will also &quot;boil away.&quot; So, to get the desirable flavors and aromas into the beer, Flavoring and aroma hops are added near the end of the boil, sometimes in two stages, and less often a brew master may &quot;dry hop&quot; the fermenting beer.

==Yeast==
Yeast is technically an ingredient, but yet it really isn't. Yeast can be thought of as the machine by which wort is turned into beer. Before the discovery of yeast, this process was considered somewhat magical, and beer was often fermented by wild strains of yeast, and sometimes by a strain of yeast found on a family's stir stick or in previously used fermentation barrels. In fact, the Reinheitsgebot of Germany stated that the only permissible ingredients in beer were barley, hops, and water. Often, fermenting beer would get contaminated with bacteria and/or undesirable strains of yeast, and barrels would be burned - not because of the contamination but because the barrel was &quot;cursed.&quot; A &quot;stir stick&quot; that was used in successful batches of beer would be considered blessed and would be treasured by its owners, not realizing that it was just infected with a desirable strain of yeast.

There are two main types of beer yeast; Ale and Lager. Ale yeast is top-fermenting and prefers temperatures from 60–70°F (15 - 21°C).  Ales are typically more complex than lagers, with more flavour and aroma components. Lager yeast is bottom-fermenting and prefers cooler temperatures.  It typically results in a cleaner tasting beer, without the estery character common to ales.

Yeast comes in two main forms, dried and liquid.  Dried yeast can be of very good quality (avoid that which comes with tins of malt extract, though), and is often more quickly active in a beer. It can produce a limited range of ales—beware that no dried yeast is truly a lager yeast, nor will it provide the distinctive lager character.  Dried yeasts are generally more effective if rehydrated prior to use.  Liquid yeasts are harder to store as they must be kept chilled prior to use.  There are many more strains of liquid yeast, and thus one can much more exactly reproduce a particular beer or style.  Dried yeast is typically used by beginners and liquid yeast by more advanced brewers, although there are exceptions on either end of the scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you continue to homebrew you will gather a collection of homebrewing equipment. This collection will continue to grow and evolve as you continue to brew and you find what works for you.


==Basic Homebrewing Equipment==
The equipment described here should be considered vital to any homebrewing set up. These items should be purchased from a reputable homebrew supply store, since the quality of materials and construction of these tools is of absolute importance. A brewer can choose to use sub-standard ingredients, and/or less than perfect brewing practices (with the exception of sanitation procedures), and still produce a drinkable beer. Conversely, even with the highest quality ingredients, and the perfect application of brewing procedures, use of poor quality equipment will invariably lead to disaster. When choosing equipment, purchase equipment made from stainless steel, high quality tempered glass, and food grade plastics when possible.

* '''Brew Kettle''' - A brew kettle should always be used to boil wort (unfermented beer) before pitching yeast. Some beer kits may claim that boiling is not mandatory, such as pre-hopped extract kits, but experienced brew masters know that hopping even pre-hopped extracts will result in a fresher taste and boiling ingredients will help prevent unwanted microbial infections. The kettle should be made of stainless steel, or aluminum.  While a 3-gallon capacity can be sufficient a larger kettle, capable of holing an entire batch with adequate space to contain foaming will improve the quality of beer produced.  Many homebrewers prefer a kettle with a ball valve attached, allowing simple gravity transfer to the fermenter. 
 
* '''Stove or Burner''' - Some method of heating the wort to boiling is needed.  Small batches can be boiled on a kitchen stove, however propane burner are preferred by many, as they can reduce the time needed to bring wort to a boil, and allows larger volumes of wort to be boiled.  

* '''Stirring Spoon''' - It is important to stir the wort while bringing it to a boil and while boiling to keep from scorching the solubles. The spoon should be steel or food grade plastic; never use wood or porous materials. Flavors from previous boils can transfer via porous materials, but even worse, so can bacteria.

* '''Fermenters''' - Your fermenter must be made of high quality food grade plastics or tempered glass. There are two types of fermenters commonly used by modern homebrewers; glass carboys and plastic buckets. A few homebrewers use stainless steel conical fermenters, which are similar to the tanks large brewerys use, however these are not necessary to produce great beer.  Generally, for a five gallon (19L) batch of beer, the fermenter should have about a 6.5 gallon capacity. During fermentation, a layer of foam will form on the surface of the liquid, which is called ''krausen''. You will need an adequate amount of ''ullage'' to prevent the krausen from contaminating the airlock. (Ullage is the space between the surface of the contained liquid and the top of the container.) It is imperative to properly sterilize fermenters before and after use, and to be careful not to scratch or damage the inside surface. You should have at least one fermenter and an additional food grade bucket to serve as a &quot;bottling bucket.&quot; Some brewers choose to have two fermenters; one for primary fermentation and one for secondary.

* '''Bottling Bucket''' - A bottling bucket is a simple food grade bucket with a spigot attached.  The bottling buckets allows priming sugar to be added to the beer consistently without disturbing the yeast and trub layer at the bottom of the fermenter.  The spigot allows bottles to be filled easily and constantly using gravity.  

* '''Airlocks''' - There are several types of airlocks, the two most popular being the three-piece and the single piece airlocks. The goal of the airlock is to prevent foreign particles and oxygen from floating into the fermenting beer while allowing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to push it's way out. The one piece works similar to the drain trap under your sink, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pushes on the trapping water until it pushes slightly past the bottom of the J, allowing part of the interior atmosphere to escape. In the three-piece design, the escaping CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; actually pushes a plastic cap piece up until the gas can escape around the bottom of the cap. Another type of airlock used with carboys, is called a blowoff hose. A large plastic hose (1.5in for most standard carboys) is attached to the mouth of the carboy and the other end is placed in a container of water. Escaping gas simply bubbles through the water.  Blowoff tubes are frequently used for active fermentation.  The yeast matter can then escape through the tube into the bucket of water.  

* '''Syphon''' - Once fermentation has begun, and there is alcohol in the liquid, it's a good practice to avoid aerating the liquid. Yeast still in beer will oxidize and cause undesirable tastes. So, it's also good practice to carefully siphon the beer when transferring from container to container. A meter of hose will do the job, but if you purchase a kit from your local brew supply store, you will receive a ''racking cane'', a cane clip, and a tube clip, in addition to some hose. The racking cane is a rigid plastic, cane shaped tube that when clipped to the &quot;from&quot; bucket with the cane clip eases the entire process. The tube clip is will allow the syphoner to stop the flow of liquid by pinching the hose; when filling bottles, it's a good idea to have an &quot;off button.&quot;

* '''Bottles''' - A standard 5 gallon (19L) batch of beer will fill approximately two cases (48 bottles), depending on transfer loss.  Either swing top bottles (with the rubber gasket) or pry top bottles may be used.  Screw top bottles cannot be capped reliably using equipment available to the homebrewer.  

* '''Bottle Caps''' - Caps can be purchased from a brewing supply store, usually by the gross (144).

* '''Bottle Capper''' - There are two main types of cappers, as pictured to the right (someday). Description of pros and cons of each should go here :P

== Optional Brewing Equipment ==
The equipment and tools listed here can ease certain burdens of the brewing process, and/or can allow the brewer to employ complex techniques. Some of the tools can be home made, but they should be constructed using the highest quality materials.

=== Record Keeping &amp; Measurement===
log book, clock

* '''Hydrometer'''
A hydrometer is a device to measure the specific gravity (a measure of density) of a liquid.  For the brewer the specific gravity(SG) relates the amount of fermentables in a solution of wort or beer.  Taking Specific Gravity readings after boiling (OG) and at the end of fermentation (FG) the amount of alcohol can be calculated.  Hydrometers are relatively inexpensive equipment which will help to produce consistent beer.  A hydrometer should be verified before each use by placing in distilled water, the hydrometer should read 1.000 in distilled water, if slightly off adjust for the inaccuracy, if far off replace your hydrometer. 
The alcohol content is approximately  ABV=(OG-FG)/7.62

* '''Refractometer''' 
A refractometer is used to measure the refractive index of a solution.  A refractometer is used as a substitute for a hydrometer in brewing applications.  Refractometers have a few advantages over hydrometers, first they can be re-calibrated easily.  The second advantage of a refractometer is only a few drops of a sample are need to take a measurement.  The two main drawbacks to a refractometer are they are substantially more expensive than hydrometers and, the a correction is needed for alcohol content in a partially fermented sample.  

* '''Thermometer'''
Temperature plays an important role in the brewing process.  An accurate thermometer, which can be calibrated is important to ensure a consistent beer.

=== All Grain Brewing Tools and Equipment ===
Sparge equipment, Grain sack, iodine, etc.
==== Grain Mill ====
A grain mill is used to crush grain for steeping or mashing.  Crushing the grain breaks the husk and endosperm inside the kernel allowing access to the components inside the grain.  Most grain mills are roller mills, where the grain is run between two closely space rollers.  While having ones own mill allows more control over the crush of the grain, and allows brewers to purchase bulk grain keeping costs lower, most home brew shops will crush grain for you.  

==== Mash/Lauder Tun ====
A mash tun is a vessel where the biochemical processes of the mash occur.  Most home brewers use a combination mash/lauder tun.  The mash/lauder tun must hold the grain and water during the mash and allow the sweet wort to be drained from the vessel.  The most common mash tuns used by homebrewers are plastic beverage coolers, with a false bottom (stainless steel plate with holes in it) or a manifold on the bottom of the vessel.  The grain bed and the false bottom or manifold act as a filter only allowing the sweet wort to flow out of the mash tun to the boil kettle.  
Commercial breweries will frequently use a separate mash and lauder tun.  The mash tun is where the starch conversion occurs, the entire mash is then transferred to a lauder tun to be drained and rinsed in a process called a lauder or sparge.  This frees the mash tun for another batch to be mashed, while the sparge is conducted on the first batch. Separate mash and lauder tuns are unnecessary for smaller operations where a batch needs to be in the boil kettle as much of the time as possible.

=== Sanitation Equipment ===
Bottle washer, tree, brushes, bleach, oxyclean

=== Bottling/Finishing Equipment ===
bottle fill tube, bottling bucket, spigot, cooler, kegging, etc.

=== Other Useful Tools ===
Chiller, labeling

==== Hop Socks ====
Hop socks or hop bags are knitted bags. Hop cones or pellets are placed inside a sock to allow alpha and beta acids, and flavoring and aroma characteristics to be extracted from them during the boil, while allowing the spent particles to be quickly removed from the wort.  Use of hop bags is a controversial subject.  Some believe that hops should be allowed to freely move in the boil, while others use hop bags to reduce the sediment in the bottom of the kettle at the end of to boil.

==== Chiller ====
Chillers are used to cool wort to yeast pitching temperatures from boiling temperatures as rapidly as possible.  Rapid chilling of wort reduces the formation of DMS (a compound which contributes to off flavors).  There are two basic types of chillers, immersion chillers and counter-flow chillers.  
Immersion chillers are simply a coil of tubing, typically copper, which is placed in the wort.  A coolant, typically tap water is then run though the chiller exchanging heat with the hot wort. 
Counter-flow chillers work by the wort flowing through the chiller on the way to the fermenter, and  cool water flowing in around the wort line in the opposite direction.  Two varieties of counter-flow chillers are commonly in use. the concentric coil chiller with the wort running thought a metal tube which is surrounded by another tube which the coolant flows though.  The other type is the plate chiller, which is much more compact and smaller, however also much more difficult to clean after use. Cleaning and sanitation are very important with counter-flow chillers as the wort flowing though the chiller is not boiling after it leaves the chiller, and it is not possible to examine or scrub the inside of a counter-flow chiller.  
 
==== Whirlpool====
A Whirlpool is used to remove turb from the wort before entering the fermentor.  For homebrewers using a whirlpool the hot wort is pumped from the bottom of the kettle and then pumped back into the kettle such that the wort spins.  This causes the sediment to set in a pile at the center of the kettle when the pump is turned off and the wort allowed to settle.  Many homebrewers are experimenting with combining a whirlpool with an immersion chiller.  This has shown to decrease chilling time substantially as well as reducing the solids transferred to the fermenter.   

==== Water Filter ====
Filtration of brewing water can improve the flavor of a beer.  The removal of chlorine or chloramine (common disinfectants used in municipal water supplies) can greatly improve the flavor of a finished beer.  This is especially important for all-grain brewers.  A activated carbon filter will remove chlorine, chloramine and many organic compounds which are undesirable in the brewing process.  

==== Beer Filter ====
Many brewers wish to improve the clarity their beer thorough filtering.  Filtering of finished beer will remove haze in a beer, as well as any yeast left in suspension.  Depending on the degree of filtration a beer many need yeast reintroduced to be naturally carbonated.  Alternatively a beer can be force carbonated directly in a keg after filtration.  

==== Oxygen System ====
Oxygenation systems are used to reintroduce oxygen to the wort before the yeast has begun fermentation.  Yeast require oxygen to grow, however boiled wort will be nearly free of dissolved oxygen.  Stainless steel diffusion stones are frequently used to encourage the gas to enter solution.  Oxygen is either supplied through a pure O2 tank or a air pump using a sterile filter.

      <comment>/* In the Beginning... */  Hops grow on bines, not vines. Don't ask me why.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==In the Beginning...==
Making beer starts in the field where hardworking farmers raise acres of barley and wonderful hop bines. Barley is grown in winter and spring varieties, and barley for beer is grown in 2-row and 6-row varieties. Hop vines are an annual crop, harvested flower buds, or cones, being the fruit of the plant brewers have interest in. The vines may be trimmed back, and the core of the plant left in the ground for next year. Barley grain is then sent to the maltster, and hops are either immediately used, frozen and vacuum packed until use, or compressed into pellets and stored for future use.

==Grain Preparation==
Harvested grain is allowed to germinate for 1-3 days until the desired level of modification is achieved. Then the grain is dried using heat to varying degrees and drying times to produce the varying types and styles of malt. For some styles of malt, additional preparations are preformed such as smoking or roasting. The malted grain is milled using varied designs of grinders that attempt to break up the starch rich &quot;meat&quot; of the grain, while leaving the hulls as intact as possible.

==Mashing and Lautering==
The starches are broken down to fermentable sugars and extracted into water from the milled malt grains or grist by processes called the mash and the lauter. The mash uses heat at specific temperatures to activate certain enzymes that break starch chains down to sugars that can easily be consumed by yeast. Lautering is simply the straining of the spent grain from the sugar enriched water. Sparging is another process that rinses the spent grain, and is usually done as a part of the lautering.

===The Mash===
There are three major fashions in which the mash is preformed; Infusion, Temperature Controlled Step, and Decoction. The infusion mash is the simplest, in which grist and water are combined and held at a single temperature until the conversion of starches to sugars is complete. It gets its name from the &quot;infusion&quot; of hot water into the grist to obtain the initial temperature. The step mash gets its name from the manner by which the temperature of the mash is brought to an initial point, held there for a period of time, called a rest, and then raised to another rest, and sometimes again. If you plot the temperature with respect to time, the plot will appear to be &quot;steps.&quot; The Decoction mash is the oldest method and is done by infusing boiling water to the mash to achieve initial temperature rest. Sometime before the end of the rest, a measured amount of the mash (water ''and'' grist) is removed and brought to a boil. When added back in, the mash temperature raises to the next rest. This is usually done once more, and sometimes a fourth rest is used.

===The Lauter and Sparge===
Once the starches are converted to sugars, and dissolved into the mash water, the sweet liquid is drained away and sent to the boil. The sweet liquid can be filtered through a collander or a screen, but it is often more desirable to carefully drain the liquid away from the grain to avoid excessive aeration of the hot liquid, since this will cause oxidation. Usually the lauter and the sparge are done as one operation.

The mash is carefully put into a lauter tun, using some sparge water to keep the surface of the liquid above that of the grain. This allows the grain to form a &quot;bed&quot; where the spent hulls support each other and form a filtration structure, while the higher temperature of the sparge water stops further enzymatic activity. Sometimes the mash tun and the lauter tun are one and the same, in which case sparge water is added to the mash to maintain the surface while part of the mash is drained and cycled back into the mash. Once the mash is completely transferred, or the cycling liquid &quot;runs clear,&quot; or has no large particles, the sweet liquid is slowly drained to the boil kettle while fresh sparge water is carefully added to the top of the tun. When the volume of liquid from the mash is drained, lautering is considered complete. But, the process is usually continued, and is called sparging. The resulting liquid can now be called wort. 

==Malt Extract==
The sweet liquid that results from the mash, lauter, and sparge can be considered &quot;extract.&quot; The all-grain home brewer ignores this and proceeds to the boil. However, this liquid can be concentrated, by boiling down to a thick syrup, or cooked into a dry powder. These are the forms we usually refer to as &quot;malt extract.&quot; Bulk malt extract and unhopped extract kits are produced this way, and pre-hopped extracts are either obtained after the boil or simply mixed with hop extract.

When a brewer uses malt extracts to make beer, he must first &quot;unconcentrate&quot; the extract. This can be compared to making orange juice from frozen orange juice concentrate. An amount of water is brought to a boil, then removed from the heat source. The malt extract is stirred in, dissolving into the liquid, which then can be again called wort.

==The Boil==
Hops are then added to the wort, and boiled therein for an hour or more. This causes alpha acids in the hops to break down and dissolve into the wort. Some adjuncts that could not be added in the mash can also be added to the boil, as in the case of molasses, or if a mash was not performed at all (this is then called partial mash brewing). Near the end of the boil more hops may be added to impart flavors and aromas from the hops, certain fining agents may be added such as Irish moss, and certain other adjuncts may be added to pasturize them while leaving their starch chains intact.

Before pitching yeast, the wort must be cooled to a yeast friendly temperature. This can be done by immersing the brew kettle in a tub full of cold water, placing a special chilling coil into the wort, or special chillers that the wort actually passes through. Quick cooling lessens the potential for early bacterial contamination or oxidation of the wort. Slow wort cooling can allow dimethyl sulfide to build up in the wort, which will produce off flavors. Rapid cooling also aids in cold break formation, allowing a clearer beer to be produced.

==Yeast Farm?==
Professional and commercial breweries usually maintain a culture of yeast that they use in their beer. Many homebrewers do the same, and the science, or art as some might consider it, of maintaining a yeast culture is called zymurgy or, more affectionately, yeast farming. This process can be considered apart from the brewing process, since viable yeast cultures can be bought and quickly pitched to a cooled wort, but a wise brewer knows that understanding how yeast lives is very important to understanding how yeast makes beer. In fact, most experienced homebrewers will prepare what is called a &quot;starter&quot; to pitch instead of blindly tossing in the contents of the store bought vial.

A nurturing environment is produced that is rich in sugars and nutrients, into which yeast is pitched. The mixture is allowed to ferment for a day or two, or even a few hours, after which the sediment may be harvested and placed into cold storage. The yeast sediment may also be freeze-dried to produce the dried yeast that comes in packets with many shelf stored beer kits. The stored yeast, in liquid form, can be expected to have viable cells several months later, but a yeast farmer will repitch after no more than a month, both to keep the culture alive, and to revitalize the amount of viable cells.

A day or two before brew day, a smart brewer will create a starter by preparing perhaps a quart of wort, using a DME (dry malt extract) for simplicity and then pitching either a sample from his yeast farm, a stored bought vial of liquid yeast, or rehydrated dry yeast. The yeast will multiply in number until they reach an optimal threshold of yeast per volume of wort, and the fermenting starter will exhibit signs of primary fermentation and it is then ready to pitch to the wort. As an aside, professional breweries who ferment in large batches might make several starters, i.e., a quart to start a five gallon starter to start a 60 gallon barrel. By doing this, the brewer shortens the time it takes for primary fermentation to start, and thus minimizes the chances for unwanted microbials getting a foot hold and ruining the batch.

==Fermentation==
Fermentation is said to have two stages; primary and secondary. In primary fermentation, yeast is very active, reproducing itself and consuming the easily converted sugars. The process may seem violent, and a foam head will form, which is called krauesen. Once the krauesen &quot;drops,&quot; or settles to the bottom, primary fermentation is complete and some brewers will transfer the fermenting liquid off of the sediment and into a secondary fermenter. This is done to prevent the spent yeast cells from negatively affecting the flavor of the beer, however the benefit of doing this is somewhat debatable, and some brewers choose not to do this.

Fermentation can take a couple weeks to a month, or even longer depending on the amount of sugars in the wort and the difficulty of conversion. Light body beers can be quickly fermented with fast working ale yeast. Conversely, heavy body beers fermented with colder working lager yeast can ferment a lot longer. Primary fermentation usually is complete within the first week.

==Carbonation==
Before consumption beer is normally carbonated, and often aged for a week or more. Generally, longer aging produces a better beer, but too much aging can negatively affect the quality. Beer can be ''naturally'' or ''artificially'' carbonated. Natural carbonation capitalizes on the fact that even after fermentation is complete, yeast remains suspended in the beer. After transferring the beer into an intermediate &quot;bottling&quot; or &quot;priming&quot; bucket, additional fermentable sugar is added to the beer. The beer is allowed to sit for up to 24 hours, in which time the suspended yeast reawakens and begins to convert the new sugars. The beer is then put into a sealed container or containers, such as a keg or recappable bottles. Within a week the yeast will have converted the new sugars into a negligible amount of alcohol and an amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adequate to pressurize the container and carbonate the beer.

Aging becomes most important when the sugars added are different than the sugars present in the source wort. Priming corn sugar is quickly converted and so will result in larger bubbles and a thin head. Given time under pressure these bubbles will break down and allow better head development. Priming malt will perform better, but both priming sources will introduce flavors that may not have been present in the original beer. A process called krauesening is optimal, but requires slightly more work. Aging also allows the suspended yeast to settle, and allow the beer to clear, resulting in a cleaner looking and tasting beer.

Artificial carbonation is done by putting the beer into a keg and applying pressure from a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank for at least 24 hours to force carbonate.

==Consumption==
Artificially carbonated beer should be poured into a stein, to avoid sloshing the sediment while drinking. Steins should be washed using a diluted bleach solution, since dish soaps will leave a film on the glass that will destroy beer head. Homebrewed beer still has suspended yeast cells in it, which is a Good Thing(TM). When a human drinks alcohol, its body uses vitamin B complex and water to neutralize and rid itself of the alcohol. If it didn't do this, the human would remain perpetually drunk, which might sound good, but then the human would be unable to drink more beer since it would probably kill it. Now, when that human wakes in the morning after two cases of beer, a bottle of BaerenJaeger, and a few hours praying to a porcelain god, the human's body is depleted of vitamin b and is dehydrated from excessive gifts to the aforementioned god. Yeast cell walls contain vitamin b complex, so a homebrewer, after enjoying a few home brews with good friends will drink a glass or two of water before going to bed. NO HANGOVERS. (Well, at least less likely)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Operating System Classification==

There are several types of operating systems.

&lt;!-- No longer part of the spec?
===Batch===

In a batch operating system, instructions are given to the computer in '''Job control language''' and the task is carried out without any further user interaction.

The job control language tells the computer:

*The priority of the job,
*What to do on an error,
*The filenames of data files to be used,
*The owner of the job,
*The processor time to allocate to the job, and
*The maximum number of lines that can be printed out by the job.
--&gt;

===Interactive===

In an interactive operating system, the user interacts directly with the operating system to supply commands and data as the application program executes and the user receives the results of processing immediately.
The user is in direct two way communication with the computer.

===Real time===

A real time operating system will give guaranteed feedback within a predefined set period of time, therefore taking away the unpredictability of the operation being carried out. This allows for the system to be mathematically modelled to allow the time needed for operations to be carried out to be determined, even under the predicted maximum stress levels. It allows deadlines to be set on operations being carried so as to provide a &quot;best of&quot; result within the time period able to be given for an operation.

'''Example: '''If a real time operating system was used to control a planes rudders (via a RT application) it would need to set deadlines on the calculations used to calculate rudder movements. Without these deadlines a calculations results may be returned to late and cause to plane to crash. 

One very important factor to remember about real time operating systems and applications is that &quot;'''''the right answer late is wrong'''''&quot;. After all what is the point in having the correct answer to a planes rudder calculation if it comes too late and the plane has already crashed because the rudder angle was not changed earlier.

===Multi-programming system===

Multi programming is the apparent simultaneous execution of two or more programs. In a desktop computer, for example, several programs all seem to be running at the same time. What is really happening is that the processor is switching between each program, giving each one a small slice of processor time. This happens fast enough to create the illusion of several programs running at once.

===Multi-user system===

A multi user operating system allows two or more users to communicate with the computer at the same time. Each user has a terminal with a display unit and an input device, like a keyboard, which is connected to the computer system. The processor switches between each user's programs very quickly, and each user is unaware of anybody else using the computer from another terminal.


===Command Line Interface===

[[Image:bash_screenshot.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of a sample 'Bash' command line session, taken on Gentoo Linux.]]
A command line interface or CLI is a tool for interacting with computers, often using a text terminal. Commands are entered as lines of text (that is, sequences of typed characters) from a keyboard, and output is also received as text. CLIs originated when teletype machines were connected to computers in the 1950s. In terms of immediate interaction and feedback, they represented an advance over the use of punch cards.

===Graphical user interface===
A graphical user interface (GUI) allows the user to interact with their operating systems via the use of windows, menus and a pointer. A typical GUI allows the user to click icons on screen and follow through hierarchical structures rather than having to type command lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not enough can be said about sanitation with beer making. Good beer comes about when you use the yeast that you want to without other yeast or bacterium coming in and having a party in your wort at your expense (and bad tasting beer). 

# Assume that everything has to be sanitized before it touches the wort
#* This is a good rule to live by and helps keep your wort from getting unwanted infections. 
#* Whenever you are brewing keep a pail of sanitizing solution available for anything you may want to sanitize
# Have a drying rack available
# Drop your equipment in to the bucket of sanitizer
#* all of it; hoses, spoons, air locks, etc.
# Leave it there for the prescribed time period (read the instructions on the side of the package)
# Remove from the pail, rinse (as necessary) and allow to dry

There is a difference between what is referred to as &lt;b&gt;clean&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;sanitized&lt;/b&gt;. Clean means the chunks, and debris and discoloration are removed from the equipment. Sanitized means that all of the bacteria that may be growing on the equipment is killed. When in doubt, sanitize.

===Yeast Management===

==Yeast pitching==
Yeast is added to the cooled wort as (or after it is added to the fermenter). It is important to get enough healthy yeast in to the brew to achieve a healthy fermentation.

When using a yeast slurry the pitching is adjusted for the amount of beer in the yeast.
The pitching rate is also adjusted for the number of dead yeast cells in the slurry

==Yeast cropping==
When yeast is recovered from a fermenter with the intention of re-using the yeast for a subsequent fermentation it is referred to as cropping of the yeast. The timing of the cropping is important to recover yeast with maximum nutritional reserves.

==Yeast storage==
It is inevitable that yeast will need to be stored between cropping and pitching. By keeping the yeast cold the yeast metabolism is slowed down so that nutritional reserves are available so that the yeast doesn't starve during storage.


===Primary Fermentation===
Primary fermentation takes place in a bucket or carboy, sometimes left open but often stoppered with the carbon dioxide gas produced venting through a fermentation lock. During this time, temperatures should be kept at optimum temperature for the fermentation process. For ale this temperature is usually 65-75°F / 18-24°C, and for lager it is usually much colder, around 50°F / 10°C. Starting within 12 hours and continuing over the next few days a vigorous fermentation takes place. During this stage the simple sugar maltose in the wort is consumed by the yeast. A layer of sediment, the trub, appears at the bottom of the fermenter, composed of heavy fats, proteins and inactive yeast. A sure sign that primary fermentation has finished is that the head of foam (krausen), built by bubbling of CO2, falls. 

===Secondary fermentation===
Often, the beer is then siphoned into another container, usually a carboy, for aging or secondary fermentation. The siphoning is done to separate the batch from the afore-mentioned layer of sediment so that it is not used as food, as this can give the beer a off-flavor. During secondary fermentation the heavier, more complex sugars and impurities are digested. Secondary fermentation can take from 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer, depending on the type of beer. Some homebrewers will keep the batch in the primary fermenter (called single stage fermentation) for secondary fermentation and simply put up with any off flavors. This eliminates the need for a second container, reduces labor, and reduces the likelihood of contaminating the batch with bacteria, or oxidizing it, during transfer to the second container. This is a good beginner strategy, especially for those not skilled with siphoning liquids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bottling &amp; Kegging ==
Before you will want to drink your beer you will want to carbonate it. There are two general ways you can do this; bottle conditioning and forced carbonation. Bottle conditioning is a generic term that refers to both natural carbonation and aging the beer, whereas forced carbonation refers to putting the beer under pressure with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a container such as a keg. Be sure to realize that natural carbonation can be done in a keg, and forced carbonation can be done before bottling.

== Natural Carbonation ==
When fermentation is complete, this only means that all the fermentable sugars have been consumed and converted by yeast; there are still yeast cells floating in the beer. You can take advantage of this, and the fact that a by-product of fermentation is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. All you need to do is introduce fermentable sugars into your beer to restart the fermentation process. There are two main ways to accomplish this; priming or kraeusening.

It is also important to note that if there is too much sugar available to the yeast when you seal the container, the yeast will continue processing the sugar until it is gone - even if the pressure exceeds the strength of the container. In other words, '''without careful attention paid, bottles can and will explode'''. The best way to avoid this is to first be certain fermentation is complete, and then avoid introducing too much sugar for priming. It is recommended to take at least three gravity readings, a day apart a piece; if the reading remains the same through three readings, you can be reasonably sure fermentation is complete.

=== Priming ===
The most common way to restart fermentation is to add a mixture of water and corn sugar or dry malt extract (DME) to the fermented beer. For a 19 Liter (5 Gallon) batch of beer, you will use 180 ml (¾ cup) of corn sugar '''or''' 300 ml (1¼ cups) of dry malt extract. More sugar can be used for a higher level of carbonation, but avoid using more than 240ml (1 cup) of corn sugar or 400 ml (1⅔cups) of DME. The measure of sugars should be dissolved into 0.5 l (1 pint) of boiling water, allowed to boil for a few minutes, and then quickly cooled to the temperature of the beer. Stir this mixture into the beer, carefully so as to avoid splashing and exposure to oxygen.

Some experts state that you should &quot;rack,&quot; or let sit, the primed beer for about 24 hours before bottling to allow fermentation to restart, however in practice, it seems that as long as the newly added sugars are sufficiently mixed into the beer, consistency will be fine, and the time from priming to enjoying will be the same. The most notable problem with priming beer is the introduction of new flavors that would not be in the original wort. This can impart a subtle flavor that will exist in beers that otherwise would be completely different. The best way to avoid this is to kraeusen your beer.

=== Advanced Priming ===

Priming Tablets (Carbonation Tablets) or &quot;Primetabs&quot; are an advanced method of priming beer in homebrewing,  They are small, sanitized corn sugar tablets which come in packages of usually 250 tablets per package, and are used when bottling your beer.  Some priming tablets also contain DME (Dried Malt Extract) in the tablet with the corn sugar.
When bottling your beer you usually add from 1 to 5 primetabs to a regular 12 oz / 330 ml bottle, depending upon how much carbonation you desire. 2 for lowly-carbonated beers like British Ales, and up to 4 or 5 for highly carbonated beers like Hefeweizen and others. There is typically no boiling or other handling required - simply put the desired number of tablets in the bottle, fill with beer, then cap, and that's it. Some priming tablets like Coopers Carbonation Drops only require 1 tablet per a 12 oz [345 -375 ml] bottle so be sure to read the package directions before using.  For example, Munton's CarbTabs are different in amount of tablets required verses Cooper's Carbonation Drops.  The tablets can be added before or after filling as there no difference either way.  However, once the bottle is capped it should be turned on-end 2 or 3 times until the tablets dissolve in the liquid.  After the bottle is capped in the first few hours, it is good idea to swirl or tip the bottle end to end to ensure a good mixture throughout the bottled beer.   This ensures that the added priming sugars are accessible to the remaining yeast in the bottle, then the bottles can be left in a dark 60F to 70F (15C to 20C) environment for the standard week or two, which is long enough for the carbonation to develop in the bottled beer..  For best results the bottle should sit for two weeks.  The only downside with priming tablets or &quot;Primetabs&quot; is their price tag, as they are usually more expensive than your regular run-of-the-mill corn sugar that is typically used to prime beer with.

=== Kraeusening ===
Kraeusening requires a bit of fore thought, before you pitch yeast to your wort. The idea is to save a portion of the unfermented wort from fermentation and then add it back to the fermented beer before bottling. This allows you to add more sugars for the yeast to consume without introducing unnatural (to that specific beer at least) flavors. If you use fining agents at boil time (such as Irish moss) this has the added effect of reintroducing some of those fining agents back to the beer and can help clarity and reduce haze.

The saved wort is called gyle, and due to the fact that worts will vary in fermentable sugar content from beer to beer the gyle will have a variable sugar content. Because of this you must calculate the amount of gyle needed at the end of the boil, just before pitching yeast. This requires the use of a hydrometer. First, take a gravity reading of the wort at pitching temperature, after adding any waters to bring the wort to the desired volume (usually 19l or 5 gallons). Subtract from this reading 1 and then multiply that number by 1000. In other words drop the 1.0 from the front of the reading, so that a reading of 1.065 becomes 65. Then divide the volume by this number, and then multiply this number by 3 to find the volume of gyle needed. For example, a 19l (5 gal) batch of wort has a gravity reading of 1.040: (19liters/40) x 3 = 1.425 liters of gyle or (5gal/40) x 3 = .375gal = 1½ quarts of gyle.

It is imperative to store this gyle in a sealed container to avoid contamination by bacteria or wild yeasts. Once you are prepared to bottle, you will use the gyle in the same fashion you use the corn sugar or DME and water mixture. It is not necessary to reboil the gyle, but be sure the temperatures of the gyle and beer are as close as possible to the same, so as to avoid shocking the yeast.

== Forced Carbonation ==
Beer can be put under pressure in a keg, usually higher than pressure required to dispense beer from the keg, and held there for a day or two. &lt;!-- I'm not an expert here so, I'll stop now. Perhaps I'll pick it back up after some research... --&gt;

==Bottling==
The two accepted ways of filling bottles is by siphoning into the bottles or using a special bucket with a spigot in the side. Many home brew supply stores carry a special bottle filling tube that has a valve which allows you to push the tube to the bottom of the bottle to open the valve and gently move the tube out of the bottle to stop flow. These tubes work both with spigots and siphoned bottling. There is another benefit of these tubes, in that by using one to fill the bottle to its brim, the bottle will have the perfect ullage once the tube is removed.

Ullage is an important consideration when filling bottles, to maintain consistency in levels of carbonation. Ullage is the small space between the surface of the beer and the cap. The ideal amount of ullage is about an inch.

If you are siphoning, use a siphon lock, that pinches the hose, to control flow. If you are using a spigot, attach a length of hose, so that filling starts at the bottom of the bottle. It's important not to splash the beer around, because doing you will aerate the beer. After filling, loosely place the caps on the bottles. Wait about 15 minutes before crimping the caps so that escaping and newly formed carbon dioxide can push the oxygen out of the top of the bottle.

==Kegging==
There are a variety of kegging systems, from tap and pump traditional beer kegs to soda-pop keg systems with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks to &quot;party pigs&quot;, which are 2.5 gallon plastic bottles which use co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridges to perform force carbonation and dispensing functions. &lt;!-- none of which I consider myself to be an authority on, so I will leave this as is pending research --&gt;

* '''When using some verbs, we are committing ourselves to action.''' In this case, you must use present simple.   
  
 ''I promise that I won't be late.''  
   
 ''I suggest you go and see a doctor.''   
  
 ''I insist that we pay the bill.''

== Guitar book ==

Hi. You asked on the german wikibooks-discussion-site on the guitar-book if the images there are free to use and how to handle them. All pictures in this book are already uploaded on wikimedia commons. Thus, you only have to copy the link of a picture you might use from our german guitar-book and place it on your own site. The image-links will work without any change or modification. The only thing you have to change could be the picture prefix. On german wikibooks two prefixes are working: &quot;Bild:&quot; and &quot;image:&quot;. At the english wikibooks the prefix has to be &quot;image:&quot;, so you have to change that in the copyed links if you want to use them.

All pictures on the guitar book are free to use on every wikimedia project, so feel free to use it for your own projects. You only have to create new images if there are german words in our images. In this case copy them, fix the words and upload them under another name (on wikimedia commons, of course).

Another tip: use not only the bablefish-translation. Take the link from the original-page, or better: copy the source-code. 

if you will have any question, send me an E-Mail at mjchael@gmx.de. I don't recognize the changing of the english wikibooks. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] 11:44, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

rehi: Ok , I makes a suggestion for you... You see the German text. I think, you can recognize which could be interesting for you. I assume that you will see the tabs and pictures. If you'll find something, (maybe you want to write an article over something, then I will translate you the German article into a halfway readable English. But I can better translate the pages that were made by me. (Diploma, Workshops..) But I can work only step by step. So I will translate step by step, and I need a person who can translate and correct and make same advices. You can use the texts, or a part of it, or you will only use the Information. It can be that you need only individual components, or only the pictures and left. I will not care about it. Everything that is written by me, I can translate. I for my part hope to catch some stuff from your page. I'm looking for example for songs without copyright. But I have no idea whether the words are correct, and whether the chords were at the correct places. You will find many examples like: [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_Jazzworkshop#Lektionen jazz-workshop] or [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_Diatonischer_Quintfall_in_Am_mit_Samba-Rhythmen samba-rhythm with a standard-jazz progression] with tabs, songs '''and''' midi. Or I have powertabs for the midi-example like [[commons:Category:Guitar_picking|Guitar picking]] and you can make an English version of the PDF. Even the Pictures of the cords can be &quot;translated&quot; in an English version. I am a simple guitar-teacher. But I make it just as hobby and not for my living. So I am a hunter and collector and look, borrow and steal wherever I coud find something new. Changing and translating is more simply than to develop it completely  new. And the most difficult is to find the information (examples) at all. When you (the English wikibooks, not you alone) start to work on the guitar-book I will have more chances to borrow something from your wikibooks.

== Guitar Wikibook ==

Hello NickPenguin, I think your changes should be fine, and if it's not, it's just an edit away.

Right now, I am focusing upon the first section (guitar parts and amplifier), as that's the section I feel safe about. The thing I am wondering if the order the book should proceed: Do we jump right into open string chords, or go into melodies first? Should power chords be at the first? When should we introduce styles, or keep it as a seperate section? Problem is that different instructors have different idea - The instructor in my community center starts with some basic melody first, then to open chord and strumming, while my jamming club teaches power chord first.

As for German wikibook, I cannot understand the language, but what I can understand impressed me enough, so I think it culd be a good idea to translate them into here.

Another thing I worried is whether it became too much; it was definitely more than most book that I had even read, and could be overwhelming. So we may need to figure out whether it's design to be accomodating for beginners, or be as detail as possible.
Anyway, thanks for the message, and happy editing! [[User:George Leung|George Leung]] 05:39, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: childrens'  → children's using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In many old stories, folk tales, and even fantasy games, many mystical figures from sages to witches to elves used odd concoctions of strange liquids and plant distillates to produce magical effects.  Even though these are purely children's stories, all myths are in some way rooted in fact.  Perhaps you can't bring the dead to life with a concoction of wolf's bane and mandrake; but you can cure a stomach ache with a light tea made from steeped ginger root.

The Field Remedies Wikibook is the documentation of just that.  Any distillates, teas or other herbal remedies may be documented here, offering the valuable knowledge of simple remedies for a range of potential conditions.  The information here should be generally useful, enriching, and enlightening to the serious study or casual Wikibooks browser.

Originally the title &quot;Potionology&quot; was chosen for this Wikibook for entertainment value; we also wanted to avoid the term &quot;medicine,&quot; which implies greater authority than we care to claim.  You should definitely seek medical attention for anything worse than a minor cold; don't try fixing that spreading green infection on your hand with a few herbs that you found listed in some online site.  That being said, there is some valuable information contained within.

Once again, the Field Remedies Wikibook is meant to provide practical knowledge, not medical training; it is not a scientific or medical journal, and should not be taken as such. Factual accuracy and sometimes even safety are suspect throughout this Wikibook; although we'd like to try to keep things at least menially correct here.  These remedies are likely not effective in treating serious conditions, and in some cases may be downright ''dangerous''; please be mindful.

==How to Add Entries==
When adding entries, be mindful of the following:

*'''Use a lot of references'''.  If you claim something, make a reference to something else, such as Wikipedia.  Use w: links, such as [[w:Green tea]], to reference Wikipedia.  Any claims made by your own experience should be noted, such as &quot;in the experience of [[User:Bluefoxicy]]...&quot;
*'''Be realistic'''.  Don't put down that a mixture of garlic and wolfsbane will keep vampires away.  That's just immature.
*'''Place warnings on dangerous pages'''.  Certain things will cause nasty side effects, such as dangerous blood pressure increases from excess Licorice; this is '''dangerous''' and it '''needs''' to be noted that you can kill yourself this way.  Don't tell someone to mess with [[w:Mandrake|Mandrake root]] without warning that just uprooting the plant can release a fatal cloud of narcotic gas, or that small doses can cause irreparable cases of death.
*'''Notate works in progress'''.  It's perfectly okay to note that ingredient X has desired effect Y, but that you need another ingredient you can't yet find, or haven't found the right potency, or whatnot.  Concoctions of various herbs are interesting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many '''healing remedies''' which can be sought by distilling certain plants.

==List of remedies==

===Nausea===
Mild to severe stomach aches and nausea can be easily corrected.

* [[Field Remedies/Healing remedies/Ginger tea|Ginger tea]]



While mild nausea may be corrected with small sips of ginger tea (or flat ginger ale), You should give it in tablespoon size amounts every five mnutes. This is important if you don't want it to come back up. Continue clear liquids only for 4 hours. If vomiting continues despite this regimen, evaluation by a health care professional is advisable. Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance could occur and have dire consequences.

Mild stomach pain can often be managed at home especially if it is intermittent and associated with nausea or diarrhea. However it can also have a more serious cause. If stomach pain interferes with your normal activity, is constant rather than intermittent, or lasts more than than two hours, you need to be evaluated by a medical profesional. Sooner then two hours if very painful. Possibilities include but are not limited to: infection of almost any abdominal organ, appendicitis, pancreatitis, liver disease, severe constipation (NEVER attempt to self treat severe somach pain with laxatives!) plus many other possible diseases. Seek a professional's advice or care and do not risk your life or well being by attempting to treat severe pain at home.

===Infections===
There are certain configurations that may help heal from infections.  These may increase immune response or simply dampen certain diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ginger tea''', made by steeping crushed [[w:Ginger|ginger root]] in hot water, can be used to cure some digestive issues.

==Background==
Ginger has many beneficiary properties.  It contains many [[w:Antioxidants|antioxidants]], which may help prevent [[w:Cancer|cancer]] according to medical studies.  It is also known to effectively cure all forms of [[w:Nausea|nausea]] including [[w:Motion sickness|seasickness and carsickness]] as well as [[w:Morning sickness|morning sickness]]; do note, however, many physicians recommend against the use of ginger to combat morning sickness, although pregnant Chinese women traditionally use it for exactly this purpose.

According to the PDR[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101230.shtml], ginger has been shown to promote production of saliva, digestive juices, and bile.  It also tends to boost the pumping action of the heart, prevent the formation of blood clots, lower LDL cholesterol, and decrease inflammation.  It may have a stimulative effect on the immune system; this has not been concluded.  Ginger also has mild laxative effects due to stimulation of the [[w:GI tract|GI tract]].

The anti-inflammatory properties of ginger has lead some to use it for the treatment of diseases such as arthritis and bronchitis; one study of 261 participants showed that ingesting ginger twice daily significantly reduces the pain experienced by sufferers of osteoarthritis, versus those being administered a placebo.

As ingesting ginger ''may'' lower LDL cholesterol levels and prevent blood clotting, it may be helpful in preventing [[w:Atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]], [[w:Heart attack|heart attack]]s, and [[w:Stroke|stroke]].  Ginger also has [[w:Analgesic|pain relieving]], [[w:Sedative|sedative]], [[w:Antipyretic|fever reduction]], and [[w:Antibacterial|antibacterial]] effects.

===Precautions===
Ginger root should not be consumed in doses exceeding 6 grams per day.  This may damage the lining of the stomach and cause stomach ulcers.  '''Large overdoses may lead to [[w:Central nervous system|CNS]] depression and heart irregularities''' and you should '''seek medical attention ''immediately'' if you suspect a large overdose'''.

Avoid ginger if you are at risk of internal bleeding or have gallstones.  The PDR also recommends against using ginger to treat [[w:Morning sickness|morning sickness]], although there is no evidence that ginger is harmful during pregnancy.

Do not take large doses of ginger if you are also taking a blood-thinning drug.

===Notes===
It is notable that ginger will not cure the underlying cause of any disease, especially nausea; it will only allieviate some of the symptoms associated.  Mild cases of food poisoning, for example, can be easily waited out; but severe cases can be fatal, and you should always seek medical attention if you suspect a dangerous infection.  If your doctor tells you it will go away on its own, or just perscribes simple antibiotics such as [[w:Penicillin|penicillin]], ginger tea is a good way to quell the symptoms in the meanwhile.

Ginger root has a strong and spicey flavor; chewing on a small piece of the root may be quite painful and difficult for many individuals, somewhat in the way chewing on a [[w:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] would be, as the active constituent is a compound similar to [[w:Capsaicin|capsaicin]].  A diluted tea, however, should be easily drinkable by most; and for those who enjoy the flavor of ginger root, can even be a pleasant beverage.

==Preparation==
For ginger tea, you will need a small slice of [[w:Ginger|ginger root]] and 250mL (''about 8oz'') of hot water; the PDR recommends 0.5-1g[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101230.shtml] of ginger be used.

To prepare the tea, [[Field Remedies/Preparation/Crush|crush]] the ginger and pour hot water (''recommended: 85C'') over it.  Fill the vessel with approximately 175-250mL (''6-8oz'') of hot water and steep for about 5 minutes.  [[Field Remedies/Preparation/Strain|Strain]], if desired.  Honey may be added to sweeten the tea to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Licorice''' has several beneficiary properties, although '''can be quite dangerous''' as well.  High doses of licorice increase blood pressure a lot.  '''The increased blood pressure and clotting risk can lead to strokes and other ill effects'''.

==Background==
Licorice has many beneficiary properties.  It is a highly effective [[w:Cough medicine|cough medicine]], and in this is present its very interesting historical use.  Licorice also may have uses related to [[w:Mouth ulcer|mouth]] and [[w:Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcer]]s.  It also presents itself as a mild [[w:Laxative|laxative]].  Licorice has also been noted to help with liver disease and reduce the risk of liver cancer; and increases T-Cell count and interferon production, boosting immune response to viruses such as hepatitis and influenza.

In Asian medicine, licorice root has been used for boils, dehydration, diarrhea, eye diseases, headache, sore throat, and swellings from infections.  its effectiveness for these disorders has not been scientifically verified.[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101700.shtml]

Licorice has been mentioned in 63 readings by [[w:Edgar Cayce|Edgar Cayce]][http://www.meridianinstitute.com/echerb/Files/1licoric.html].  Cayce notes the benefits of Licorice on the intestinal tract, the liver, and the healing process in general; and describes (''without medical training'') how and why this works.  Cayce also has recommended licorice to soothe minor cardiac arhythma problems.

===Tentative===
It has also been said that [[w:Licorice|licorice]] stimulates excess red blood cell production, which can have a similar effect to [[w:Blood doping|blood doping]], where blood is drawn and then later re-injected to increase red blood cell count in the body.  The blood doping procedure is a disqualifying infraction in most sports events for this reason; it is detected by checking for elevated red blood cell count.

Increased red blood cell count allows you to supply more oxygen to muscles, leading to efficient removal of waste carbon and thus mildly increased strength, muscular endurance, and stamina.  Unfortunately, it also leads to increased platelets, which leads to increased blood clotting and risk of stroke.

Licorice has also been said &lt;!--by Edgar Cayce if [[User:Bluefoxicy]] recalls correctly--&gt; to increase the general rate of healing.

==Special Precautions==
Licorice has some unfortunate negative side effects.  Large doses of licorice can lead to [[w:Hypokalemia|hypokalemia]], a potentially fatal potassium deficiency, as well as severe increases in [[w:Blood pressure|blood pressure]].  These dangerous side effects make highly concentrated licorice distillates extremely dangerous.

The PDR notes that dosages of more than 20 grams of Licorice Extract or 50 grams of licorice root daily for an extended period of time will lead to excessive loss of salt from the blood, water retention, high blood pressure, and heart irregularities, sometimes accompanied by fatigue, headaches, and muscle cramps.  It further recommends to limit use of Licorice preparations to 6 weeks, noting that the side effects disappear after the drug is discontinued.

The PDR also describes drug interacitons.  Licorice increases potassium loss associtaed with other drugs such as diuretics. This potassium loss ca cause increased sensitivity to the heart medication digitalis.  Other heart drugs such as quinidine and procainamide can increase licorice-induced potassium loss, leading to a dangerously rapid heartbeat.  Licorice may also increase the effects and unwanted side effects of steroid medications such as prednisone (Deltasone).

The PDR specifies quite directly to '''not take licorice when pregnant'''.

==Preparation==
For those who enjoy licorice, a licorice tea can be a soothing and beneficial drink.  A tea can be made by using 1-1.5g (1/2tsp) of licorice root.  The root must be crushed, possibly utilizing a [[w:Garlic press|garlic press]]; and boiled in water.  The root can be added to cold water and boiled, or be placed in a vessel and have boiling water poured over it.  In either case, steep in the boiling water for 15 minutes; strain; and drink.

''Based on the method given in the PDR''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cold resistance? ==

In Dragon Quest 8, there's an herb called &quot;Nook Grass&quot; that when distilled into tea or consumed causes the body to warm, and increases cold tolerance.  Interestingly enough, ingesting niacin (nicotinic acid) does exactly the same thing.  Is there a plant that's safe to make a concentrated distillate or a mild tea from to help with this?

The concentrated distillate would (just like popping a 500mg niacin pill) cause extreme flushing and help if you're outside for too long in the cold and starting to freeze (''run to the house now that you can move!''); while a mild tea would QUICKLY warm you up after being outside in the cold.  Continued ingestion of this B vitamin in fair amounts is completely safe; it takes a LOT to overdose on niacin, although it can be done and the consequences are deadly.  Also continued ingestion will lead to lasting cold tolerance, even if it stops sudden flushing you hot.

== More PDR stuff ==

The PDR has a few good herbal pages.  Here's a few more we could use.

*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/100980.shtml Echinacea]&amp;mdash;2 effective varieties, sweet/bitter taste.  Relieves colds and shortens the lifecycle of the flu; increases white blood cells, spleen cells, T-helper cells, and interleukin (all immune system agents); has an effect on viruses similar to interferon.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102120.shtml Parsely]&amp;mdash;Kidney/bladdar stones, urinary tract infections.  This stuff makes you diuretic, so you should drink a lot of fluids and a little of the oils; then you'll pee and pee and pee and flush your urinary tract out, as opposed to leaving festering infections there.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101320.shtml Green tea]&amp;mdash;Antioxidents, prevents cancer of stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, breast, lung, and pancreas.  Helps with diarrhea and upset stomach.  Can be used as a mouthwash to prevent plaque and cavities.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102460.shtml Sage]&amp;mdash;Appetite loss, excess perspiration, sore throat.  Watch out for overdoses.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101250.shtml Ginseng]&amp;mdash;Enhanced thought process, decreased reaction time, virus resistence, fatigue reduction, antioxident, blood thinning, decreased blood sugar, decreased LDL.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102600.shtml Siberian ginseng]&amp;mdash;Enhances immune system.  May cause high blood pressure.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102040.shtml Notoginseng]&amp;mdash;Slows or stops internal and external bleeding; relieves pain when applied topically; can be used topically to speed the healing of wounds and bruises.  Possibly lowers hypertension.  Not known if it can be overdosed on; but not known if we can make tea from this either.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102170.shtml Peppermint]&amp;mdash;Surprisingly useful. Liver and gallbladdar problems; appetite loss; bronchitis; colds, coughs, sore throats; fevers; succeptibility to infections.  Damn hard to overdose on (has never been done), but possible.  You can make tea out of this.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102420.shtml Rosemary]&amp;mdash;Can be mixed with wine.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102650.shtml Spinach]&amp;mdash;When &quot;run down,&quot; taking spinach will make you feel better.  Makes you strong to the finach.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102670.shtml St. John's Wort]&amp;mdash;Smile.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102960.shtml Witch Hazel]&amp;mdash;Use topically to heal wounds and insect bites etc.


Unuseful things:
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101240.shtml Ginkgo]&amp;mdash;enhances brain function; but only useful in concentrated extracts.  You'll have to buy this stuff.

There's an [http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/index.shtml index] on the PDR site of the different plants they know about.

== The Bilinear Transform ==

The '''Bilinear transform''' is a mathematical relationship which can be used to convert the transfer function of a particular filter in the complex Laplace domain into the z-domain, and vice-versa. The resulting filter will have the same characteristics of the original filter, but can be implemented using different techniques. The Laplace Domain is better suited for designing analog filter components, while the Z-Transform is better suited for designing digital filter components.

The bilinear transform is the result of a numerical integration of the analog transfer function into the digital domain. We can define the bilinear transform as:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{2(1-z^{-1})}{T(1+z^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

The bilinear transform can be used to produce a piecewise constant magnitude response that approximates the magnitude response of an equivalent analog filter. The bilinear transform does not faithfully reproduce the analog filters phase response, however.

== W Domain ==

The bilinear transform is a one-to-one mapping, that is that a unique point in one domain will be transformed into a unique point in the other domain. However, the transformation is not a linear transformation, and is not an exact equivalency between Laplace and Z domains. If a digital filter is designed and transformed into an analog filter, the resulting poles and zeros are not located on the s-plane, but instead on the w-plane that has similar properties, but with a nonlinear correspondence.

In the bilinear transform, the positive imaginary axis in the s-domain is transformed into the upper-half unit circle in the z-domain. Likewise, the negative imaginary axis in the s-domain is transformed into the lower-half unit circle in the z-domain. This mapping is highly nonlinear, however, resulting in a phenomina known as &quot;frequency warping&quot;.

== Prewarping ==

Frequency warping follows a known pattern, and there is a known relationship between the warped frequency and the known frequency. We can use a technique called '''prewarping''' to account for the nonlinearity, and produce a more faithful mapping.

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_p = \frac{2}{T}\tan\left(\frac{\omega}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The ''p'' subscript denotes the prewarped version of the same frequency.

== Phase ==

The bilinear transform does not maintain the phase characteristics of the analog filter, and there is no way to correct the phase response to match.

== Filter Design Steps ==

When designing a digital filter using an analog approximation and the bilinear transform, we follow these steps:

#Prewarp the cutoff frequencies
#Design the necessary analog filter
#apply the bilinear transform to the transfer function
#Normalize the resultant transfer function to be monotonic and have a unity passband gain (0dB).

Alternatively, if we have an '''inverse bilinear transform''', we can follow these steps:

#use the inverse bilinear transform on the filter specifications in the digital domain to produce equivalent specifications in the analog domain.
#Construct the analog filter transfer functions to meet those specifications.
#use the bilinear transform to convert the resultant analog filter into a digital filter.

== The Inverse Bilinear Transform ==

The inverse bilinear transform can be specified as such:

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{1 + s}{1 - s}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Sonorus''''' is a spell that is used by a wizard to make his voice louder, used when he needs to address a large gathering.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Sonorus spell is first seen used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] when he is called upon to commentate the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. Having charmed his own voice, it then is loud enough to reach every one of the hundred thousand or so wizards in the stadium. When the game is finished, Ludo ends the spell by invoking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Quietus|Quietus]].

Ludo uses this spell again when commentating the events in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].

== Analysis ==

From a simple viewpoint of physics, one has to wonder about how this charm actually works. Specifically, if Quidditch matches are anything like football (soccer) matches, the fans will be loudly singing their team's songs, and so sound that would reach them would have to be extremely loud. Muggle stadiums have multiple sound sources, set up in the air well away from the spectators, so that they can be made arbitrarily loud without deafening anyone in particular. Yet Ludo is in the top box, along with all the dignitaries; sound loud enough to reach the cheap seats at the far ends of the pitch, over all the shouting that the fans are going to be doing, would have to be literally deafening to other occupants of the Top Box, and rendering the Minister for Magic deaf, along with the Minister's Bulgarian opposite number, cannot be good for any wizard's employment prospects. On that basis alone, it is most likely that the spell works partly by boosting the Charmed wizard's volume, and partly by selectively sensitizing the onlookers' ears to his voice, so that they hear him partly through the air, partly by direct mental impression. This would explain both the ability of Ludo's voice to reach the entire Quidditch World Cup stadium, and also be dimly audible to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] while he is waiting to enter the arena for his First Task – in the latter case, Harry was not in the area where Ludo had chosen to make his voice audible, so could only hear the amplified audio portion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The spacetime position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be encoded in a paravector

:&lt;math&gt;
 x = x^0 + \mathbf{x},
&lt;/math&gt;

with the scalar part of the spacetime position in terms of the time

:&lt;math&gt;x^0 = c t_{{}_{}}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The proper velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the derivative of the spacetime position with respect to the proper time &lt;math&gt;\tau_{{}_{}} &lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;
c\, u  = \frac{dx}{d \tau } 
&lt;/math&gt;

The proper velocity can be written in terms of the velocity

:&lt;math&gt;
c\, u  =  \frac{dx^0}{d \tau} + \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{d \tau} =
 \gamma\left( 1 +  \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{d x^0}  \right) = 
 \gamma\left( 1 +  \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}  \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma =  \frac{dx^0}{d \tau} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\mathbf{v}^2}{c^2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and of course

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = \frac{d \mathbf{x}}{d t }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The proper velocity is unimodular

:&lt;math&gt;
 u \bar{u} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

==Spacetime momentum==

The spacetime momentum is a paravector defined in terms of the proper velocity

:&lt;math&gt;
 p_{{}_{}} = m c u
&lt;/math&gt;

The spacetime momentum contains the energy as the scalar part

:&lt;math&gt;
 p = mc ( \gamma  + \gamma \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} ) = 
 \frac{E}{c} + \mathbf{p},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{{}_{}} = \gamma m c^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

The shell condition of the spacetime momentum is

:&lt;math&gt; p \bar{p} = (mc)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation that maintains the length of paravectors. Lorentz transformations include rotations and boosts as proper Lorentz transformations and reflections and non-orthochronous transformations among the improper Lorentz transformations.

A proper Lorentz transformation can be written in spinorial form as

:&lt;math&gt;
p\rightarrow p^\prime = L p L^\dagger,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the spinor &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; is subject to the condition of unimodularity

:&lt;math&gt; L \bar{L} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In &lt;math&gt;Cl_3 &lt;/math&gt;, the spinor &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; can be written as the
exponential of a biparavector &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{{ }_{ }} = e^{W}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Rotation==

If the biparavector &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; contains only a bivector (complex vector in  &lt;math&gt;Cl_3 &lt;/math&gt;), the Lorentz transformations is a rotation in the plane of the bivector

:&lt;math&gt;
R  = e^{ -i \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\theta} }
&lt;/math&gt;

for example, the following expression represents a rotor that applies a rotation angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; around the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; 
according to the right hand rule

:&lt;math&gt;
R  = e^{-\frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_{12}}=e^{ -i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 },
&lt;/math&gt;

applying this rotor to the unit vector along &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; gives the expected result

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e}_1 \rightarrow  e^{ -i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 } \mathbf{e}_1
e^{ i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 } = \mathbf{e}_1 e^{ i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 }e^{ i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 } = \mathbf{e}_1 e^{ i \theta \mathbf{e}_3 } =
\mathbf{e}_1 ( \cos(\theta) + i \mathbf{e}_3 \sin(\theta) ) =
\mathbf{e}_1 \cos(\theta) + \mathbf{e}_2 \sin(\theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

The rotor &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has two fundamental properties. It is said to be unimodular and
unitary, such that

* Unimodular:  &lt;math&gt;R \bar{R} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* Unitary: &lt;math&gt;RR^\dagger = 1&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of rotors, the bar conjugation and the reversion have the same effect

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{R} = R^\dagger. &lt;/math&gt;

==Boost==

If the biparavector &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; contains only a real vector, the Lorentz transformation is a boost along the direction of the respective vector

:&lt;math&gt;
R  = e^{ \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\eta} }
&lt;/math&gt;

for example, the following expression represents a boost along the 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; direction

:&lt;math&gt;
B  = e^{  \frac{1}{2} \eta \, \mathbf{e}_3 },
&lt;/math&gt;

where the real scalar parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the rapidity.

The boost &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is seen to be:
* Unimodular:  &lt;math&gt;B \bar{B} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* Real:  &lt;math&gt;B^\dagger = B &lt;/math&gt;

==The Lorentz transformation as a composition of a rotation and a boost==

In general, the spinor of the proper Lorentz transformation can be written
as the product of a boost and a rotor

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{{}_{ }}  = B R
&lt;/math&gt;

The boost factor can be extracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
B = \sqrt{L L^\dagger}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the rotor is obtained from the even grades of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
R = \frac{L + \bar{L}^\dagger}{2 \langle B \rangle_S}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Boost in terms of the required proper velocity==

The proper velocity of a particle at rest is equal to one

:&lt;math&gt;u_{r_{ }} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Any proper velocity, at least instantaneously, can be obtained from an active Lorentz transformation from the particle at rest, such that

:&lt;math&gt;
u = L u_{r_{}} L^\dagger,
&lt;/math&gt;

that can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
u = L L^\dagger = BR (BR)^\dagger = B R R^\dagger B^\dagger = BB = B^2,
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;
B = \sqrt{u} = \frac{1+u}{\sqrt{2(1+\langle u \rangle_S)}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the explicit formula of the square root for a unit length paravector was used.

==Rapidity and velocity==

The proper velocity is the square of the boost

:&lt;math&gt;
u = B^{2^{ }},
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma(1+\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}) = e^{\boldsymbol{\eta}},
&lt;/math&gt;

rewriting the rapidity in terms of the product of its magnitude and respective 
unit vector

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\eta} = \eta \hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}&lt;/math&gt;

the exponential can be expanded as

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma +  \gamma\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} = \cosh(\eta) + \hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\sinh(\eta),
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{{ }_{ }} = \cosh{\eta} &lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\sinh(\eta), &lt;/math&gt;

where we see that in the non-relativistic limit the rapidity becomes the velocity divided by the speed of light

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} = \hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}} \eta &lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz transformation applied to biparavectors==

The Lorentz transformation applied to biparavector has a different form from the Lorentz transformation applied to paravectors. Considering a general biparavector written in terms of paravectors

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle u \bar{v}  \rangle_V  \rightarrow \langle u^\prime \bar{v}^\prime \rangle_V  
&lt;/math&gt;

applying the Lorentz transformation to the component paravectors

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle u^\prime \bar{v}^\prime  \rangle_V = 
\langle L u L^\dagger \,\, \overline{ L v L^\dagger} \rangle_V=
 \langle L u L^\dagger\, \bar{L}^\dagger\bar{v} \bar{L} \rangle_V =
  \langle L u \bar{v} \bar{L} \rangle_V = 
 L\langle u \bar{v}  \rangle_V\bar{L},
&lt;/math&gt;

so that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a biparavector, the Lorentz transformations is given 
by

:&lt;math&gt;
F \rightarrow F^{\prime_{ }} = L F \bar{L}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The electromagnetic field is defined in terms of the electric and magnetic fields as

:&lt;math&gt;
F = \mathbf{E} + i c\mathbf{B},
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived from a paravector potential &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
F =  c \left\langle \partial \bar{A}  \right\rangle _{V},
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;
\partial  =  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^0}  - \nabla 
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
A  =   \Phi/c + \mathbf{A}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorenz gauge==

The Lorenz gauge (without t) is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \partial \bar{A} \rangle_S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is still invariant under
a gauge transformation 

:&lt;math&gt;
A \rightarrow A^\prime = A + \partial \chi,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is a scalar function subject to the following condition

:&lt;math&gt; 
\partial \bar{\partial} \chi = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

==Maxwell Equations==

The Maxwell equations can be expressed in a single equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\partial} F = \frac{1}{c \epsilon} \bar{j},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the current &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
j = \rho c + \mathbf{j}
&lt;/math&gt;

Decomposing in parts we have
* Real scalar: Gauss's Law
* Real vector: Ampere's Law
* Imaginary scalar: No magnetic monopoles 
* Imaginary vector: Faraday's law of induction

===Electromagnetic Lagrangian===
The electromagnetic Lagrangian that gives the Maxwell equations is 

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} \langle F F \rangle_S - \langle A \bar{j} \rangle_S
&lt;/math&gt;

===Energy density and Poynting vector===

The energy density and Poynting vector can be extracted from 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F F^\dagger = \varepsilon+ \frac{1}{c}S,
&lt;/math&gt;
where energy density is
:&lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}( E^2 + c^2 B^2 )
&lt;/math&gt;
and the Poynting vector is
:&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} E \times B
&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz Force==

The electromagnetic field plays the role of a spacetime rotation with

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{e}{mc} F &lt;/math&gt; 

The Lorentz force equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d p}{d \tau} = \langle F u \rangle_{\Re}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Lorentz force in spinor form is 

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{ d \tau} = \frac{e}{2mc} F \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentz Force Lagrangian===
The Lagrangian that gives the Lorentz Force is

:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{1}{2} m u \bar{u} +  e \langle \bar{A}u \rangle_S
&lt;/math&gt;

==Plane electromagnetic waves ==

The propagation paravector is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;
   k = \frac{\omega}{c} + \mathbf{k},
&lt;/math&gt;

which is a null paravector that can be written in terms of the unit vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
   k = \frac{\omega}{c}(1 +\mathbf{\hat k} ),
&lt;/math&gt;

A vector potential that gives origin to a polarization|circularly polarized plane wave of left ''helicity'' is

:&lt;math&gt;
A = e^{i s \mathbf{\hat k}} \mathbf{a},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the phase is

&lt;math&gt; s=\left\langle k \bar{x} \right\rangle_S = \omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; 

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be perpendicular to the propagation vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;. This paravector potential obeys the Lorenz gauge condition.
The right helicity is obtained with the opposite sign of the phase

The electromagnetic field of this paravector potential is calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;
F = i c k A_{{}_{}},
&lt;/math&gt;

which is nilpotent

:&lt;math&gt;
F F_{{}_{}} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The proper velocity can be expressed in terms of the associated Lorentz transformation spinor called ''eigenspinor''. 

The proper time derivative of the eigenspinor can be expressed in terms of the
spacetime rotation biparavector &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{d \tau} = \frac{1}{2} \Omega \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

The spacetime rotation biparavector contains the information of the interaction that the particle is subject to. 

The dynamics of a classical particle can be expressed in terms of a differential equation involving the eigenspinor.

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d p}{d \tau}  = mc \frac{d }{d\tau} 
( \Lambda   \Lambda^\dagger ) =
mc ( \frac{d \Lambda }{d\tau} \Lambda^\dagger 
+ \Lambda \frac{d \Lambda^\dagger}{d \tau}   ),
&lt;/math&gt;

using the definition of the spacetime rotation biparavector

:&lt;math&gt;
mc \frac{1}{2}( \Omega \Lambda \Lambda^\dagger + 
\Lambda \Lambda^\dagger \Omega ^\dagger ) =
mc \langle \Lambda \Omega \rangle_{\Re{ }},
&lt;/math&gt;

that finally gives the dynamic equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d p}{d \tau } = mc \langle \Omega \Lambda \rangle_{\Re{ }},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the role of the force is now played by the spacetime rotation biparavector.

Once the spacetime rotation is identified with the electromagnetic force,
the result is the spinorial form of the Lorentz force.

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{d \tau } = \frac{e}{2 m c}  F  \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

==Constant Electric Field==
The eigenspinor form of the Lorentz force can be solved analytically in many interesting cases. One of the simplest is the case of the constant electric field. If the electric field is directed along the z direction, the equation to solve is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{d \tau } = \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;
and the solution is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda = e^{ \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau }\Lambda_0.
&lt;/math&gt;
The proper velocity is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;
u = e^{ \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3  \tau} u_0e^{ \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau}.
&lt;/math&gt;
If the particle starts at rest, the proper velocity is simply
:&lt;math&gt;
u = e^{ \frac{e}{m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau}. 
&lt;/math&gt;
An additional integration gives the spacetime position
:&lt;math&gt;
x = x_0 +  \frac{m c^2}{e E} \mathbf{e}_3 ( e^{ \frac{e}{m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau}-1) 
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Circuit Theory/Page}}

This appendix page is going to take a deeper look at the units of decibels, it will describe some of the properties of decibels, and will demonstrate how to use them in calculations.

== Definition ==

Decibels are, first and foremost, a power calculation. With that in mind, we will state the definition of a decibel:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The letters &quot;dB&quot; are used as the units for the result of this calculation. dB ratios are always in terms of watts, unless otherwise noted.

== Voltage Calculation ==

now, another formula has been demonstrated that allows a decibel calculation to be made using voltages, instead of power measurements. We will derive that equation here:

First, we will use the power calculation and Ohm's law to produce a common identity:

:&lt;math&gt;P = VI = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we plug that result into the definition of a decibel, we can create a complicated equation:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{ \left[\frac{ \frac{V_{out}^2}{R} }{ \frac{V_{in}^2}{R} }\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can cancel out the resistance values (R) from the top and bottom of the fraction, and rearrange the exponent as such:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{\left[ \left(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}\right)^2 \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

If we remember the properties of logarithms, we will remember that if we have an exponent inside a logarithm, we can move the exponent outside, as a coefficient. This rule gives us our desired result:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 20 \log{\left[ \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \right] }&lt;/math&gt;

== Inverse Calculation ==

It is a simple matter of arithmetic to find the inverse of the decibel calculation, so it will not be derived here, but stated simply:

:&lt;math&gt;P = 10^{dB/10}&lt;/math&gt;

== Reference Units ==

Now, this decible calculation has proven to be so useful, that occasionally they are applied to other units of measurement, instead of just watts. Specifically, the units &quot;dBm&quot; are used when the power unit being converted was in terms of milliwatts, not just watts. Let's say we have a value of 10dBm, we can go through the inverse calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;P = 10^{10dBm/10} = 10mW&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, let's say we want to apply the decibel calculation to a completely unrelated unit: hertz. If we have 100Hz, we can apply the decibel calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{100Hz} = 20dBHz&lt;/math&gt;

If no letters follow the &quot;dB&quot; lable, the decibels are referenced to watts.

== Decibel Arithmetic ==

Decibels are ratios, and ''are not real numbers''. Therefore, specific care should be taken not to use decibel values in equations that call for gains, unless decibels are specifically called for (which they usually aren't). However, since decibels are calculated using logarithms, a few principles of logarithms can be used to make decibels usable in calculations.

=== Multiplication ===

Let's say that we have three values, '''a''' '''b''' and '''c''', with their respective decibel equivalents denoted by the upper-case letters '''A''' '''B''' and '''C'''. We can show that for the following equation:

 a = b c

That we can change all the quantities to decibels, and convert the multiplication operations to addition:

 A = B + C

=== Division ===

Let's say that we have three values, '''a''' '''b''' and '''c''', with their respective decibel equivalents denoted by the upper-case letters '''A''' '''B''' and '''C'''. We can show that for the following equation:
 
 a = b / c

Then we can show through the principals of logarithms that we can convert all the values to decibels, and we can then convert the division operation to subtraction:

 A = B - C</text>

I am Pinko1977. I am a Wikipedia editor and a participant at Wikisource. I am a writer who has been published in a number of online newspapers, blogs, and journals, and now I am planning to get into writing books. My areas of interest are history, politics, and culture---especially American pop culture.

I love music and literature, and I am especially enamoured of singers. My favorite vocalists are (in no kind of order) Bessie Smith, Jim Morrison, Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, Robert Johnson, Kurt Cobain, and countless others. As you can see, my love of music is irrespective of era and genre. In terms of books, I've mostly read nonfiction and biographies throughout my life, but recently I've been revisiting fiction and poetry. I've written poetry off-and-on myself over the years, and have attempted a couple of short stories. I see fiction as another avenue where I can explore history, culture, and their effects on human relationships.</text>

== XMLRPC - Serializing and Deserializing Datatypes ==

As a lightweight alternative to SOAP, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer Dave Winer] came up with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC XMLRPC] as a means to make remote method calls and exchange data between servers.  
The spec for this format is located at [http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec].

It works well for its intended use.  Well, unless you are coding in PHP and using the built-in, undocumented functions to generate XMLRPC.  You may have to build your own, just to be on the safe side.

Just a quick example of what it looks like.  In xmlrpc, a &lt;struct&gt; is what we would call in php an 'associative array', whereas an &lt;array&gt; is a 'list' or an array with only numerical indices (or in some languages, no indices).  A complex array datatype with the following structure:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Array
(
	[0] =&gt; dogs
	[1] =&gt; cats
	[animals] =&gt; Array(
		[0] =&gt; FALSE
		[1] =&gt; little_dogs
		[2] =&gt; little_cats
		[3] =&gt; 5
		[4] =&gt; 2.3
		[5] =&gt; 1
			),
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;   

Becomes the following XMLRPC: 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
      &lt;params&gt;
         &lt;param&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;
               &lt;struct&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;0
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;dogs&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;1
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;cats&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;animals
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;
                           &lt;array&gt;
                              &lt;data&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;boolean&gt;0&lt;/boolean&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;little_dogs&lt;/string&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;little_cats&lt;/string&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;5&lt;/i4&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;double&gt;2.3&lt;/double&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;boolean&gt;1&lt;/boolean&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                              &lt;/data&gt;
                           &lt;/array&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
               &lt;/struct&gt;
            &lt;/value&gt;
         &lt;/param&gt;
      &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/methodResponse&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==What is Mathematics?==
This question is one of the most complicating questions I've ever had to take in mathematics, and has no simple satisfactory answer. The Philosophy of mathematics is a complex and difficult topic not really suitable for an introductory text.

At a naive level we can describe mathematics as a language that expresses relationships.  This includes logic, measurement, algebra, calculus and geometry.  This language allows us to understand our universe and to solve problems in it. When your eyes view a page of mathematics, it looks like a collection of symbols.  Mathematics is not the symbols on the page but what those symbols really mean.

Any two people from any corner of the Earth, if both understand mathematics, can view the same page and understand the implications precisely, understand a question uniformly, or continue the discussion without a single spoken word.  There is no other such language taught across the entire planet.

This Wikibook is dedicated to helping those who see the page of symbols but do not hear the language of mathematics.

===The Disciplines of Mathematics===
There are two disciplines contained within mathematics: logic and theory.  They are separate but interdependent in that mathematics is useless without both.  Unfortunately, many people are only taught the theory side.  A more thorough description of both disciplines is presented later.  For now, we'll put it all on the table.

====Mathematical Logic====
Logic is the expression of ordered thoughts starting from axioms and resulting in a conclusion.  There are many rules and formalities for mathematical logic which ensure that truth is maintained throughout the logical argument.  Once a conclusion is successfully built it can be used with confidence as an axiom in another different logical argument.

Mathematical logic studies a set of artificial languages called logics. These languages are thought to have theoretically interesting structures, structures which are worthy of study both for their own sakes and for the light that such study promises to shed on the methods of reasoning used throughout mathematics.

====Mathematical Theory====
Theory deals with the abstraction of the real world into the mathematical world.  As much as mathematical logic is rigorous and specific, mathematical theory is abstract and generalized.  There is no doubt that this is where the fun of mathematics shines through.  Using mathematical theory a person can divine how to build a house or why cell phones work, make predictions about seemingly random events, even predict the motions of planets, stars, and galaxies! 

When Theory moves from the abstract to the real world, it is called applied mathematics.  These are the every day experiences people have with mathematics and is the small part of the realm of mathematics with which people usually are most familiar.


=== Things students should emphasize ===

Students must always remember that the mathematical language (terminology and symbols) are just ''representations'' of mathematical thought. Often students of math get mired in or turned off by the language, when the focus should be more on mastering the concepts. Math is universal only in its use of common logic and common concepts. The actual symbols (letters, words, sentences) of the language are not as important as the thought process. 

Yet fortunately, the language itself, especially in writing, has become highly standardized over the years, just to assist in communication. But mathematics is valid no matter how it is represented, as long as all terms and symbols are well-defined to the reader. Sometimes there is no single way to express math, just as, sometimes, there is no single way to make an argument. Ideally, in the open-marketplace of ideas, the most efficient representation becomes the accepted canon. Yet mathematical language, like all human languages, sometimes is entangled in traditional notation. We humans love our traditions! But often all it takes is a fresh new representation, to make concepts that once were confusing, suddenly clear. 

In any event, it is most important to learn the concepts, and then just view the symbolism as a tool of communication, and a bookkeeping tool during problem solving: and an exertion of the mind, which, for most, is unable to keep track of all the complex threads of mathematical logic. 

Students should not stress too much over memorizing pages of facts and concepts, without also striving to understand why they are true, why those facts must follow given the arguments, and why they make sense. Students should focus heavily on developing the skills and practicing the intellectual gymnastics that will enable them to think mathematically and solve mathematically posed problems. That person who can solve a problem from scratch, create new ideas, work things out by his or her own thought process, is more useful to Mathematics and society than one who can simply recall facts and figures, since these can always be looked up on Wikipedia! That is, it is more useful to have people who can write new Wikipedia articles, than people who can just read them!

Nevertheless, memorization is also useful, since of course nobody can possibly have the brainpower, memory, ability, time, or patience to prove all facts from first principles. Often, grand leaps of useful mathematical reasoning can be made by simply proving that one (perhaps already immensely complex and rich) axiom or fact will lead to a new conclusion. I believe Isaac Newton (?) once said, &quot;I can see so far, because I stand on the shoulders of giants.&quot; There is no shame in building on the work of others, as long as one acknowledges the source. Not only does this give fair credit where credit is due, but it allows things to be verified, especially if the thoughts of these &quot;giants&quot; are simply implied. 

One beauty of math that separates it from other disciplines like science, is that the preconditions don't always need to be established. With math, we can simply assume our foundations to be true, and build a new logical structure. In fact, some math concepts are so elemental and obvious, that often they are just implied as following from common sense! Take whole numbers and counting, for example: it seems reasonable to assume that most people would agree that they just &quot;are&quot;, and don't need any intrinsic proof of validity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origins ==

This is semi-rewrite of policy, amalgamating the more significant parts of [[WB:NC]] and [[WB:HNS]]. I've named it 'policy' rather than 'convention', in the hope it might sound more authoritative, added more examples to make it clearer, and kept it short so as to not scare off newbies.

I've also changed the introductory examples to hint that the subpage convention is preferable to the pseudo-namespace convention, since newbie's can't be trusted to provide backlinks. I've also altered the distinction to focus on the backlinks only, hinting that the only other distinction is typographic. The previous distinction of hierarchical vs. digraphic usage is bogus. You can use either system with either convention.

Comments? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:58, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

:Although you can use either system with either convention, we recommend hierarchical with slashes and digraphic with colons, as that's what naturally follows from the delimiter's nature.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:39, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

::Perhaps in your mind, but from a technical standpoint the only difference is the auto-backlinks. I don't see why we would want to confuse newbies by convincing them otherwise. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:57, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:::KelvSYC is right '''because''' from a technical standpoint the only difference is the auto-backlinks. The auto-backlinks enforce a hierarchical organization. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 13:54, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

== Template naming conventions ==

It is too strict for templates to have also the same prefix than for books. I agree that we should enforce the use of a naming convention for book-specific templates but I propose to allow in this specific case an abbreviation for the prefix. Rationale: templates are very often used to save keystrokes for repetitive text junks. There are no strong necessities to know to what book belongs one template, as there are for modules. Enforcing complete wikibook names in template prefixes will either promote very short names for books or a recurrent violated policy. For example, in [[Ada Programming|Programming:Ada]] we make extensive use of templates under the [[Template:Ada]] root. These templates are used for external links and for code highlighting. I would not like the book being named just &quot;Ada&quot; or the code templates to become larger. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

The abbreviation used for templates should be a redirect to the book main page in the main namepace, e.g. [[Ada]]. This will avoid future use of the abbreviation for other books. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

: Although it is an acceptable compromise in general, it may not suit [[Ada Programming|Programming:Ada]], as under [[WB:NP]] Programming:Ada is a section of [[Computer Programming|Programming]], which means for it to be called a book you would have to move the entire book anyways.  Since book management will soon be under the auspices of [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], the office should be responsible for book aliasing.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 02:44, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:: There seems to be some confusion here. This is a really early naming convention which I have entitled the &quot;bookshelf convention&quot; as per [[Wikibooks:Naming policy#Historical conventions]]. All it needs is to be renamed from [[Ada Programming|Programming:Ada]] to Programming Ada, [[Ada Programming]], How to Program in Ada, or just Ada, or whatever. All its subpages will need to renamed too. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:09, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::: No confusion, [[Talk:Ada Programming/New Name needed|discussion for a rename]] are on the way. We are very much in favour on sticking to agreed standards. It is in this discussion that we discovered that the new policy has some hurdles for us in choosing a suitable new name. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:29, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

Forgetting about Programming:Ada, is there any objection against this change to the proposed policy? May we edit the page to reflect this compromise. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 23:21, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

: I suppose even if your book is named &quot;My Extremely Long Book Title About Programming Ada&quot;, but you've created the redirect &quot;Ada&quot; to point to it, then technically, you own that subsection of the template namespace, so any templates beginning with &quot;Template:Ada:&quot; or &quot;Template:Ada/&quot; belong to that book also. Is this acceptable? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:58, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I have no complaints aside from how book aliasing is controlled.  I suggest that the CCO should have an alias registry.  You really don't want an obscure and inactive book to have a single-letter alias, right?  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 03:34, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Good point. I'll allow it in this case, since the Ada book is really quite professional looking, and I don't want to irritate the authors too much. It has a lot of pages, and uses a lot of templates, mostly of the form &quot;Template:Ada/&quot;. The programming language is probably the most common use of the word &quot;Ada&quot;, and I can't think of another book that would need to fight over this part of the namespace (except perhaps a Wikibook about [[w:Ada Lovelace]] herself). But you're right, we do need to keep track of aliases. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:52, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

: So, just to clarify, can the [[Movie Making Manual]] use [[MMM]] as a prefix for our headers now that I've setup a redirect from [[MMM]] to [[Movie Making Manual]]?  For example, is the header name &quot;MMM Header&quot; legal? [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 14:12, 23 Sept 2005 (GMT)
:: No, community consensus is needed in order for a book to get an alias. Also, even if you get the alias, naming it &quot;Template:MMM Header&quot; breaks [[WB:NP]].  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 17:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
::: Thanks for the reply.  Sorry, I'm new here... Why does &quot;Template:MMM Header&quot; break [[WB:NP]]? [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:22, 24 Sept 2005 (GMT)
:::: For any book ''book'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Template:''book''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is reserved for a book's internal organization.  Thus, to conform you need it to be named (assuming you have the alias) &quot;Template:MMM:Header&quot; or &quot;Template:MMM/Header&quot;. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 17:31, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
::::: OK, thanks.  Can we have several templates?  E.g. &quot;Template:MMM/Header&quot;, &quot;Template:MMM/cinematographyHeader&quot;, &quot;Template:MMM/productionHeader&quot; etc?  And how do I request community consensus for the [[MMM]] alias?  Thanks,  [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 19:30, 25 Sept 2005 (GMT)
:::::: I'm not sure about how to gauge consensus w.r.t. the alias, but I see no reason why you can't have multiple headers (the cookbook does). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:05, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

== things that go into 2 or more books ==

[[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] mentions
''There are no strong necessities to know to what book belongs one template''

I agree. Some templates are useful enough to be used in several different books.

I'm sure I have at least 6 paper books on my shelf that each have a &quot;Appendix: ASCII Chart&quot;, and 5 other books that each have an &quot;Appendix: Periodic table of the elements&quot;.

* (a) Should such things go into a free-floating &quot;page&quot; without a book name ? (I suppose this is technically the same as a &quot;book&quot; with only the one page, without any sub-pages).
* (b) Or should such things go into a free-floating template as [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] suggests?
* (c) I suppose the third option is to mantain several more-or-less identical copies, each one associated with a single book to give it the &quot;right name&quot;. But that would be silly.

=== Transclusion ===

I belive that transclusion is a good answer to that. Often there will be a more general/higher level book which could contain the source and all other books would transclude the pages in. For example see [[Computer Programming/Control]] and [[Ada Programming/Control]] - of course this is a very complex example - but it shows that the technique scales well.

-- anon

: OK, that's yet another option I hadn't considered.

* (d) Associate the text with one particular &quot;general&quot; book, but transclude that text into all others that wanted it.

: So the ASCII chart would presumably &quot;really&quot; go into [[Computer Programming]], and all other books that wanted one would transclude it.
: So the periodic table would &quot;really&quot; go into [[General Chemistry]], and any other book that wanted one would transclude it.
: OK, that sounds like a good idea.

== Capitalization ==

Regarding capitalization, I wanted to promote the case like &quot;The Title of Doom&quot;, rather than &quot;The Title Of Doom&quot; (I forget which is title-caps and title-case). I just happened to choose a bad example (i.e. &quot;How To Build A Computer&quot;). If someone can find a good example of a '/'-based 'flat'-style Wikibook with the right capitalization, let me know. I think the subpages (i.e. chapters) perhaps ought to follow the same conventions, but I didn't want to seem too pedantic. :-) - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:22, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

:Great. To be more specific, we capitalize the first word and all words that are not [[w:Closed-class_word|closed class words]]. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:05, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
::The policy as it stands now only allows for lowercase articles (the, an) and prepositions (of, into, without). What about conjunctions (And, Or) and pronouns (It, Their)? I have at least one printed book with a lowercase &quot;and&quot;, though I have not found a pronoun in a title. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::[[Guide to UNIX]] has a lowercase &quot;to&quot;, but you could also argue that it is sentence case (&quot;The title of doom&quot;) because UNIX is a proper noun. The bad thing is that Guide to UNIX mixes slash convention (&lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX/Shell Prompt&lt;/s&gt;, colon convention (&lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX commands:File system utilities&lt;/s&gt;), and space convention (&lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX files&lt;/s&gt;). The subpages and sections have inconsistent case: &lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX/Shell Prompt#Finding a shell prompt&lt;/s&gt; is a sentence case section name on a title case subpage. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::I made several page renames in [[Guide to UNIX]], which is why I striked several of the names above (including one typo). The submodule names are now more uniform. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:10, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Talking about conjunctions, I prefer using &quot;and&quot; instead of the ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot;. Or is this too nitpicky?

What about situation when whole title consists of capital letters like {{bad link|RANGERS IN COLONIAL AND REVOLUTIONARY AMERICA}}? Such case is not mentioned, so it looks like there's a problem. When I asked author of this module to change it name, he replied that current naming policy does not forbid such titles and that it is common in US Army documents. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:16, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

==Page naming==
My own gripe with the present [[WB:NP]] is the ban on the use of abreviated book titles in page names.  Long page names look very ugly and hurt the usability of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:category:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages (i.e. the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:category:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages work best if each page name only takes up a single line).  For example, I would really like to be able to use the [[MMM]] abreviation for the [[Movie Making Manual]], e.g. [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras]]. Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:25, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
*The current version would let you register MMM as an alias. However, the requirement to check with administrators is too strict; the chance that someone else also wants MMM (Making Monster Madness? Map of Much Music?) is too low. Instead, any wiki contributor should be able to edit the registry and add MMM. Also, the current version of the naming policy does not allow MMM names for subpages, templates, and categories ([[:Category:MMM/festivals]]). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== Votes ==

Please vote ''Aye'' it you thing the policy is okay as it is and ''Nay'' if you think it needs more work. If the ''Ayes'' have it for a whole week then the policy is accepted.

We are writing books, not encyclopedia entries or magazine articles. Title caps would give the books an air of respect, that I'm sure that authors all want to portray. Next, I think the forward slash convention is the better convention, not only because it creates the backlinks (which are small, and noninvasive), but also because the colon convention could potentially interfere with the creation of other wiki- projects, or other namespaces. Lastly, If we allow for aliases (although we should make it easy for a book to obtain a non-contested alias), the template naming convention makes the most sense: we want templates to be attached to their book, so that they aren't stolen and adapted for other books.

=== Nay ===

# - For now. It's not that clear if title caps or title case is preferred for book names, maybe title case would be better, because that's what's generally used for the titles of books. Also, no preference is given to any method of capitalising the titles of sub pages. There is currently a discussion going on over at [[Talk:Cookbook:Policy]] about these capitalisation rules, and it would be nice if we could come up with a consensus for a general policy for Wikibooks as a whole, instead of limiting it to only the Cookbook.

# - The caps should refer all exceptions if any. The alias should refer limitations of chars if any, in example the case of the use of &quot;/&quot; like in the Programming C -/- -/- that is under dispute, as a writer :I do think that the use of non alphanumeric chars on titles should be very clear, even more as I defend the use of ASCII hexa in places like where + can't be used and a graphically similar char exist (like the plus minus sign), and that the url of a work may be or not difer from the books title, there are very good reasons, even beneficial to the hole site (wikibooks) in not having human friendly urls more so since they aren't already that friendly for example the &quot;_&quot; = &quot; &quot; can give some problems in edits and transclusions.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:13, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

# While I'm not completely against writing this policy, I don't think it needs to be enforced strictly as a hard policy like the NPOV issues that could kill a project or a book.  It is far more important to simply suggest best practices and to make a clear example of what has already been done on Wikibooks.  Indeed, I don't really care how a particular Wikibook is organized as long as the naming convention for pages is consistant throughout that particular Wikibook.  It also helps if ''somewhere'' on each page you can get back to the &quot;main page&quot; of the Wikibook.  Trying to legislate the petty details is pointless and defeats the creative process.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:19, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
#:What if we include a clause about how harsh a violation of this policy will be for the book. Certainly, we dont want to delete an entire book because they delimit page names with the wrong character, but we should still have a set of standardized guidelines, that people can work towards. If a n00b starts a new book with a completely off-the-wall convention, it should be identified and corrected, to prevent problems. Basically, it's the same thing as how we deal with stubs: if a stub exists, people can find them and fix them, although there is no policy ''against creating stubs''. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:46, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
#::I suggest that instead of an ''enforced policy'' that instead it should be a ''guideline'' policy instead.  Official, yes.  A reason to go in and trash the page organization of a Wikibook?  No.  If a new contributor wants to use ampersands or parenthesis for page naming conventions, why not?  I am in general opposed to &quot;article&quot; style names where no naming convention is used, but otherwise I don't think it really matters.  The only reason for that is because of ambiguity as to which &quot;Wikibook&quot; the module belongs to. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:52, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

== short page names ==

''# This vote is against the ban on the use of abbreviated aliases for page names.

[[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:12, 13 October 2005 (UTC)''

From the comments above, perhaps the policy should say something like
: ''On a case-by-case basis, the community may approve 2 different names for a book. A &quot;short name&quot; such as &quot;Ada&quot; for a book -- (( or even a chapter of a book ???)) -- with a long name such as Programming:Ada. All sub-pages and templates would use the short name. The short name should be composed of one or more whole words, not abbreviations.&quot;
If we changed the policy to say that, would you change your vote to approve the policy? (This proposal would allow &quot;The Academic Researchers' Manual&quot; to be abbreviated as in &quot;Research/Page Name&quot;, and &quot;Movie Making Manual&quot; to be abbreviated as in &quot;Movie/Page Name&quot;

Just to point out an example here, when I started the naming conventions for [[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] (Wikisource...not Wikibooks) I realized that it would get very tiring typing in 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica for every link.  I shortened the name to EB1911 for most of the articles and template (as well as categories) essentially out of practical need, and the fact that it was fairly obvious what the topic was about.  I also added a redirect from [[s:EB1911|EB1911]] to the main page.  That way if they went to that obvious shortcut it would take you to the main page as well.  (It appears as though the redirect was lost on the move to en.wikisource).  I think the redirect is a good idea anyway if you are going to have a naming convention shortcut.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:27, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

::Hi.  I should explain exactly why I dislike long page names.  There are four reasons:

Unfortunately, this mailing list doesn't allow HTML (no hyperlinks) so I have to cut-and-paste the entire URL into the body of the text.

But the thing is I edited it since not because of it's last step which you know of course, but becuase of the affections anyone can get. Wikibooks is a registered site(project) of Wikimedia and so, it's accessed worldwide, so you please remove any portions related to Hinduism. I'm not being harsh because I respect all religions but it may affect some people that are jealous with you or your religion.

hi my name samboeun, and i live in Cambodia. and my Email: samboeun100@yahoo.com. i just want to add some idea for my knowledge to all people who want to develop him self and become a good student or person. this is this main idea for me that i think that it will be help all of you to study



      English is the only language that any one can understand. So to say, it has become as an ideal language for expressing our feelings. First, we have to learn the language and then we have to gain fluency in the language. Unless we have the fluency in English language, it would not be possible to work with the computer. If you do not know English, then you would be in need of a translator to do the job.

    The first stage of learning this language would be very interesting. Once you are fluent with the alphabets, slowly you can learn many words. It would always be better to follow the method of reading first, then writing. You can use the picture books for this purpose. When you feel that you are familiar with the words, you can form sentences. This is the most interesting stage to learn. You just think of a sentence in your mother language, and try to write the same sentence in English. There could be some mistakes. But you should not bother about it. But, you have to write the same sentence using many different words till you are satisfied with your sentence. If you follow this way, very soon you can create sentences of your own.

The next step is learning the grammar of the language. It is quite simple and very systematic compared with other languages. There are certain rules and regulations for each and every topic in grammar of this language. As long as you follow the rules and regulations, it would be a difficult task to make mistakes. You would gain that much guidance from the grammar.
The presentation is the most important factor in communicating your feelings. So, naturally you must be sure while you are presenting. what you really wish to say. At any point, do not try to write or speak, beyond your capability. Even if it is a small and simple sentence, it would reach the receiver perfectly. This is our basic idea. Slowly, you can improve the standard of your language by practice. If you know to form the sentences, it is more than enough to go deep into the subject. Though this only an article about the importance of the English Language, we have to learn some of the basic points in presenting the sentences.
There are three different types of sentences: They are,
1. Statements. 2. Interrogative sentence. 3. Imperative sentence. 4. Exclamatory sentence. To begin with, you must know the difference between a phrase and a sentence.

Phrase is a group of words, which gives meaning, but not complete meaning.
A sentence is a group of words, which makes a complete sense.

1. Statement: The sentence starting with nouns or pronouns is known as statement.

Example: Rome is a church city.

2. Interrogative sentence: There are two types of interrogative sentences.

a. &quot;wh&quot; type question. The sentences starting with the following fords are &quot;wh&quot; type question. What, When, Where, Who, How many, How long and etcetera.
Example: Why did you come late? 2. What are you doing there?

b. &quot;yes or no&quot; type question. For which sentences you get the reply either with yes or no they are called yes or no type question.
Example: Is your father a doctor? The answer: No sir.

3. Imperative sentence: The sentence that gives command, request, and advice is known as Imperative sentence. Example: Walk on the pavement. 2. Eat regularly.

4. Exclamatory sentence: The sentence that expresses the sudden feelings or strong emotions is known as exclamatory sentence.

Example: Alas! He is dead. 2. Oh! What a beautiful sight.

When you are familiar with the above points, it would be very interesting to you to create many wonderful sentences.
In general, the sentences are divided into three different kinds. They are,
1. Simple sentence. 2. Compound sentence. 3. Complex sentence.

Though it very essential to have knowledge in handling the above sentences, we have to study them separately. In this essay, we are talking about the importance of the language.
Many people make mistakes even with the usage of articles. It is a pity that even scholars may make mistakes. So, you should not get dejected with your style of writing.

There is a lot of difference between these two. 1. a few 2. few
When you want to say that you have friends, you have to say that,&quot; I have a few friends.&quot;
When you want to say that you do not have friends, you have to say that, &quot;I have few friends.&quot;

This is the opposite meaning of the word, many.
Apart from these, there are many points to be discussed later.
When you feel that you are already strong on the above subjects, you can develop your knowledge for betterment of your knowledge. As long as you educate yourself, you will come across many new things. There is no end for learning. All the above points are used in the normal usage of English. The literature value of the English Language is entirely different and should be dealt separately.
so this is my new idea and if you want to share your knowledge you can press &lt;u&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/u&gt;'''''Bold text'''''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now as a good student, you are allowed to contribute for the good. So, there are some facts that you must know after reading this Wikibook.

1.) Being a good student doesn't mean that you must be an angel. Because, at some situations you have to be a little rugged, &quot;NOT MEAN&quot;. If someone fights with you, you first ignore but then if he insists, show him a good knuckle sandwich, but that doesn't matter. The thing that matters is your judgement to decide when to fight and when not to.

2.) As a good student, advantages of a good education must be known to you now. So, if you want to be better, always try knowing more, search good articles at Wikipedia, read good educational books. Contribute to a good field and plan an excellent career at this stage to prevent future difficulties.

3.) I created a quote that ''A magician tries to conceal his teachings but a good student always spreads/reveals his knowledge.''
Always help and support others as much as you can. If anyone is always getting bad grades, improve him so not only you but he's also happy. Of course, helping doesn't include cheating.

I hope you may follow these tips in your future. You are about to be on your journey as a good student for the first time. That's all you need to know! Take care and have a very happy life!

Hello! Bonjour! Guten Tag! Hola! Ciao! My name is Murtaza Ali (but I call myself Mastermind 007 at this site). I live in Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. and I study in Sherwood Academy. 
I'm a big fan of Wikipedia because it can provide you with almost all the knowledege they gain through other users. It's similar to Microsoft's Encarta. I've just worked on these Wikibooks till now:-

*[[How To Become A Good Student]] 
*[[Football (Soccer)]]

I'll create many Wikibooks if you can just provide me with some topics(must be in English) but I'll try my best to do it along with you all. You can send an article to me with your ideas at my talk page. 
Have a good time at Wikibooks!

Goodbye! Au Revoir! Adiós! Auf Wiedersehen!

      <comment>/* Descripción del proceso */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Inserting figures into a document is often a very problematic task when we start learning [[w:LaTeX|LaTeX]] and using it for the first few times. The large ammount of different [[w:graphic formats|graphic formats]], and incompatibilities between them, also makes the situation more confusing. This chapter will try to explain the ''complete'' method required to insert figures into your document, while providing several tips and hints on how to get the best results.

==Conventions==

Before we start, and in order to avoid any possible confusion, we will have to agree on the terms that will be used in this chapter, and what they mean when they are used.

* A ''graphic'' is any drawing, illustration, image, diagram, photograph, graph, chart, plot, histogram, etc.; that you might want to include in a document to illustrate or clarify an idea. Most of the content of this chapter deals with preparing graphics for inclusion in LaTeX documents.

* A ''figure'' is the structure commonly utilized to insert a graphic in a document. A figure is usually composed by a graphic, a caption (which is ''not'' part of the graphic), as well as a numbering sequence that identifies figures in the document (Figure 1, Figure 2, ...).

==Overview of the process==

The complete process to include a figure in a LaTeX document is composed, essentially, of the following four steps:

# '''Determine the appropriate format for your graphic.''' There are two main kinds of graphics: [[w:raster graphics|raster graphics]] and [[w:vector graphics|vector graphics]]. It is important to know the difference between them so that you can choose which one is more appropriate for your needs. This step will also help you to determine which of the available tools will be most useful in the next step.
# '''Draw/create/obtain the graphic.''' This is probably the most important part of the whole process. Next steps will be much simpler (and produce better results) if this step is carried out correctly. However, this step is also the most difficult to explain due to the large ammount of available tools and programs to produce graphics.

Además, dependiendo del tipo de gráfico y del origen de tus datos, unas herramientas pueden ser más adecuadas que otras. Por otra parte, generar un gráfico con la herramienta inadecuada puede ocasionar que las figuras terminen con muy mala calidad en tu documento final. Una gran parte de esta guía está dedicada a darte diversas sugerencias y estrategias para seleccionar la herramienta adecuada según el tipo de gráfico que necesites.
# '''Preparar el gráfico en un formato adecuado para LaTeX.''' Esta parte es normalmente muy sencilla. Aunque es la parte con la que  muchos principiantes tenemos problemas por no haber llevado a cabo satisfactoriamente el paso anterior, y por desconocer los comandos existentes para realizar esta tarea. Esta guía explicará también los métodos más comunes para preparar tu gráfico en un formato que LaTeX pueda entender.
# '''Insertar el gráfico como una figura dentro de tu documento.''' Esto ya es pan comido, simplemente agregas unos cuantos comandos a tu documento y ''¡listo!''

Las siguientes secciones detallan como realizar exitosamente cada uno de estos pasos, y te brindan también una gran cantidad de consejos para obtener los mejores resultados.

===Determinar el formato adecuado para tu gráfico===

Antes de comenzar a discutir las diversas opciones y herramientas para producir gráficos es necesario aclarar que existen, escencialmente, dos formas de almacenar un gráfico dentro de un archivo en la computadora (y es una decisión muy importante determinar cual de los dos formatos es el adecuado para el tipo de gráfico que necesitas):

====Mapas de bits====

Un [[w:mapa de bits|mapa de bits]] es, en escencia, una gran tabla que indica el color de cada punto (''[[w:píxel|píxel]]'') en tu gráfico. Es un formato muy sencillo y popular para internet pues no requiere (salvo la compresión) de un procesamiento complicado para mostrar el gráfico, simplemente la tabla de colores se copia en la pantalla y listo. Este tipo de archivos es conveniente para guardar fotografías ya que las cámaras y escáneres digitales funcionan precisamente de esa manera, dividiendo el gráfico en una gran cantidad de puntos y registrando el color de cada uno de ellos.

La desventaja principal de este formato es que no puede cambiarse el tamaño del gráfico con facilidad. Originalmente los puntos son del tamaño del punto más pequeño que se puede mostrar en la pantalla. Pero si tratamos de hacer el gráfico más y más grande acabaremos por ver unos cuadrotes en lugar de puntitos. Además, si hacemos el gráfico pequeño y lo queremos después agrandar perderemos inevitablemente calidad en la imagen (una tabla pequeña no puede guardar la misma información que una tabla grande).

Extensiones típicas de archivos que usan este tipo de formato son: [[w:BMP|BMP]], [[w:JPEG|JPEG]], [[w:GIF|GIF]], [[w:PNG|PNG]] y [[w:TIFF|TIFF]]. Entre las aplicaciones populares que pueden generar este tipo de archivos están [[w:Microsoft Paint|Microsoft Paint]] y [[w:Adobe Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] entre otras.

====Gráficos vectoriales====

Una alternativa para tener gráficos que no pierdan calidad cuando se cambia su tamaño son los [[w:gráfico vectorial|gráficos vectoriales]]. Este tipo de formatos, en lugar de guardar una gran tabla de colores, almacena una serie de instrucciones a seguir por la computadora para, literalmente, ''dibujar'' el gráfico cada vez que lo necesite. Un archivo vectorial puede contener instrucciones como: ''&quot;dibujar un circulo aquí con este radio&quot;'', ''&quot;trazar una recta de este punto a este otro&quot;'', ''&quot;poner una flecha al final de esta linea&quot;'', y las instrucciones pueden complicarse hasta cosas como ''&quot;escribir este texto en esta posición con este tipo de letra y este tamaño&quot;'', ''&quot;dibujar una [[w:curva de Bézier|curva de Bézier]] con esta lista de puntos de control&quot;''.

Como todas las coordenadas de los puntos y dimensiones en un gráfico vectorial están dadas de manera relativa, aumentar o reducir el tamaño del gráfico es (para la computadora) una simple cuestión de multiplicar o dividir. Este formato es particularmente útil para crear diagramas (en esencia lineas, flechas y cuadros), así como gráficos para visualizar datos, fórmulas o ecuaciones (histogramas, diagramas de sectores, gráficas de puntos o líneas, etc.); así como ilustraciones en general: modelos de un átomo, el diagrama de un experimento o un fenómeno físico, una ilustración geométrica. Siempre es preferible, si es posible, tener gráficos vectoriales pues conservan su calidad aún después de transformarlos o modificar su tamaño.

Hay aplicaciones profesionales, comerciales, que generan este tipo de gráficas como [[w:Corel Draw|Corel Draw]] y [[w:Adobe Illustrator|Adobe Illustrator]]. Las herramientas de dibujo de [[w:Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office]] (como en [[w:Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[w:Microsoft Word|Word]], [[w:Microsoft Excel|Excel]] o [[w:Microsoft Draw|Microsoft Draw]]) también generan gráficos vectoriales ([[w:WMF|WMF]]). En el mundo TeX son populares los formatos [[w:EPS|EPS]] (PostScript Encapsulado) y [[w:PDF|PDF]], además de que el mismo lenguaje de LaTeX (junto con algunos paquetes auxiliares) puede utilizarse para describir gráficos en un estilo vectorial.

Cabe señalar que la mayoría de los formatos vectoriales (si no es que todos) soportan también insertar mapas de bits dentro de ellos. Un error que muchos llegamos a cometer es pensar que, como hemos logrado guardar un gráfico dentro de un EPS, el gráfico ya es vectorial. Hay varias herramientas para producir gráficos que dicen poder exportar gráficos en EPS, pero lo único que hacen es guardar la tabla de colores dentro del EPS (y cabe señalar que el EPS es un formato particularmente malo para guardar mapas de bits resultando, usualmente, en archivos enormes aún para gráficos pequeños).

Hecha esta explicación lo único que queda por decir es que, siempre que sea posible, utilices algún formato vectorial para crear y guardar tus gráficos. Las únicas excepciones son cuando el gráfico es por naturaleza un mapa de bits, como por ejemplo: una fotografía, material obtenido de internet o capturas de pantalla.

===Dibujar/crear/obtener el gráfico===

En esta sección presentaremos diversos consejos para producir diferentes tipos de gráficos. Empezaremos por el caso de los mapas de bits donde las siguientes sugerencias te ayudarán a obtener buenos resultados.

====Fotografías en formato JPEG====

La mayoría de las cámaras y escáneres digitales producen directamente archivos ya en formato [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] (o JPG, que son lo mismo). La ventaja principal del formato JPEG es que tiene un algoritmo de compresión muy poderoso que produce, normalmente, archivos muy pequeños (comparados por ejemplo con un BMP). Para alcanzar estos altos niveles de compresión se basa en el hecho de que el ojo humano no es realmente capáz de distinguir tantos colores como hay disponibles en una computadora (algo así como 24 millones de colores) y modifica ligeramente el color de algunos puntos (''píxeles'') en la imagen.

Podemos decir, de hecho, que el formato JPEG logra comprimir la imagen sacrificando un poco de su calidad. Para fotografías, u otro material similar, que normalmente contienen muchisimos colores la pérdida de calidad es imperceptible y convierte al formato JPEG en una opción excelente.

====Imágenes ''sencillas'' en formatos BMP, GIF, PNG====

En este caso por ''sencillas'' me refiero a mapas de bits con pocos colores, o con areas uniformes (del mismo color) muy grandes. Este tipo de gráficos son comunes, por ejemplo, en manuales de software donde quieres incluir una figura mostrando alguna de las ventanas de tu aplicación o en general cualquier [[w:captura de pantalla|captura de pantalla]] (''screenshot''). Para estos casos la compresión en JPEG puede ser un desastre ya que la pérdida de calidad si se hace notoria y evidente.

La solución entonces es recurrir a formatos como [[w:BMP|BMP]] que no realiza gran esfuerzo para comprimir (en cuanto a calidad es el mejor formato porque guarda la tabla de colores, casi, tal cual). Otras mejores soluciones son [[w:GIF|GIF]] y [[w:PNG|PNG]] que sí tienen algoritmos de compresión más inteligentes pero evitan en lo posible demeritar la calidad del gráfico. En todo caso, si tienes la posibilidad de elegir, PNG es mucho mejor formato pues nunca ha tenido problemas de [http://burnallgifs.org/archives/ patentes] y es mucho más amigable con LaTeX.

====Herramientas para manipular mapas de bits====

Si quieres hacer retoques o editar un mapa de bits existen soluciones comerciales como [[w:Adobe Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] o [[w:Paint Shop Pro|Paint Shop Pro]]. [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] tiene el programa [[w:Microsoft Paint|Paint]] que provee una funcionalidad mínima y para algunos casos puede ser suficiente. Alternativamente en el mundo del software libre puedes encontrar [http://www.gimp.org/ The Gimp], es el favorito de los usuarios de [[w:Linux|Linux]] y hay también una versión de [http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/ Gimp para Windows]. Estos programas te permiten también convertir entre tipos de formatos y producir, entre otros, los BMP, PNG o JPEG. El programa [http://www.imagemagick.org/ ImageMagick], que presentaremos en detalle más adelante, es también muy util para convertir entre diferentes formatos.

Recuerda, sin embargo, no utilizar mapas de bits a menos que tu gráfica sea una fotografía, que la única fuente que tengas de la imagen sea a través de internet, o que la imagen la obtengas como una [[w:captura de pantalla|captura de pantalla]].

====Productos comerciales====

Para gráficos vectoriales hay muchas más opciones y caminos a seguir. Todos con sus propias ventajas y desventajas. Un grupo de estas soluciones consiste en utilizar algún producto comercial, como [[w:Corel Draw|Corel Draw]] o [[w:Adobe Illustrator|Adobe Illustrator]], para crear tus gráficos. Este tipo de programas normalmente pueden exportar buenos archivos EPS que se pueden utilizar con LaTeX. Una de sus principales ventajas es que proveen un juego de herramientas muy completas para hacer todo tipo de diseños profesionales. Siempre guarda, además del EPS que puedes exportar, una copia de tu gráfico en el formato nativo de la aplicación para poder modificarlo o reusarlo después.

En el caso de gráficas de puntos o lineas, o gráficas en general que resultan de análisis numérico, muy buenas soluciones comerciales incluyen a [[w:MATLAB|MATLAB]] y [[w:Mathematica|Mathematica]]. Estos programas también permiten exportar los gráficos en EPS y otros formatos amigables para LaTeX.

La desventaja obvia es que necesitas tener acceso a uno de estos programas ya sea en tu universidad, lugar de trabajo o, alternativamente, comprar una licencia para usarla en tu propia computadora. Otra desventaja es que para algunos usuarios principiantes la gran cantidad de opciones y herramientas puede hacer parecer complicado el usar este tipo de programas.

'''Nota:''' Algunas aplicaciones tienen la opción de agregar un ''&quot;tiff preview&quot;'' al archivo EPS. Verifica que tengas deshabilitada esta opción ya que dichos ''previews'' hacen que LaTeX sea incapaz de procesar correctamente el archivo EPS.

====Soluciones alternativas====

Existe también [[w:software libre|software libre]] alternativo que puedes utilizar para crear tus gráficos. Un muy buen editor libre para gráficos vectoriales es [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkspace]. Otra solución alternativa, enfocada particularmente a la creación de diagramas y realmente muy fácil de usar, es [http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/ Dia] que cuenta también con un [http://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/ instalador] para Windows.

La ventaja principal de estos programas es que se trata de software libre, que puedes obtener gratuitamente desde internet, y su potencial es muy cercano al de las soluciones comerciales discutidas anteriormente.

Otro de los favoritos de Linux es [http://www.xfig.org/ Xfig] que tiene su equivalente [http://www.schmidt-web-berlin.de/WinFIG.htm WinFIG] para Windows. Además está [http://www.skencil.org Skencil] que, después de cargar una buena cantidad de [http://www.nongnu.org/skencil/devel.html herramientas y aplicaciones], también puedes correr en Windows. Finalmente esta la suite de aplicaciones de [http://www.koffice.org KOffice] que corre en el ambiente KDE y, entre otras monerias, incluye Kivio (para diagramas) y Karbon14 (para gráficos vectoriales). También hay intentos de hacer correr KOffice en Windows pero se encuentra todo en etapas mas bien experimentales y necesitas instalar una buena cantidad de emuladores de Linux (vamos, que al final es más facil instalarte mejor un sistema de Linux completo).

Una de las pocas desventajas es que prácticamente todos estos programas se originaron para Linux y, aunque si hay algunas versiones para Windows relativamente fáciles de instalar, el entorno de trabajo no se siente tan estable y fluido como el de las soluciones comerciales.

====Soluciones amigables para Windows====

Si estás muy acostumbrado al uso de productos de Microsoft Office o programas de Windows en general, hay buen truco que consiste en instalar el controlador de una impresora PostScript genérica en tu computadora. Hecho esto puedes mandar a imprimir desde cualquier programa o aplicación de Windows y guardar los resultados en un archivo EPS. Después de esto tienes aún que ''arreglar'' el archivo EPS antes de poder usarlo en LaTeX. Los detalles y consejos adicionales para poner en práctica esta solución los puedes encontrar en el excelente artículo [http://ltx.blogspot.com/2003/11/cmo-crear-figuras-eps-desde-windows.html Cómo crear figuras EPS desde Windows] de JL Diaz.

Una opción ''shareware'' en esta misma línea consiste en utilizar [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/wmf2eps.html WMF2EPS]. Este programa te ayuda realizar con unos cuantos ''clicks'' todo el proceso, que puede llegar a ser un poco engorroso, de imprimir el archivo EPS y corregirlo. La gran desventaja de esta solución es que se trata de [[w:shareware|shareware]] y sólo lo puedes utilizar, según la documentación, durante diez dias antes de comprar el producto.

====Usando el lenguaje de LaTeX====

Otra solución que da muy buenos resultados es utilizar el mismo lenguaje de LaTeX para describir tus gráficos. Un paquete excelente que te permite hacer este tipo de cosas es [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pgf.html TikZ] de Till Tantau (lo puedes instalar fácilmente desde ''MiKTeX Options'') que pone a tu disposición una amplia gama de comandos para realizar todo tipo de gráficos y diagramas. Los resultados son impresionantes y espectaculares, tan sólo da una mirada al [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/en/pgfmanual.pdf manual de usuario] (en inglés) que, además, es un placer de leer.

Esto tiene sus ventajas y desventajas, muy similares a LaTeX mismo. Por un lado al poder ''programar'' tus gráficos tienes un control absoluto y preciso sobre todos los detalles, realizar gráficos sencillos es también muy rápido. Por otra parte, tienes un nuevo lenguaje que aprender, no tiene una interface gráfica y el código (por más sencillo que sea) no te permite ver inmediatamente como es que se verá finalmente el gráfico.

Un paquete que pone en práctica una idea muy similar es [http://pstricks.de PSTricks] de Herbert Voß que, aunque puede ser algo más poderoso, tiene la desventaja de que sólo puede producir directamente archivos en formato PS. Para lograr conseguir archivos PDF tienes que hacer un poco más de [http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=pdf/pdfoutput trucos].

Existen algunos intentos por crear interfaces gráficas que pueden ayudarte a ganar un poco de las ventajas de este tipo de soluciones sin tener que cargar con todas sus desventajas. Uno de proyectos más notables es [http://jpicedt.sourceforge.net/ jPicEdt] de Sylvain Reynal que te permite exportar código de PSTricks para incluirlo en tu documento de LaTeX. jPicEdt es una buena solución y con un repertorio de herramientas bastante razonable pero, aunque que se encuentra en constante y activo desarrollo, aún no tiene el potencial y la versatilidad que otras soluciones (tanto libres como comerciales) suelen llegar a tener. Obserba también que '''j'''PicEdt está escrito en Java y necesitas tener una [http://java.com/en/index.jsp máquina virtual de Java] para poder ejecutarlo.

Otra aplicación que cae en esta categaría es [http://www.gnuplot.info/ gnuplot] que te permite crear gráficos a partir de datos o funciones matemáticas. Se trata también de un programa donde tienes que hacer ''scripts'' (aprender un nuevo lenguaje) para después procesarlos y obtener el gráfico en alguno de los lenguajes para LaTeX (como PSTricks) o directamente en EPS.

La ventaja principal de este tipo de soluciones es que, a diferencia de todas las anteriores, el procesado del gráfico se hace por LaTeX mismo. En particular tienes acceso a insertar texto y fórmulas con toda la libertad como lo harías en el resto de tu documento. Esto produce finalmente gráficos de muy buena calidad pues, si contienen texto o símbolos, se utilizan las mismas fuentes del resto del documento ganando uniformidad.

Las mejores soluciones, en cuanto a calidad final, se pueden lograr normalmente utilizando este tipo de herramientas. Sin embargo, son también estas soluciones las que pueden requierir de mucho más trabajo y esfuerzo para lograr ver los resultados finales en tu documento.

===Preparar el gráfico en un formato adecuado para LaTeX===

En este momento debes de tener ya dibujado o creado tu gráfico pero, posiblemente, no se encuentre aún en un formato adecuado que pueda entender LaTeX. Para esto hay dos reglas básicas que tienes que seguir:

* Si generas un documento PS (compilas con &lt;tt&gt;latex + dvips&lt;/tt&gt;, los modos &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX =&gt; PS&lt;/tt&gt; ó &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX =&gt; PS =&gt; PDF&lt;/tt&gt; de TeXnicCenter) necesitas todas tus figuras en formato EPS.
* Si generas directamente un PDF (compilas con &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;, o el modo &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX =&gt; PDF&lt;/tt&gt; de TeXnicCenter) necesitas tus figuras ya sea en PNG, JPEG o PDF.

Si eres de los que les gusta simplificarse la vida y no te gustan las reglas complicadas, entonces simplemente apréndete esta regla infalible:

* Asegurate de tener, por cada gráfico, una versión EPS y otra versión en alguno de los formatos: PNG, JPEG o PDF.

De estos últimos tres formatos elige el más adecuado según el tipo de gráfico que se trate: PNG para mapas de bits ''simples'', JPEG para fotografías digitales y PDF para gráficos vectoriales. Ahora la pregunta que seguramente te estás haciendo es: ¿Y cómo carambas logro obtener mi gráfico en alguno de estos formatos ''raros''? Las siguientes secciones muestran los métodos más comunes y efectivos.

====EPS a PDF====

Muchas de las soluciones presentadas anteriormente te permiten generar o exportar a un archivo EPS. Si ya tienes el EPS entonces conseguir el PDF es muy sencillo. Simplemente abre una ventana de ''Símbolo de Sistema'' o ''Consola de Comandos'' busca la carpeta donde tienes tu gráfico y ejecuta el comando:

 &gt; epstopdf grafico.eps

Esto genera el archivo PDF correspondiente y, si el EPS contenía originalmente un gráfico vectorial, el PDF resultante será también vectorial. No es recomendable usar esta ruta si el EPS contiene un mapa de bits ya que producir un PNG o JPEG es mucho mejor alternativa. El comando &lt;tt&gt;epstopdf&lt;/tt&gt; es parte de MiKTeX y seguramente ya lo tienes instalado.

====JPEG a EPS====

Si tienes un gráfico JPEG, y necesitas producir un documento PS, la mejor solución es encapsularlo dentro de un EPS usando [http://www.pdflib.com/products/more/jpeg2ps.html jpeg2ps]. Este programa lo tienes que bajar e instalar en tu computadora, una vez hecho esto puedes ejecutar el comando:

 &gt; jpeg2ps grafico.jpg &gt; grafico.eps

para generar el archivo EPS correspondiente. Este comando lo que hace es simplemente añadir a tu archivo JPEG cierta información adicional que le permite a LaTeX procesarlo correctamente, conservando la compresión del archivo original. Esto es buena idea ya que, como comenté anteriormente, el formato EPS es particularmente malo para tratar directamente con mapas de bits (genera archivos ''muy'' grandes).

====ImageMagick: LoQueSea a LoQueSea====

Una excelente herramienta, si ya tienes tu gráfico guardado pero en algún formato incompatible con LaTeX, es utilizar [http://www.imagemagick.org/ ImageMagick]. Entre otras cosas, este programa te permite convertir entre una cantidad inimaginable de formatos usando un sencillo comando &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; (se ejecuta también desde una consola de comandos), por ejemplo:

 &gt; convert grafico.png grafico.eps

En particular si tienes [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ Ghostscript] instalado (en MiKTeX, por ejemplo, ya viene incluido) te brinda soporte para generar los archivos EPS. ImageMagick da muy buenos resultados convirtiendo mapas de bits, pero debes de tener un poco de cautela tratando de convertir gráficos vectoriales pues no siempre da los mejores resultados.

===Insertar el gráfico como una figura dentro de tu documento===

Ya que tienes listo el gráfico en un formato adecuado lo que sigue es agregarlo a un documento en LaTeX. Abre tu documento de LaTeX (&lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt;) y agrega la siguiente instrucción en el preámbulo (antes de &lt;code&gt;\begin{document}&lt;/code&gt;):

 \usepackage{graphicx}

Este paquete lo que hace es permitir incluir gráficos externos en tu documento. Luego, en algún lugar cercano a donde quieras que se coloque tu figura agrega el siguiente código:

 \begin{figure}
   \centering
     \includegraphics{migrafico}
   \caption{Mi Figura}
   \label{fig:ejemplo}
 \end{figure}

El comando &lt;code&gt;\includegraphics{...}&lt;/code&gt; indica el nombre del archivo que contiene el gráfico que quieres insertar. Observa que no es necesario incluir la extensión del archivo, de este modo LaTeX siempre utilizará el más adecuado (EPS, PDF, PNG o JPEG) según la forma en que estés compilando.

==Consejos y notas adicionales==

En esta útlima sección se encuentran algunas notas finales que pueden ayudarte a resolver problemas típicos cuando tratas de insertar figuras en LaTeX.

===Posicionamiento de las figuras===

Normalmente las figuras no aparecen exactamente en el lugar donde tu las podrías esperar. Pero no te alarmes demasiado, LaTeX es muy inteligente y lo que hace es tratar de acomodar las figuras en el lugar más apropiado donde se verán mejor.

Evita entonces redacciones del tipo:

 ... como se muestra en la siguiente figura:

y utiliza en su lugar las bondades de LaTeX:

 ... como se muestra en la Figura~\ref{fig:ejemplo}.

Esto hace que la referencia no dependa del lugar donde aparesca la figura y, finalmente, todo se ve mucho más elegante. Si, por alguna razón, realmente quieres controlar la posición donde aparece la figura puedes leer el artículo [http://ltx.blogspot.com/2003/10/quiero-mi-figura-aqui.html Quiero mi figura AQUÍ] de JL Diaz.

===Tamaño de las figuras===

Si la figura resulta demasiado grande o demasiado pequeña puedes agregar opciones al comando para incluir el gráfico:

 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{migrafico}

que ajusta el ancho de la figura al 70% del ancho del texto que cabe en una página. Puedes, por supuesto, modificar el valor 0.7 por cualquier otro para ajustar el tamaño a tus necesidades. Hay muchas más opciones que provee el comando &lt;code&gt;\includegraphics&lt;/code&gt;, si tienes curiosidad puedes leer la guía [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex.pdf Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e].

===Ruta para guardar los archivos===

Recuerda poner los archivos de los gráficos (al menos las versiones que requieres para compilar en LaTeX) en la misma carpeta donde se encuentra el archivo principal &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; de tu documento. Esto te ayuda a resolver muchos de los problemas que podrías tener insertanto figuras y ayuda a que LaTeX sea más eficiente procesando tu documento. Existen opciones para especificar rutas alternativas donde LaTeX puede buscar tus gráficos, si estás interesado revisa la también la guía [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex.pdf Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e] donde se discuten además los pros y los contras.

===Problemas de visualización===

Uno de los problemas típicos de visualización que los principiantes llegamos a tener es que la gráfica no aparece y, en su lugar, sólo vemos una caja con el nombre del archivo del gráfico. Esto normalmente ocurre porque se tiene activada la opción &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt;, ya sea como opción del paquete en &lt;code&gt;\usepackage[draf]{graphicx}&lt;/code&gt; o como una opción global para todo tu documento en &lt;code&gt;\documentclass&lt;/code&gt;. Esta opción puede ser muy útil ya que, normalmente, los documentos sin gráficos se pueden visualizar más rápidamente mientras estás desarrollando tu trabajo. Sin embargo recuerda quitar esta opción, o cambiarla por &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;, si quieres que aparescan los gráficos en el documento.

Otro de los problemas es que, principalmente con archivos EPS, los gráficos no aparecen correctamente cuando visualizas el DVI de tu documento. Recuerda que el formato DVI es sólo para ''pre-visualizar'' tus documentos. No esperes ver todas tus gráficas y con todos sus efectos especiales en un visor de archivos DVI (como Yap de MiKTeX). Para ver los resultados finales y definitivos siempre mira el archivo PS o PDF.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Highschool Catalog ==

I saw your question on the mathematics bookshelf, and I wanted to see if i could help out. Wikibooks in general frowns upon creating random pages full of lists, so it would be a bad idea to simply create a page that lists highschool-appropriate classes. However, there are 2 techniques that you could use, if you want to lump all such pages into a single reference source:

#you can create a subpage in your user namespace to hold the list. User namespaces are generally free from the restrictions in other parts of wikibooks, although some restrictions still apply. You can list all relevant pages on your user page namespace.
#you could create a template that would tag certain pages as being &quot;highschool appropriate&quot;, and then create a category for that template. All the tagged pages then would appear under the category, which you could browse.

If you want to try either solution, or if you have any questions, leave me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my talk page]]. good luck! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Digital Signal Processing|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:12, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

When designing a particular filter, it is common practice to first design a Low-pass filter, and then using a spectral transform to convert that lowpass filter equation into the equation of a different type of filter. This is done because many common values for butterworth, cheybyshev and elliptical low-pass filters are already extensively tabulated, and designing a filter in this manner rarely requires more effort then looking values up in a table, and applying the correct transformations. This page will enumerate some of the common transformations for filter design.

It is important to note that spectral transformations are not exclusively used for analog filters. There are digital variants of these transformations that can be applied directly to digital filters to transform them into a different type. This page will only talk about the analog filter transforms, and the digital filter transforms will be discussed elsewhere.

== Low-Pass to Low-Pass ==

This spectral transform is used to convert between two lowpass filters with different cutoff frequencies.

We have high-pass and lowpass filters, and it turns out that we can create both filter effects using a single piece of hardware called a '''tunable filter'''. Tunable filters rely on a device called an '''allpass''' filter to create other types of filter outputs.

== Allpass Filters ==

A common, although unintuitive, tool in the DSP toolbox is the all-pass filter. As the name implies, the all-pass filter passes all frequency components without attenuation.

== Why Allpass? ==

The question comes up, if an allpass filter doesn't actually filter anything, why do we bother to study it? The answer is that even though the allpass filter doesn't affect the magnitude response of the system, it will affect the phase response of the system.

Allpass filters have the property that cascading an allpass filter with another IIR filter will produce a linear output for the whole system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This section covers the topics on sensor imperfection and how these components behave in the real world.''

There is no such thing as a &quot;distance sensor&quot;. period. Those components commonly called &quot;distance sensor&quot; or similar names measure something and extract distance information out of that. This extraction works pretty good in particular circumstances, but are worthless in many others. The key to successfully measuring e.g. a distance, is knowing, exactly, what your sensors measures and how external factors influence the measurement. This doesn't mean you just need to know how accurate the sensor is, it means you need to know what part of physics is used, and what the laws of physics say about that.

I'll cover some of the most commonly used sensors and what laws of physics apply to those. I'm not going very deep into explaining physics, there are better sources for that (a wiki physics book for example), just enough to give you the idea of what problems you may expect and where to look for a solution.

==Light Based Sensors==

===Reflection: short range sensors===
This type of sensor detects objects at a range up to a few centimeter. These sensors are quite simple. They consist of a light source, usually an IR diode which signal can be modulated and a light detector, which can be as simple as a light sensitive diode or transistor with an amplification circuit or a more complex IC complete with filters and TTL level outputs.

These sensors work by detecting the reflection of the emitted light. The range at which an object is detected depends on a number of properties of the object:&lt;BR&gt;
* reflectivity/color: how well does the object reflect IR-light? Every object has a color. A green object means that it reflects light with wavelengths that we interpret as the color green. This can be a pretty large range. IR is also a color. Like any other color, some objects reflect IR, and other objects absorb IR.
* surface smoothness: A very smooth surface (like a mirror) reflects more light than a rough surface. (For example, a photograph of a black billiards ball usually shows a white spot caused by [[w:specular reflection]]).
* Angle: The more the surface is turned away from the sensor the more light is going to be reflected away from the sensor.
* Lightsources: Other lightsources like light bulbs or the sun emit IR light as well. Especially the sun can prevent an IR based sensor to operate.

===Reflection: medium range sensors===
Medium range sensors are a bit more complicated than short range sensors. These sensors consist of an IR emitting diode which signal is modulated, the receiver has a lens to focus the reflected light onto a light sensitive strip. Moving the sensor back and forward towards an object moves the reflection beam along the light sensitive strip. The resistance of the strip depends on where the light hits the strip.

Its range has the same limiting factors as short range sensors.

===Reflection: Long range sensors===
Long range sensors use the time a laser pulse takes to travel from the emitter to the object and back. Since the speed of light is so high this type of sensor is only useful for larger ranges.

Its range is also limited in the same way as the previous IR sensors. Another thing than can limit is haze, smoke and other particles on the air.

=== Camera ===

Cameras used in robotics are commonly built around a [[w:Image sensor|image Sensor]]. These cameras are sensitive to IR-light and usually have a IR-filter in front of the lens. Cheap webcams may not contain such a filter, which makes them very sensitive to sunlight. 


=== Stereo vision ===

These sensors consist of (at least) 2 cameras mounted some fixed distance from each other.

This is rarely used because solving the [[w:correspondence problem|correspondence problem]] is difficult.

See also [[Robotics: Sensors: Computer Vision]].

==Sound Based Sensors==
===What is sound?===
Sound is in essence vibrations and pressure differences in the air. These vibrations are split into 3 groups by their frequency. The first group, called ''infrasone'' has a frequency below 20Hz. The second group, called ''ultrasonic'', has a frequency above 20Khz and an upperbound of 2Mhz in air or 30Mhz in water. The last group is what is commonly called ''sound''. This groups range lays between 20Hz and 20Khz and can be heard. Although only newborn babies can really hear all the way up to 20Khz. The older you get the less frequencies you can hear.&lt;BR&gt;
Most sensors use ultrasonic sound, usually around 40Khz. Such a signal can't be heard, while it's still easy to use (generate, detect,...).

===Doppler effect===
If both the source and the receiver are motionless relative to each other, the receiver will hear the same frequency as the source emitted. However if one or both of them move relative to the other, the receiver will detect a different frequency. This change in frequency is called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect Doppler Effect]. Most people know this effect from the sirens of passing police cars or ambulances. When they pass you'll hear one sound as they approach and a somewhat different sound as they move away.

Calculating what frequency the receiver will hear is quite easy:

&lt;math&gt;f_r = f \frac{c + v_r}{c - v_s} &lt;/math&gt;

With:
:&lt;math&gt; f_r&lt;/math&gt; = The frequency the receiver hears
:&lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; = the frequency the source emits
:&lt;math&gt; c&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of sound
:&lt;math&gt; v_r&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of the receiver
:&lt;math&gt; v_s&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of the source

===Speed of sound===
The speed of sound depends on the medium it traverse through and its temperature. For air this is approximately 330m/s at 0°C. Of course most of the time the temperature is a bit higher than this. Calculating the actual speed is fairly easy:

&lt;math&gt;c = c_0 \sqrt{\frac{T}{T_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

with:
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = the actual speed at the current temperature.
:&lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of sound at 0°C: 330m/s.
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = the current temperature in Kelvin.
:&lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; = 273,15 K (this is 0°C in Kelvin)

===Reflection===
===Resonance===
===Diffraction===

==Ultrasonic Distance sensors==
These sensors are pretty simple. In theory that is. In practice these sensors can be a real pain in the pinky. In this section I'll cover some of the troubles you may run into when trying to get them to work.

Ultrasonic distance sensors consist of 3 major parts: A transmitter, a receiver and a timer. To measure a distance the timer triggers the transmitter which emits a series of pulses, then the timer waits until the receiver detects the reflection of the pulses and stops the timer. The time measured is then divided by 2 and multiplied with the speed of sound. The result is the distance between the sensor and the object in front of it.
The transmitter send out a stream of pulses on a carrier frequency. The maximum frequency humans can hear is about 20 KHz. A frequency higher than that is picked to avoid annoying humans with the constant beep -- 40KHz is a common value.

The receiver triggers when it receives a signal with that particular frequency. This is not necessary the signal the transmitter sent. If more than one ultrasonic sensor with the same carrier frequency are used, they can detect each others signals.

Sound doesn't move in a straight line, but rather as a 3D expanding wave. When the wave reaches an object part of it bounces back and moves again as a 3D expanding wave in the opposite direction. Such a wave can easily bounce multiple times before disappearing. So it is very possible that you receive pulses that have travel a much larger trajectory than just to and back from the object in front of the sensor. While some part of this problem can be solved by letting the sensor wait some time before starting another measurement, other situation can produce incorrect measurements which are fairly tough to correct. For example moving through a doorway can fail because the sensors emitted pulses bounce from the walls back to the sensor and so giving a measurement that indicates an object in front of the sensor. One way of correcting this is using another sensor, for example a IR distance sensor to see if there really is an object. However such solution pose another problem: which sensor to believe? 3 sensors allow you to go with the majority, but then things become quite complicated in constructing and interfacing such systems, not to mention what it does to the power consumption.

===Distance Formula===
The formula for calculating distance from a sonar pulse looks like:

&lt;math&gt;Distance=343m/s*\frac{Elapsed Time}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

343 m/s is the speed of sound, and we need to divide the time by 2 because the sound travels out and back.

===Availability &amp; Range===
Sonar sensors are widely available and relatively inexpensive, ranging from $15 to $40 depending on the desired range.  On average the maximum range of a midlevel sonar sensor will be between 4 and 6 meters.  Unlike infrared or laser sensors, sonar sensors also have a minimum sensing distance as well.  This is due to the fact that the distance measurements are based on the speed of sound, and over very short ranges the sound travels out and back more quickly than the circuitry can respond.  This minimum distance will vary by sensors, but is typically around 2 to 5 centimeters.
Also unlike infrared sensors, sonar sensors don’t have a perfect “cone” of vision.  Because sound propagates as a 3D pressure wave, the sensor actually has a range that resembles a sinc function wrapped around a curve.

===Potential Problems===
Sonar sensors work very well for collision avoidance in large areas, but they do have some limitations.  Because sound propagates out as a 3D pressure wave and echoes, your robot may see things that are not really in its way.  For instance, near angled walls the sound waves may bounce several times before returning to the sonar receiver.  This makes it difficult for the robot to know which echo is actually the correct distance to the nearest obstacle.

Similar to this is the problem of having multiple sonar sensors operating the in the same area.  If the frequencies of nearby sonar sensors are too similar they may cause false readings since the sensors have no method besides frequency to distinguish pulses it sent out from those other sensors send out.

Another common problem is the difference in absorbency and reflection of different materials.  If you shoot a sonar pulse at a cloth covered wall (i.e. cubicle), it is likely that the cloth will absorb a significant amount of the acoustic energy and that the robot will not see the wall at all.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, a floor with very high acoustic reflection may register as an obstacle when it is really a clear plane.

==Magnetism Based Sensors==

===Compass sensors===
These sensors are used to measure the orientation of the robot relative to the magnetic north. It is important to remember that the magnetic north is not exactly the same as the geographical north. They differ several degrees.

The magnetic field of Earth is quite weak. This makes that these sensors will not operate well along other magnetic fields. E.g. speakers would mess up the reading. If you use these sensors it is best to mount them as far away from your motors as possible. While you can't shield them without making them useless, paying attentions to where you mount them can make a considerable difference in reliability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== URLs ==
URLs should be permanent. When you begin to put together a website make sure that the URLs you choose will survive redesigns. A useful article on good URLs is [http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/uri-choose Choose URIs wisely].

== Navigation bars ==
Navigation bars normally consist of lists of links. Since they are lists they should be marked-up using the &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ol&lt;/code&gt; elements. (XHTML 2.0 may introduce a special navigation list element when it is released.)

&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;ul&gt;
  &amp;lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/&quot; accesskey=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/li&gt;
  &amp;lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/news/&quot;&gt;News&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/li&gt;
  &amp;lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Contact us&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/li&gt;
  &amp;lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/accesskeys/&quot; accesskey=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Access keys&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/li&gt;
 &amp;lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Every page on your website should include a link to your home page. The link should be in the same place on every page. In most cases it will be the first link in your primary navigation bar.

=== Access keys ===
{{wikipediapar||access keys}}
Access keys are keyboard shortcuts for links and form elements. Important links that appear on all pages on your website, e.g. the link to the home page, should be given an access key. The access key bindings should be the same on all pages on your website. You should include a web page that lists all the access keys used on your website.

== Search and Site Map ==
You can't have a link from your home page to every other page on the website. If your website contains more than a few pages you need a site map and possibly a search tool so users can find relevant pages easily.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;create custom XLINK in both XML and XML schema&quot;'' Where is the schema? Maybe I overlooked something, but I only see information about how to use XLINK in an XML document and stylesheet.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Introduction - Flesh out the Intro and revise some of the current wording. Examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;XLink allows a documents hyperlinks to be isolated and centralized on a separate document which is similiar to centralization of formatting on XSL stylesheets. When document addresses change these can be changed in the centralized location.&quot; ''This is worded awkwardly.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;XLink allows bidirectional linking and parameters that control when the link is processed.&quot; ''What does this mean? What is bidirectional linking? This could be explained before this bulleted list. The Intro can also explain parameter controls.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The use of xlink requires the declaration of the xlink namespace which is at http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink/. This namespace provides the global attributes for type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, from and to.&quot; ''What is the xlink namespace? Elaborate on the global attributes, even if you just say that these attributes will be outlined in more detail in the XML Documentation section of this chapter.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* XML Documentation - 1. Should this section be titled &quot;XML Documentation&quot;? 2. The attributes should be listed in a table format, with a table heading. There should also be a segment of info before and after the table to transition between the sections. Examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Intro: &quot;The following table outlines the attributes that can be used with the xlink namespace. The table also includes descriptions of how the attributes can be used.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Summary: &quot;The proceeding examples illustrate how to use the xlink namespace and attributes within XML documents (and schemas? stylesheets?).&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* XML Examples - The code should be separated for the XML document, XML stylesheet, and HTML. The examples should have better explanations. If feasible, it may be helpful to modify the example code to continue the TourGuide model.
* Summary - The summary seems to have unnecessary line breaks at the end of each line. Regarding the XLINK limitations, is this information still current? Is it possible that there's more widespread support for XLINK in browsers today?
* Exercises - I don't believe the exercises should be in their own blocks. I need to consult with the editorial board, so we can develop more specific standards for formatting exercises and solutions. However, exercises and solutions should be links off of this page.
* Overall - The page formatting should conform to the author guidelines (as you've said). The content can be fleshed out and explained better. Please edit any grammar or spelling errors you see. There are many fragments and missing punctuation in the text.

I think the plan and comments on the plan are on target.

== Discrete Cosine Transform  in dsp==

The '''Discrete Cosine Transform''' (DCT) is a transform that is very common when encoding video and audio tracks on computers. Many &quot;codecs&quot; for movies rely on DCT concepts for compressing and encoding video files. The DCT can also be used to analyze the spectral components of images as well. The DCT is very similar to the DFT, except the output values are all real numbers, and the output vector is approximately twice as long as the DFT output.
It expresses a sequence of finite data points in terms of sum of cosine functions.

== Haar Transform ==

The Haar Transform, or the '''Haar Wavelet Transform''' (HWT) is one of a group of related transforms known as the '''Discrete Wavelet Transforms''' (DWT). DWT Transforms, and the Haar transform in particular can frequently be made very fast using matrix calculations. The fastest known algorithm for computing the HWT is known as the '''Fast Haar Transform''', and is comparable in speed and properties to the Fast Fourier Transform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beekeeping gloves are, as the name suggests, special gloves made for beekeeping.  They are made of leather and other tough but flexible materials.  The gloves extend to the elbows, where they are tied.
Many experienced beekeepers do not use gloves as bees will generally not sting unless provoked.  For beginners, however, both because they are more likely to make mistakes and because they aren't so used to being around bees, gloves are definitely a good idea.

Some people use thin nitrile gloves as an alternative to heavy duty leather gloves. These gloves are more sensitive and therefore result in less chance that bees will get inadvertently crushed. In addition, bees don't perceive the nitrile gloves as skin so they tend not to sting through the gloves.

There is a very verbose policy [[Wikibooks:Media]] that needs some tweaking. I have called the attention at the time of the proposal to factual errors.&lt;br&gt; 
I strongly disagree with the use of the phrase &quot;Public domain works are works not protected by copyright laws or are ineligible for copyright protection.&quot; and also but with a minor degree have a strong distaste for the continued mislabeling of the Wikibooks GFDL policy as simply GFDL (this one may still cause us problems, it improbable, but any complain would have legitimacy, since any work that was clearly GFDL and is now using Wikibooks GFDL constitutes the relicensing of the work by an unauthorized party).&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Wikibooks GFDL&quot; is used to distinguish that the project uses the GFDL with some restrictions (that is with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts ).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:42, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

Subjetividad, imaginarios y prácticas: las miradas del sentido del humor




Cárdenas, N.; Flantermsky, H.; Garduño, A.; Gisbert, G.; Graillet, Y.; Gravis, M.; Jo, M.; Meza, M;  Petroyianni, V.; Romano, J.




 









Resumen

Este ensayo pretende estudiar la influencia del imaginario social en lo construcción de la subjetividad y la práctica social del sentido del humor. El análisis  de esta triada parte de la teoría de Castoridis en cuanto al imaginario social para relacionarla con la subjetividad (vista desde Heidegger, Melucci, .Galande y Engelken) y el humor (desde Hipócrates, Lyotard, Lipovetski, Freud, y otros). Conclu-imos que ……

La variabilidad en cada uno de los debates realizados, la falta de consenso y la dificultad para llevar a cabo la idea de concierto arendtiana, donde se supone que la polifonía de la diversidad, de todas las voces haciendo una amalgama musical en la cual diferencias y desacuerdos forman parte de una música colectiva que no desafina y suena bien, ha hecho que tengamos que recurrir al único lenguaje posible para unir este archipiélago disperso de subjetividades: el sentido del humor. 
La búsqueda del pensamiento como ejercicio libre de la imaginación y la necesidad de encarnar el reto de nuestra imaginación desbordada y estimulada por estos seminarios, ha hecho posible que nos conectemos en una misma frecuencia como proceso para poder hacer algo en común. Pero fue solamente cuando dejamos de tomarnos tan en serio unos a otros, cuando nos pudimos reír y apreciar nuestros ridículos intentos de imponer hacer al grupo lo que cada uno quería hacer individualmente. Solamente en ese momento en que pudimos ver lo que nos estaba pasando pudimos empezar a desarrollar verdaderamente algo juntos. Y es que hasta entonces cada uno quería ejercer cierto dominio desde el reino de su parcela de conocimientos y experiencia confrontando a los demás ya que competir entre nosotros es una práctica habitual. Mucho Cacique y poco indio. En los debates pudimos discutir entre nosotros, coincidir, divagar, perdernos, encontrarnos, buscar puntos comunes, cuestionarlos y sobre todo reírnos de ellos a través del humor que nos abrió la puerta para darle la vuelta a la tortilla y cambiar nuestra dinámica de funcionamiento.
En un principio, cuando unimos los dos grupos de trabajo de los cuales partimos, no nos dimos cuenta de la complejidad de la tarea que nos habíamos propuesto. No parecía tan difícil enlazar los temas de Subjetividad, Prácticas e Imaginarios. Si somos muchos, podemos fácilmente dividirnos las tareas, parecimos asumir todos sin mucha preocupación. Craso error: cada uno tenía su mirada puesta en cosas muy diferentes desde perspectivas muy distintas y hacer un ensamblaje de esas diferencias iba a resultar, después de agotadores esfuerzos, a lo sumo en un pobre y desarticulado Frankenstein: pedazos mutilados y sin alma puestos juntos sin mayor trascendencia. 
Nos aventuramos pues en esta plataforma que nos unió, que es el sentido del humor, para poder aproximarnos al tema de investigación. Con toda probabilidad ha sido un esfuerzo lleno de riesgos, imprecisiones, límites borrosos y mucha dificultad. No ha estado exenta de sufrimientos, y a pesar de que tenemos la costumbre de asociar el humor a lo placentero, en numerosas ocasiones no lo ha sido tanto. Pero ha sido una aventura enriquecedora, muy nutritiva y también divertida para nosotros, como se aprecia en las etapas que hemos vivido a lo largo del trabajo, por lo que pensamos que ha valido la pena el esfuerzo y esperamos que también lo sea para los que lean este trabajo. 


 
Introducción
Este ensayo pretende estudiar la influencia del imaginario social en lo construcción de la subjetividad y la práctica social del sentido del humor. 

En la primera sección abordamos definiciones que varios autores ofrecen, entorno a al sujeto y subjetividad. Mostramos la indeterminación que el concepto encierra en su propia polisemia. Luego, partimos de las aportaciones de las ciencias sociales en torno a la subjetividad para introducirnos a la concepción de Castoriadis, en tanto sujeto como creación social.

En la segunda sección, partimos de la teoría de Castoriadis (1986) en cuanto al imaginario social y nos aventuraremos a estudiar el humor cómo una forma en que el imaginario social se materializa. Siendo el propio Castoriadis quién acuña el término de Imaginario Social, pareció pertinente tomarlo como base. Así, tomando como pretexto de algunas expresiones del humor, establecemos vínculos entre el humor  y los caracteres múltiples, del origen magmático, autonomía, de las dimensiones conjuntista-identitario y social-historico del imaginario social. 

Finalmente, la última sección concluimos………….. 






1.	De la noción de sujeto a la subjetividad: la indeterminación como principio.

El concepto de subjetividad es posiblemente uno de los más difíciles y problemáticos de definir en ciencias sociales, debido a su amplitud descomunal y escasa precisión. Para acercarnos a este complejo concepto, un punto de partida puede ser la noción de sujeto de Heidegger como ser ahí (dassein), que le otorga al ser humano la condición ontológico-existenciaria de que “es abierto a él mismo”, lo cual quiere decir que nos movemos ya en cierta comprensión de nosotros, sin que esta comprensión esté determinada o nos determine en modo alguno.  Es decir, para entender la subjetividad es preciso partir de un principio de indeterminación. 
Asimismo, Melucci (2001) la revela como una –unidad abierta-. Esto hace que podamos preguntarnos por sus sentidos sin que estos “aparezcan” del todo, sin que tengamos que hacer una visión desde el ojo de Dios, view from everywhere, o que tampoco la hagamos desde ningún lugar, view from nowhere. 

Hacer el intento de (re)presentar, (des)velar e imaginar la subjetividad supone adentrarse en un nodo de significados, intercambios y metáforas articuladoras de sentido. En la subjetividad están inscriptos: su contrario, “lo objetivo”, la identidad, la filosofía que supone sujetos, el Yo, la conciencia, el cuerpo, la verdad, la autonomía, la salvación, la belleza, la política, la historia, el lenguaje, los imaginarios, los otros, la sociedad, el conocimiento, la cultura, las preguntas acerca del origen:¿Quién soy ahora, qué papel me toca jugar?
Este gran conjunto aparentemente ilimitado de tropos es indicativo de la complejidad que existe para abordar una categoría que se presenta como nodo y no como un concepto o dispositivo concreto.

Existen pues muchas visiones de la subjetividad; las hay que le otorgan poder/saber al sujeto dotándolo de autonomía e imaginación y le dejan la posibilidad de auto construirse, autodeterminarse. Las hay también en su sentido opuesto, las que no le otorgan al sujeto casi ninguna posibilidad de autodeterminación en sí mismo, sino en principios o estructura externas que lo constriñen. El desarrollo de este nodo-concepto ha estado impregnado desde sus comienzos por la tradición filosófica occidental, a través de diversidad de escuelas y tendencias. El abordaje de la subjetividad plantea el surgimiento de la antinomia sujeto/objeto como un marco que pauta la conformación del conocimiento acerca de la realidad. Largos debates han atravesado las escuelas idealistas o materialistas en filosofía, las cuales han aportado multiplicidad de visiones sobre sus sentidos.

El marco filosófico occidental ha delimitado las coordenadas del ser: lo que uno es, está relacionado con lo que uno piensa, la identidad del Yo será un proceso reflexivo (con)formado por él mismo. En este contexto, la modernidad propone el sujeto y la conciencia como dos figuras para delinear la subjetividad.

En las ciencias sociales, podríamos decir que la conformación del nodo-concepto de subjetividad parte del espacio en que los sujetos sociales, y con ellos, los sujetos individualizados, comprenden el mundo y a sí mismos (Engelken, 2005). De esto se desprende que existen gran variedad de conceptos relacionados o asociados con el de subjetividad, tales como los de sí mismo, self, yo, mundo, sociedad, individuo, psique, identidad, cultura, entre tantos otros. 

La investigación de la subjetividad consiste básicamente en la interrogación de los sentidos, las significaciones y los valores, éticos y morales, que produce una determinada cultura, su forma de apropiación por los individuos y la orientación que efectúan sobre sus acciones prácticas. No existe una subjetividad que pueda aislarse de la cultura y la vida social, ni tampoco existe una cultura que pueda aislarse de la subjetividad que la sostiene. Esta mutua determinación –en verdad, mutua producción- debe ser nuestro punto de arranque, ya que la subjetividad es cultura singularizada tanto como la cultura es subjetividad (objetivada en los productos de la cultura, las forma de intercambio y las relaciones sociales concretas que las sostienen, pero también en las significaciones y los sentidos que organizan la producción cultural). 

1.1 Imaginario social y sujeto
Para Castoriadis (1986) el hombre existe sólo, en y a través, de la sociedad y la sociedad siempre es histórica. La sociedad como tal es una forma, cada sociedad dada es una forma particular e incluso singular. La forma se vincula a la organización, es decir, al orden o si se prefiere orden/desorden. Los individuos y las cosas son creaciones sociales tanto en la forma general y particular que ambos toman en cualquier sociedad determinada.

¿Qué es lo que mantiene unida a una sociedad? ¿Cuál es la base de la unidad, la cohesión y la diferenciación organizada de la maravillosa y compleja red del fenómeno que observamos en cada una de las sociedades existentes? 
Para Castoriadis (1986) lo que mantiene unida a una sociedad es “la institución de la sociedad como todo”, esto es, constituida de varias instituciones particulares. La palabra institución está tomada aquí en su sentido más amplio y radical: normas, valores, lenguaje, instrumentos, procedimientos y métodos para tratar con las cosas y hacer cosas, y, desde luego, también como el yo individual, en el tipo y la forma tanto particular como general. Por ejemplo, las distinciones: hombre/mujer que se le da en cada sociedad. 

Castoridis (1986) afirma que las instituciones prevalecen, asegurando su validez efectiva, a través de la adhesión, el apoyo, el consenso, la legitimidad, la creencia, más que por coerción y sanción. A la transformación, o fabricación, del material humano en individuos sociales, transformación en la cual están implicados éstos y el mecanismo de su perpetuación. Lo cual deja entrever una recursividad entre construcción de individuos sociales troquelados por la “la institución de la sociedad como todo”, y entre estos individuos que legitiman y reproducen las instituciones que les engendró. 

El autor se pregunta: ¿cuál es la parte del pensamiento y de la manera de mirar y de hacer las cosas que no está condicionada o co-determinada, en un nivel decisivo, por la estructura y los significados de la lengua, por la organización del mundo que aquélla lleva en sí, por el primer ambiente familiar, la escuela, todo el hacer y el no hacer al que uno ha estado constantemente expuesto, los amigos, las opiniones que van y vienen, las maneras en que uno se ve forzado por los innumerables artefactos en los cuales uno anda nadando, etc.? Concluye que si, con toda sinceridad, alguien puede responder cerca del uno por ciento de este planteamiento, ciertamente, es uno de los pensadores más originales que jamás han existido. 

Así pues, declara el autor, hay una unidad de la institución total de la sociedad y, esta unidad es la unidad y la cohesión interna de la inmensa y complicada red de significaciones que atraviesan, orientan y dirigen toda la vida de una sociedad y a los individuos concretos que la constituyen realmente. Esta red de significados es lo que él llamo el magma de las significaciones imaginario-sociales, las cuales son llevadas por la sociedad e incorporadas a ella y, por así decirlo, la animan. Tales significaciones imaginario sociales son, por ejemplo: los espíritus, los dioses, Dios; la polis, el ciudadano, la nación, el Estado, el partido, la comodidad, el dinero, el capital, la tasa de interés; el tabú, la virtud, el pecado, etc. Pero también son el hombre/la mujer/el niño tal como se especifican en una sociedad; más allá de las definiciones puramente anatómicas o biológicas, el hombre, la mujer y el niño son lo que son en virtud de las significaciones imaginario sociales que los hacen ser precisamente eso que son. Un romano y una romana fueron y son algo totalmente diferente, por ejemplo, de los americanos y las americanas de hoy. Castoridis llamó imaginarias a estas significaciones porque no tienen nada que ver con las referencias a lo racional o a los elementos de lo real, o no han sido agotadas por ellos, y porque son sustentadas por la creación. Y las llamó sociales porque existen sólo sí son instituidas y compartidas por una colectividad impersonal y anónima.

Si nos detenemos ahora en Bourdieu, éste nos explicará la posición que ocupa el sujeto, una posición relativa respecto a los otros actores dentro de lo que él entiende por campo, el espacio social pluridimensional. Las prácticas que desarrolle cada sujeto están en función del interés o ilusión por participar en este campo manteniendo, cambiando o intentando cambiar su posición dentro de él. 
No obstante, para que estas prácticas se instituyan como estrategias Bourdieu apela al habitus, que es lo que genera prácticas individuales dando a la conducta esquemas de percepción, pensamiento y acción y es lo que nos permitirá conectar lo individual con lo social. 

Normalmente el agente expresa su habitus de clase o grupo a través de un determinado habitus lingüístico: interés por decir determinadas cosas y una determinada manera y capacidad para hablar en un determinado contexto.  Por tanto, el habitus nos permite entender como una determinada comunicación entre diferentes sujetos está determinada por la internalización de la posición que ocupa en la estructura social. De esta manera vemos como se configuran mercados lingüísticos con discursos estilísticamente caracterizados (Bourdieu, 85), lo que condiciona racionalmente, según los propósitos individuales, cómo elegimos dirigirnos a terceros. Así pues, las prácticas del sentido del humor estarán relacionadas directamente con los sujeto/s al/a los que se dirijan, lo que permite que se constituyan y reafirmen las identidades de agentes y grupos; y de aquí que podamos construir diferentes tipologías del sentido del humor a partir de estas relaciones: críticas con el poder establecido, del absurdo, etc.


2. Imaginario social y Humor

Bajo este entendimiento de subjetividad y lo que es el magma de significaciones imaginario sociales, veamos su relación con el humor. Etimológicamente “humor” proviene del latín “umus”, que significa líquido, fluido, humedad (Ortega, 1997; Luke, 1987). Sin embargo, el término “humor” a lo largo de la historia, ha tenido, y tiene, una gran variedad de significaciones. Desde Hipócrates se asocia “Humor” con disposiciones anímicas y temperamentos del hombre (Ortega, op. cit). Las primeras aproximaciones a una tipología de la personalidad y comprensión del ser se basaron en la proporcionada distribución de los “humores” en la teoría hipocrática, flemático, sanguíneo, colérico y melancólico. Pero aquí quizás convenga diferenciar entre el humor  y otros conceptos relacionados. Una de las formas más comunes del humor popular es el chiste. Fischer lo define como un &lt;juicio que juega&gt; (Fischer, cit. en Freud, 1976a) que encuentra sentido en las incongruencias. Aquí lo entenderemos como “maneras de ver al mundo, de observar o percibir”. Es en las relaciones e interacciones cotidianas que tienen las personas, como juegos de lenguaje, con contenido de imágenes y emotividad, donde se encuentra lo más interesante del fenómeno humorístico. Por tanto, el humor contempla una complejidad de interconexiones. En palabras de Lyotard (1989): 
“(…) los juegos de lenguaje son (...) el mínimo de relación exigido para que haya sociedad (...). Desde su nacimiento, el ser humano está ya situado con referencia a la historia que cuenta su ambiente, y con respecto a la cual tendrá posteriormente que conducirse”.   
El humor en la colectividad, en las sociedades, ha tenido gran importancia en la historia de los pueblos, como puede constatarse, por ejemplo, en las festividades y carnavales. Un autor que toma con fuerza esta idea es Lipovetski (1998), quién alude a un tipo de humor en la era medieval, en donde la risa y los elementos humorísticos de la colectividad estaban asociados a lo grotesco, lo inferior, el rebajamiento de lo sublime, del poder, de lo sagrado. Incluso en el Renacimiento: 
“La risa siempre está unida a la profanación de los elementos sagrados, a la violación de las reglas oficiales”. 
Sin embargo, cuando se extraen del humor los elementos de mofa, grosería, su base obscena, según el autor, lo humorístico ya no es tan sólo el simbolismo de la degradación de lo sagrado, sino que también comienza a ser algo crítico, agudo, contracultural, rebelde. El humor, así, pierde un tanto su carácter de acción pública,
 “Se metamorfosea en placer subjetivo ante tal o cual hecho cómico aislado” 
Si tuviésemos que realizar una definición aproximada y muy general del humor en base a las referencias que nos ofrece la literatura revisada, de alguna manera nuestro esfuerzo sintético confluiría en algo como esto: en el humor, las concepciones de realidad, de conocimiento, la moral, el “yo”, los “otros”, y por lo tanto la identidad y alteridad del que “comprende” estos sentidos en lo sin sentido, están inextricablemente involucradas.

Quizás haya sido Esopo, como dice Ortega (1997), el que con sus fábulas de gran belleza nos introduzca en esta mezcla de seriedad y de risa. En todas sus historias, se desviste al final una suerte de moraleja, algo que nos enseña cosas de nuestro mundo y de nuestras relaciones. 

“El humor, piensa el griego, descubre el punto convergente de las antinomias y resuelve equilibradamente la aparente contradicción entre lo doloroso y lo grato”.  

Dicho humorismo se adentra y se aventura a considerar el humor entre contrastes: lo trágico y lo cómico, lo doloroso y lo placentero, aparentes fuerzas contrarias que desde él se van desentrañando para comprender al hombre en sí mismo. Por esta razón, según los mismos pensadores griegos, al humor le precede no sólo la reflexión, sino también un profundo entrenamiento del espíritu. Es decir, se relacionaría directamente con una comprensión ética del ser y del mundo, la conducción del espíritu humano con una pedagogía, con ciertos valores. 
El humor sería entonces:

“(…) capaz de alzarse benignamente sobre los defectos humanos, tomar distancia frente a ellos por medio de la risa, para penetrar en una concepción sana y natural del mundo, al par que muestra debilidades y errores”. 

 La sucesión de desconcierto– iluminación, que hace referencia a la pregunta de ¿quiénes somos?, nos da la idea que en el humor se nos revela algo que no siempre es evidente, algo que no es del todo visible, tal y como las estrellas no son visibles en el día, pero no por ello dejan de estar allí. Aquí pues, la conexión del humor impregnado y sustentado en este magma de las significaciones imaginario sociales, que hacen del humor la característica del grupo social que le da vida.  

2.1 La Multiplicidad social y la humorística
Estos juegos de lenguaje del humor, es una práctica que hace operativa la socialización, y da sentido de existencia. Castoriadis (1986) dice: “La sociedad como tal es una forma, cada sociedad dada es una forma particular e incluso singular”.  El humor como expresión social, también tiene formas, formas singulares asociadas a la sociedad donde se produce. El humorista o la persona con sentido del humor, parece tomar elementos del medio que les rodea, para adaptarse/criticar a su entorno, y de allí emergen diversidad de formas de expresión de esa cualidad. Éstas también se han consagrado en nuestras prácticas académicas: la ironía, el sarcasmo, la sátira, la burla, la caricatura también, como negarlo, forman parte de nuestro día a día en el mundo académico. 


 El humor tiene vigencia cultural, singularidades que le hacen asequible a cierto grupo social, definiendo así una forma particular. Un ejemplo claro de ello es el chiste nacionalista o regional, el cual genera un sentido de unidad en el grupo social. ¿Cuantos chistes redimen la nacionalidad propia en despecho de las ajenas y subvierten su precariedad? Este tipo de chistes, al tiempo que generan una cohesión, un sentido de pertenencia, crean valores, normas de conducta, expectativas del deber ser, procuran: adhesión, el apoyo, el consenso, la legitimidad, la creencia. Esta manera de crear unidad, en concordancia con Castoriadis, no es en definitiva a través de la fuerza, sino de la forma sutil, simbólica, creativa, veladamente potente, a la vez que divertida e imaginativa. En este rubro se encuentran  los chistes regionalistas que ponen al descubierto y en evidencia cruda lo que como sociedad hacemos, que para entenderlo hay que vivir en el lugar, su significado se asocia a los códigos del imaginario propios del lugar. Un ejemplo sería el siguiente:
 

En América Latina, por ejemplo, el humor nos sirve para identificarnos como pueblos, a través de la pobreza, la miseria, de la historia de los regímenes políticos llevados por dictadores, de las pseudos-democracias. Justamente, al hablar de comprensión, en el latinoamericano se le atribuye una especie de agilidad para entender situaciones humorísticas de agudeza y profundidad, que no podrían ser entendidas por cualquiera, por ejemplo, los anglosajones, quienes parecen tener un humor basado más en la torpeza, en la burla. El humor “hermana”, quita las fachadas, permite el acercamiento entre las personas.

También es cierto que hay humor general o “globalizado” como lo es por ejemplo las películas de Chaplin, o algunos que circulan por internet. Este tipo de humor también es un reflejo de las formas sociales, como en espejo. Veamos una muestra:

 

Este chiste da cuenta de una práctica dentro de nuestras interrelaciones en un imaginario social globalizado, y descara algunas de sus características. Descubre la neurosis corpórea, ante la idealización de un modelo del cuerpo ajeno e impuesto a través de los medios masivos de comunicación. También, ejemplifica la fluidez post-modernista en tanto a la facilidad de cambiar de personalidad, bajo un medio que permite seleccionar virtualmente cualquier sexo, edad, nacionalidad, estatura, color, etc. Ante esta cachetada de verdades, no queda más que reírnos de nosotros mismos.

Aristóteles buscaba para el desarrollo y crecimiento del hombre cierta moderación, equilibrio, sentido de proporción o “prudencia” (phronesis), entre lo cómico y lo trágico. Compensación: “El humor en la tragedia, y seriedad en la comedia”. Diógenes Laercio: franco opositor de los órdenes convencionales, reconocía su importancia: el humor, la comedia y la tragedia conformaban aspectos esenciales para vivir bien en este mundo.

El humor, piensa el griego, descubre el punto convergente de las antinomias y resuelve equilibradamente la aparente contradicción entre lo doloroso y lo grato. (Ortega, op. Cit, p. 20)

Por esta razón, según los mismos pensadores griegos, al humor le precede no sólo la reflexión, sino también un profundo entrenamiento del espíritu. Es decir, se relacionaría directamente con una comprensión ética del ser y del mundo, la conducción del espíritu humano con una pedagogía, con ciertos valores. El humor sería entonces

 “capaz de alzarse benignamente sobre los defectos humanos, tomar distancia frente a ellos por medio de la risa, para penetrar en una concepción sana y natural del mundo, al par que muestra debilidades y errores”  (Ortega, op. Cit., pp. 21).

De allí surgen algunas consideraciones que hasta hoy parecen profundamente asociadas al sentido del humor: obtención de cierto placer, conciencia de imperfección para reírse de sí mismo, tolerancia y humildad, liberación de las prisiones convencionales y de las visiones parciales que nos ciegan, capacidad para “discriminar y responder a las relaciones de las partes al todo” (Luke, op. Cit.), la confrontación a la moral convencional, y quizás la más compleja de todas, por incluir en cierta medida a las anteriores, la capacidad de comprensión o Verstehen. 

&lt;el humor es en principio un intento por comprender y responder ante determinadas situaciones o experiencias de perplejidad, de asombro, en donde “algo no es cual debería ser”&gt;. Es decir, que en el humor, las concepciones de realidad, de conocimiento, la moral, el “yo”, los “otros”, y por lo tanto la identidad y alteridad del que “comprende” estos sentidos en lo sin sentido
 
Este chiste, evidencia el repudio a los signos de vejez. En este caso, la caída de los senos como proceso natural del paso del tiempo. El empecinamiento por aparentar lo que se ha perdido, lo que no se tiene, el deseo por otro cuerpo, ser otra persona. Esa que es aceptada como lo deseable, el estereotipo vigente. La sonrisa de la anciana, muestra una satisfacción tras encontrar una careta que disfrace la naturaleza de su cuerpo. Lo que importa es lo que aparentamos, lo que ven los demás (o que pretendemos que se ve), aunque sepamos el engaño. Es al tiempo una legitimación de lo que  se quiere, pechos turgentes. Esta es una cachetada obvia del imaginario social, que por ponerla de manifiesto sin tapujos, solo queda reírnos de nosotr@s  mism@s.   

Un contraejemplo, que denuncia un imaginario masculino es el siguiente:

  

Bugdeon argumenta que los cuerpos no sirven simplemente como una fundación natural o superficie pasiva sobre la cual se inscriben sentidos por sistemas de significación sino que existe una irreductibilidad entre el sujeto y el objeto tal que, en orden para comprender las vías en las cuales los hombres y mujeres viven activamente sus identidades encarnadas, es necesario desarrollar un enfoque en el que se pueda visionar un cuerpo más allá de la dicotomía de materialidad y representación, es decir, el cuerpo visto no como un objeto, sino como un evento. 

Según la teoría de estructuración del cuerpo de Giddens, es de central importancia la relación entre la agencialidad y las estructuras sociales ya que el control regularizado y el monitoreo reflexivo del cuerpo por el agente cognoscente es una condición necesaria para la acción. En la modernidad tardía, dicho autor sugiere que la reflexividad se ha acelerado de manera tal que el cuerpo, una vez dado como aspecto de la naturaleza, se convierte en un proyecto abierto a la intervención humana, y como la naturaleza, es colonizado y sujeto a constante revisión. El oscurecimiento de la frontera entre lo que es dado y lo que está abierto a elección nos diría que el sí mismo puede ser liberado de la determinación corporal. 

A través del desarrollo de técnicas y tecnologías tales como la ingeniería genética, tecnologías reproductivas, cirugía plástica, la dieta y regímenes para la salud, los cuerpos no sólo se convierten en objetos para el manejo y la reconfiguración, sino que cada vez más son centrales en la construcción de la identidad propia. Existe la idea de un supuesto “libre albedrío”, o libertad de elección, según la cual los individuos son responsables de cultivar y reestructurar activamente lo corporal, eligiendo a través de diversidad de rangos de elecciones entre múltiples alternativas. En la post-modernidad, las experiencias del sí mismo y el cuerpo están mediadas por una constante proyección amplificada por los medios de comunicación, de una proliferación de imágenes y opciones, que uno debe incorporar a su propio proyecto. 

Siguiendo con la teoría de Guiddens, Bugdeon (2003) plantea que la relación entre el cuerpo y sí mismo está abierta a tres aspectos críticos fundamentales:
1)	Las conceptualizaciones sobre mente y cuerpo se establecen principalmente como dicotómicas.
2)	En este proceso se privilegia especialmente la mente sobre el cuerpo.
3)	Se produce una especie de ceguera sobre la naturaleza del género en esta dicotomía. 
Esto nos sugiere que en el mundo occidental, la reflexividad tiene un lugar preponderante como modo de relación y compromiso con el mundo. En este compromiso, el cuerpo se convierte en un material a través del cual la mente actúa, colocándolo fuera del actor. Es decir, los actores son principalmente agentes pensantes y que eligen entre múltiples alternativas, y no seres que sienten y habitan como seres-del-mundo. Existe entonces una énfasis exagerado en la reflexividad donde la mente toma al cuerpo, y ese privilegio nos provee una mirada en donde los actores sociales quedan “descorporeizados”, el individuo es un sí mismo reflexivo y no encarnado; es una conciencia desencarnada. Esta imagen probablemente haya sido en gran medida influida por la criatura cartesiana.

2.2 El origen magmático y su relación con el humor

En relación a la raíz u origen del magma y de su unidad, Castoriadis (1986), dice que  “ningún sujeto o individuo (o grupos de sujetos e individuos) podría nunca ser este origen”. Esta borrosidad del origen también es característica del humor. El “Humor”, como ya hemos señalado, es fluido, su sino escapa, se escurre de las dimensiones factuales de los significados, de los signos, de la rigurosidad lógica. El fenómeno humorístico parece estar constituido por nubes de Humo, suerte de estructuras disipativas (o ausentes), humedad vaporizada, que hace sumamente difícil la tarea de convertir al humor en objeto de estudio o de encontrar su origen, su creador primero ¿Quién creo el último chiste que escuchamos? es difícil señalarlo, y finalmente pierde sentido en la práctica cotidiana. Lo que nos lleva a concluir que el humor tanto producto del imaginario social, no podemos encontrarle un origen único e indiscutible. 
Por otro lado, el autor señala “Somos fragmentos de la institución de la sociedad, partes totales” el chiste, como producción humana, también funciona como un fragmento que es parte de la imagen total, pero que a su vez, de alguna manera la sintetiza, la reproduce, en forma de holograma. 

Esta creación humana (el humor) tiene a su vez un doble vínculo. Es una creación  al tiempo que crea, engendra. Crea, recrea o legitima creencias, formas de ser, valores, estereotipos.  Es decir, el humor es producto de un imaginario colectivo que recrea imaginarios colectivos. 
 

Este es un ejemplo de los atributos esperados/acusados para hombre/mujer, que expresan/acusan las creencias, valores, lo que debe ser o se espera socialmente de cada género. 
El problema de la realidad en el humor se traduce en poder ver las cosas desde otras perspectivas, que eso que denominamos no es unidimensional sino que ofrece diversas caras. 
De allí surgen algunas consideraciones que hasta hoy parecen profundamente asociadas al sentido del humor: obtención de cierto placer, conciencia de imperfección para reírse de sí mismo, tolerancia y humildad, liberación de las prisiones convencionales y de las visiones parciales que nos ciegan, capacidad para  “(…) discriminar y responder a las relaciones de las partes al todo” a la a confrontación a la moral convencional, y quizás la más compleja de todas, por incluir en cierta medida a las anteriores o a la capacidad de comprensión o Verstehen.


Castoriadis (1986) afirma que si se analiza cómo funcionan, en una sociedad, “el magma de significaciones imaginario sociales y sus correspondientes instituciones, se puede ver que, en un aspecto, hay una similitud entre la organización social y la biológica: en el ‘cierre’ […]. Tanto la organización social como la biológica muestran un ‘cierre’ organizativo, informativo y cognoscitivo. Cada sociedad, al igual que cada ser o especie viviente, establece (crea) su propio mundo, dentro del cual, desde luego, se incluye a sí misma.[…] La institución de la sociedad es la que determina lo que es real y lo que no lo es, qué tiene sentido y qué no lo tiene”. La producción de los chistes es reflejo de esta idea. Es la sociedad, (los individuos) la que define qué tiene sentido y qué no lo tiene. La difusión de cada chiste esta en función de su vigencia, de su significado, o a falta de él, sucumbe. La vida de cada chiste esta en función del sentido, del reflejo que tiene de “la realidad” o su significante. Así, basta que exista un evento social para que surjan nuevas creaciones humorísticas como por ejemplo: Irak, San Juanico en México, elecciones políticas, etc. contra chistes que dejan de circular, porque pierden vigencia. El humor, como producto social es una “construcción, una constitución, una creación del mundo, de su propio mundo. Su identidad no es sino este sistema de interpretación, este mundo que ella crea” (Castoriadis 1986). 

2.3 La Autonomía en el  humor

Castoriadis (1986) compara el sí mismo de la sociedad con lo que Varela ha llamado la “autonomía” del ser viviente.  Nosotros nos permitimos relacionar el sí mismo social, con el humor. Los cuales comparten las siguientes características:
a)	La fijación de sus caracteres no poseen una base física, como el genoma, que pudiera garantizarles,  incluso probabilísticamente su conservación a través del tiempo y su transmisión. Su vigencia, difusión y permanencia, corresponden a otro tipo de factores, difusos y al parecer volubles.
b)	“Propiamente hablando, para la sociedad no existe el ruido. Cualquier cosa que aparezca, cualquier cosa que suceda en una sociedad, debe querer decir algo para ella; o, abiertamente, se le declarará sin sentido”. Así los chistes, tienen o no sentido, y cuando alguien cuenta alguno y no nos causa gracia buscamos el sentido de su gracia. Tendemos a escarbar el significado, nos empeñamos para hacerlo inteligible, o terminamos por desecharlo.
c)	La fabricación y elaboración de información se da como algo virtualmente ilimitado y  va más allá de cualquier caracterización funcional. 
d)	Su principio de conservación está en “la conservación de los atributos arbitrarios característicos de cada sociedad  sus significaciones imaginario sociales” (Castoriadis, 1998). 
e)	Las operaciones lógicas/físicas a través de las cuales se relacionan, organiza y utiliza, están siempre bajo la influencia de las significaciones imaginario sociales, las cuales son arbitrarias y diferentes entre sí, como si pertenecieran a sociedades distintas 
f)	“La sociedad, sin correlativos físicos, crea Ser en una forma masiva e indiscriminada: espíritus, dioses, pecados, virtudes, derechos del hombre, etc. y para ella este tipo de Ser tiene siempre un orden más alto que el físico puro” Castoriadis (1986). El humor, como hemos dicho, esta en el orden de lo imaginario, de lo masivo, de la creación, en un ámbito que va más allá de lo físico, que es incluido en algunos referentes pero no se circunscribe a él.
En las fábulas, los refranes (y en general, en todo el sentido del humor). El alto contenido de fondo moral que éstos ostentan, acerca de los valores, hábitos, costumbres, respetos, la cotidianidad que se manifiestan en sus moralejas, que son relatadas de una forma liviana “Una fábula seria no le gusta a nadie”. Sus contenidos son dichos en una forma que no es represiva, obligante, ni fastidiosa, se descubre una enseñanza, y la perciben en general como una buena manera de aprender. El humor, como referíamos antes, sin hacerlo de una forma explícita, evidente, abre un poco su espectro e indica ciertos parámetros, ciertos caminos, de una manera casi sublime. En una moraleja hay pues un mensaje de fondo que tiene como propósito guiar a la gente, a través de una crítica que, si bien puede ser muy hiriente en el caso de las ironías o del “humor negro”, en general es “manejable”, a través de una crítica con refranes, a través de una crítica con humor. Las personas que los usan están indicando un camino que se puede observar, y que no es tan severa la crítica a cuando se hace de forma directa. La obra humorística entonces da cuenta de un valor moral. Sin embargo, en el humorista, no se habla de que existan valores distintos, ni costumbres y creencias que los aparten mucho del resto de los mortales. Se dice que existe cierta tendencia a ser gente de oposición, de “izquierda”, o de una “moral liberal” lo cual tiene mucha relación con el papel del humor como opositor al “sistema”.Lo cual de cuenta de una alta relación de moralidad que existe en el humorista. Entonces, como tendencia, si podemos ver esa conexión del humorista con una realidad que no pretende cambiar permanentemente, pero que la denuncia de una manera muy particular, y logra con ello elevarnos para observarla en perspectiva y bromear con sus significados.
De aquí se deriva el nexo del humor que se desprende del magma de representaciones  imaginario sociales. 

Para Castoriadis (1986), la sociedad no existe sin el mito y para la sociedad, “el mito es esencialmente una forma de revestir de sentido al mundo y a la vida que está dentro del mundo; porque, de otra manera, ambos carecerían de sentido”. El humor podríamos verlo, bajo esta perspectiva, como una derivación del mito, porque también es una forma de revestir el mundo y a la vida que contiene, en este sentido holográmico ya mencionado. Es decir, el humor como una condensación de una realidad humana de significación, que aunque no necesariamente es universal como en el mito, si es común al grupo social. 

2.4 Las Dimensiones conjuntista-identitaria e imaginaria en el humor

Castoriadis (1986) afirma que la institución de la sociedad, y las significaciones imaginario sociales que tienen que ver con ella, se despliegan siempre en dos dimensiones que no pueden dejar de asociarse. La dimensión conjuntista-identitaria, grupo teórico-lógico, y la estricta y propiamente imaginaria. 
“En la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria la sociedad funciona, actúa y piensa a través de/en elementos, clases, propiedades y relaciones establecidas como distintas y definitivas. En esto, el esquema más importante es el de la determinación. Entonces, lo que se necesita es que todo lo que sea concebible se vea a través de la determinación, y las consecuencias o implicaciones de esto también. Desde este punto de vista, la existencia es la calidad de lo determinado.En la propia dimensión imaginaria, la existencia es significación. Pero, aunque no puedan ser señaladas, las significaciones no están determinadas. Se relacionan entre sí a través de una forma básica de reenvío, representación, el cual implica también una cuasi equivalencia y una cuasi pertenencia. Funciona la mayor parte de las veces a través de un quid pro quo, x en vez de y, que, en casos no triviales, es arbitrario, es decir, instituido. Este quid pro quo es el meollo de lo que el autor llamó ‘relación signitiva’; es decir, de la relación entre el signo y aquello de lo cual es signo el signo, y que es la base del lenguaje. No existe una razón necesaria o suficiente para que ‘perro’ esté en lugar de ‘canis’ o para que ‘siete’ tenga algo que ver con ‘Dios’. Pero la relación quid pro quo va más allá del propio lenguaje.” 
En éste la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria corresponde a lo que Castoriadis llama ‘código’. Lo propio de la dimensión imaginaria se manifiesta a sí misma a través de lo que él llamó lengua (langue). Así, en determinado contexto, pertenecen al código frases como: “Dame el martillo”. En cambio, pertenecen a la lengua oraciones como: “Senté a la belleza en mis rodillas y la sentí amarga y la injurié”. La diferencia entre código y lengua, más generalmente, entre la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria y la propia dimensión de lo imaginario, no es, desde luego, una diferencia de esencia, sino de uso y manejo. Las dos dimensiones son, para usar una metáfora topológica, impenetrables; en el lenguaje y en la vida social. Esto quiere decir que, arbitrariamente, cerca de cualquier punto del lenguaje hay un elemento que pertenece a la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria y también hay un elemento que pertenece a la dimensión de lo imaginario. El humor es un reflejo creativo de esta bidimensionalidad, en él lo interesante y el objetivo es evidenciar en y a través del código, el imaginario. Cada juego de palabras quiere exponer, en el humor, a manera de reflejo impúdico lo que a su grupo concierne. Así, sin tapujos se desvela lo obsceno de lo político, de las creencias, de la subjetividad, de las costumbres, de las miserias, la idiosincrasia, de lo obvio, de las catástrofes y de la muerte misma. En suma, de lo que es propiamente la red de representaciones imaginario sociales (magma). 

2.5 Carácter social-histórico del humor

Así, en una sociedad, las significaciones de lo imaginario social presentan un tipo de organización desconocida, hasta la fecha, en otros campos. A este tipo de organización Castoriadis (1998) lo llamó magma. El magma contiene grupos—incluso un número indefinido de ellos--, pero no es reducible a grupos o sistemas de grupos, aunque éstos sean ricos y complejos. Incluso no puede volverse a constituir analíticamente, es decir, por medio de las categorías y operaciones de los grupos teóricos. El orden social y la organización no son reducibles a las acostumbradas nociones matemáticas, físicas e incluso biológicas de orden y organización, al menos como han sido concebidos hasta ahora. 
Declara el mismo autor, que lo social histórico crea un nuevo tipo ontológico de orden, unidad, coherencia y diferenciación organizada. No se crea de una vez y por todas, un nuevo tipo de orden ontológico, característico del género sociedad. Sino que, en cualquier momento, este tipo de orden se materializa a través de diversas formas, cada una de las cuales encarna en una creación, en un nuevo eidos de la sociedad. El humor tampoco es estático, sino que evoluciona, muta se transforma, se recrea. Un ejemplo de ello son la adaptación de los chistes sexistas como el que sigue: 

Versión 1: José que tu mujer te pone los cuernos// Pero compadre, que vergüenza, pobre hombre que fiasco se ha de haber dado.

Versión 2: María siéntate, tengo que darte una noticia terrible… Tu marido te engaña// María contesta “No me digas eso,  pobre chica la aburrida que se llevará”

o como los estos:
¿Por qué se necesita un millón de espermatozoides para fertilizar un óvulo?
Porque no les gusta preguntar direcciones. 

¿Qué haces si una mujer te arroja un seguro de granada?
¡Corre, seguramente tiene la granada en la boca!  


El humor sexista con un discurso de hegemonía masculina, deriva tras el feminismo en un sexismo contrapuesto, igual de hegemónico, en un movimiento de contraataque. Evidenciando esta capacidad adaptativa en el humor, reflejo de los contextos socio-históricos. 
 
“El humor no sólo tiene algo de liberador, como el chiste y lo cómico, sino también algo de grandioso y de patético, rasgos estos que no se encuentran en las dos clases de ganancia de placer derivada de una actividad intelectual (...) lo grandioso reside en el triunfo del narcisismo, en la inatacabilidad del yo triunfante aseverada. El yo rehusa sentir las afrentas que le ocasiona la realidad; rehusa dejarse constreñir al sufrimiento...” 

Es decir, que el humor asume el encargo de guiar al “yo” que sufre, en los embates de una realidad que podría parecer aplastante. El humor no es conformista, no es “resignado”, se opone a las circunstancias reales, es capaz de afirmarse ante lo desfavorable y además de obtener placer por ello. A diferencia de la comicidad, el humor no es sólo alivio, no sólo libera lo reprimido. Hace elevar al humorista desde una visión en perspectiva. Es como distanciarse y decir “Véanlo: ese es el mundo que parece tan peligroso. Un juego de niños, bueno nada más que para bromear sobre él” (Freud, 1976b). El “super yo” sería la instancia psíquica que para éste autor consolaría al yo y lo pondría a salvo del sufrimiento: 

“(…) la esencia del humor consiste en ahorrarse los afectos a que habría dado ocasión la situación y en saltarse mediante una broma la posibilidad de tales exteriorizaciones de sentimiento.” 

Entonces sería comprensible el por qué el humor tiene un toque de genialidad que supera las antinomias, que afronta las desigualdades de una manera singular.

Siguiendo de nuevo a Castoriadis, quien dice: “En resumidads cuentas: lo viejo entra en lo nuevo con la significación que éste le da a aquel, y no podría ser de otra manera, […] lo que estaba en lo viejo está, de una manera o de otra, preparando lo nuevo o relacionándose con él”. En relación a esto, el mismo autor refiere que “basta recordar como, desde hace siglos, las ideas o los elementos griegos o cristianos han sido continuamente redescubiertos y remodelados, reinterpretados, en el mundo occidental para conformar lo que equivocadamente se llama las necesidades y que, en realidad, es el esquema imaginario del presente. Esta sociedad se cuestiona su propia institución, su representación del mundo, su representación imaginaria social”. Esto origina una transformación y renovación que hace posible, en el mismo lugar, encontrar sociedades con imaginarios diferenciados a la luz del tiempo. 
El humor se rebela contra ciertas cosas establecidas, situaciones “duras”, y también contra el estatus, contra normas o poderes constituidos que oprimen. De allí, la interesante relación que se establece entre el sistema y el humor, que tiene que ver directamente con el problema de la realidad “...lo rígido, lo fuerte de un tema algunas veces lo rompe el sentido del humor, te permite abordar las cosas con una dinámica más suave, se rompe una estructura de seriedad, de un patrón que a mi me parece además pesado”. O bien ésta otra frase más explícita: “el sentido del humor ha servido a través de toda la historia como una forma de proyectarse contra el sistema y de poderle sacar la lengua”.
Entonces, el humor no consiste simplemente en hacer más “digerible” la realidad, como sí lo hace la comicidad. El sentido del humor sería una forma de comprender la realidad, de abordarla. El poder jugar con los significados y transformarlos, descubrir o construir significados que permitan contra-atacar una realidad que parecía irreversible, otorga una “fuerza” que permite levantarse de la situación “aplastante”. El humor luce entonces incontestable. Lo curioso es que en el humor, se colocan en el tapete cosas que por obvias, por evidentes, por naturalizadas, o quizás por el miedo que producen, no se nombran, no se cuestionan, o no se observan. Uno de los entrevistados, se refirió al humor como “El arte de decir la verdad sin darle chance de defenderse a la mentira”.

Castoriadis (1998) explica que “aparte de la existencia de instituciones que se dan en todas las partes de la sociedad, y significaciones imaginario sociales que se dan en cualquier parte de la sociedad, y de algunas cosas sin importancia, no hay nada esencial que sea común, digamos, entre una moderna sociedad capitalista y una sociedad primitiva. Y, si lo que dije anteriormente se sostiene, no existe, y no puede existir, ninguna ley o proceso determinante por el cual una determinada forma de sociedad podría producir otra, o al menos ser la causa de que apareciera. Los intentos de hacer derivar las formas sociales de las condiciones físicas, de los antecedentes o de las características permanentes del hombre, son peores que fracasos: carecen de sentido. En esto, la ontología y la lógica heredadas no tienen esperanza: están obligadas a Ignorar el propio ser de lo social histórico. Pero ‘creación’ no sólo es una mala palabra para la ontología y la lógica. También es inevitable llegar a preguntar: ¿creación por parte de quién? Pero la creación, al igual que el trabajo de lo socialimaginario, de la sociedad instituyente (societas instituans, no sociedad instituta), es el modo de ser del campo de lo social histórico, a través de los medios del cual este campo es, La sociedad es autocreación, desplegada como la historia. Para aceptar y dejar de hacer preguntas sin sentido sobre sujetos y sustancias, o sobre causas, se necesita, para estar seguro, una radical conversión ontológica […]  Las nuevas formas socio-históricas, surgen de la creación. Directa o indirectamente hemos sido testigos del surgimiento de las nuevas formas social históricas: por ejemplo, la creación de la polis democrática en la antigua Grecia; o, más de cerca, del capitalismo occidental. En cada uno de estos casos hay muchas cosas significativas por decir y un trabajo interminable por realizar, acerca de las condiciones que preceden y rodean ese surgimiento. Se puede elucidar esos procesos; pero no explicarlos. Su explicación vincularía tanto los significados a los no-significados, lo cual no tiene sentido; como la reducción de todos los magmas de significaciones que aparecen en la historia a varias combinaciones de nuevos elementos de significación que han estado presentes desde el comienzo de la historia humana—lo cual es, obviamente, imposible (y otra vez nos llevaría a hacer la pregunta; ¿cómo surgieron estos elementos primarios?”. 

Para tomar un ejemplo concreto y explicativo: consideremos el surgimiento del humor, no se observa una producción al azar de un gran número de variedades sociales, ni la eliminación de todas, menos una, por inadecuadas, ni la elección de un tipo de humor por ser la única forma social adecuada que vale la pena. Lo que se observa es el surgimiento de una nueva significación social imaginaria: la ilimitada expansión del dominio de lo racional de estos factores al producir una forma, el chiste contado de boca en boca, la cual no fue planeado por un actor que pueda ser señalado o un grupo de actores y la cual, ciertamente, no podría ser construida a través de una imprevista asamblea de elementos preexistentes. Estos elementos y estos factores entran en el humorismo de una sociedad sólo si, y cuando, pueden ser utilizados por ella o cuando llegan a convertirse en su instrumento, por decirlo de alguna manera, hacia la esfera humorística de significaciones y por lo tanto les sea otorgado un nuevo sentido. 

Muñiz (1994)   en su descripción teórica, nos dice que el humor desde la biología revela enigmas: no tiene un sentido específico, y no pareciera tener un alto valor utilitario. La risa que provoca es un reflejo que no tiene “propósito” biológico, más que el de aliviar o relajar tensiones. Tampoco pareciera contribuir a nuestra supervivencia, aunque el valor social del humor puede tener influencia diferencial sobre las personas y sus ocupaciones. Pero también agrega que el humor es una actividad creativa de alto nivel de complejidad y abstracción. 

El humor se trata en el fondo de imágenes y de experiencias significativas expresadas en símbolos de un texto que  pueden ser palabras, imágenes, dibujos, gesticulaciones u otra forma de expresión. Lo humorístico, denota una propiedad compleja: no es un asunto de estructuras sino de interacciones de significado entre personas que provienen de comunidades, que poseen una historia, que atribuyen sentidos a su realidad (Maffesoli, op. cit), que imaginan, actúan, proyectan deseos a lo que consideran debe ser la misma, personas que van configurando relaciones entre lo originado y lo originante que ellas mismas originan, o al menos tratan de originar.





3. Conclusiones.

El humor es una reflexión, se basa en buscar sentidos y dejar la mente libre que fluya y que juegue con los conceptos que pueden pasar como inapercibidos por ser ya internalizados a nivel inconciente. De tal manera, el humor saca al nivel conciente las practicas sociales que internalizamos sin tener una razón, sino porque pertenecemos a una delimitación espacio temporal que nos impide que nos conformemos con las reglas y normas sociales sin cuestionarlos.
Viéndolo desde esta perspectiva, el humor es una practica social, basada en una narrativa subjetiva que desborda los limites lógicos y/o impuestos como norma social, con el papel de defensa, socialización, buscar sentidos para las cosas y para la existencia. 
 El análisis teórico y la etnografía que hicimos sobre la intertextualidad entre imaginario social y sentido del humor (como artefacto social) subraya la relación entre yo y otros como una relación  dinámica, dependiente del espacio geográfico y la delimitaciones histórico-socio-culturales. 
En la presentación se menciono la relación entre la inteligencia y el humor. También el hecho de que en tu propia lengua en más fácil hacer chistes con cómico de lenguaje y que tengan sentido por los demás. Con esto quiero subrayar el hecho de que en humor, bajo cualquier forma (cómico de situación, de personaje, lenguaje, etc.) juega con los símbolos y conceptos socialmente construidos. 
Desde este punto de vista podemos ver al humorista como “etnógrafo” o “artesano” en construir y resignificar la realidad. El es flexible a la dinámica social, se adapta y por moldear la materia como a un artesano le salen distintas formas de expresarse. La relación de comunicación con los demás se basa en mostrar distintas formas de ver las cosas. Es decir de un punto común, un concepto se esta construyendo una narrativa subjetiva, pero esta tiene sentido en un determinada delimitación espacio-temporal. 
¿Porque aparece esta delimitación? Los ejemplos que me vienen en la mente son: maneras de percibir el concepto de belleza, de la familia, etc. en imaginarios sociales distintos. Estamos viendo las mismas cosas y podemos entenderlo de manera distinta según el bagaje de informaciones que tenemos. Esto puede pasar aun en la misma cultura, pero cuando hay también otras maneras de codificar y decodificar las practicas sociales y sus artefactos el problema es mas  complejo. 
Hablamos de códigos de los imaginarios propios o de los propios imaginarios o de otros. Es suficiente ver el la codificaciones que hay en el lenguaje utilizando las gafas de un lingüista o antropólogo o psicólogo, ya aparecen una perspectivas bastante interesantes que sabemos pero nunca nos ocurrió pensarlo de esa manera.
Vuelvo a la relación entre inteligencia y humor porque es importante subrayar –según lo hicimos antes en el trabajo- que el segundo necesita un nivel alto de complejidad y abstracción. Mencione esto porque el humor es un juego que maneja con los significados, símbolos y la lógica. Es en juego de significar y resignificar según la lógica del codificación-decodificación del lenguaje (mira grafico).
 Por ejemplo, en un comercial que dan ahora en la televisión se dice: “una lección divertida nunca se olvida, dicen los psicólogos, pedagogos y padres”. Si, estamos de acuerdo, pero ojo a la codificación-recodificación (sobre todo si lo usas en otro imaginario), porque pueden aparecer diferencias causadas por distintos variables: lenguaje, entorno social, educación, histórico-socio-cultural, económico, etc.  

Vuelvo a la importancia social del humor como artefacto social, porque este es un tipo que tiene una dinámica histórica bastante interesante: no base física, se basa en la disipación social, no tiene origen y tampoco se le impide. Cuando escuchamos una broma no pensamos: ¿Quien lo hizo? ¿Cuando? ¿Donde? No, solo reímos y (sub)entendemos el idea. Pero también es importante subrayar que la difusión y permanencia son tan subjetivas como el objeto en si y que depende de factores bastante volubles.
El humor como las maneras de ver el mundo, de observarlo o percibirlo se encuentra precisamente en las interacciones cotidianas como por ejemplo en los juegos de palabras, las alusiones a determinados acontecimientos conocidos por todos o en metáforas de la vida cotidiana…
Las prácticas que desarrolle cada sujeto están en función del interés o ilusión por participar en este campo manteniendo, cambiando o intentando cambiar su posición dentro de él. 
No obstante, para que estas prácticas se instituyan como estrategias Bourdieu apela al habitus, que es lo que genera prácticas individuales dando a la conducta esquemas de percepción, pensamiento y acción y es lo que nos permitirá conectar lo individual con lo social. 
Normalmente el agente expresa su habitus de clase o grupo a través de un determinado habitus lingüístico: interés por decir determinadas cosas y una determinada manera y capacidad para hablar en un determinado contexto.  Es decir, si los aplicamos al humor nos podemos encontrar con situaciones en las que un parlante estándar para llamar la atención, producir buenas comunicación, buen entendimiento, y por qué no incluso respeto en determinados momentos, cambia su registro y se identifica con el receptor para gastarle una broma, utilizando una jerga graciosa, etc.
Por tanto, el habitus nos permite entender como una determinada comunicación entre diferentes sujetos está determinada por la internalización de la posición que ocupa en la estructura social. 
De esta manera vemos como se configuran mercados lingüísticos con discursos estilísticamente caracterizados (Bourdieu, 85) [2], lo que condiciona racionalmente, según los propósitos individuales, cómo elegimos dirigirnos a terceros.
Después del proceso de codificación y decodificación de los conceptos estamos de acuerdo con la teoría de Castoriadis según la cual el humor es un proceso dinámico de resignificación que es flexible al entorno social.
Como conclusión y para motivar la elección del sentido del humor quiero mencionar que el concepto elegido es producto de un imaginario social colectivo que crea un imaginario colectivo. De tal manera como hay la destilación de las practicas y normas sociales, que se construyen y tienen sentido en una cierta delimitación espacio-temporal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Life Classification'''

=='''Concept'''==
Lifeforms ('''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/O|organisms]]''') are '''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/C|classified]]''' into groups to create a '''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/H|hierarchy]]''' of life.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=60%&gt;The hierarchy of life has many divisions in it.  The basic divisions are as follows:
*Domain
**Kingdom
***Phylum
****Class
*****Order
******Family
*******Genus
********Species

==Examples==

==='''The Five Kingdoms'''===

All life can be classified under one of five kingdoms.

*Kingdom: [[Middle School Science/Biology/Bacteria|Bacteria]]
*Kingdom: Protista ([[Middle School Science/Biology/Protists|Protists]])
*Kingdom: [[Middle School Science/Biology/Fungi|Fungi]]
*Kingdom: Plantae ([[Middle School Science/Biology/Plants|Plants]])
*Kingdom: Animalia ([[Middle School Science/Biology/Animals|Animals]])

===Classification of Humans===
Humans are living things and therefore can be classified into this hierarchy.

''''''Human Classification''':'''
*'''Kingdom:''' Animilia (animals)
**'''Phylum:''' Chordata (animals with a vertebrate)
***'''Class:''' Mammalia (mammals)
****'''Order:''' Primates
*****'''Family:''' Hominidae (human-like)
******'''Genus:''' Homo
*******'''Species:''' sapiens

Scientifically, the human species is identified as ''Homo sapiens''.

==Expository Text==
Think of all the different animals that you can.  Make a list of all the ones that you know about--cats, dogs, elephants, giraffes, lions, tigers, bears, bugs.  Now add to the list all of the plants that you can think of--pine trees, palm trees, carrots, apples trees, lettuce, cactus, grass.  Combining these will create a long list of things is hard to look at and even harder to study from.  There are more than 1.5 million species of '''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/O|organisms]]''' that have been identified by scientists.  In order to study all of these organisms, scientists have put them into different categories, in other words, they ''classify'' them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wort Boiling==

===With Malt Extract===
Heat the wort to boiling uncovered, adding any brewing salts (gypsum, et al.) at this point.  Remove from the heat source and add 1 or 2 cups of malt extract, stir until completely dissolved and return the wort to a boil.  The boil does not need to be too aggressive.  The [[hot break]] usually occurs during the first 5 to 15 minutes of the boil.

After 10 minutes, make the first (&quot;bittering&quot; or &quot;boiling&quot;) hop addition.  Begin timing your hour boil at this time.  Continue to add hops at the intervals specified in your recipe.  Be sure to remove your hops from the refrigerator several hours before brewing so that they may come up to room temperature before adding to the kettle.

Boil for 45 minutes and add 1/2 teaspoon of Irish moss.  If using a immersion wort chiller, place the unit in the kettle now to allow 15 minutes of boiling for sterilization.

Continue to boil for 15 minutes.

Once again remove the kettle from the heat source, and add the remaining extract and adjunct sugars (if any) to the wort and stir to dissolve thoroughly and completely.  The temperature should drop to about 170°F.

Allow the hot wort to remain at this temperature for about 10 minutes to sanitize the extract and sugars.

Cool the wort by any or all of the following methods:
* Begin the flow of cold water through an [[Brewing/Boiling/Immersion Chiller|immersion chiller]]
* Add ice which was previously made by filling sterilized 1- or 2-litre PET (soda) bottles with water that had been boiled, allowed to freeze, and the plastic bottle cut off
* Place the brew kettle in a sink filled with ice water.

Siphon the wort into your fermenter, leaving the hot break, cold break, hops and other sediment in the kettle.  Top up to the volume desired for fermentation.  Aerate the wort well for 5 minutes.

Pitch the yeast when the temperature of the wort has dropped below 80°F (ideally around 76°F).

If dry hopping, wet the hops with a small amount of hot water (in effect making a quarter cup of &quot;hop tea&quot;) before adding them to the cold fermenter.  This will allow the aromatic oils to more easily dissolve out of the hops.

===Hop Additions===
Hops are added into the wort during the boil to extract the bitterness from the hops. 

'''Bittering hops'''
Adding the hops at the start of the boil maximises the amount of bitterness extracted from the hops. The hops added at the start of boil contribute mainly to the bitterness of the beer, however the aromatic compounds are very soon boiled off and so these hops do not contribute much to the hop aroma of the beer.

'''Aroma hops'''
The hops added towards the end of the boil retain more of the volatile aromatic compounds and this results in a beer with more hop aroma. But because of the short time the hops are boiled - not much bitterness is extracted.


===Adjunct additions===
During wort boiling sugar or syrup adjuncts may be added. The adjunct needs to be added so that enough time is given for the adjunct to be dissolved and sterilised.

      <comment>Changed &quot;two&quot; to &quot;several&quot;, and eliminated &quot;, or&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Diagnostic skills are not taught in automotive schools or books as much as in the past, for several reasons.  First, it is often more efficient for a mechanic to remove and replace a part than to try to repair that part.  Second, the parts themselves are not made to be repaired as much as in the past.  Granted, the time it would take to repair a transmission may be far more than it would be to replace the transmission, so it may be a more efficient system overall.  However, the modern way does have its disadvantages--one of them being less ability to diagnose.  In one case, a customer was nearly charged $3000 to replace the transmission in a pickup truck when the problem was a bad spark plug (the plug was not firing properly so the engine computer would downshift looking for more power and would then be told to upshift again because the RPMs were too high).  Knowing how to really track down the problem can save you a lot of money.

There are several approaches to diagnosing a problem:
1) using a repair manual
2) relying on your own analysis
3) using the experiences of others with the same problem.
I suggest grabbing a repair manual until you know more.  As you repair with the guidance of a manual, you will develop an 'intuition' that will guide you to problems.  This process won't happen on its own, however--you have to be hungry for it.

The first step in any diagnosis is to gather information.  Use your senses and ask questions: when does the car make that noise?  What does it sound like?  How does it feel?  Where is the sound coming from?  Does it happen at all speeds?  Does the car do anything at all?

The second step in diagnosis is to grab a manual armed with that information and look for the troubleshooting charts.  I believe that factory manuals have great information, but are not as novice-friendly as the manuals from the auto parts stores.  For my own vehicles, I try to get the factory manual (for the most authoritative information) as well as the Haynes (or similar) manual.  If you only get one, maybe just the Haynes.

Please note that advanced mechanics will often not need this step, as the problems will be obvious to them.  After doing enough repairs, the different systems fit together and do not seem foreign, separate, confusing, or threatening.

&lt;H1&gt;Holden / Opel / Vauxhall Astra &lt;/H1&gt;

Symtoms diagnostics and repairs for common faults of the Astra Mk3 C14NZ engine. Refer to a Haynes Manual for details concerning the actual repair.

{{subject|Automobile_Repair/Diagnostics}}==Astra Engine temperature erratic usually low==
This is usually caused by the thermostat stuck open. Either luckily or by design thermostats usually fail safe - open.  On a C14NZ the thermostat is behind the camshaft belt casing and requires the camshaft belt and pulleys to be removed so it cannot be easily tested. New thermostats are remarkably cheap from generic parts supplier, and can be fitted in the upper radiator hose as an alternative to their proper placement. Haynes does not describe this procedure. Remember to fit the thermostat the correct way around,, that is with the longer piece facing the engine.

==Astra Engine temperature high, electric fan not running==
First check the fuse. Fuse # 11. 
Second test the Cooling fan thermostatic switch. Removing this will let all the coolant out, observe safety precautions described in the Haynes manual - cool engine and catch coolant. The switch often fails open circuit, use a continuity tester to check if switch closes when heated in a pan of water just before boiling point.

Thirdly check that 12Volts is being supplied to the fan motor, if not, broken wires can be the cause. Lastly prepare to replace the fan assembly, remove it and check it before buying a new one.

==Astra Engine misfires at low revs==
Symptoms such as misfires and stalls until engine is running at &gt; 3000 RPM and even then runs rough. 
Firstly check the spark plugs for excessively large gaps, eroded electrode or dirt. Replace if necessary.
Otherwise on the C14NZ engine this is often caused by oil in the distributor cap. The distributor is mounted horizontally on the end of the camshaft and the oil seal allows small amounts of oil into the distributor that then causes short circuits.
This can be cured during the early stages by wiping the inside of the distributor cap with a clean rag. Later stages of deterioration burn carbon tracks in the cap and these can be cleaned off, but a new cap is required. If a lot of oil leaks into the distributor the whole unit has to be replaced, it is not possible to buy component parts of the distributor.

==Astra Engine falters or stalls==
The C14NZ engine may run for long periods and then it falters and perhaps stalls.  In many cases it will restart and run normally for a while. This fault is infuriating if the period between failures is weeks since you can never be sure that the problem is fixed and it can be caused by numerous faults.
First check the failure mode, if the rev counter drops to zero before the engine stops it is most likely to be the Engine Control Unit or the crankshaft position sensor.  The C14NZ ECU is pretty robust and the CPS is more lightly to fail. Surprisingly the CPS can be intermittent, but it will eventually fail completely. It is simple to change, but cannot be bought as an individual component.
If the rev counter continues to reflect the engine speed the problem is in the High Tension circuit, most likely the plug leads.

==Astra Engine idles erratically ==
The C14NZ engine should run at 600 RPM at idle, if it hunts, increases in speed and then may cut out completely, first check the air filter is in good condition. Otherwise the most likely fault is the hose pipe between the Multec CFI single port injection system and the MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor. Check the pipe has not come loose or been damaged.

==Astra Engine misfires under full throttle==
Engine runs normally under light load but misfires at full throttle. 
Firstly check the condition of the spark plugs.
Then look for signs of a rich mixture, check fuel consumption. An over-rich mixture can be due to a broken Coolant Temperature Sensor or wiring. The sensor operates the dashboard temperature gauge, check readings are sensible. A broken sensor failure is the equivalent of running with the choke on. The ECU thinks the engine is cold. The sensor connector is exposed and rather insecure. The sensor should read about 1600 Ohms at room temperature. See Haynes manual for replacement procedure.

==Astra 5 speed manual gearbox, cannot select 2nd gear==
Usually caused by a worn gear linkage. Inside the engine compartment, the top side to side link is made of plastic and seems to be the &quot;weak link&quot;. With an assistant in the car, have them try to select 2nd gear, if there is side to side play replace the link. This is not described in the Haynes Manual - details follow.
&lt;H1&gt;Jeep Cherokee XJ / Grand Cherokee &lt;/H1&gt; the whole sentence listed above has unconfirmed datas

==Cherokee Diagnostic Trouble Code 11==
DTC 11 on the 4.0L Inline 6 MPI &quot;Power Tech HO&quot; (High Output) engine indicates a fault with the CPS (Crankshaft Position Sensor). The Haynes manual describes the electrical checks to diagnose a faulty unit before purchasing and fitting a replacement.

The CPS on the 4.0 Liter automatic uses one 11mm (*) bolt, the manual uses two. Access is possible from the underside of the engine. The sensor is mounted on the back of the clutch bell housing with little clearance between it and the bulkhead. It can be felt but not seen from underneath the vehicle, and seen but not accessed from the top of the engine. Use a socket with an omni directional extension and a couple of straight extensions so that the ratchet is free of the bodywork. The torque setting is fairly low, and once the socket is in place removal does not require much effort.
Replacing the sensor is more difficult, the bolt must be started in its thread by hand and there is barely enough room to use your thumb. Use the socket and extensions to tighten to the correct torque setting.

(* on a Feb 97 UK spec manual the bolt heads mike up at 10.7mm across flats so there's a bit of slack. If not corroded in they come out easily enough using an 11mm socket, as did the one I measured. I don't know whether there is a special tool in exactly the right size to prevent rounding off the hex, but I still have one that's seized in to sort... TS)

==Cherokee Coolant leaks underneath the manifolds==
The 4.0L Inline 6 MPI &quot;Power Tech HO&quot; engine may develop coolant leaks when the engine core plugs become corroded. Corrosion is often caused by running the engine without anti-freeze or corrosion inhibitors in the cooling system. 

Access to the front core plug is possible without removing the manifold. Remove the core plug by locating the weaker corroded part and puncturing it with a center punch or a screwdriver. The core plug is made of fairly soft material, but be very careful not to push the plug into the engine block, if this happens the manifold will have to be removed to recover it. Once the core plug is pierced with the screwdriver lever it out until an edge is exposed and then use a Mole grip to remove it.

Refit using a socket that fits the new core plug loosely, 32 mm or similar. Ensure that the core plug is square on the engine block, add sufficient socket extension bars so that they are free of the manifold and the push it using a large piece of wood as a lever. Once the core plug is engaged feel it to check that it is square, if so drive it in with a shorter extension and a hammer (be sure to use a solid steel hammer, not a sand filled or lead &quot;dead blow&quot; type, as the impact of these hammer types is not sufficient to drive in the frost plug), if not use use a smaller socket to drive one side rather than the other to square it up. Stop when the core plug flange is flush with the engine block.
Refill the cooling system with rust inhibitor and anti-freeze.

Frost plug sizes are 2&quot;, except certain 1987 Renix models which have both 2&quot; as well as 1&quot; frost plugs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About This Book ==
This book is intended to be a complete replacement for science books in middle school (ages 12-15).  Each section should be set up as a module that can be used independently of other modules.
&lt;br&gt;
Although there are many other informational textbooks, many are very complex and not suited for middle school students.
&lt;br&gt;
Many of the textbooks that are online lack resrouces for teachers.  The purpose of this Wikibook is to provide teachers quiz and test questions, worksheets, and labs or activities to use in the classroom.

== Basic Module Format ==
The modules for each section should follow this basic format

* '''Concept''': This is the basic idea of what this section is about.  Each page should have a short concept that consists of clear, easy-to-understand sentences.

* '''Examples:''' To keep the concepts as clear as possible, put all examples explaining that concept into this section.  This section is intended to be added to and exapanded the most.

* '''Optional module sections:'''
** '''History:''' A brief history of the concept, such as how it was discovered, or how it was developed.
** '''Review Questions:''' Include questions that would be good for a test or quiz
** '''Activities/Labs:''' Include activities that can that might help students understand this concept.

==Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence==

As White, you still have designs on playing f4, but Black with his knight sortie has challenged your control of d5. Should you fight back, or ignore this distraction?

:[[/3. f4/]]: White has had enough of Black's e-pawn, and feels an open f-file would be useful in his later attack. 

:[[/3. Bc4/]]: White again restrains himself from the committal f4 and places another piece where it controls d5. With a little co-operation from Black, White may now head towards one of the most terrifying opening positions yet discovered...

Less critical alternatives are:

:[[/3. a3/]]: the Mengarini Variation, preventing Bb4, but this bishop has at least one other good square. 

:[[/3. d3/]]: Having challenged Black to some old-fashioned fisticuffs, White sadistically transposes to a solid King's Indian Attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== An Overview of GCC Architecture ===

This section is based on a Red Hat magazine article {{ref|rh_magazine}}.

GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) comprises a number of compilers for different programming languages. The main GCC executable '''gcc''' processes source files written in C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, Fortran, or Ada and produces an assembly file for each source file. It is a driver program that invokes the appropriate compilation programs depending on the language of the source file. For a C source file they are the preprocessor and compiler '''cc1''', the assembler '''as''', and the linker '''collect2'''. The first and the third programs come with a GCC distribution, the assembler is a part of the GNU binutils package. This book describes the internals of the preprocessor and compiler '''cc1'''.

Each compiler includes the following three components: a front end, a middle end, and a back end. GCC compiles one file at a time. A source file goes through all three components one after another. [[:Image:Gcc.JPG|Figure 1]] illustrates the components and the source file representations associated with each component.

[[Image:Gcc.JPG|center|frame|GCC front end, middle end, and back end with source file representations.]]

The purpose of the front end is to read the source file, parse it, and convert it into the standard ''abstract syntax tree (AST)'' representation. There is one front end for each programming language. Because of the differences in languages, the format of the generated ASTs is slightly different for each language. The next step after AST generation is the unification step in which the AST tree is converted into a unified form called generic. After this, the middle end part of the compiler takes control. First, the tree is converted into another representation called ''GIMPLE''. In this form, each expression contains no more than three operands, all control flow constructs are represented as combinations of conditional statements and goto operators, arguments of a function call can only be variables, etc. [[:Image:gccinternals-img2.png|Figure 2]] illustrates the differences between a tree in generic form and a tree in GIMPLE form. GIMPLE is a convenient representations for optimizing the source code.


After GIMPLE, the source code is converted into the ''static single assignment (SSA)'' representation. The central idea of this form is the fact that each variable is assigned to only once, but can be used at the right hand side of an expression many times. Every time the same variable of a tree in the GIMPLE form is reassigned, the compiler creates a new version of that variable and stores the new value into it. When the same variable is assigned to in both branches of a conditional expression, one needs to merge the two possible values of the variable into a single variable. This operation is denoted as PHI function in the SSA form.


The SSA form is also used for optimizations. GCC performs more than 20 different optimizations on SSA trees. After the SSA optimization pass, the tree is converted back to the GIMPLE form which is then used to generate a ''register-transfer language (RTL)'' form of a tree. RTL is a hardware-based representation that corresponds to an abstract target architecture with an infinite number of registers. An RTL optimization pass optimizes the tree in the RTL form. Finally, a GCC back-end generates the assembly code for the target architecture using the RTL representation. Examples of back-ends are x86 back end, mips back end, etc.

In the next sections we describe the internals of the C front end and the x86 back end. The compiler starts with its initialization and command line options processing. After that the C front end preprocesses the source file, parses it and performs a number of optimizations. The back end then generates the assembly code for the target platform and saves it to a file.

{{GCC_take_home|GCC is a compiler collection that consists of a front end for each programming language, a middle end, and a back end for each architecture. The main representations that each source file goes through are AST in front end, RTL in middle end, and the assembly representation in back end. GCC compiles one file at a time.}}

=== GCC Initialization ===

The C front end includes the C/C++ preprocessor and the C compiler. Program '''cc1''' includes both the preprocessor and C compiler. It compiles a C source file and generates an assembly (.S) file.

The compiler frontend and backend interact with each other using callback functions called language hooks. All hooks are included into a global variable struct lang_hooks lang_hooks that is defined in file langhooks.h. There are the following types of hooks: hooks for tree inlining, hooks for call graph, hooks for functions, hooks for tree dump, hooks for types, hooks for declarations, and language-specific hooks. The default values for the hooks are defined in file langhooks-def.h.

GCC initialization consists of command line option parsing, initializing the back end, creating the global scope, and initializing the built-in data types and functions.

Each declaration is associated with a scope. For example, a local variable is associated with its function's scope. A global declaration is associated with the global scope. 

Function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4674|toplev_main()}} is the function that processes the command-line options, initializes the compiler, compiles a file, and frees up the allocated resources. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|opts.c|477|decode_options()}} processes the command-line options and sets the corresponding variables within the compiler. 

Following the command line option parsing function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4621|do_compile()}} is called. It performs the back-end initialization by calling function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4487|backend_init()}}. After that, function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4519|lang_dependent_init()}} performs language-dependent initialization which includes the initialization of a front-end and a back-end. The C initialization function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-objc-common.c|154|c_objc_common_init()}} creates built-in data types, initializes the global scope and performs other initialization tasks. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-common.c|3043|c_common_nodes_and_builtins()}} creates pre-defined types described in file builtin-types.def. 

The standard C types are created at the initialization time. The following table presents several types:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC builtin types
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Variable Name
| C type
|- align=left
| char_type_node
| char
|-
| integer_type_node
| int
|-
| unsigned_type_node
| unsigned int
|-
| void_type_node
| void
|-
| ptr_type_node
| void*
|}

GCC built-in functions are the functions that are evaluated at compile time. For example, if the size argument of a strcpy() function is a constant then GCC replaces the function call with the required number of assignments. The compiler replaces standard library calls with built-in functions and then evaluates them once the function's AST is constructed. In case of strcpy(), the compiler checks the size argument and uses the optimized built-in version of strcpy() if the argument is constant. Builtin {{GCC_func|3_4|builtins.c|1444|builtin_constant_p()}} allows to find out if the value of its argument is known at compile time. GCC builtins are used beyond GCC. For example, the string processing library of Linux kernel uses builtin_constant_p() to invoke the optimized version of a string processing function if the string size is known at compile time. 

GCC evaluates each builtin function using a corresponding expand_builtin() function. For example, builtin_strcmp() is evaluated using {{GCC_func|3_4|builtins.c|3260|expand_builtin_strcmp()}}. The following table gives examples of GCC builtins:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC builtin functions
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Builtin Name
| Explanation
|- align=left
| builtin_constant_p
| returns true if the argument is a constant
|-
| builtin_memcpy
| equivalent to memcpy()
|-
| builtin_strlen
| equivalent to strlen()
|}


{{GCC_take_home|GCC initialization consists of command line option parsing, initializing the back end, creating the global scope, and initializing the built-in data types and functions.}}

=== C Preprocessor ===

Following the initialization, function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4621|do_compile()}} calls function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|1807|compile_file()}}. This function invokes parse_file() front-end language hook which is set to function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-opts.c|1205|c_common_parse_file()}} for C language. The latter function invokes function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-opts.c|1306|finish_options()}} which initializes the preprocessor and handles -D, -U, and -A command line options (which are equivalent to #define, #undef, and #assert respectively). The C preprocessor handles the preprocessor directives such as #define, #include in the source code.

Following the preprocessor initialization, {{GCC_func|3_4|c-parse.in|3767|c_parse_file()}} function is invoked. This function uses the standard lex/bison tools to parse the file. The preprocessor is implemented as a part of the lexer. The C language lexer function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-lex.c|433|c_lex()}} calls the libcpp function {{GCC_func|3_4|cppmacro.c|1038|cpp_get_token()}} which handles the preprocessor keywords. The state of the preprocessor is defined by variable {{GCC_func|3_4|c-common.c|46|cpp_reader *parse_in}}. Type {{GCC_func|3_4|cpphash.h|319|struct cpp_reader}} contains most importantly the list of text buffers being processed. Each buffer corresponds to a source file (.c or .h). Function {{GCC_func|3_4|cppmacro.c|1038|cpp_get_token()}} calls appropriate functions for legitimate preprocessor keywords. For example, when #include is encountered, function {{GCC_func|3_4|cpplib.c|672|do_include_common()}} is invoked. It allocates a new buffer and places it on top of the buffer stack making it the current buffer. When a new file is compiled the buffer is popped off the stack and the compilation of the old file continues.

Function {{GCC_func|3_4|cpplib.c|501|do_define()}} is called whenever a new macro is defined using #define keyword. 

{{GCC_take_home|The preprocessor takes care of the preprocessor directives, for example #include and #ifdef.}}

=== Source Code Parsing ===

After running the preprocessor GCC constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) for each function of the source file. An AST is a number of connected nodes of type {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|1768|struct tree}}. Each node has a ''tree code'' that defines the type of the tree. Macro {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|276|TREE_CODE()}} is used to refer to the code. Tree codes are defined in files {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|1|tree.def}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-common.def|1|c-common.def}}. Trees with different tree codes are grouped into ''tree classes''. The following tree classes are defined among others in GCC:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC tree classes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Tree Class
| Explanation
|- align=left
| 'd'
| declarations
|- 
| '&lt;'
| comparison
|- 
| '2'
| binary arithmetic
|}


There are two types of trees: ''statements'' and ''expressions''. Statements correspond to the C constructs, for example an expression followed by a ';', a conditional statement, a loop statement, etc. Expressions are what the statements are build up from. Examples of expressions are an assignment expression, an arithmetic expression, a function call, etc. Examples of tree codes are given in the following table:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC tree codes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Tree Code
| Tree Class
| Explanation
| Operands
|- align=left
| MODIFY_EXPR
| 'e'
| an assignment expression
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - left hand side; TREE_OPERAND(t,1) - right hand side;
|-
| CALL_EXPR
| 'e'
| function call
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - function definition; TREE_OPERAND(t,1) - function arguments;
|-
| FUNCTION_DECL
| 'd'
| variable declaration
| DECL_SOURCE_FILE(t) - source file; DECL_NAME(t) - variable name;
|-
| ARRAY_TYPE
| 't'
| array type
| TREE_TYPE(t) - type of an array element; TYPE_DOMAIN(t) - type of index;
|-
| DECL_STMT
| 'e'
| variable declaration
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - variable; DECL_INITIAL(TREE_OPERAND(t,1)) - initial value;

|}

In addition to the tree code that defines the type of the tree, a number of operands different for each tree type are available. For example, an assignment expression has two operands which correspond to the left and right sides of the expression. Macro {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|814|TREE_OPERAND}} is used to refer to the operands. Macro {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|745|IDENTIFIER_POINTER}} is used to find the name of an identifier that an {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|53|IDENTIFIER_NODE}} tree represents. The following table presents several tree nodes, their purpose, and their operands.

Each tree has a type that corresponds to the type of C expression that it represents For example, the type of the {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|425|MODIFY_EXPR}} node is the type of the left-hand side operand. {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|697|NOP_EXPR}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|692|CONVERT_EXPR}} trees are used for type casting.

Tree NULL_TREE is equivalent to NULL. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|print-tree.c|45|debug_tree()}} prints out the tree to stderr.

The parser is implemented as a bison grammar. The grammar invokes the GCC functions that construct the AST. When a new identifier is lexed, it is added to the pool of strings that GCC maintains. The tree code of an identifier is {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|53|IDENTIFIER_NODE}}. When the same identifier is lexed again, the same tree node is returned. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|stringpool.c|94|get_identifier()}} returns the tree node for an identifier. 

A new variable declaration is processed in a number of function calls. First, function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2493|start_decl()}} is called with the name of the declaration, its type as returned by the lexer, and its attributes. The function calls {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|3223|grokdeclarator()}} that checks the type and argument nodes and returns a tree with the code appropriate for the declaration: {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|280|VAR_DECL}} for variables, {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|280|TYPE_DECL}} for types, etc. The declarartion is then added to the ''scope''. A scope contains all declarations created within a function, but does not contain global declarations. There is also the global scope that contains global declarations. When a function is parsed, its declarations are attached to its body as a {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|69|BLOCK}} node. When a declaration is created, the identifier node is associated with the declaration node using {{GCC_func|3_4|c-tree.h|70|IDENTIFIER_SYMBOL_VALUE}}. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2147|lookup_name()}} returns the declaration for a given identifier. When a declaration leaves the scope the tree attributes {{GCC_func|3_4|c-tree.h|131|C_DECL_INVISIBLE}} is asserted.

A ''symbol table'' is not maintained in GCC. Instead, the compiler uses the pool of identifiers and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-tree.h|131|C_DECL_INVISIBLE}} attribute. Language hook lang_hooks.decls.getdecls() returns the variables in the scope chained together.

Functions {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|4426|start_init()}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|4490|finish_init()}} are called for an initialized declaration. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2673|finish_decl()}} finalizes the declaration. For an array declaration it computes the size of an initialized array. Then function {{GCC_func|3_4|stor-layout.c|339|layout_decl()}} is called. It computes the size and alignment of the declaration.

Parsing a function depends on the presence of its body. A function declaration is parsed using the same functions as those used for variable declarations. For a function definition, function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|5406|start_function()}} is called. Then the compiler parses the body of the function. When the function ends function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|6006|finish_function()}} is called.

Functions {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2493|start_decl()}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|5406|start_function()}} take declaration's ''attributes'' parameter as one of their arguments. The attributes are described in the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes GCC Manual]. Attributes are extensions of GNU implementation of C. The following table presents a few of them and explains their purpose:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ Function attributes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Attribute
| Explanation
|- align=left
| constructor
| call function automatically before main()
|-
| destructor
| call function automatically after main()
|-
| alias
| alias to another function

|}

For each type of C statements there is a function that constructs a tree node of the corresponding type. For example, function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|1656|build_function_call()}} builds a CALL_EXPR node for a function call. It takes the identifier of the function name and the arguments as its parameters. The function finds the function declaration using {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2147|lookup_name()}} and type casts the arguments using {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|1135|default_conversion()}}. 

The ASTs are then converted into the SSA and eventually to the RTL representations. Whether the conversion occurs after parsing each function or when the whole file is parsed is controlled by the compiler option -funit-at-a-time. It is false by default. 

{{GCC_take_home|GCC parser is written as a bison grammar. It creates the AST representation of the source file. ASTs are built up of tree nodes. Each node has a code. Tree nodes correspond to the statements and expressions of C. Function debug_tree() prints out the tree.}}

=== Assembly Code Generation ===

The backend generates the assembly code for the specified target platform. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|final.c|2884|output_asm_insn()}} is called for each instruction written to the assembly file. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|final.c|1322|final_start_function()}} generates the prolog of the function before it is saved to the assembly file.

{{GCC_take_home|The backend generates the assembly code for the specified target platform.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we describe the creation of a new compiler extension step-by-step. First, one needs to download the GCC and patch it with the GEM patch. After that one can start writing the compiler extension. When the extension is ready one can compile other programs using the GEM-patched version of GCC and the new compiler extension.

=== Installation ===

Download GEM framework from [http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/gem/gem-3.4.1.tar.gz here]. Unpack it and type '''make all'''. This will download a copy of GCC, patch it with GCC patch, compile and install GCC, and build examples.

The C function overloading example allows one to overload functions in C just like in C++:

   /* one function */
   void test(int a, int b) {
     printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;, a, b);
   }
   /* overloaded function */
   void test(char *a, int b) {
     printf(&quot;%s %d\n&quot;, a, b);
   }
   void main() {
     test(1,2);
     test(&quot;abc&quot;, 1);
   }

Let us consider the CFO example in more detail.

=== C function overloading ===

The source code of the extension is located in ./examples/cfo/cfo.c file. The following hooks are implemented:

  gem_start_decl()
  gem_start_function()
  gem_build_function_call()

The idea of the implementation is to modify the name of each function declared more than once. The names of these functions are modifier to include the type information of the arguments. For example, function test(int, int) is renamed into test_i_i(int, int). The renaming takes place in function cfo_alias_decl(). 

Functions cfo_start_decl() and gem_start_function() call this function. It looks up the name of the function being declared and returns immediately if the name is not found:

  cfo_find_symtab(&amp;t_func, func_name);
  if (t_func==NULL_TREE || DECL_BUILT_IN(t_func)) {
    return;
  }

Therefore, the names of non-overloaded functions are not changed. This maintains the compatibility with the unmodified compiler.

If the function with this name was declared previously then the extension checks if an alias with the arguments type information was created:

  strcpy(new_name, func_name);
  strcat(new_name, cfo_build_name(TREE_PURPOSE(T_O(declarator, 1))));
  cfo_find_symtab(&amp;t_func_alias, name);

Function cfo_build_name() builds the name of the function arguments. An alias is created if it was not created before.

    t_alias_attr=tree_cons(get_identifier(&quot;alias&quot;),
                           tree_cons(NULL_TREE, get_identifier(name), NULL_TREE), NULL_TREE);
    TYPE_ATTRIBUTES(T_T(t_func)) = t_alias_attr;
    DECL_ATTRIBUTES(t_func)=t_alias_attr;

Finally, the new declaration is renamed so that it includes the type information of the arguments:

    T_O(declarator,0) = get_identifier(new_name);

Function cfo_build_function_call() builds the name of the function that includes the argument type information and looks it up in the symbol table. If the name is found then the function name is replace in the function call. If the name is not found then the function was not overloaded and the name of the function being called is not changed. Build the new name:

  name = cfo_build_decl_name(t_func, t_parm);

Check if this identifier was parsed previously:

  t_new_func = get_identifier(name);

If it was then get the declaration:

  if (t_new_func) {
    t_new_func = lookup_name(t_new_func);
  }

If the declaration is found then replace the function:

  *func = t_new_func;

=Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence=

White has nailed down Blacks d-pawn by controlling d5 with three pieces. This prevents Black from breaking open the centre, or does it? The late Alexander Alekhine, world champion in the 1930s, recommends:

:[[/3...Nxe4/]]! 

This is the fork trick common to several openings. After 3...Nxe4 Black has eliminated two of the attackers of d5 with one stroke, and will proceed to regain the piece by 4...d5, grabbing a large chunk of the centre as he does so. For now, Black is a pawn up, but White may just have something else up his sleeve too...

Black can also choose to forget about d5 for the time being:

:[[/3...Nc6/]] transposes back to the Max Lange Defence. 

:[[/3...d6/]] is a timid move. It attempts to maintain a pawn at e5 after White plays f4, but it happens to give White the run of the board in the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Function overloading as in C++===

This example was presented previously.

===toString() method for each structure as in Java===

===Invoke a block of code from a function as in Ruby===

Linux implementation of lists allows to invoke a block of code on each element of the list:

[http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/nfs/pagelist.c?v=2.4.20#L199 pagelist.c]:

        list_for_each_prev(pos, head) {
                 struct nfs_page *p = nfs_list_entry(pos);
                 if (page_index(p-&gt;wb_page) &lt; pg_idx)
                         break;
        }

list_for_each_prev takes the code in the brackets as a parameter. The trick is to use a macro that rolls out to a for() loop whose body becomes the code in the brackets. The goal of this project is to allow programmers to use code blocks in function calls. 

===Dereference function results when a structure is returned===

C allows one to dereference the return value of a function if it is a pointer to a structure:

  get_struct()-&gt;field=0;

If the function returns the structure, not a pointer to it, then a compile-time error is generated:

  get_struct().field=0;
  &gt; request for member `field' in something not a structure or union

This extension addresses the problem of dereferencing structures that are return values.

===Use functions to initialize a variable===

When a variable is defined and initialized the initializers is constant. You will get an error if you try to use a function, no matter what this function is:

  int getint() { return 1; }
  int i=getint();
  &gt; initializer element is not constant

When a variable is used the function it was initialized with is called. 

===Default values of function arguments as in C++===

  void func(int a=0) {
    printf(&quot;a=%d\n&quot;, a);
  }
  int main() {
    func();
  }
  &gt; syntax error before '=' token

===Reference parameters as in C++===

  void test(int &amp;a, int &amp;b);
  int x,y;
  test(x,y);

===Return address protection (RAD)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/RAD Rad]

===Repair of control-hijacking attacks (DIRA)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/dira Dira]

===Array bounds checking using segmentation hardware (CASH)===

===Detecting interger overflows (DIVINE)===

===Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (GDIF)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/~lclam/gdif/ Gdif]

===GCC switches in object file===
[http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Record_GCC_command_line_switches_in_object_files GCC switches in object file]

===The -fstack-protector feature===
[http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.1/ GCC 4.1] implements a protection mechanism against buffer overflow attacks and exposes it to a programmer with a -fstack-protector option. This is an example of functionality that benefits from modular implementation because it has nothing to do with core functionality of the compiler. Does GCC have enough hooks to implement -fstack-protector module?

      <text xml:space="preserve">An important decision you must make before starting to create a website is the version of (X)HTML that the web pages will conform to.

The following versions of (X)HTML are current in January 2006:
* HTML 4.01 Strict
** (''HTML 4.01 Transitional'')
** (''HTML 4.01 Frameset'')
* XHTML 1.0 Strict
** (''XHMTL 1.0 Transitional'')
** (''XHTML 1.0 Frameset'')
* XHTML Basic
* XHTML 1.1
Versions of HTML prior to 4.0 are obsolete. Web pages in these versions should be withdrawn or converted to a variant of HTML version 4.01 or XHTML. No new page should be created using a version prior to HTML 4.01.

Four versions in the list above are shown in brackets. These versions are intended to be used as stepping stones when converting web pages from obsolete versions to current versions. They are not intended to be used by new web pages.

You shouldn't be using any variant of XHTML 1.0 unless you understand and apply the rules in [http://www.w3.org/TR/html/#guidelines Appendix C] of the XHTML 1.0 specification. You also need to understand the differences between the &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt; MIME types and how to configure your web server to respond with the appropriate MIME type.

Internet Explorer version 7.0 and lower (about 90% of web surfers were using Internet Explorer version 7.0 or lower in January 2006) does not understand XHMTL Basic or XHTML 1.1. These versions should not be used for general purpose web pages at the moment. XHTML Basic is useful for web pages that are only viewed by mobile phones as this is the preferred version for these devices.

This leaves HTML 4.01 Strict as the best choice for new authors. After you have mastered writing quality web pages using HTML you can learn the technical details of '''serving''' XHTML properly. (Writing XHTML web pages is just as easy as writing HTML web pages, the problem is configuring the server to serve them properly.)

Note that automatic tools can easily convert '''valid''' HTML 4.01 Strict to XHTML 1.0 Strict provided you don't use Javascript in your web pages. Converting Javascript is often a problem since XHTML does not permit &lt;code&gt;document.write()&lt;/code&gt;. (If &lt;code&gt;document.write()&lt;/code&gt; works in your XHTML then your server is not configured correctly.) If you must use Javascript avoid &lt;code&gt;document.write()&lt;/code&gt;.

Authors with experience of configuring web servers or access to good technical support may want to use XHTML 1.0 Strict from the start.

== Validation ==
Regardless of the version of HTML you choose to use it is important that you regularly validate your pages to ensure they conform to your chosen specification.

=== HTML 4.01 Strict ===
The DOCTYPE for HTML 4.01 Strict is

All HTML 4.01 Strict documents must start with this line (certain variants are permitted but they are beyond the scope of  this section).

Many examples of HTML in textbooks will not validate using the Strict DOCTYPE. This normally means that the example uses obsolete HTML elements, e.g. &lt;code&gt;FONT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FRAME&lt;/code&gt;. If you find that the examples in a book won't validate (or only validate with the Transitional or Frameset DOCTYPE) the textbook is probably out of date. The content of a significant number of textbooks are five or more years out of date, e.g. some books published in 2005 have content that was cutting edge in 1999 but is no longer considered best practice. Avoid any textbook that contains example that don't validate.

Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* The transition from Latin to Old English is a natural, thus the transition of Iesous from Greek to Latin to O.E. to English reaches an interesting juncture in Chapter 4. Jesus had foreign relations. Modernity opts (v. 7) for universal language at that point. The Coptic only starts in Chapter 2, first viable sacred name is a preview in 3: 10, unavoidably (the abbreviation &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;IHC&lt;/span&gt; represents the unpronounceable name of God already) this shows a mixture of Greek and English translation, an awkward moment, but one of the earliest examples of superlineation and an Aramism of redundant verbage, all in three words, altogether fascinating. Latin makes it easier, Codex D starts at John 3: 16, first viable sacred name John 4: 1. The last leaves or pages in both codices are missing bringing the Latin phrases to a dramatic conclusion in Chapter 20 and 21, even more so the Aramaic in Chapter 20. Can you wait?
* The preliminary heading was Greek/Latin Word pictures with the addition of Codex D, but that puts Latin on an equal basis with Greek. Findings in Chapter 3 touch on a more descriptive term, so the change to “plus Latin Facsimiles” outlining its tertiary and political role, behind Greek and Aramaic. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:51, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{gmail}}

Gmail's huge storage (7 gigabytes) may tempt some to use it as a file storage system. Because of the tedious process of putting one attachment after another and sending it to yourself, someone has taken the liberty of developing a program to add a shell extension to Microsoft's Windows operating systems. There are many different shell extensions (it may take a bit of digging through Google's search engine), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Here is one to try out, the most popular and well known GMail Drive! There is also an extension for Firefox called &quot;GSpace&quot; that does the same thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thermodynamic Processes for an Ideal Gas ==

Let us first consider the expansion and compression of an ideal gas from an initial volume V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to a final volume V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under constant-temperature (isothermal) conditions.  From the definition of pressure-volume work, we have:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext}dV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we assume the process occurs reversibly, then &lt;math&gt;P_{ext}=P&lt;/math&gt; where P is the pressure of the gas; therefore&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-\int_{V_1}^{V_2} PdV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now let us use the equation of state for an ideal gas, which is &lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt; where n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute (Kelvin) temperature.  Substituting for P, we get&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{nRT}{V}dV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we have a closed system, then n is a constant; moreover, since we have stipulated that this process occurs under isothermal conditions, T is also a constant.  Therefore, the integral simplifies to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-nRT\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{dV}{V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This integral may be solved to yield&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-nRT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Next we consider the change in the internal energy of the ideal gas upon isothermal expansion/compression.  It is helpful to review the two key assumptions that underlie the ideal gas model:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideal gas particles are point particles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideal gas particles have no interparticular forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
From these two statements, we now contemplate what would happen to the internal energy (U) of an ideal gas upon isothermal expansion or compression.  Because ideal gas particles are point particles, if the gas sample is compressed, the particles will not experience any change in energy because they have no internal volume to get &quot;squeezed&quot;.  Similarly, because they have no interparticular forces, they do not experience any change in attraction or repulsion between different particles if they are squeezed closer together.  Hence, we may (correctly) reason that for an isothermal process on an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is zero.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 0\;&lt;/math&gt; (isothermal process, ideal gas)&lt;br&gt;
(This same result may be rigorously proved using the thermodynamic master equations, or by using statistical thermodynamics.)  Note that because U is a state function, &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; will always be equal to zero for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; isothermal process on an ideal gas, whether or not it occurs reversibly.&lt;br&gt;
Because of the First Law of Thermodynamics,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = q + w\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and because &lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the energy change associated with heat upon isothermal reversible expansion or compression is just the negative of the work, or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q = -w = nRT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;.
In a similar fashion, other results may be derived for processes on ideal gases.  A summary of results is given below.

== Molar Thermodynamic Properties for an Ideal Gas ==
We are given that the molar Gibbs free energy of an ideal is &lt;math&gt;\bar G = \bar G^\circ+RT \ln\frac{P}{P^\circ}\;&lt;/math&gt;. Let's try and derive &lt;math&gt;\bar U=\bar U^\circ=\bar H^\circ-RT\;&lt;/math&gt;; noting that &lt;math&gt;\bar U^\circ=\bar G^\circ+T\bar S^\circ-RT\;&lt;/math&gt; and assuming that the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U\;&lt;/math&gt; and enthalpy &lt;math&gt;H\;&lt;/math&gt; of an ideal gas are independent of pressure and volume.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}
==Natural history==
Recurrence rate of 50-80% after surgery. Recurrence rate reduced to 50% with intralesional steroid therapy. RT reduces recurrence rate to 12-28%. 


==Treatment Overview==
*No universally accepted treatment protocol
*Modalities: surgery, radiation, pressure therapy, cryotherapy, intralesional injections of corticosteroids, interferon, fluorouracil, topical silicone, and pulse-dye laser treatment
*Surgery only has recurrence rate of 50-80%
*Post-op RT
**Success rate 75-90% within 10 year follow-up; however, a recent Dutch study had 70+% recurrence within 2 year, in sharp disagreement with prior studies
**Usually surgical excision followed immediately with RT
**Usually 3-4 fractions daily in 3-4 Gy/fx; however, recent Dutch meta-analysis suggests that dose is insufficient for long-term control, and should use BED of &gt;30 Gy (e.g. 13/1, 16/2, 18/3)
**Sites with high rates of recurrence (eg. high-tension areas) should be treated with escalated dosage


==Post-op RT==
'''''Meta-analysis'''''
*'''Utrecht'''
**'''2005''' PMID 16254707 -- &quot;Biologically effective doses of postoperative radiotherapy in the prevention of keloids. Dose-effect relationship.&quot; (Kal HB, Strahlenther Onkol. 2005 Nov;181(11):717-23.)
***Meta-analysis, 18 studies. Recurrence rate for surgery only 50-80%
***BED: Recurrence rate decreased as a function of BED, if &gt;30 Gy recurrence was &lt;10%. No difference with high stretch tension sites
***Conclusion: For effective therapy, need a reasonably high dose (BED &gt;=30 Gy, for example 13/1, 16/2, 18/3 or 27/1 LDR), within 2 days of surgery
**'''2009''' PMID 19362243 -- &quot;Dose-effect relationships for recurrence of keloid and pterygium after surgery and radiotherapy.&quot; (Kal HB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 May 1;74(1):245-51.)
***For keloid recurrence after radiotherapy following keloid removal, with either teletherapy or brachytherapy, the recurrence rate after having delivered a BED greater than 30 Gy is less than 10%.
***Conclusion: &quot;Most of the doses in the radiotherapy schemes used for prevention of keloid recurrence after surgery are too low. A scheme with a BED of 30 to 40 Gy seems to be sufficient to prevent recurrences of keloid&quot;

*'''U.Pittsburgh;2011''' - PMID 20472370 -- &quot;A Radiobiological Analysis of Multicenter Data for Postoperative Keloid Radiotherapy&quot; (Flickinger JC; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Mar 15;79(4):1164-70.)
**Review of multiple published studies. For 95% control of keloids with electrons, fractionated (in 3 fx) dose of 18.3-19.2 Gy (earlobe) or 23.4-24.8 Gy (other sites). Single fraction equivalent dose: 11.4 Gy (earlobe) and 14.5 Gy (other sites).

'''''Randomized'''''
*'''Beth Israel, 1996''' PMID 8646474 -- Steroid injection vs RT
**31 keloids treated. 
**&quot;Prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence with postoperative corticosteroid injections versus radiation therapy: a randomized, prospective study and review of the literature.&quot; (Sclafani AP, Dermatol Surg. 1996 Jun;22(6):569-74.)
***Recurrence 2/16, 12.5% (RT) vs 4/12, 33% (Steroids), NS.
**Conclusion: No statistical difference seen, but small study, likely underpowered. 

'''''Single Institution'''''
*'''Tokyo; 2007''' (2002-2004) PMID 18046154 -- &quot;Postoperative radiation protocol for keloids and hypertrophic scars: statistical analysis of 370 sites followed for over 18 months.&quot;
**Prospective. Compared 109 pts (121 lesions) treated from 2002-2004 on a risk-adapted protocol vs historic controls (218 pts; 249 lesions). Risk-adapted strategy employed 10, 15, or 20 Gy depending on site (higher dose: anterior chest wall, scapular, suprapubic; lower dose: earlobe). Historical controls received 15 Gy standard dose.
**Minimal f/u 18 months. Recurrence rate 29.3% (historic) vs 14.0% (protocol). The recurrence rate in the anterior chest wall was statistically reduced. Outcomes of earlobe did not differ between irradiation with 15 Gy or 10 Gy.
**Conclusion: &quot;Keloids and intractable hypertrophic scars should be treated with dose protocols customized by site. Our results suggest that keloid and intractable hypertrophic scar sites with a high risk of recurrence should be treated with 20 Gy in 4 fractions over 4 days and that earlobe should be treated with 10 Gy in 2 fractions over 2 days.&quot;


*'''Utrecht; 2007''' (Netherlands)(1998-2004) PMID 17967309 -- &quot;Postoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the prevention of keloids.&quot; (Veen RE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 15;69(4):1205-8.)
**Retrospective. 35 patients with 54 keloids (earlobe/auricle n=23, sternum n=17, others n=14), treated with HDR BT. First dose with 6 hours after surgery, 2 additional doses next day 6 hours apart. 
**Outcome: 45% recurrence after HDR 4/1 + 6/2; 3% recurrence after HDR 6/1 + 8/2; no recurrence after HDR 18/3. Better cosmetic results after higher doses
**Conclusion: HDR effective; recommend 3 x 6 Gy

**Retrospective. 21 patients with 32 keloids. RT 12 Gy in 3-4 fxs. Mean F/U 19 months
**Recurrence (elevation of the lesion not confined to the original wound area): 72%
**Conclusion: RT may not be as efficacious as suggested by other studies

**75 pts with 113 keloids with follow-up mean time of 9.7 yrs. 74% involved earlobe. 60% no prior treatment. Superficial X-rays used in 89%, 12 Gy in 3 fx over 3 days most common.
**Control rate 73%. Failure 19% if no prior treatment, 42% if recurrent.
**Toxicity: No treatment-related complications. 5% mild hyperpigmentation. Carcinogenesis never reported to their knowledge
**Prognostic: Higher recurrence in those &gt;2cm, previous therapy, in men. No advantage to starting treatment within 24 hrs versus more than 1 day (range 4-21 days). Mean time to recurrence 12.8 months

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Stórir bókstafir'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
:&lt;big&gt;''Capitalisation''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;p&gt;


Rules about big and small letters are divided into three parts. 
Capital letters:

#after punctuation marks (greinarmerkjum)
#in nouns (nafnorðum)
#in other groups

It must be noted that due to (mostly) English influences, both foreigners and Icelanders tend to write capital letters where not appropriate and vice versa. The Icelandic rules also tend to be confusing. However, these few (about five hundred) and simple rules and years of practice, should make it all worth while.

It's studying time!

=Capital letters after punctuation marks=

==1==

* Always start with a capital letter at the beginning of each sentence. 

Pretty basic, huh?

# Ex.: ''Ég er svangur. Fáum okkur að borða.'' – I'm hungry. Let's have something to eat.
# Ex.: ''Ertu franskur?'' – Are you French?
# Ex.: ''Enska er skemmtileg, en ekki eins skemmtileg og íslenska.'' – English is fun, but not as fun as Icelandic.

==2==

* Always write a capital letter after a period (.) or the equivalent of a period (:?!) unless it is followed by a dependent clause (ósjálfstætt orðasamband).

# Ex.: ''Aðal þema Moby Dicks var: Vertu þú sjálfur.'' – The main theme of Moby Dick was: Be yourself.
# Ex.: ''Jæja! Enn og aftur tókst þér að klúðra þessu.'' – Well! Once again you managed to screw it up.
# Ex.: ''Er ég ánægður? Ó jæja.'' – Am I happy? Oh well.
# Ex.: ''Hann missti allt: manga bækurnar sínar, myndirnar sínar og DS tölvuna sína.'' – He lost everything: his manga books, his pictures and his DS game computer.

The last example was a dependent clause (ósjálfstætt orðasamband)

==3==

* If a direct quote is in a sentence, a lower case letter follows, even if it ends with a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!).

# Ex.: ''&quot;Ertu lítill?&quot; spurði hann.'' – &quot;Are you small&quot; he asked.
# Ex.: ''&quot;Ég hata þig!&quot; öskraði hún.'' – &quot;I hate you!&quot; she yelled.

=Rules concerning lowercase and capital letters in nouns=



==A list of proper nouns  (sérnöfn)==

* Human names ('''G'''eir '''H'''agalín), human pet names ('''K'''alli), god and godesses ('''H'''ades, '''K'''ristur =Krist) and animal names ('''L'''assý) 
* (Örnefni), f.x. the names of the continents ('''E'''vrópa =Europe), names of countries ('''J'''apan), names of locations ('''N'''ew '''Y'''ork), names of regions in countries ('''N'''orðurland =Northernland), street names ('''K'''ringlumýrarbraut =Kringlumýrar St.), also common nouns which are used as proper nouns e.g. ('''T'''jörnin, which means &quot;the pond&quot; and would be written with a '''t''' in that meaning), and shortened names of locations ('''F'''jörðurinn = Hafnarfjörður)
* Name of constitutions ('''S'''pítali Íslands), clubs ('''T'''he Icelandic book club), corporations ('''E'''imskip, '''S'''íminn) and political parties ('''S'''jálfstæðisflokkurinn, '''S'''amfylkingin)
* Name of books ('''T'''he Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), newspapers ('''M'''orgunblaðið, '''F'''réttablaðið) and magazines ('''H'''ugur og heilsa)
* Names of musical pieces ('''C'''anon in A), poems ('''S'''ónettur Shakespears)and essays ('''Á'''hrif gróðurhúsaáhrifa)
* Nations ('''S'''koti =Scottish man), residents in specific areas ('''T'''exasbúi = a Texan) or continents ('''A'''síu-maður = an Asian)
* Stars ('''P'''ólstjarnan) and constellations ('''Ó'''ríon = Orion)

*Note that the names of '''languages''' are '''not''' written with a capital letter. 
(Ísland = Iceland, Íslendingur = an Icelandic person, íslenska = Icelandic.)

''Finally, some nouns are written with a lowercase letter if they derive from proper nouns and are then an exception from the rules concerning lowercase letters.''

==Concept==
Bacteria are most widely distributed organisms. These are unicellular micro-organisms. A scientist named Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria in 1677 for the first time. Later, Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch worked on them. This was a milestone in the history of biology and medicine. They discovered that bacteria produce many harmful diseases in man and animals. Bacteria(Singular is bacterium) range from 1um to 10um in length and from 0.2um to to 1 um in width. Bacteria can be observed under light microscope. The habitat of bateria is not specific. They are found everywhere, in air, water, living as well as dead bodies of organisms and even in glaciers and hot springs

==Kinds Of Bacteria==
On the basis of various shapes and forms, bacteria are divided into four types.
First is '''Cocci'''(Singular Coccus) and means rounded. The second is '''Bacilli'''(Singular Bacillus) which is rod-like. The third one is '''Spirilla'''(Singular Spirillium) and means spiral shaped and the last is '''Vibrios'''( Singular Vibrion) which means comma shaped.

A bread machine or breadmaker is a home appliance for baking bread. It handles the process from ingredients to a finished loaf, automatically. The machine consists of a bread pan with a paddle mounted in the centre, in a special purpose oven, with a control panel.

Ingredients (often flour, water, salt, sugar, yeast, butter, and milk powder or fresh milk) are measured and added to the bread pan, which is then placed into the bread machine. The machine takes a few hours to make a loaf of bread, first by turning the ingredients into dough using the paddle, then baking the loaf. When it has finished baking and has cooled down, the pan is removed from the bread machine, and the bread freed from the pan. The paddle is now in the bottom of the loaf, and has to be removed, leaving a small paddle-shaped hole.

Generally, the bread goes stale faster than bread from a commercial baker because it doesn't have the same additives. However, it is possible to use a sourdough starter in bread machine dough recipes. Sourdough contains a symbiotic brew of yeast and lactic acid bacteria cultures. Lactic acid produced by these bacteria greatly preserves bread, as well as enhancing its flavour. However, a sourdough rise takes much longer than a yeast rise, and most bread machines do not have a programmable cycle that caters to this.

Some bread machines are equipped with a timer, so that they can be loaded at night before going to bed, and be set to start in the early morning, presenting a freshly baked loaf ready for breakfast. The machine can sometimes be set to just make the dough, not to bake it, in which case it is baked in an oven. Pizza dough is another option.

Packets of bread mix are available, designed specifically for bread machines. They consist of the ingredients pre-measured. The only other ingredient that needs to be added is water.

The first bread machine was released in Japan in 1986. They became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States in the late 1990s.

Using a bread maker is a convenient way to avoid the hydrogenated vegetable oil that supermarkets add to their bread to make it bake more quickly, as well as other unwanted additives.

Some bread machines can be set to make other things besides bread, such as [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]. They can also be used to make [[Cookbook:Mochi|mochi]], a kind of Japanese rice cake.</text>

      <comment>inserted &quot;or&quot; as a missing conjuction between &quot;faa-yiz&quot; and &quot;moomin&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The hamza is the symbol that is a عين (rħain) with no tail.
It looks like this:&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ء&lt;/font&gt;
The hamza is best thought of as a vowel separator.

The hamza is not a letter by itself, even though it makes a consonant sound.

The hamza is on either a ياء (yaa') or an ألف (alif) or a واو (waaw) or is by itself.
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ئ / ؤ / أ / إ / ء
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Arabic writing makes sense, but the hamza's carriers cannot be figured out by just hearing. One has to either know the hamza spelling rules or have seen enough Arabic words to know how a word would be spelt. And there do exist spelling rules to figure out whether and which letter a hamza should go over.

But most people don't know the rules of the hamza, and they don't need to. They can spell fine without being able to explain why.

Often people wonder why is the hamza carried by other letters at all. Here is a short explanation:

Whenever a word starts with a vowel in Arabic an alif was written.

And in the old accents, people probably didn't pronounce the hamza anywhere else in a word.
for example:
فائز faa-iz- meaning winner
مؤمن mu'min  meaning (religious) believer

were not pronounced in that manner

instead it was:
faa-yiz or
moomin

So if the hamza existed on a yaa' that means that the different dialects pronounced it like a yaa' instead of a hamza'. You can still hear this pronounciaction very often in Arabic dialects for many words.

== Clearing Private Data ==

=== History ===

[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-history.png|thumb|right]]
It is possible to select individual history items to delete, by using the history side bar. You can open the history side bar by selecting from the menu the ''View -&gt; Sidebar -&gt; History'' option. Deleting singular items can be achieved by finding the item, right-clicking on it to get the context menu, and selecting ''Delete''. Deleting multiple entries can be achieved by right-clicking the list to focus it (for left-clicking will open the web page under the mouse, and losing focus on the list) and using the up/down arrows, and shift+up/down to select blocks of entries. Pressing ''Delete'' on the keyboard will delete the selected history items.

It is possible to delete all history items by opening the preferences dialog on the menu at ''Edit -&gt; Preferences'', and clicking on the ''Privacy'' tab and then the ''History'' tab. A button will be there to ''Clear Browsing History Now''. This will clear '''all''' history items.

Under this tab also, by changing the option ''Remember my browsing history for X days'', to 0, history items will not be kept between sessions.

Auto-completed URLs will disappear as corresponding history items are deleted.

=== Cookies ===

[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-cookies.png|thumb|right]]
Cookies can be cleared by selecting the ''Privacy'' tab  and then the ''Cookies'' tab under the user preferences from the menu at ''Edit -&gt; Preferences''. All cookies can be deleted by clicking the ''Clear Cookies Now'' button. Individual cookies can be cleared by clicking the ''View Cookies'' button to open the cookie viewing dialog. Selecting cookies and pressing ''Delete'' on the keyboard will delete those cookies.

By changing the option to ''Keep Cookies'' to ''Until I close Firefox'', cookies will not be kept between sessions. Also it is possible to choose to block all websites from putting cookies on your computer unless you have explicitly allowed them to do so, by adding them to a list accessible from this tab.

=== Other Data ===

It is possible to delete other private data by using options under the ''Privacy'' tab of the user preferences. See [[Using Firefox/Preferences#Privacy|Preferences]] for more details.

If you just want to delete one or a few values from the saved (remembered) list of field (or form) values, navigate to the item you want to clear ''(don't click on it, just &quot;point&quot; to it)'', then use the Shift-Delete key combination to clear it.

=== Deleting All Private Data ===

You can delete all private data, including browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form data, passwords, and download history, by opening the ''Clear Private Data'' dialog under the menu in ''Tools -&gt; Clear Private Data'' (or by pressing ''Ctrl-Shift-Delete'' on your keyboard). This will ask you to list your preferences as to what should be cleared from Firefox. If you want to do the same thing often in the future, you can deselect ''Ask me before clearing private data'', and the dialog will not be cleared. 

Your preferences for this option can be set in the user preferences dialog under the ''Privacy'' tab; there is a button down the bottom right that says ''Settings'', which will effect this function.

=== Security Extensions ===

==== Stealther ====

This Firefox extension allows you to surf the web without leaving a trace on your local machine. It temporarily disables the following while it is active:

- Browsing History (Websites you've visited, no auto-complete of URL's
- Cookies (Doesn't allow websites to store cookies *Warning* this could cause difficulties when trying to access user account or E-Mail)
- Downloaded Files History (All the files you've downloaded)
- Disk Cache (Any files normally stored on your local machine &quot;i.e images&quot; will not be stored for fast viewing)
- Saved Form Information (Information that would be used during the save form feature in Firefox &quot;i.e save user name and password on this computer?&quot; will not work)
- Sending of ReferrerHeader. (When you click on a link from one web page or website to another, the browser usually sends a Referer/header to the server to tell sites where you came from.)

==== NoScript ====
&quot;Winner of the &quot;2006 PC World World Class Award&quot;, this tool provides extra protection to your Firefox.
It allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking web site, and guards the &quot;trust boundaries&quot; against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).
Such a preemptive approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality...
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript ;-)&quot; -Giorgio Maone

==== WOT ====

&quot;Can you recognize good and reliable Internet content? Did you have a bad experience that you would like to share with others? WOT can help you. Seeing website reputations on your browser allows you to learn from other people. This shared knowledge makes it easier to avoid online fraud, including phishing and spyware. WOT can add reputations also to web search results, Digg, Gmail, Wikipedia, and other selected sites.&quot; -Against Intuition, Inc.

&quot;This of course preserves your privacy to great extent&quot; - Anonymous

==== CookieSafe ====

&quot;This extension will allow you to easily control cookie permissions. It will appear on your statusbar. Just click on the icon to allow, block, or temporarily allow the site to set cookies. You can also view or clear the cookies and exceptions by right clicking on the statusbar icon. For safer browsing you may choose to deny cookies globally and then enable them on a per site basis.&quot; -Ron Beckman

&lt;big&gt;'''Partial Breast Irradiation'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Anatomical studies==
*Rationale for APBI is that majority of local recurrences occur in close proximity to tumor bed, and &lt;20% appear &quot;elsewhere&quot; in the breast. Absolute number of &quot;elsewhere&quot; failures is quite low (&lt;&lt;1% per year) and is similar to rate of new contralateral tumors

*'''Holland''' - Classic paper that justified the need for whole breast RT. Evaluated mastectomy specimens. 42% of extensive intraductal component (EIC) negative breasts had residual carcinoma; 74% of EIC+ had residual carcinoma. Most carcinoma was intraductal type.  Most tumors were large and clinically detected.
*:PMID 2153190 &amp;mdash; &quot;The presence of an extensive intraductal component following a limited excision correlates with prominent residual disease in the remainder of the breast.&quot; Holland et al., 1990.

*'''Vaidya''' - A paper that paradoxically justified the rationale for partial breast irradiation. Multicentric foci were plotted in an abstract 3-D space and the conclusion was that although 63% (same result as Holland) of otherwise occult cancers were present in mastectomy specimens, over 79% of them were in other quadrants. This was in contrast with the results of breast conserving surgery trials in which early local recurrence occurred most commonly (&gt;90%) of the time in the area around the primary tumor, thus justifying the approach of TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy [[http://www.targit.org.uk TARGIT]]
*:PMID 8795588 &amp;mdash; &quot;Multicentricity of breast cancer: whole-organ analysis and clinical implications.&quot; Vaidya JS, Vyas JJ, Chinoy RF, Merchant N, Sharma OP, Mittra I. 1996.
 
*'''3D studies of duct-lobular system'''
**PMID 8630874  &amp;mdash; &quot;Intraductal extension of primary invasive breast carcinoma treated by breast-conservative surgery. Computer graphic three-dimensional reconstruction of the mammary duct-lobular systems.&quot; Ohtake et al. 1995.
**:20 pts studied, all had quadrantectomy. Ductal anastomoses are present, and may be a risk for spread to other ductal-lobular systems.  Maximum distance of spread, 11.9 mm.
**PMID 11413514 &amp;mdash; &quot;Computer-assisted complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the mammary ductal/lobular systems: implications of ductal anastomoses for breast-conserving surgery.&quot; Ohtake et al. 2001.
**:3D reconstruction of a single entire breast

*PMID 11072782 [http://content.kluweronline.com/article/272741/fulltext.pdf Full Text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Relationship between the morphological and biological characteristics of intraductal components accompanying invasive ductal breast carcinoma and patient age.&quot; Imamura et al. 2000.
*:Median extension of intraductal component 9 mm. Related to patient age, with older patients having less extension.

*PMID 15465188 (2004) &amp;mdash; &quot;Defining the clinical target volume for patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and accelerated partial breast irradiation: a pathologic analysis.&quot;  Vicini et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Nov 1;60(3):722-30.
*:Recommend 10 mm margin around tumor bed

==Dosimetry==
*'''MD Anderson; 2012''' PMID 22884255 -- &quot;A new paradigm for calculating skin dose.&quot; (Gifford KA, Brachytherapy. 2012 Aug 8. [Epub ahead of print])
**Evaluation of skin volumetric models. Literature review showed average breast epidermal thickness 1.68 mm. Clinical plan developed with 2 mm skin contour, as contraction of the external surface contour, to estimate epidermis thickness. Second plan 5 mm expansion of the external contour
**Outcome: median difference for Dmax (01. cc) skin -2 mm vs skin +2 mm was 12% (SS), maximum was 24% (SS)
**Conclusion: Surface model for skin may underestimate dose delivered to epidermis by as much as 24%
 
*'''Dose Homogeneity Index, Tufts; 1988''' PMID 3352544 --&quot;A dose homogeneity index for evaluating 192Ir interstitial breast implants.&quot; (Wu A, Med Phys. 1988 Jan-Feb;15(1):104-7.)
**Dose homogeneity index defined as DHI = [V(TDR)-V(HDR)]/V(TDR), where V(TDR) denotes the total treatment volume enclosed by the prescribed treatment dose rate (TDR) and V(HDR) denotes the volume enclosed by high-dose rate (HDR), which is 1.5 X TDR or greater. Also can be written as (V100% - V150%)/V100%

===Meta-Analysis===
*'''Heraklion University, Greece; 2010''' PMID 20210799 -- &quot;Partial Breast Irradiation or Whole Breast Radiotherapy for Early Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.&quot; (Valachis A, Breast J. 2010 Feb 23. [Epub ahead of print])
**Meta-analysis. 3 trials with 1,140 patients. 
**Outcome: No difference in OS (OR 0.9, NS), DM (OR 0.7, NS), or SCV recurrences (OR 1.4, NS). However, PBI increased risk of local recurrence (OR 2.1, SS), and axillary recurrence (OR 3.4, SS) compared with whole breast RT
**Conclusion: PBI doesn't jeopardize survival but issue of locoregional recurrence needs to be addressed
**Letter to editor (Polgar C, PMID 20127229): Inappropriate to include the 2 &quot;old&quot; British trials using inadequate patient selections criteria

***Use of APBI-brachytherapy increased over time: from &lt;1% in 2000 to 13% of patients in 2007. At 5 yrs, cumulative incidence of subsequent mastectomy was significantly higher: 4.0% (APBI) vs 2.2% (WBI); HR = 2.14. Higher risk of hospitalization: 9.6% v 5.7% (O.R. 1.71), infection: 8.1% vs 4.5% (O.R. 1.85); rib fracture 4.2% vs. 3.6%; fat necrosis 9.1% vs. 3.7%; breast pain 14.9% vs. 11.7%.  Lower incidence of pneumonitis: 0.1% vs. 0.8%.
***Conclusion: APBI-brachy was associated with inferior effectiveness (as evidenced by increased utilization of mastectomy) as well as increased acute and late toxicities compared with WBI.

==APBI-Balloons==
===Overview===
*Usual dose: 34 Gy in 10 fractions (BID) over 5 consecutive days. Dose usually prescribed at 1 cm depth.
*Ideal dosimetric criteria (see PMID 20378268):
**PTV_EVAL: breast tissue bounded by expansion of balloon by 10 mm, limited to 5 mm from skin surface, and limited by posterior breast tissue extent (chest wall and pectoralis muscles are not included), less balloon volume
**95% of prescribed dose covers 95% of PTV_EVAL
**Skin maximum: &amp;le; 125% prescribed dose
**Rib maximum: &amp;le; 145% prescribed dose
**Volume of breast receiving 150% of prescribed dose (V150): &amp;le; 50 cc
**Volume of breast receiving 200% of prescribed dose (V200): &amp;le; 10 cc

===Outcomes===
*'''American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite Registry'''
**'''True recurrence; 2012''' PMID 22836556 -- &quot;Tumor bed control with balloon-based accelerated partial breast irradiation: incidence of true recurrences versus elsewhere failures in the American Society of Breast Surgery MammoSite(®) Registry Trial.&quot; (Beitsch PD, Ann Surg Oncol. 2012 Oct;19(10):3165-70. doi: 10.1245/s10434-012-2489-x. Epub 2012 Jul 27.)Randomized trials demonstrate that lumpectomy plus whole-breast irradiation (WBI) yields survival equivalent to mastectomy. Studies that use WBI, however, typically report higher tumor bed recurrence rates than elsewhere failures (EF) (historically considered new primary lesions). The rate of true recurrence (TR) versus EF was queried for a large patient cohort treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).
***Registry trial. 1449 cases, lumpectomy with MammoSite APBI (34/10 BID). Invasive 87%, DCIS 13%. Comparison of true recurrence (TF) versus elsewhere failure (EF). Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: IBTR 3.5%; 5-year invasive IBTR 3.6%, DCIS 3.4%. True recurrence 1.1% versus elsewhere failure 2.6%. ER- status associated with increased risk of IBTR and EF. No pathologic factors associated with TF
***Conclusion: IBTR after balloon-based APBI is low, and similar (and potentially better) than whole breast irradiation

**Update (2009) PMID 19806329: &quot;DEGRO expert panel recommends to refrain from APBI outside prospective studies as this would not only jeopardize the completion of the necessary clinical trials but also neglect the lack of data that are mature enough to permit definitive conclusions regarding long term tumor control, overall survival and cosmetic outcome of thousands of women&quot;

== Terrible! ==

This is the worst-written of the three Meatloaf recipes.  For example:

&quot;Drain off grease when brown 10-20 minutes.&quot; What does that even mean?  And then there's &quot;Bake until done.&quot;  Is this a joke?

When the writing's not just plain bad, it's still pretty obtuse.  Anbody feel like taking a crack at fixing it?

Just a little bit of chili or some jalapenos make any meatloaf excellent. (I would add a recipe but, why bother, chili makes everything perfect, and those who noticed it will add it anyways.)
Or instead of worcestershire sauce, use habanero tabasco. A teaspoon will be enough for a little bit of spice.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tämä on nyt tällaista testiä vain. Kokeillaan.

VAU! Mitäs siihen sanot, jos mä tätä tästä alan muokata tällai? Just muuten viime viikolla yksi BSCW:ssä oleva opiskelija ehdotti, että olisi hyvä jos meidän alalle sais tällaisen Wikipedia-tyyppisen avoimen tieto- ja hakuteoksen.

Täähän sujuu kuin tanssi.

No juu, niin sujuu. Tätähän voisi ihan testikäyttää jollain kurssilla. Periaatteessahan tänne voi joku eksyä ja laittaa spämmejään, mutta ehkä se ei ole todennköistä.

Niin, tämä voisi toimia keskustelualustana ainakin. Vaikka mitään ketjuja tähän kyllä ei saa muodostettua. Saako tähän lisättyä liitetiedostoja jotenkin? Edelleen olen eniten mua kiinnostaa just nyt sellainen väline, jolla voisi tehdä tutkimusyhteistyötä. Oonko tylsä, jos olen sitä mieltä, että tämä ei taida toimia ihan juuri sellaisena....Mutta johonkin juttuun tämä varmasti käy. En aio ruveta vielä teknopessimistiksi.

1.2. 
Ei tänne vielä ole ainakaan mitkään spämmit eksyneet / LY

I would further categorize the stocks into '''Value''' &amp; '''Growth''', but the decision to allocate these investments are very subjective, and in regard to a mutual fund the decision ultimately rests with the mutual fund manager to determine. Also common among mutual funds what is considered to be large-cap growth can actally have an allocation of 40% small-cap value and 60% large-cap growth and still be considered &quot;Large-Cap Growth&quot;  thus defining and analyzing would succumb to an individual selection basis, which the investor can do by himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Goal / Purpose== To provide investors in regard to specific asset catagories if applicable: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_risk Default Risk], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return#Average_Annual_Rate_of_Return Average Annual Rate of Return], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Deviation Standard Deviation],  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_coefficient Average Beta] of those Returns for a 5, 10, &amp; 20 year time frame (full market cycle) and corresponding  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_%28economics%29 Indices]. Over all it is to help simplify an overly complex system.

==Target Audience==
Investors that wish to diversify thier portfolio using either [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_investing passive] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_investing active investing] approach.
==Information Benefit==
Even though I am getting very specific about the maturity for fix income based on a 5, 10, &amp; 20 year scale. I would like the data set to be based on 20 years or more thus a full market cycle. As a result the need to update this information will not be necessary. In regards to the subjectivity of rates and other variable, it will have minimal inpact due to the longer time scale that is use for historic return based on each asset class.

==Factors Impact==
*Factors such as management fees, stock selection and market timing do have an impact upon one's portfolio but more in a negative way than a positive way.

==Topics that should not be in the article==
*Different ways to allocate portfolio or techniques use based on some formula i.e. age.
*Asset allocation rules, however an appropriate link is applicable. 
*Not an article about stress or stomach acid test.
==Topics that should be in the article==
*How to determine an appropriate benchmark and type of benchmark, should be brief and concise.
*Numerical in nature thus a data set that can be used by an informed investor.

===Links===
Maybe the links to wikipedia should be trimmed back a bit.  Just about every time a dollar sign appears it is linked to wikipedia.  This seems excessive, and i think it is a breach of policy.  Those that stay should probaly be formetted in the form W: and then the name of the page on wikipedia. [[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 10:55, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

=Where To Start? With Nothing!=

Clear your mind and assume nothing.  When you achieve this blank state you have arrived at the starting point for Mathematics:  the big Nothing (with a capital &quot;N&quot;).  To move on from Nothing using the Language of Mathematics we will need  a framework to build on.  The framework we need has to allow us to expand the reach of the language as we go.  To find such a framework Mathematics looks to the world of Logic.

==A Brief Glimpse of Logic==

&lt;div id=&quot;reflogic&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;First, a description of Logic&lt;sup&gt;[[#ftntlogic|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Logic] is most often said to be the study of arguments, although the exact definition of logic is a matter of controversy among philosophers. [The task] of the logician is the same: to advance an account of valid and fallacious inference to allow one to distinguish good from bad arguments.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this description it is clear that a solid system of logic requires arguments to work with.  A &lt;b&gt;Logical Argument&lt;b&gt; is the ordered process of going from some definitions to reaching a conclusion.  Obviously you can't have an argument (or reach a conclusion!) without something to argue over.  A &lt;b&gt;Definition&lt;/b&gt; is a simple statement and can form the basis for an argument. A &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; is the endpoint of an argument.  A useful argument results in a conclusion which tells us something about the original definitions.

An Example is in order:
* &lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; Something which has water on it is wet.
* &lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; Something not protected from the rain gets water on it.
* &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Something not protected from the rain gets wet.

These three statements make up a logical argument.  Using the conclusion from this logical argument, we can now identify the things around us in jeopardy of getting wet the next time it rains.  The couch in the house is safe; the trees outside are not.  Notice that the conclusion comes directly from the definitions -- for this example there is no &lt;b&gt;Body&lt;/b&gt; to the Argument.

Thinking deeper about this argument it becomes clear that we jumped into the middle of something.  You could ask:  What is Rain?  What is Water?  What is a &quot;Something&quot;?  

Obviously there are a lot of logical arguments which could have preceded this one.  For example, we could define Water as a collection of molecules with the chemical formula of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and define rain as a collection of collections of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. An argument relating rain to water can then be made.

But then what is a Molecule?  Again, we could define a Molecule as a collection of atoms.  Still, what is an Atom?  For that matter, what is a Collection??  It quickly becomes obvious why philosophers spend so much time quietly thinking to themselves.

Fortunately we're thinking about Mathematics, not the Meaning of Existence (which can easily take a lifetime&lt;sup&gt;[[#ftntphil|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;).  Remember that a useful logical argument results in a conclusion which tells us something about the original definitions.  In our example above we discovered that we can combine the two definitions into a more compact form as the conclusion.  In this case, it's hard to say that the conclusion is much more useful than the definitions.  However, some logical arguments can take many, many definitions and arrive at a simple conclusion which itself becomes tremendously useful.  This is called &lt;b&gt;Reduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[#ftntreduc|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Reduction will be the first goal of our Mathematics framework.

==Starting The Framework For Mathematics==

Time to start building!  Since the starting point is Nothing there can be no arguments.  We need a definition!

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; An &lt;b&gt;Object&lt;/b&gt; is something that can be described.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Any logical argument leading to this (as a conclusion) we will disregard as being in the realm of pure Philosophy.  We will also assert (not assume!) this definition is true.  Consider the previous assertion of truth carefully!  The implication is powerful:  from the very beginning Mathematics ceases to be tangible.  With this definition we can say &quot;The Universe is an Object&quot; or &quot;Emptiness is an Object&quot; or &quot;Words are Objects&quot;; indeed, even a Thought, a Color, a Feeling, or even Something That Has Not Been Discovered is an object! Ahhh, the freedom!  No boundaries!  If this fundamental definition is preserved (and it will be) our Mathematical Framework will have tremendous reach and breadth.

Wait! There is one problem -- our definition is written in words, specifically English, and we don't want to be limited as to who can understand or use this definition.  There are concepts in other languages as well as things undiscovered which we want to include in the realm of Mathematics.  To keep the limitation of language from putting boundaries on the framework, symbols are used in place of words. For now, we will use lowercase English letters to represent objects.  Remember, they are symbols in Mathematics, not letters.  Letters have sound; symbols do not.  &lt;b&gt;Symbols&lt;/b&gt; can represent any Object as defined above.  We can now add a definition to our framework:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A &lt;b&gt;Symbol&lt;/b&gt; is a written character.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Next comes a decision on how to use Symbols which brings up another problem:  there are not nearly (not even close) to enough symbols to give every Object its own symbol.  Adding to the problem is the confusion caused in other people if symbols are assigned to objects.  Other people will have to know what each symbol specifically represents, which means creating a gigantic Symbol Dictionary.  The Symbol Dictionary would have to be updated every time a new object is found, created, or considered.  That is no good!

To solve the problem of Symbols, we add the following definition to our framework:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A &lt;b&gt;Variable&lt;/b&gt; is a Symbol which represents a property of some object(s).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Whew!!  Our Dictionary just got much, much smaller.  Reality requires us to have at least some symbols that are specifically defined and universal -- those situations are not far away.  However, any symbol that does not have such a concrete definition can be used as a variable.  The key point of the definition of a variable is &quot;represents a property&quot;.  Fortunately this definition is wide open since &quot;represents a property&quot; is not a restrictive phrase.  Success!! Our language is universal AND our freedom has returned.

Putting the previous definitions to use we can now define a variable:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let β (the Greek letter Beta) represent an object with two and only two wheels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This statement does not require us to state exactly what object with two and only two wheels is represented by β.  In  fact, an object satisfying β does not even have to exist.  But now we can tell what objects β could be.  For example, β could be a bicycle, but not a car.  β could be a motorcycle but not a motorboat.  Notice the definition of β allows us to separate all objects into two groups of objects:  one group which satisfies the conditions of β and another group which does not.  This leads us to our next definition:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A &lt;b&gt;Set&lt;/b&gt; is a group of objects with one or more common properties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Sets are vitally important in Mathematics.  If you are not confident in how this definition was reached it is probably well worth your time to review some of the previous definitions for clarification!  Sets are so important and occur so frequently in Mathematics they require universal symbols to represent them.  For a Set, the universal symbols include the left and right curly braces used as follows:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; The Set &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; contains all objects represented by variable β.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(Almost) Mathematical Notation:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is the same as {β} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
  
The Mathematical Notation is not pure -- it is &quot;Almost&quot; because it contains English words.  Let's fix that immediately!
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equivalence&lt;/b&gt; means two symbols represent the same value, state, or are the same thing.  Another common term for this condition is &lt;b&gt;Equal&lt;/b&gt;.  In Mathematics, the symbol = represents Exact Equivalence. Let's look at this more closely. Since &quot;equivalence&quot; can refer to the &quot;state or condition&quot; two boxes containing three items in each could be considered &quot;equivalent&quot;. However, if the three items are not the same kinds of things, say three cats in one and three dogs in the other, they are not &quot;equal&quot;. For them to be equal, they must be exactly the same. This concept is recurrent in more advanced mathematical structures. This distinction is made now to avoid future confusion the student might have. Many students get the impression that mathematics in not consistent and contradictory when they have such an experience. Keep in mind that people sometimes take shortcuts when explaining material or are so caught up in the explanation at hand that things slip their mind. This is human nature and should be forgiven since perfection seldom exists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In our (Almost) Mathematical Notation for Set &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; above, the phrase &quot;is the same as&quot; shows equivalence.  Therefore, we can write the condition in pure Mathematical Language:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; = {β} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Hopefully your mind hears &quot;&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is a Set of all objects that satisfy the conditions of the variable β&quot;.  It is common in Mathematical literature to use uppercase English letters as symbols for Sets, and lowercase English letters as symbols for variables.  Also, it is common for the Set symbol to be the uppercase equivalent of the Variable symbol.  We will follow these conventions from this point forward.

Example:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; = {a}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

How did your mind hear that line?  It is significant to note that Variable a has never been defined, yet we understand the concept of what is represented by the line above.  It is important to understand that the line above also has not validated any of our previous definitions.  This is a small taste of a special power of Mathematics:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Generalization&lt;/b&gt; is the ability of Mathematics to specify behaviors and relationships for a broad variety of objects without actually defining what the objects are.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

There are not enough tools in our framework at this time to exploit Generalization completely.  But we will eventually!  For now, here's the definition of another set:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; = {p}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This is an &lt;b&gt;abstract&lt;/b&gt; Set, since we do not know what the Variable p represents.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Q&lt;/b&gt; = {q: &lt;s&gt;all words&lt;/s&gt;  any word that starts with 'm'}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This is a &lt;b&gt;concrete&lt;/b&gt; Set since a definition of Variable q is given.  A new universal symbol has been presented here.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; In the notation for a Set, a colon (:) is used to represent the phrase &quot;is defined as&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Using this definition, the Mathematical Language given above for Set Q reads &quot;Q is a Set of all objects that satisfy the conditions of the variable q which is defined as &lt;s&gt;all words that start&lt;/s&gt; any word that starts with 'm'&quot;.

There is an additional way to specify a Set when there are a specific group of objects contained within it.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; = {x: a donkey, a mushroom, a glass of water, a cloud}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

There is NO spoken phrase for Variable x that correctly describes these objects in terms of a common or shared property.  Nonetheless, this is a valid Mathematical Set.  Again this demonstrates the ability of Mathematics to express concepts that formal written language cannot describe.  This also demonstrates a small piece of the power of Mathematics which we will put to great use as we move forward.


&lt;!-- Defines a set, then set operators --&gt;

For college level math, it is necessary to become somewhat familiar with Greek as well as Latin letters (which is what the English alphabet is derived from), as both are used as Mathematical symbols.  When learning new concepts, anxieties can be reduced if the symbols, at least, are familiar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Polyominoes''' are shapes made from connecting unit [[../Parallelograms#Square|squares]] together, though certain connections are not allowed.

== Domino ==
[[Image:Side_side_connected.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Domino]]
A domino is the shape made from attaching unit squares so that they share one full edge.  The term polyomino is based on the word domino.
There is only one possible domino.

== Tromino ==

A polymino made from three squares is called a tromino.  There are only two possible trominoes.

[[Image:TrominoV.jpg|120px]] [[Image:TrominoI.jpg|120px]]

== Tetromino ==

A polymino made from four squares is called a tetromino.  There are five possible combinations and two reflections:

==Pentominoes==

A polymino made from five squares is called a pentomino. There are twelve possible pentominoes, excluding mirror images and rotations.
