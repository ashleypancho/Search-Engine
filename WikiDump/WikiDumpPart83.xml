      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

'''Slicing''' is the cutting of food into thin, relatively broad slices. Slices may be used as they are or processed further to produce other speciality cuts such as [[Cookbook:Chiffonade|chiffonade]], [[Cookbook:Rondelle|rondelles]], diagonals, oblique or roll cuts, and lozenges. Slicing may be accomplished by hand or machine. Mechanized slicers include rotary slicers and food processors with a slicing attachment. A [[Cookbook:Mandoline|mandoline]] greatly increases both the speed and uniformity of slices produced and are available for both professional and home use.

==How to==
===Method A===
The tip of the knife rests on the cutting board while the food item is held with the other hand. The knife is rocked up and down. On the downward movement, the blade moves down and forward to slice through the item, keeping the tip on the cutting board. If the item is too large to rest the tip on the work surface, the same motion is used but the tip points toward the cutting board while one pushes the knife down and forward through the food in one movement. ''Do not saw backwards and forwards''.
===Method B===
Gripping the item with one's fingers curled under as described, use the wrist as a fulcrum and the second joint of one's index finger as a guide. With the heel of the knife on the cutting board, the tip is lifted and one slices by drawing the knife slightly back toward you and down through the item, using the knuckle of the index finger to adjust the thickness of each cut. The motion of the knife should be almost entirely from the wrist, not from the elbow.

==SAFETY==
Knives should always be kept sharp and stored separately from other utensils. Cuts occur more frequently with dull knives because they have a tendency to slip off the food being cut. Never leave knives in a sink full of soapy water. Never try to catch a falling knife. Never try to clean the circular blade of a mechanical slicer while the machine is still assembled. ''Always ensure that mechanical slicers and other electrical cutting equipment are disconnected from the power supply before disassembling them for cleaning''. When using a mandoline, use the food holder which is supplied with it. If it didn't have one when you bought it, it is quite likely being illegally sold in your jurisdiction which probably requires that they be sold with a holder included.

When slicing food by hand, always grip the handle of the knife firmly. A loose grip can lead to accidents. The food item is held firmly with the other hand, the fingers curled under, so that the side of the blade is against the knuckles. The curling under of the hand holding the food is extremely important and a safety requirement that must never be disregarded even when the knife is nowhere near one's fingers, so as to make it a habit that becomes automatic. Many accidents, and indeed the loss of digits, could have been avoided if this technique were always followed. Regrettably, even professionals sometimes disregard their own rules. ''Resist the temptation to do so''.

= Ethics and Technical Communication  =

As you put together professional documents and begin working in the “real” world, you must understand what could easily lead to your downfall in your professional workplace. The Paul Anderson text claims that at work in a professional setting, there at least three major “sources of guidance”: 

#The code of ethics already developed by your field’s professionals, 
#The ethical code set in place by your company, and 
#Your own personal ethics. 

Some companies have decided to have employees keep their personal ethics at home. In reality, companies that try to keep personal ethics at home find that employees are occasionally asked to perform actions that they do not condone at home. In professional settings we would like to assume that companies would not act unethically, so why should we even pay attention?

The truth is, companies do act unethically whether it is disposing of toxic waste incorrectly or price gouging to name a few. The same goes for writing professional documents. You should keep them clean and standardized to save yourself from damaging a possible job opportunity and the name you represent.

== Ethics and Resumes ==
Resumes present a unique case in professional writing as they relate to ethics. In the work place, it is considered unethical if you do not present all the information related to a given project, good and bad. However when writing your resume, there is a common understanding that only good information will be included. While not including negative aspects is acceptable on a resume, including extra items that you did not accomplish is not.

When writing your resume, it is obvious that you should not lie. In today’s time, it is very easy for a prospective employer to go online, call a current or past employer, or call a reference to find out what kind of work you did. Lying in your resume '''will''' hurt you. Not only could you be rejected for a job, you could also be selling yourself for a position that you are not qualified for. For example, writing that you are experienced with Microsoft Office 2007 even if you have little experience could lead to frustration at work, poor performance reviews, or even losing your job. 

Here are tips for keeping your resume within ethical boundaries:

* List only the jobs you have actually held and what you did at the job.
* Do not elaborate on your education. State only the schools you attended and the degrees you have completed.
* Provide correct statistics about positions you have held. If you do not know the actual data, give a plausible range of data.
* Do not take credit individually for something accomplished as a team.
* Do not write in a way that is intended to mislead the reader.
* Do not provide references that have not agreed to be listed as one.

Possible future employers do have the right to run a background check on you with your approval. In this background check, the company will go through and call your previous employers. They will ask if you: 
   A) worked for them, and 
   B) what type of employee you were, if the possible future employer wishes. 
If you are unsure about a certain fact or number, do not guess. Call your previous or current employer and ask them to clarify. Also, make sure anything you put on your resume can be supported by evidence. If you claim you worked 7 different shifts in a previous job, you should be able to list all 7 of those shifts in case you are ever asked.

NEVER lie on your resume! It is one of the first impressions you are able to make on a potential employer, and you obviously want to leave a lasting impression. Lying on your resume or even stretching facts will not help you in the long run. Remember that you are the brand you are selling. Nothing is more important than the image you want to project.

==Stakeholders==
When writing any professional document, it is important to identify the potential stakeholders. A stakeholder is anyone who will be affected by what you are intending on writing. How you choose to word your document or even the choice to write the document becomes an ethical matter to  stakeholders. It is crucial to consider your main objective(s) before writing. If you are writing a document that would be used to harm other living things (like writing a manual for a handgun) you have to weigh the implications to all stakeholders impacted. According to the Paul Anderson text, there are three types of stakeholders: direct, indirect, and remote.
===Direct===
The direct stakeholders are those initially impacted by what you write. For instance, if you are writing about opening a new waste disposal area, the stakeholders clearly include the company you are writing to. However, disposal companies that might use this waste area in the future are also considered direct stakeholders. Their future business will be impacted based on whether your proposal is accepted or declined.

===Indirect===
The indirect stakeholders are those that are not impacted until a later time. Using the previous example of the waste disposal, citizens in the area would be indirect stakeholders. The stakeholders don't necessarily need to be people. The nearby eco-systems would be indirect stakeholders to this same proposal. If toxic waste is dumped there, it would harm the animals, rivers and plant life nearby.

===Remote===
Finally, the remote stakeholders are not affected until far into the future. One example following our hypothetical waste disposal area, is future generations. While it may seem far-fetched, historically, there have been instances where toxic or poisonous things have been disposed of  incorrectly and the run-off that went into lakes and streams caused birth defects. While this  is remote, it must be considered when writing a document.

==Ethical Writing==
Once on the job, you will be assigned to create many documents throughout your professional career. Some may be simple and straightforward, some may be difficult and involve questionable objectives. Overall, there are a few basic points to adhere to whenever you are writing a professional document:
*Don't mislead
*Don't manipulate
*Don't stereotype
===Don't mislead===
This has more than one meaning to the professional writer. The main point is clear. When writing persuasively, do not write something that can cause the reader to believe something that isn't true. This can be done by lying, misrepresenting facts, or just &quot;twisting&quot; numbers to favor your opinion and objectives. This is clearly different from the resume ethics. Once you are on the job, you cannot leave out numbers that show you're behind or over-budget on a project, no matter how well it may work once it is completed. Facts are facts and they must be represented in that way. Be cautious when using figures, charts and tables, making sure they are not misleading. While this may seem easy to read about, when the pressure is on and there are deadlines to meet, taking shortcuts and stretching the truth are very common. 

The other, less frequently used component is plagiarizing. While it may seem like this is something students learn to avoid after they graduate, it remains an important guideline for all professionals. Plagiarizing is misrepresenting the source or facts, most commonly when you claim the ideas you are writing about are yours. When you are researching professional documents, make sure you are using material with permission. If you are writing about what you've researched, make sure you are citing the sources of your information and giving credit to all the necessary researchers. This rule also extends beyond writing to what is referred to as intellectual property. Intellectual property includes the following:
*Patents - Items whose credit for creation is protected
*Trademarks - Company names (WalMart), logos (the Target bulls-eye), or slogans (I'm lovin' it)
*Copyright law - Items whose distribution is protected by law (books, movies, or software)
None of these things can be used without proper recognition of or approval from the appropriate company or individual involved. 

This law extends beyond the major companies. Any written document in your own company is copyrighted by law once produced. That means if you are borrowing a good idea from a friend at another company, you must cite them as a source. Also, although not required by law, it is a good idea to cite sources from inside your own company as well. You wouldn't want some one else taking credit for your ideas. Why should you treat others any differently?

The legal consequences are most notable when one considers writing in the professional world. While plagiarizing may give you a failing grade in a class, plagiarizing in the workplace can not only get you fired, but could result in a costly lawsuit or possibly even jail time. It is not only ethical to follow these rules, it is an enforced law. Make sure you properly document all sources so as not to mislead a reader.

===Don't manipulate===
If you are holding a professional job, it is understood that you have a decent ability to write persuasively, even if your first persuasive document was your resume. Do not use your ability to persuade people to do what is not in their best interest.  While this may not always seem easy, a good writer with a bad motive can twist words to make something sound like it is beneficial to all parties. The audience may find out too late that what you wrote only benefited you and actual ended up hurting them. This goes back to the stakeholders. Make sure they are not only considered and cared for when writing a persuasive document. It is easy to get caught up in the facts and forget all the people involved. Their feelings and livelihood must be considered with every appropriate document you create.

===Don't stereotype===
Most stereotyping takes place sub-consciously now since work places are careful to not openly discriminate. It is something we may not even be aware we are doing, so it is always a good idea to have a peer or coworker proofread your documents to make sure you have not included anything that may point to discriminatory assumptions.

== Addressing Unethical Practices ==

Many times in the professional setting, workers find it difficult to deal with unethical practices in their company. First, begin by bringing the unethical practice to the surface, which is usually the hardest part. Paul Anderson's text reviews '''three''' ways that you can bring your company's practices to the surface. It is easiest to first start ''asking questions''. Asking questions may seem too simple but it is an effective way of bringing attention to your company's problems. Ask questions about who their decisions are affecting and why they are making those decisions. This will not put you on the spot for being the bad guy, but it will allow you to voice your opinion.

The second idea Anderson describes as ''being helpful'' in revealing unethical practices is to ''use facts or reason'', instead of accusation. Before you raise questions about your company's unethical practices, make sure you have cold hard facts instead of accusations.  Many times accusations are made about situations where people truly do not know the reason those decisions were being made. If you base your thoughts around true facts, your company will assume you looked into the situation and will take your thoughts more seriously.

The third helpful way to bring your company's unethical practices to the surface is to ''remain open to others ideas''. What this allows you to do is base a solution around many different sides instead of just your own. Since people usually have different ethical values, your own stance may not coincide with everyone elses'. Make sure you identify possible values of others when considering possible solutions.

== Employing Ethical Techniques ==

In professional writing, ethical dimensions begin to surface especially in persuasive writing. When you are trying to persuade other people to make a certain decision or to take action, stay clear of manipulation and misconceptions. At times, you may be misleading someone unintentionally. In persuasive writing, you must respect the readers values and viewpoints. Do not use false or skewed facts or argue from such premises because you may deceive the reader(s) and cause them to make an unlawful decision.

Avoiding manipulation when writing persuasively is also key. Sometimes you may be aware of the readers point. If so,  you must make sure not to use this personal information against them in your writing. It is unethical to persuade readers to make a decision that benefits yourself and not them. Most times, people try to manipulate others to receive some type of reward or gain.

To avoid using misleading or manipulating words and phrases, it is important to be open to alternative viewpoints. In preparing any type of persuasive writing, you will come across conflicting viewpoints, so being aware of other views should not be hard. Keep your readers' ideas and goals in mind and consider what lies behind their concerns. To help solve these problems it may also be good to make statements based on human values. Discussing several opinions and ideas on the subject will make you more persuasive, because most viewpoints will be included to prevent you from appearing biased. 

==Legal Issues and Communication==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Ethics/Legal Issues|This section]] presents information about legal aspects of communication which will help ensure that your writing is free of legal concerns.

==Appreciating Different Cultures==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Ethics/Cultures|This section]] discusses the importance of considering diversity when writing because our world is multicultural, and your writing needs to reflect our world in that regard.

==Ethics Decision Checklist==
* What is the nature of the ethical dilemma?
* What are the specific aspects of this dilemma that make you uncomfortable?
* What are your competing obligations in this dilemma?
* What advice does a trusted supervisor or mentor offer?
* Does your company's code of conduct address this issue?
* Does your professional association's code of conduct address this issue?
* What are you unwilling to do? What are you willing to do?
* How will you explain or justify your decision?

=== Intent ===
* To simplify creation of complex template-based types
* To synthesize a new type or types based on template argument(s)
* To localize default policies when policy-based class design is used

=== Also Known As ===
Templated Typedef Idiom

=== Motivation ===
Class templates designed using policy-based class design technique, often result into very flexible templates with multiple type parameters. One downside of such class templates is that, too many type parameters must be provided when their instances are created. Default template parameters come handy in such cases. However, all the intermediate template parameters need to be specified anyways when the last template parameter (policy class) is different from the default. 

For example, consider a case where special purpose allocators are used with standard C++ containers. GNU C++ compiler provides many special purpose allocators in namespace ''__gnu_cxx'' as extensions of the standard C++ library. Consider the following standard map template instantiation with malloc allocator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::map &lt;std::string, int, less&lt;std::string&gt;, __gnu_cxx::malloc_allocator&lt;std::string&gt; &gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A variation of the above map using ''float'' instead of an ''int'' requires all the unrelated type parameters to be mentioned again.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::map &lt;std::string, float, less&lt;std::string&gt;, __gnu_cxx::malloc_allocator&lt;std::string&gt; &gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Type generator idiom is used to reduce code bloat in such cases.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
In type generator idiom, common (invariant) parts of a family of type definitions are collected together in a structure, whose sole purpose is to generate another type. For example, consider the ''Directory'' template shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class Value&gt;
struct Directory
{
  typedef std::map &lt;std::string, Value, std::less&lt;std::string&gt;, 
                    __gnu_cxx::malloc_allocator&lt;std::string&gt; &gt; type;
};

Directory&lt;int&gt;::type    // gives a map of string to integers.
Directory&lt;float&gt;::type  // gives a map of string to floats.
&lt;/source&gt;

An extra level of indirection (''struct Directory'') is used to capture the invariant part and one or two template parameters are left open for customization. A type generator usually consolidates a complicated type expression into a simple one. A type generator can be used to generate more than one type by simply adding more typedefs.

For example, consider how standard STL algorithms are applied to maps. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Directory&lt;int&gt;::type age; // This is a map.
transform(age.begin(), age.end(),
          std::ostream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;),
          _Select1st&lt;std::map&lt;std::string, int&gt;::value_type&gt; ());
&lt;/source&gt;

An adapter that transforms map's value_type, which is a pair, into the first element of the pair. ''_Select1st'' does the job of adapter in the example above. Its type is needlessly complex with ample opportunity of typing it wrong when repeated multiple times. Instead, type generator idiom simplifies type specification of the adapter considerably.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class Value&gt;
struct Directory
{
  typedef map &lt;string, Value, less&lt;string&gt;, __gnu_cxx::malloc_allocator&lt;std::string&gt; &gt; type;
  typedef _Select1st&lt;typename type::value_type&gt; KeySelector;
  typedef _Select2nd&lt;typename type::value_type&gt; ValueSelector;
};
Directory&lt;int&gt;::type age;    // This is a map.
transform(age.begin(), age.end(),
          std::ostream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;),
          Directory&lt;int&gt;::KeySelector());
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, type generator can be used to conveniently change the invariant type parameters, if needed. For example, changing ''malloc_allocator'' to ''debug_allocator'' throughout the program. The main reason why you might sometimes want to change it is to get more useful information from bounds-checking or leak-detection tools while debugging. Using type generators such a program-wide effect can be achieved by simply changing it at one place.

Personal ethics can't be discarded and only with difficulty ignored, they can be changed, extended and will evolve but that takes time it's not a switch you can turn on or off ethics, at its core, is the application of personal moral rules.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:51, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

The next set of important brush tools are called the ''CSG tools''. ''CSG'' in this case stands for ''Constructive solid geometry'' which, in a nutshell allows you to cut and merge brushes, as well hollowing them. The tools are called ''CSG Subtract'', CSG Merge'' and Hollow.

==''CSG Subtract''==
[[Image:SubtractRadiant.png|thumb|right|upright=0.5]]
This tool allows you to &quot;cut out&quot; or &quot;subtract&quot; one brush with another. See the figure with the purple and olive brush. Modelers know this as a ''Boolean'' operation. To use ''CSG Subtract'' intersect two or more brushes, then select the brush you want to cut with, in the example, this was the olive one. Then press the first ''CSG Subtract'' button in the toolbar [[Image:SubtractButtonRadiant.png]].

If you then delete the brush you cut with, you should now find that there's a hole in the other brush(es) where that brush was. If you select the brushes left, you will most likely see that they have split up into smaller brushes. This is because all brushes in the ''id tech 3'' engine (and therefore in ''GtkRadiant'') have to be convex.

This tool is very useful to make holes into brushes when placing doors etc. But be careful, if you use this with to complex objects, you might find yourself with an excessive number of brushes as result. So if you want to do arches or other round things, you're probably better off with {{GtkRGloss|patch|''patches''}} and ''end caps''.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==''CSG Merge''==
[[Image:MergeRadiant.png|thumb|left|upright=0.5]]
This tools function is very simple, it merges multiple brushes into one brush. So to use it, select two or more brushes '''which align with each other on at least one side'''. Then press the ''CSG Merge'' button the in toolbar. [[Image:MergeButtonRadiant.png]]

Generally, the reason why you only can merge aligning brushes is the same reason as for the subtract, ''id tech 3'''s inability to handle concave brushes. So a rule of thumb would be that any two brushes which when merged would become a concave brush cant be merged.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==''Hollow''==
[[Image:HollowRadiant.png|thumb|right|upright=0.5]]
The Hollow tool allows you to (surprise) make a brush hollow. This replace the original brush with six brushes, making up the sides of the brush you had. The &quot;side&quot; brushes will be as thick as the grid size you have selected. This tool does however overlap the brushes in the corners, which should be avoided, so when using this tool, always fix the overlapping corners.

To use it, simply select the brush you want to hollow, make sure you have chosen the grid size you want, and click the hollow button in the toolbar.</text>

      <comment>/* Intent */ Currently, there is only one intent.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Object Generator&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To simplify creation of objects without explicitly specifying their types. (This is not the factory method pattern)

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
In C++ template programming, types of objects  can get really large and incomprehensible even in small programs. For example, the following type (''Wrapper'') is a standard unary function object that wraps the member function ''read_line'' in class ''File''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct File
{
  int read_line (std::string);
};
typedef std::mem_fun1_t&lt;int, File, std::string&gt; Wrapper;
&lt;/source&gt;

Reading a collection of files using the ''for_each'' STL algorithm, without object generators, looks like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void read_lines(std::vector&lt;File *&gt; files)
{
   typedef std::mem_fun1_t&lt;int, File, std::string&gt; Wrapper;  
   std::string arg;
   for_each(files.begin(), files.end(),
      std::binder2nd&lt;Wrapper&gt;(Wrapper(&amp;File::read_line), arg));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code is pretty much unreadable and more bloated than necessary. Even typedefs don't improve readability as placeholder typedefs like ''Wrapper'' are distracting. The ''object generator'' idiom alleviates the situation.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
In the ''object generator'' idiom, a template function is created whose only job is to construct a new object from its parameters. It is based on a useful property of function templates which class templates don't have: The type parameters of a function template are deduced automatically from its actual parameters. For example, consider a simple object generator defined in STL: ''make_pair''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
std::pair &lt;T, U&gt; 
make_pair(T t, U u)
{
  return std::pair &lt;T, U&gt; (t,u);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''make_pair'' returns an instance of the ''pair'' template depending on the actual parameters of the ''make_pair'' function. For example, ''make_pair(1,1.0)'' creates an object of type: ''std::pair&lt;int, double&gt;'' by automatically deducing the types of the objects being passed to the object generator function. ''make_pair'' is particularly handy in the case where a generated pair object does not need to be stored in a local variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
map &lt;int, double&gt; m;
m.insert (make_pair(1,1.0)); // No need to know how pair template is instantiated.
&lt;/source&gt;

The C++ standard library defines several object generators to avoid code bloat. ''std::bind2nd'' and ''std::mem_fun'' are two such standard object generators that can be used to avoid code bloat in the example shown in the motivation section above.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void read_lines(std::vector&lt;File *&gt; files)
{
   std::string arg;
   for_each(files.begin(), files.end(), bind2nd(mem_fun(&amp;File::read_line), arg));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Known Uses ===
C++ standard library (mem_fun, make_pair, bind1st, bind2nd etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Dharma Rae Wilding.I am a special education major, and plan to do home bound teaching when I get my degree. I am originally from the San Francisco bay area. I have lived in Southwest Virginia about 45 years, but I am still a California girl. I am 60 years old and live alone with 4 dogs. I have been told I'm a little eccentric, but people who like me think of it as being unique, original and a free spirit.
 
I've been single a little over 20 years, and the freedom is wonderful. I have 3 grown children ages 34 to 44, with a boy on each end and a girl in the middle. I have 3 grandchildren, 2 girls and a boy by my sons. I'm an organic gardener and have been an environmentalist all my adult life. If we don't save the whales we certainly won't be able to save ourselves.

My teaching philosophy is the same as my life’s philosophy. With enough of the right kind of attention and encouragement every human being has the opportunity to reach their full potential. The right kind of attention and encouragement is different for every individual. Home bound teaching will give me the opportunity to teach   each unique individual in a way that will maximize their opportunity for developing their full potential no matter where their interests and talents lie.</text>

      <comment>/* Bezier Curve tool */ added a reference to the node control handles</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Todo|Created by taking over from [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Tutorial_for_Vectorial_graphism]. Needs to be rewritten; a beginning transition is missing.}}

The next three buttons as we go downwards are used for drawing paths. A path is a mathematical curve that is specified by a number of points that the path must curve through. Taking them out of order, lets look at the middle one, the bezier curve tool.

===Bezier Curve tool===

[[Image:InkscapeBezierButtonAndCurve.png]]

&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

Above is an example of a bezier curve. You can see two nodes in this view. These are the start and end nodes of the curve. But there are node control handles that you cannot see. These determine how the line curves between the end nodes. In order to see those nodes you need to click on the node editing button.

===Node tool===
[[Image:InkscapeNodeTool.png]]

&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

Clicking on the node tool reveals another node in the middle of the curve.

If you then click on the middle node you will see the bezier handles appear.

[[Image:InkscapeBezierHandles.png]]

&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

These handles allow you to change the shape of the curves between the nodes. Notice that a list of node tools appear at the top. You can use these to change the nodes. We will not go into detail about these tools in this beginners tutorial.

The node tool can be used on all the objects created with the other tools to reveal their nodes.

===More on the drawing tools===

The other two drawing tools also create paths. The top tool of the three is the scribble tool. Use it like a pencil. The computer will calculate all the nodes and beziers for you. Closed paths can be created by drawing a loop. (With the bezier tool, click on the start node to close the curve).

The last tool in the group is the calligraphy tool. It allows you to do calligraphic writing. The pen creates closed loops in a realistic pen nib like way. Because of this many graphic artists like to draw with this pen all the time.

===Selection tool===
This tool allows you to select objects, resize them and move them about. If you click twice on an object with the selection tool, the handles change and you are able to rotate an object. Click a third time to switch to the object's tool.

[[Image:InkscapeSelectionRotation.png]]

&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

===Zoom tool===
This tool looks like a magnifying glass with a + sign in it. Drag the tool over an area to zoom in. Shift and click to zoom out again.

You can zoom in and out with the '''+''' and '''-''' keys, respectively. (These keys are to the left of the Backspace key, and on the right side of the numeric keypad.) Another shortcut to zoom in is '''Ctrl-middle click''' or '''Ctrl-right click'''. ('''Shift-Ctrl-middle click''' or '''Shift-Ctrl-right click''' zooms out.)

Inkscape keeps a record of your previous zoom levels. To go back to a zoom level, use '''`'''; to go ahead to a zoom level, use '''Shift-`'''.

===Text tool===
Keyboard Shortcut - '''F8''' or '''T'''

Looks like a letter A. Click and drag an area where you want your text to go, then start typing! If the letters are too small, click on the select button, then drag the handles to make it bigger. There are a lot of things that you can do with text that are beyond the scope of this beginners tutorial.

===Connector tool===

Use this to draw a connection between two objects. For example, a drawing and a label.

[[Image:InkscapeConnector.png|200px]]

&lt;br clear =all&gt;

The nice thing about using this tool is that if you decide to move the objects about on the canvas, the connector still maintains the connection.


===Gradient tool===
[[File:Inkscape icons color gradient.svg|Inkscape icons color gradient]]

Click the gradient tool button in the Inkscape tool bar, then click and drag on an object and you will create a gradient from a fully opaque colour to full transparency. The gradient tool can be used to edit an existing gradient, adjust colour stops by dragging and placing the gradient handles that appear over an object when the tool is active.

===Colour Sampler tool===
[[File:Inkscape icons color picker.svg|Inkscape icons color picker]]

The colour sampler, or &quot;eyedropper&quot; tool can be used to sample any colour in the inkscape window.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So you've become an administrator on a MediaWiki project, or you just want to know what the differences are between an administrator and a normal MediaWiki user?  This Wikibook is intended to help with the job and try to explain the special functions available to an administrator. It also covers some of the things you need to avoid when trying to do your job.

This book is not a policy manual, although links to existing policies on several Wikimedia projects have been provided for reference purposes.  This book is about '''How-to admin''' in the general sense and is appropriate to any project using the MediaWiki software.

An important point to note here is that while most Wikimedia sister projects use the term ''administrator'' or ''admin'' to mean a person who has been granted &quot;Sysop&quot; privileges with the MediaWiki software, most MediaWiki documentation usually uses the term Moderator instead.  This Wikibook is not dealing with any of the software configuration issues that are associated with low-level operating system commands and configuration files directly associated with the use of the MediaWiki software.  Most MediaWiki documentation calls these individuals administrators, but with Wikimedia sister projects these individuals are usually called developers instead, as the MediaWiki software developers also do the low-level software configuration for Wikimedia projects.  Instead, the term administrator is going to apply to the project moderators and following Wikimedia sister project conventions and hierarchies.

The specific permissions granted to an administrator on a MediaWiki project can differ. This book covers the full set of permissions that might be granted but on the particular project you are interested in you may find that some functions listed here are unavailable.

See the [[MediaWiki Developer's Handbook]] for a book on how to &quot;hack&quot; Mediawiki to customize the software, add an extension, or contribute to Mediawiki development.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/37.55.189.140|37.55.189.140]] ([[User talk:37.55.189.140|talk]]) to last version by Jomegat</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Headings are created using sequences of &quot;=&quot; characters, placed before the heading title and after the heading title, on the same line. The level of headings is determined by the number of &quot;=&quot; characters.

Examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Level
! Example
|-
| 2.
| ==Plants==
|-
| 3.
| ===Plants===
|-
| 4.
| ====Plants====
|}

==Start level: 2==

Do not use headings of level 1, such as &quot;=Title=&quot;; start with level 2 instead. The heading at level 1 is used for the title of the page.

==Maximum level: 6==

The maximum level of a heading is 6, rendered using &lt;nowiki&gt;======Heading L6======&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Entering a heading with 7 equals-signs such as &lt;nowiki&gt;=======Heading L7=======&lt;/nowiki&gt; results in the creation of a heading of the level 6, with one equal-sign becoming part of the text of the heading: &quot;=Heading L7=&quot;.

==Spaces==

Depending on the convention that users and editors adopt, there can be any number of spaces between the &quot;=&quot; characters and the title.

An example without spaces:

 ==Plants==

An example with spaces:

 == Plants ==

==Table of contents==

By default, the titles of headings appear in the table of contents, shown at the top of the page. To prevent having a table of contents, put the &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;__NOTOC__&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; sequence of characters into the page. To force the presence of table of contents on a specific place of the page, use &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;__TOC__&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

==Headings not in TOC==

There is no simple way to make a heading not appear in the table of contents. For a complex way requiring the adjustment of the MediaWiki software, see [[Meta:Help:Section]].

==Customizing TOC==

There are various ways how to customize the table of contents. For instance, to place it to the right, use:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; clear:both; margin-left:0.5em;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Editability of sections==

By default, all sections are editable separately, without the need to see the complete text of the page. 

To make all the sections on a page non-editable, place &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOEDITSECTION__&lt;/nowiki&gt; anywhere on the page.

There is no simple way to make a single section non-editable, AFAIK.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Memory Management/Page}}

== Memory Allocations ==

In most native executable programs, there are two types of memory available: stack-based and heap-based memory. 

== Stacks ==

The system stack, for those systems that have them, are used most often to provide '''frames'''. A frame is a way to localize information about subroutines. In general, a subroutine must have in its frame the return address (where to jump back to when the subroutine completes), the function's input parameters. When a subroutine is called, all this information is pushed onto the stack in a specific order. When the function returns, all these values on the stack are popped back off, reclaimed to the system for later use with a different function call. In addition, subroutines can also use the stack as storage for local variables.

This whole dance, the process of creating frames on the stack and reclaiming them happens mostly transparently, and is handled by the compiler. The programmer is typically not aware of this process, and doesn't need to specifically account for it.

One pitfall to worry about can occur when a local array is allocated on the stack. If the function writes to a memory location beyond the end of the array, a problem called a '''stack overflow''' occurs. A stack overflow is a problem because data values are stored tightly on the stack and in an overflow you can accidentally overwrite these values. As was mentioned before, the function's return value is stored on the stack. So if this value is overwritten, the function will not return to the correct location. A diligent hacker can use this fact to overflow the stack with very specific values, such as the address of virus code in memory.

Stack storage is fixed. That is, the space allocated on the stack is set at compile time by the compiler and is not altered while the program executes.

== Heap Storage ==

The heap is an area of dynamically-allocated memory that is managed automatically by the operating system or the memory manager library. Memory on the heap is allocated, deallocated, and resized regularly during program execution, and this can lead to a problem called '''fragmentation'''. Fragmentation occurs when memory objects are allocated with small spaces in between that are too small to hold additional memory objects. The net result is a percentage of the heap space that is not usable for further memory allocations.

Heaps are also susceptible to overflow situations, although the results are typically not as dire as in a stack overflow. It's not impossible for a hacker to disrupt the system through a heap overflow, but it's particularly difficult.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following is an overview of text formatting available in Mediawiki:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Basic text formatting
! Formatting
! Markup
! Note
|-
| Boldface
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
| Italics
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''text''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
| Boldface and italics
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''''text'''''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
| Boldface combined with wikilink
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''[[text]]'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| The reverse order of ticks and brackets does not work: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[['''text''']]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Other text formatting such as underline or blockquote needs to be done using HTML tags, including U for underline, TT for typewriter text, S for strikethrough, SUB for lower index and SUP for upper index.

==HTML==

Text formatting can also be done using HTML and CSS. Some of the most useful HTML elements are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Most needed HTML markup
! Task
! Markup
! Note
|-
| Preformatted text
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 preformatted
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| The effect in wiki differs from the one in HTML; in wiki, the text within the PRE element is treated as within NOWIKI element, leaving all the HTML and wiki markup uninterpreted.
|-
| Blockquote
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Longer passage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Comments
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- comment --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| Avoid nesting, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;!-- comment --&gt; --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Generic inline element
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;TODO&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| Can be styled arbitrarily using cascading style sheets - CSS.
|-
| Generic block element
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;TODO&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| Can be styled arbitrarily using cascading style sheets - CSS.
|}

Some HTML elements are not allowed, such as A and IMG.

==Source code==

Source code of various programming and markup languages can be formatted using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; element, which leads to '''colored syntax''' of the code.

An example of wiki markup:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The rendering of that markup:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of hyperlinks in MediaWiki: internal, also called wikilinks, and external.

== Internal hyperlinks ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Task
! Markup
! Note
|-
| Internal hyperlink
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[[keyword]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Internal hyperlink 2
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[[keyword]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Internal hyperlink  to a section
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[[keyword#section_heading|link title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Internal hyperlink showing a different word
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[[keyword|its appearance]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Internal hyperlink with a tooltip
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[[keyword|&lt;span title=&quot;A tooltip&quot;&gt;its appearance&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Internal hyperlink in bold
| &lt;nowiki&gt;'''[[keyword]]'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|}

== External hyperlinks ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Task
! Markup
! Note
|-
| External hyperlink
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[URL_containing_no_spaces title of the URL]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|} 

== Redirecting ==

Readers and editors from different backgrounds search for the same topic under different titles, such as TODO. To avoid replication of similar content and confusion of editors and readers, the editors of a wiki website usually choose one topic title as the authorized one, under which the content is to be created, and let one or more alternative topic titles redirect to it.

To '''let a page title redirect''' to another one, create a page with the unauthorized (or minor) title, containing only the following text:

&lt;pre&gt;
#REDIRECT [[Authorized topic title]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

An alternative markup; notice the additional &quot;:&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;
#REDIRECT: [[Authorized topic title]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

If an unauthorized topic title has more possible target authorized topic titles, redirecting does not do. In that case, a '''disambiguation page''' can be created, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;
The term '''unauthorized term''' may refer to:
* [[Authorized topic title 1]]
* [[Authorized topic title 2]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The exact wording depends on the kind of content of the wiki website.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <comment>start, based on [[Meta:Help:Category]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Pages in wiki can be put into categories, by placing a category assignment anywhere in them. An example:

&lt;pre&gt;
 [[Category:Birds]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Categories have their own namespace &quot;Category:&quot;, and are pages of sorts too. A category can be put into another category, so the categories can form a hierarchy or other structures.

A list of uncategorized pages can be shown by Mediawiki software.

There is no easy way to rename a category; all its pages need to be edited and the line of category assignment changed.

==Linking==

A wikilink to a category needs to start with &quot;:&quot;, such as

&lt;pre&gt;
See also [[:Category:Birds]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Otherwise, the page is put into the category instead of linking to it, and the wikilink is not shown.

==Templates==
Categories can be used in templates, just like in mainspace pages. However, when you put a category assignment into a template, all the pages using that template become a member of that category. That is sometimes the required effect, but it may be unwanted, for instance when you want to categorize the templates rather than the pages that use the templates. For that case, embrace the category assignment into &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;
[[Category:Maintenance templates]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Templates provide a means to repeat the same text on several pages. More advanced templates make use of parameters, and even of control structures as found in programming languages. That said, basic templates are quite easy to create, requiring no knowledge of programming.

Templates have their own &quot;Template:&quot; namespace.

To create a template called &quot;header&quot;, edit the page &quot;Template:header&quot; and place the text to be repeated into that template.

To use the template in a page, type &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. What marks the use of the template are the &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; characters, also known as curly brackets.

To replace the name of the template with its contents directly in the source wikitext before the text is saved, use &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;.

==Parameters==

Templates can have unnamed and named parameters. The unnamed parameters are automatically numbered.

To use an unnamed parameter inside a template, refer to it using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and the like. Notice the ''three'' curly brackets.

To use a named parameter inside a template, refer to it using the same curly brackets and the name, instead of a number, like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{parameter_name}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

To pass a parameter to a template when you use it in a mainspace page:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{header|apple}}
{{header|parameter=apple}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

To pass equality sign (=) in the value of an unnamed parameter, you need a workaround: use, for the parameter number one, &lt;nowiki &gt;{{template|1=text=with=equality=sign}}.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Documentation==

Templates that are to be used by many users are worth documenting. One option is to document them on their talk pages. Another is to document them in their main text, and surround the documentation with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. A plus side of the second option is that users who want to learn how the template works can see its syntax on the same view as the template if they are experimenting with its code.

==Control structures==
Control structures such as ''if'' and ''switch'' are available, if the [[mw:Extension:ParserFunctions|ParserFunctions]] extension of MediaWiki is installed.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Overview of control structures
! Keyword
! Syntax
! Note
|-
| #SWITCH
|
&lt;pre style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
{{#switch: &lt;comparison value&gt;
 | &lt;value1&gt; = &lt;result1&gt;
 | &lt;value2&gt; = &lt;result2&gt;
 | ...
 | &lt;valuen&gt; = &lt;resultn&gt;
 | &lt;default result&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
|-
| #IF
|
&lt;pre style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
{{ #if: &lt;condition string&gt; | &lt;code if true&gt; }}
{{ #if: &lt;condition string&gt; | &lt;code if true&gt;
                           | &lt;code if false&gt; }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
| The condition string is considered true if it is non-empty and not consisting only of whitespace.
|-
| #IFEQ
|
&lt;pre style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
{{ #ifeq: &lt;text 1&gt; | &lt;text 2&gt; | &lt;code if equal&gt; }}
{{ #ifeq: &lt;text 1&gt; | &lt;text 2&gt; | &lt;code if equal&gt;
                              | &lt;code if not equal&gt; }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
|-
| #IFEXISTS
|
&lt;pre style=&quot;border: none;&quot;&gt;
{{ #ifexist: &lt;page name&gt; 
             | &lt;wikitext if page exists&gt;
             | &lt;wikitext if page does not exist&gt; }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

==Transcluding any page==
Above, you have learned how to use a template, that is, to let MediaWiki replace the name of the template surrounded by curly brackets with the contents of the template. In similar fashion, you can ''transclude'' any page, not just a template, by writing the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{:Pagename}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This works for pages in the mainspace. To include any page in any namespace, use: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Namespace:Pagename}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The use of a template is in fact a special case of this use, just that, as you do not specify any namespace, the Template namespace is used as the default one.

This does not work with some namespaces, such as the Special and Category namespaces.

==Substitution==
The method of using templates described in the preceding sections leads to an ''inclusion'' of templates, meaning that the source text of the page contains the name of the template surrounded by curly bracket, not its content. There is however another use of templates, in which the content of the template is written directly into the wiki page before the page is saved. This use is called ''substitution'' and is achieved as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{subst:Template}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
In a more advanced use, it may be required that control structures such as #if that are present in the substituted template are substituted too, which would seem to be achieved using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:#if ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. However, this would lead to a substitution at the time of saving the template, which is undersirable. A solution: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;subst:#if ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;noinclude&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mediawiki supports the use of images in various formats. In order to be used in a wiki, image first needs to be uploaded, to which we come later. 

== Placing images ==

The following is an overview of placing images into pages, such images that have already been uploaded.

== Galleries ==
Images can be put into a gallery as follows. Notice the absent &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; around the names of the image files.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:name_1.png
Image:name_2.jpeg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Images in galleris can be given captions, as follows.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:name_1.png | Caption 1.
Image:name_2.jpeg | Caption 2.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Ba Chun Do form teaches the use of short-range weapons.

The sword form is the sixth and final Wing Chun form. It comes last partly because of the wrist strength needed and partly because practicing is dangerous. It takes time for a beginning martial artist to develop the focused power needed to properly control a one-handed sword. Even if the student is strong enough, control is likely to be off and practice partners are likely to be hurt.

==Opening and Empty Hand==
#Begin in a loose position of attention facing East. Left hand is at your side. Right hand is near waist, holding the hilts of the swords. Blades are forward.
#Raise left hand to shoulder level, then bring left hand back to rest position while bending knees.
#Circle step left then circle step right, ending in basic stance.
#*''Application'': Mobility is very important with the swords. You have a short-range weapon, so you'll need to move fast to get into range without being hit by a longer-range weapon.
#Left hand Angle Punch.
#*''Application'': Don't forget that your empty-hand techniques are still available.
#Open left hand so palm faces right and fingers point forward. Do four vertical wrist blocks, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. Turn palm down. Do four horizontal wrist blocks, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Turn palm up, Huen Sau, return to rest position.
#*''Tip'': Practicing with the swords is a good way to start building wrist strength. Do lots of chops, and otherwise just practice a lot with them. Weight training and fingertip pushups are also good once you know what muscles you need.
#*''Note'': This movement obviously does not build up wrist strength. It is meant to demonstrate that you have powerful wrists. Doing the wrist blocks in fours is meant to show that you are stronger than when you learned Bil Jie, which does wrist blocks in threes.
#Shift to face left.
#Right foot steps forward, bringing feet together. Maintain height. At the same time bring left hand to the sword hilts.
#Look to left then Side Kick to left.
#Plant left foot into basic stance. At the same time, bounce the swords up and grab the hilts normally. Bring hands and swords up to Jong Do position, hands a few inches apart.
#*''Tip'': Both hands are in Jong Do, not one in Jong Do and one in Wu Do.

==Chop and Thrust==
#Left hand forward chop. Right hand forward chop. Left hand forward chop. Right hand forward chop.
#Right Biu Do. Left Biu Do. Right Biu Do. Left Biu Do.
#Draw both hands back slightly, then High-low Gahn Do to left with shift. High-low Gahn Do to right with shift. High-low Gahn Do to left with shift. High-low Gahn Do to right with shift.
#Shift forward and do right hand Circling Chop forward. Both swords end up in Jong Do.
#*''Application'': Circling chop is slower but more powerful.
#Repeat to the opposite side.

==Bong-Do==
#Left Bong Do, shifting right. Right hand is in Wu Do. Right Bong Do with shift. Left Bong Do with shift. Right Bong Do with shift.
#Right sword circles in front of and above left. Double chop with both swords, right first.
#*''Tip'': The exact way you do return to double Jong Do depends on the length of your swords. Generally, bring the Wu Do sword down and back slightly as you roll your forward wrist so the Bong Do blade circles toward your head before pointing upward with the blade facing forward.
#Repeat to the opposite side.

==Y-Block==

===Applications===
*Useful against a single long sword or a pole weapon.
*Do not use this trap when your opponent has two weapons. You will be using both of yours to trap one of his.
*You can use the same trap on a weapon to your side. For instance, if your opponent has a long pole, steer it to your side with Tan Do. Then shift enough to bring your other blade in contact and trap the pole. Depending on your blades and how you hold them, you may be able to charge your opponent while dragging your blades along the pole.
*Be ready to move quickly toward your opponent. One counter to the Y-block is to withdraw the long weapon straight away from you and back toward the opponent.
*Shift with the block when catching a weapon from above. If you miss or are unable to hold it, you don't want to be where it's going.

===Steps===
#Shift right and perform a Y-block, left sword in front. The blades are outward and the hooks are together
#*''Application'': Catch a descending blade or pole with the blade and hook. You can then turn the blades to lock the opponent's weapon.
#Huen Do with left blade as you shift forward, then both swords come to a double chop.
#Repeat to the opposite side.

==Quan Do==
#Low Bong Do to left with shift, at the same time doing a left Tan Do. The hilts should be close to each other. This double-block is called Quan Do. Quan Do to right with shift. Quan Do to left with shift.
#*''Application'': Block an attack coming in from the side. This double block leaves your Tan Do hand more exposed than in the High-Low Gahn Do, but this might be the best block to use based on hand position.
#Circle right sword to the left of the left sword, coming down to a double chop.
#Draw swords back slightly, separate hands, and turn blades to face each other. Shift left and push blades toward each other. Right blade continues the motion in front of left blade, then circles down and around. Double Chop to the front.
#*''Application'': Chop at a long weapon. Even if the end isn't cut off, the blades should let you control the opponent's weapon briefly so you can run in closer.
#Repeat to the other side.

==Advancing Fuk Do==
#Step forward with right foot and bring left sword to Fuk Do. Right sword is in Wu Do. Step forward left with right Fuk Do. Step forward right with left Fuk Do.
#Step back quickly right-left-right-left, ending in ready stance approximately where you started this section. As you step back, the sword in the opposite hand is forward and moving down to cover centerline.
#*''Tip'': Practice the retreat until you can do it very quickly.
#*''Application'': Retreat while covering from an aggressive attack. The fast footwork is supposed to get you away quickly while the fast swordwork confuses the opponent.

==Muen Do==
#Muen Do to left, shifting left to face West. Right sword is in a rear guard to the left, close to ribs.
#*''Tip'': Leading leg's knee is turned in. Most weight is on the rear leg.
#*''Tip'': For the form, the blades should both be parallel to the ground. Upper (Muen Do) blade is edge up and Wu Do blade is edge down.
#*''Application'': Respond to a new opponent coming from off centerline. Muen Do is intended to lift all attacks in its sweep.
#Drop both swords to a low guard, facing West.
#Shuffle step forward, to the West, lifting left sword into Muen Do and right sword into Wu Do to West. Drop swords to low guard. Shuffle step, lifting swords into Muen Do and Wu Do.
#Shift right to face East, lowering both swords in front of you as you pass North, then lifting right sword into Muen Do and left sword into Wu Do to the East.
#Drop swords to low guard. Shuffle step East, lifting swords into Muen Do and Wu Do. Drop swords to low guard. Shuffle step East, lifting swords into Muen Do and Wu Do.
#Shift left to face North, bringing both swords to Jut Do.

==Advancing Biu Do==
#Step forward with right foot, thrusting left sword forward. Right sword is in Wu Do. Step forward with left foot, thrusting right sword forward. Step forward with right foot, thrusting left sword forward.
#Step back quickly right-left-right-left, ending in ready stance approximately where you started this section. As you step back, the sword in the opposite hand is forward and moving down to cover centerline.

==Advancing Tan Do==
#Step forward with right foot, moving right sword into Tan Do and thrusting left sword forward. Step forward with left foot with left Tan Do and right Biu Do. Step forward with right foot with right Tan Do and left Biu Do.
#*''Application'': The Tan Do is on the same side as the step to prevent you from turning too far as you advance. If you were meeting an incoming attack you would normally turn into the Tan Do (or Tan Sau) to shift the attack away from your centerline. When advancing, it's more important to keep moving toward the target. But of course you should stay flexible to respond to whatever attack your opponent makes as you advance.
#Step back quickly right-left-right-left, ending in ready stance approximately where you started this section. As you step back, the sword in the opposite hand is forward and moving down to cover centerline.

==Advancing Quan Do==
#Step forward with right foot, moving right sword into Tan Do and left sword into low Bong Do. Step forward with left foot, moving swords into leftward Quan Do. Step forward with right foot, moving swords into rightward Quan Do.
#Step back quickly right-left-right-left, ending in ready stance approximately where you started this section. As you step back, the sword in the opposite hand is forward and moving down to cover centerline.

==Arm Sword==

===Applications===
If you're too close for sword work, put the blades along your arms and fight as if empty handed.

===Notes===
This is why the swords are not sharp along the entire edge. 

===Steps===
#Put your left thumb in the hook, then rotate the sword around the thumb so the blade is along your left forearm, edge facing forward. Shift right and make a punching motion to the right so the blade moves in a slicing motion. Shift left with a short elbow jab to the left, then pivot the sword back into a normal grip.
#*''Application'': For close-in fighting you can fight almost as if you were empty handed. Fold the swords along your forearms to strengthen your strikes.
#*''Application'': The slicing arm motion is throat cutting.
#*''Application'': If the sword extends past your elbow, the tip makes your side elbow strike more effective.
#*''Application'': The sword hilt makes a punch more effective.
#Repeat with the right hand.
#Pivot right sword and bring both swords to Jong Do.

==Closing==

===Notes===
No practical applications here 

===Steps===
#Bring hands and swords together in front of body. Transfer the right sword to the left hand and at the same time change the left hand grip so the swords are along the left forearm and the back edges of the swords are in the left elbow.
#Bring the right hand back to rest position and the left elbow back near the ribs. Come up to a normal standing posture and bring the right foot alongside the left foot. Press down with the right hand so it ends near the right hip.

==Training Tips==
*Practice on the dummy
*Use tonfas or even plain dowels for safer and less destructive practice

==Key Points==
*Even though Ba Chun Do literally means &quot;Eight Way Swords&quot;, don't knock yourself out finding eight different attacks. &quot;Eight Way&quot; is a Buddhist term, not a sword term.
*Many sword techniques are derived from open hand techniques. The same concepts apply but you will have to retrain your muscles. Use the sword as if it were your forearm in many open hand techniques.
*Don't forget to use hands and feet if appropriate.
*Wrist power and arm strength are very important. There's no point in blocking an opponent's strike if your wrist isn't strong enough to hold the block.
*Mobility is the counter-point to wrist strength. If you aren't strong enough to block an attack, you'll have to use soft blocks and move your body rapidly and agilely to flow around the attacks.
*Ba Chun Do techniques apply to any short-ranged weapon. &quot;Short ranged&quot; in practice means anything you can use with one hand. (&quot;Long ranged&quot; weapons are something big enough to need two hands and which can keep an opponent at a distance.)
*Ba Chun Do are used in pairs. Many of the techniques may be performed with only one sword, but the style as a whole requires two swords, just like the Wing Chun open hand style uses both hands.

==Conclusion==
See also books and videos on tonfa use. Many tonfa techniques work with Ba Chun Do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Doctoral committee members consider it a part of their responsibilities to suggest research leads and specifics bodies of research. Most established researchers are very knowledgeable about their fields (do not get intimidated; it comes from years and years of reading and conference-going). They may recommend many different resources, names, and specific books and papers. Such recommendations can be anywhere on a continuum from &quot;I vaguely remember something that might be related to your topic&quot; to &quot;This is the essential research you cannot afford to ignore in your dissertation.&quot; Much of doctoral students' confusion comes from their inability to correctly place recommendation on a scale between these two extreme points. When in doubt - ask for clarifications! 

It is rude to ignore or forget your adviser's or committee member's suggestions; it is also counter-productive, because they wish you to succeed. However, if you have good reasons not to follow the advice, state these reasons as clearly as you can, and discuss them with the advisor. 

Some committee members will disagree with each other about the direction and theoretical foundations of your research project. This is very normal; scholarship community thrives on disagreements and discussion. The best strategy for you is to engage the disagreements on the pages of your dissertation. However, if you fell a dispute becomes less professional, and more personal, talk to your main adviser. It is the advisor's responsibility to negotiate any conflicts within the committee in such a way that it does not harm your progress. To avoid finding yourself in a difficult situation, be deliberate and careful about forming your committee in the first place; make sure your main advisor has good working relationship with the rest of the committee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Technology Planning|The Educator's Guide}}


A '''technology plan''' is an important document for every educational institution. It is so important that some states, such as Pennsylvania, have incorporated the technology plan into the state-required strategic plan. This book is based on the knowledge, experience, and learnings of a group of graduate students and their professor.

This goal of this book is to offer insight and methodology into the best practices that should be followed to for a valid technology plan that is created, supported, and accepted by all stakeholders. This book is a work in progress and does not yet offer a complete step-by-step guide to Technology Planning. This book does aim to offer a starting point for others to follow and build upon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can enter mathematical formulas into a wiki, using a &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; tag, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The formulas are marked up in the TeX markup, the markup of a complex typesetting system specialized on mathematics.

Before you start writing formulas in this markup, you can consider writing the simpler ones in HTML and wiki markup, such as:

: ''f''(x) = ''b'' + ''c'' / ''d''

which is marked up as 

&lt;pre&gt;
 ''f''(x) = ''b'' + ''c'' / ''d''
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Examples==

To get started, follow the examples below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Important|Please save your work periodically.}}

==Creating the Scene==
*Open ''css-lr300-idle.exp''.
*Go to File&gt;Save As. Save it as ''css-lr300-shoot.exp''.
*Match the scene's FPS with the QC's shoot1/2/3 fps. (You should already know how to do this from the idle animation page.) The fps for the sg552 shoot animation is 35.
*Match the scene's end frame with the SMD's end frame minus one. (16 - 1 = 15). The end frame is 15 for the sg552 shoot animation.
*Find the null ''Frame''. Below the ''Parent'' button, there is a ''CnsComp'' button. Press it.
*Click the word ''Constrain'' above the ''Parent'' button, and click ''Pose''.
*Click the left hand null. Now whenever you rotate or move the hand, the gun will follow it.
*Now constrain the right arm to the left hand.
==Animation Layers==
*Take some time to think about how you can separate parts of the shoot animation into parts. You should come up with the following:
**Base layer (idle animation)
**Trigger pull
**Recoil
**Slide/Bolt recoil
**Shell ejection port opening
*We will work on these one at a time.

==Making an Animation Layer==
*Look to the bottom right of the XSI screen. There should be some tabs that say '''MCP''', '''KP/L''', and '''MAT'''. Click '''KP/L'''.
*On the bottom half of the new side panel, you will see the animation layers panel.
*Change the selection filter to ''Null''. Press '''CTRL+A''' to select all nulls.
{{NOTE|You will need to go to the '''MCP''' panel to change the selection filter.}}
*The ''Create new animation layer'' button will now be activated. Click it.
*Rename the layer to ''Trigger_pull'' by right clicking ''Layer1'' and clicking ''Rename layer''.

==Animating on an Animation Layer==
*Make a key for each item you animate at the 0 position before you set a key later in the animation.
*In some cases you can avoid the trigger rotation as sometimes you cannot see it.
*You are on your own now, contribute tips in this section if you wish.

==DopeSheet Editor==
If you want to move a key in an animation, don't bother deleting keys and then setting them again.
*Press '''0''' to open the Animation Editor.
*On the top of the new window, click ''Editor''.
*Click DopeSheet.
*Click a bone whose key you want to edit.
*Go to the ''KP/L'' panel and select the animation layer for which the bone/null is animated.
*Now the DopeSheet Editor will show up with purple, red, green, and blue rectangles if the bone/null has any keys.
*The top of the DopeSheet editor has key numbers. Drag the purple rectangles to adjust the timing of key frames in the animation.
*To select multiple keys, change the selection tool to 'Region'. Look toward the far right on the button panel on the top of the DopeSheet editor. Click the button with the cursor by a dotted rectangle. Now you can make rectangular selections and drag multiple keys around. Click the button with only a cursor to back to the single selection mode.

==Exporting the Animation==
*Go to ValveSource&gt;Export SMD
*Locate the ''tocompile'' folder, and save it as ''shoot1.smd''.
*Change the type of SMD to Skeletal Animation (*.SMD).
*Check only the optimize chains and compensate box.
*Export the animation.
*Copy and paste ''shoot1.smd'' to ''shoot2.smd'' and ''shoot3.smd''.
*The muzzle flash and shell ejection will be in the wrong place/direction. The next section will deal with this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using MySQL with Java Persistence API is quite straightforward as the JDBC driver is available directly from MySQL web site [http://dev.mysql.com/].

MySQL Connector/J is the official JDBC driver for MySQL and has a good documentation available directly on the web site. 

In this page we will see some aspects of managing MySQL using the Persistence API.

== Installing ==

Installation is straightforward and consists in making the .jar file downloaded from MySQL web site visible to the JVM. It can be already
installed if you are using Apache or JBOSS.

== Configuration tips ==

You can learn a lot from the documentation on MySQL web site [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html].

=== Creating the database automatically ===

If you intend to create table and a database automatically , you will need to have the correct user rights but also inform the Persistence API about the name of the Database you want to create.
For example with TopLink, if you used:
  &lt;property name=&quot;toplink.ddl-generation&quot; value=&quot;create-tables&quot;/&gt;
in the property.xml, you will be likely need to create a new database.
To create the database &quot;NewDB&quot; automatically, you need to give the following URL to the jdbc connection:
  &lt;property name=&quot;toplink.jdbc.url&quot; value=&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/NewDB?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&quot;/&gt;
If not, the persistence API will complain that the database does not exist.

== Evaporation of Liquids==
An open bottle of vinegar standing at room temperature will spread odor across the room despite the fact that it is not boiling.  This is because kinetic energy is unevenly distributed throughout a liquid. Some molecules are moving faster than others.  This allows the liquid to '''evaporate''' into a gas.  In order for evaporation to occur, the entire liquid does not need to be at the boiling temperature; only some individual molecules. At a given temperature a liquid evaporates at a specific rate, causing gas pressure above the liquid in the system that contains it.  Can you guess the vapor pressure of water at 100 degrees Celsius? If you guessed 760 torr or 1 atm, you're right. Liquids boil when their vapor pressures equal the atmospheric pressure around them. Some liquids are more '''volatile''' than others, meaning they evaporate more readily.

[[Image:Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution 1.png|thumb|center|A Boltzmann distribution at various temperatures.]]
Evaporation occurs because of the uneven distribution of kinetic energy.  This is called a ''Boltzmann distribution''.  Although the average kinetic energy of the liquid is below the boiling point, some molecules have above average energy.  That gives them enough energy to overcome their bonds and break free of the liquid.  At the same time, a gas molecule could strike the liquid and slow down enough to become part of it.  There is an ''equilibrium'' between the amount of evaporating liquid and the amount of liquifying gas.  Higher temperatures will have an equilibrium that favors more gas.

== Motion of Gas Particles ==

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|This animation demonstrates the motion of gas particles.]]

Gas particles move in random, straight-line motion.  Gas particles possess a greater kinetic energy than the particles of a liquid or solid.  The greater kinetic energy is due to gases existing at higher temperatures than liquids or solids.  As temperature increases, particles move faster and, thus, have greater kinetic energy.  The particles of a gas have minimal interactions, except collisions with each other.

=== Diffusion and Effusion ===

Due to their random motion, gases will eventually escape from a container if there is a hole in it.  This is called '''effusion'''.  Gases also spread out across a room, or mix together in a container.  This is called '''diffusion'''.

More information about diffusion and effusion is presented in the [[General Chemistry/Diffusion and Effusion|next chapter]].

== Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures ==

The total amount of pressure exerted by a gas is equal to the sum of its components:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For instance, if you add 300 torr of nitrogen gas to a container, then you add 250 torr of oxygen to that container, the total pressure will be 550 torr (assuming volume and temperature stayed constant).

Another way of stating this law is that the pressure exerted by a particular gas in a mixture (gases always form homogeneous mixtures with each other) is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Personal Information ==
My name is Randy Reeves Jr.  I go by the nickname Ran.  I am 23 years old and have lived in the same house for all those years.  I am from a small town on the Northern Neck called White Stone.  I can trace my linage back to five generations to the area on both sides of my family.  I am a member of the White Stone Volunteer Fire Department and have been for six years.  My Great-Grandfather Reeves and Grandfather Reeves were both founding members of the department in 1947 and both were chiefs.  My father followed in their footsteps as a fire chief as well.  I enjoy most sports.  I have coached many softball teams.  I am a huge Boston Red Sox fan ever since I start watching baseball in 1st grade.  I play Varsity Baseball in High School.  I graduate from Christopher Newport University with my BA in History.  I hope to earn my license and Master’s at ODU and go on to teacher Middle School Social Studies in my area.

== Teaching Philosophy ==
Education to me is the most important part of our society.  With out education, this country will never be able to sustain its major presences in the world’s affairs.  To me the best way to educate children is to present material in a way that kids become interested in the subject.  This means that teachers need to use technology and other forms of media to keeps kids attention.  However, I still believe that the best way to educate students is to give reading material, lectures that emphasis the points in the reading, and putting notes either on the chalkboard or in the form of a power point.  There is a movement to go away from lectures and give more hands on projects, but I do not believe that more projects help kids learn.  I believe that it gives students too much of a chance to misinterpret what the teacher wants them to learn from the project.  I do believe that discussion is very important but the teacher must keep it on track for it to be successful.  A good teacher must be able to use all the tools accessible to them in order to make sure the future is still bright for this country.</text>

I'm trying to figure out what this page is all about. I placed a {{tlx|query}} tag at the top of the page, but you removed it. Could you please do me a favor and write me a message, either here or [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my talk page]]?

Hello, my name is Amber Mills. I am 19 years old, and from Alexandria, VA. I am a sophmore planning on teaching spanish. A few of my hobbies are watching TV and hanging with friends. Some of my favorite shows are House, Nip Tuck, Law &amp; Order SVU &amp; CI, America's Next Top Model, My Wife and Kids, and Spongebob Squarepants. I like trying new things and experiencing different cultures. I also like cooking and baking. I've been trying to cook my favorite foods from scratch and I have been successful in a few. So, that's just a little about me....


'''My Educational Philosophy:'''


I believe a good teacher cares about their students. 

I think group assignments are better than lectures.

Computers should be used in classrooms. They are basically a must in the &quot;real&quot; world, so students should be taught how to use them early.

I think self-reviews and peer-reviews help students with their work.

I think the purpose of schools are to get us ready for working. When we start working, the companies pay more when you have been in school longer. 

In elementary schools we should focus on reading and creativity, but in secondary school the students should have the option to focus on college prep or vocational programs.

Also, I believe we should have a national cirriculum so that colleges wouldn't have to worry about whether or not their prospective students are ready or not. And if a student moves from one state to another, they won't be behind.</text>

      <comment>/* Motivation */ principle vs. principal</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Metafunction&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* To encapsulate a complex type computation algorithm 
* To generate a type using compile-time type selection techniques

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Templates is a powerful feature of C++, which can be used to perform arbitrary computations at compile-time, which is known as template metaprogramming. Some of the basic examples of the computations performed at compile-time are: (1) selection of a type based on compile-time constants or (2) computing factorial of a number. As a matter of fact, C++ templates is a [http://ubiety.uwaterloo.ca/~tveldhui/papers/2003/turing.pdf turing complete] sub-language of C++. Metafunction idiom is the principal way of writing compile-time algorithms in C++.

Algorithms -- compile-time or run-time -- should be encapsulated so that they are easier to use and reuse. Conventionally, run-time algorithms are encapsulated in functions that are invoked, obviously, at run-time. Metafunctions, on the other hand, are compile-time analogs of run-time functions. Traditional functions accept values/objects as parameters and return values/objects. However, metafunctions accept types and compile-time constants as parameters and return types/constants.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
A metafunction, contrary to its name, is a class template. Implementation of metafunctions is often based on template specializations. For example, consider the following ''IF'' metafunction, which is compile-time equivalent of run-time ''if'' statement. Depending upon the value of the first parameter, ''IF'' metafunction yields either an ''int'' or a ''long'' in the example below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;bool, class L, class R&gt;
struct IF
{
  typedef R type; 
};

template &lt;class L, class R&gt;
struct IF&lt;true, L, R&gt;
{
  typedef L type; 
};

IF&lt;false, int, long&gt;::type i; // is equivalent to long i;
IF&lt;true,  int, long&gt;::type i; // is equivalent to int i;
&lt;/source&gt;

''Factorial'' metafunction below is another example showing how a recursive factorial computation algorithm can be encapsulated using C++ templates. This metafunction yields an integral value rather than a type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;int N&gt;
struct Factorial 
{
    enum { value = N * Factorial&lt;N - 1&gt;::value };
};
 
template &lt;&gt;
struct Factorial&lt;0&gt; 
{
    enum { value = 1 };
};
 
// Factorial&lt;4&gt;::value == 24
// Factorial&lt;0&gt;::value == 1
void foo()
{
    int x = Factorial&lt;4&gt;::value; // == 24
    int y = Factorial&lt;0&gt;::value; // == 1
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Metafunction and Type Generator'''

Metafunction is a more general idiom than the [[More C++ Idioms/Type Generator|type generator]] idiom. The intent of metafunction idiom is to encapsulate compile-time computation where as, type generator simplifies specification of a type. Metafunctions that produce type(s) as a result of a compile-time computation are all type generators, albeit more complex. However, not every metafunction is a type generator. For example, the ''Factorial'' metafunction shown before produces an integral value, not a type, at the end of the computation. Generally, metafunctions are implemented using  [[More C++ Idioms/Compile Time Control Structures|compile-time control structures]] or other metafunctions unlike type generators.

Libraries such as [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/mpl Boost.MPL] provide a large collection of metafunctions and compile-time data structures to simplify C++ template metaprogramming.

'''Higher order metafunctions'''

These are metafunctions that accept other metafunctions as parameters and use them during computation. This is conceptually is similar a function accepting a pointer to another function or a function object as a parameter at run-time. Only difference is that metafunctions exist only at compile-time. ''boost::mpl::transform'' is an example of such a higher order metafunction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi folks

Warm Wishes for your contribution to enhance &quot;Introductory PLC Programming&quot; wikibook.
I request the Contributors to avoid Manufacturer specific descriptions.
If we decide to add manufacturer specific info., we need to identify contributors working on different vendor products.

Thanks 
VJ


I'm sure i'm in the wrong place but didn't have time to parse all your rules.  There is an inconsistency in Intro PLC Prog in the Basic Instructions section:

Positive Logic (most PLCs follow this convention)
True = logic 1 = input energized.
False = logic 0 = input NOT energized.
Negative Logic
True = logic 0 = input NOT energized
False = logic 1 = input energized.
Normally Open
(XIC) - eXamine If Closed.
This instruction is true (logic 1) when the hardware input (or internal relay equivalent) is energized.
Normally Closed
(XIO) - eXamine If Open.
This instruction is true (logic 1) when the hardware input (or internal relay equivalent) is NOT energized.

The last line under (XIO) above is not consistent with either the Positive Logic definition nor the Negative Logic definition just above it (i.e. ...true (logic 1)...is NOT energized).</text>

      <comment>Before starting.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Before deciding to start your own wiki, if you plan to write about something that may be of general public interest, there is a good possibility that there is already something similar online. Remember, a bigger wiki (with more participants) is often more fun.  If, or rather ''when'', you get hit by spammers and vandals, having a big community and others willing to help out can be invaluable. Perform extensive research using search engines to make sure that a suitable wiki does not already exist. A [[Google:Wiki|Google search for 'wiki']] currently returns about 436,000,000 results; duplicating efforts is very unhelpful - it only means some helpless soul will end up confusing the two wikis at some point in the future.

&lt;!-- &quot;'''the'''&quot; reference desk? That's kind of vague. --&gt;
Some good places to find out if a wiki already exists include:

* [http://wikiindex.org/WikiIndex_talk:Community_talk WikiIndex talk] ''(was: [http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/WorldWideWikiFAQs WorldWideWikiFAQs])''
* [[CentralWikia:List of Wikia|Available wikis on Wikia]]
* [[w:List of wikis|Wikipedia's list of wikis]]

== Technical challenge and community challenge ==
Despite the first impression, the biggest challenge for a wiki is not technical but human. There is lots of tools and documentations for the wikis. The main issue is to start the wiki, verify that anything is working and see nobody coming or staying without knowing why. That's the reason why the book deals more with relational points than technical points.

== Before starting ==
One key aspect to make a successful wiki is to create it for good reasons. Do you want to create it because one day you realize that this wiki does not exist, because you have needed this wiki or because you want to have your own wiki and you have found an idea to do it? In the last case, your wiki is likely not to grow, because the project is focused on you, not on the community. If your wiki has been created to highlight yourself, nobody will want to contribute.

The contributors should feel that they are highlighted by contributing. You should search people that are interested by your project before you create the wiki instance. If you do that, they will feel that this project is also their project. If you first create the wiki instance and then you search people, they will never feel that it is their project but yours.

Your concept should fit to the wiki mechanism. The pages of the wiki should be atomic, that is to say, one page does not need other pages to be comprehensive. Otherwise, your wiki will be hard to edit. That means that a reader needs to read several pages to get the benefit of one page and a contributor needs to be aware of the other pages to do a small edit. If it is an encyclopedic content like Wikipedia, there is no problem. The more atomic the content is, the quicker the wiki will grow.

The content should self-explain why it is done that way. For example, if you are the only website in the world to display a content in a given form, the first reader will remove the content.

==Hosting - self or external==

If you still want to run your own wiki, you will either need to run your own web server or have someone else manage a server for you.

* &quot;from '''scratch'''&quot;: you install whatever wiki engine you choose. You control everything. (Either on your own hardware, or on any suitable web host).
* &quot;hosted wiki&quot;: most technical decisions and support issues are handled by someone else, and you handle the social aspects of growing the wiki.

If you already have a web server, but your web host does not specifically say they host Wikis (for free or a fee) just see if they support the scripting language that the Wiki software you want to run requires.  Many wikis require just [[PHP]], [[Perl]], or some other common server-side scripting language that most web hosts provide. Other wikis require a database (e.g. [[MySQL]] database) and/or have other requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are companies that host wikis for free or for a price.  This means that you do not have to deal with complex programs like Ruby, PHP, MySQL, or Apache.  The wiki host will do this for you.

Beware!  Some hosts delete wikis without notice.  Make sure you are saving your own backup copy of the data in your wiki.  Some hosts make it easy to download everything you would need to run your wiki somewhere else, by using an open source wiki engine and providing backup dumps with full edit histories.  Other hosts lock you in more, e.g., with proprietary wiki markup languages, proprietary wiki engines, or limited backups.

      <comment>/* Choosing the wiki software */ Improvement.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For more power and flexibility or for business applications, many people will want to serve their own wikis.  This requires considerably more knowledge about how wikis work and especially about [[w:Wiki Software|wiki software]].

== Business Environments ==
Especially in business environments, administrators may be interested in wiki security.  Many people believe that nobody who is granted read access should be denied write access or wikis lose their power, but there are times when administrators will want to restrict which users are allowed to access a wiki.

Another consideration in business environments and other large organizations is whether or not the wiki software can interface with other logins.  E.g. Twiki can get the username from Windows NT, allowing users username level access without a login.  Such schemes allow the benefits of usernames without discouraging users from participating by making them log in.

Businesses may choose to outsource the hosting of the wiki environment.  For intranet installations, companies such as [http://www.socialtext.com SocialText] offer a hardware-based &quot;appliance&quot; solution. For customization, design or production of wiki projects, companies such as [http://www.wikistudios.com Wiki Studios] offer professional wiki services to business, non-profit organizations and branches of government.

== Customizing software ==

One of the benefits of hosting a wiki oneself is the ability to recode the wiki software.  For an example of this, see [http://senseis.xmp.net/ Sensei's Library].  The administrators of Sensei's added Go markup functionality to their software for easy illustration of Go boards and pieces.

==Choosing the wiki software==

There are more than one hundred wiki engines available. Some good starting points are to read [[w:Comparison of wiki software|Comparison of wiki software]], [[c2:TopTenWikiEngines|Top Ten Wiki engines]], [http://www.wikimatrix.org WikiMatrix comparison table]. To decide what kinds of software you would want, list all the criteria that are important for you. Then sort the ones that are required and the ones that would be great to have. Start filtering all the wiki engines that don't feature your required criteria and sort the remaining wiki engines with the great criteria. The most important points could be:
#''Which server can I use for it?''
#:-&gt; On which server and hardware can it run?
#''Am I ready to spend money on it and how much?''
#:-&gt; Should it be free?
#''Am I ready to use a tool entirely written in English only?''
#:-&gt; Should it be i18n?
#''Will the contributors be able to write in wikicode?''
#:-&gt; Should it be WYSIWYG?
#''Can I do all I want with only simple text?''
#:-&gt; Should it feature extensions and advanced features?
#''Will the contributors import content from other wikis?''
#:-&gt; Should it have compatible format with other wiki or wiki engines?
#''Is my project critical?''
#:-&gt; Is it actively updated? Is there a large community of developers?
#''Is my project very advanced?''
#:-&gt; Can it be recoded? Open source?
#''Should my project be attractive (commercial needs for example)?''
#:-&gt; Is the display customizable?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you start a wiki, '''it is essential to choose a suitable license'''. Once users start contributing to a wiki in which the license is not clearly specified, you may run into a licensing nightmare, having to track the authors of content without proper license.

The licenses proper to a wiki include:
* '''FDL.''' GNU Free Documentation License, used by Mediawiki projects. Beware that this license is incompatible with GNU General Public License. Choosing a GNU GPL for a wiki is unfortunate, as it has been designed for software, not for texts in human language.
* '''Creative Commons.''' One of the Creative Commons licenses
* '''Combination''' of the two
* '''PD.''' Public domain license, the least restrictive license.

According to some interpretations of the law, it may be illegal to ever change the copyright license of a wiki without getting explicit, written consent from everyone who has ever posted on the wiki, unless the copyright license itself has explicit provisions for changing the license.

The public domain license is the only license that lets you change the license later.
If you or your users later decide they want some license other than public domain,
you might want to check out the license comparisons in Further reading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note that the non const operator*/operator-&gt; is not really safe:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
CowPtr&lt;int&gt; foo;

int&amp; foo = *foo;

See: http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/044.htm for solution, basically we need to introduce a new Unsharable state.

:I think I added something along these lines, maybe a bit more convoluted, based on the book.
:I could not find a CowPtr facility in Boost, which seems odd. Does anyone know why? Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/123.225.75.106|123.225.75.106]] ([[User talk:123.225.75.106|talk]]) 03:53, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

Note, the implementation on this wiki page lacks a destructor and does not trat cloning of polymorph pointees correctly. This can be doen at the cost of a larger state (add 1 attribute) and using a templated constructor, which sets up the cloner/deleters.</text>

::Hi Mike, Thank you very much for your continued guidance. I do apologize for any inconvenience and please know that it is not my intention to be over-protective or inappropriate with the small contributions made. In the case of unispec.gif, this logo is internationally copyright as mentioned, under my name. There are manuscripts, technical gear and training media which carry this logo. However, as the creator of the logo I understand the requirement to provide free use, here.

:::I recommend dual licensing under the {{tlx|GFDL}} and {{tlx|cc-by-sa-2.5}} to allow maximum flexibility. However, you may choose any [[commons:COM:L|free license]]. The combination mentioned allows re-use for any purpose, including the creation of derivative works, and for commercial purposes, but requires attribution, and is viral (so all derivatives must be licensed under the GFDL or CC-by-sa-2.5). You can simply replace everything I have striked out (between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) with {{tlx|self|GFDL|cc-by-sa-2.5}} if those licensing terms are acceptable.

== Why ==
The discussion was formally closed, if your intention is to gather objections you should just contact any party that you perceive that needs to express an opinion. I've placed a notice on the only user that expressed an opinion against the deletion (on the aborted VFD), if you indeed think there are divergent opinions the a VFD is the only way forward, but this formally invalidates the discussion process that has taken place, pointing to a closed discussion doesn't help a bit.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:52, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
:It's not my place to convince people to take part in a discussion, nor to convince them of any viewpoint here. You need to discuss this with other book contributors and come to a consensus on what to do. You are not &quot;other book contributors&quot; (nor am I) so please go discuss this with them. However, placing spurious {{tlx|delete}}s is disruptive, and will stop. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:56, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

::::::I'm getting a bit exasperated too. Of course I have to comply with policy and guidelines as much as anyone else. I'm afraid I don't understand how removing the template is contrary to anything in that, much less section five. Indeed, compliance with that is why I have declined the speedy deletion.
::::::There was a VFD, closed 12 days ago, which showed that there was not consensus among the book contributors to delete that page (much less among the wider community). As such, a speedy deletion request at this time is entirely inappropriate, and is disruptive. Please work with other book contributors to come to a consensus about what to do on this issue. When that happens, you may ask for an administrator to implement the decision. Until then, no administrator is permitted to take action, per policy.
::::::I fail to see any relevant example which shows that discussion in a case such as this is unnecessary. If you can find one, I'll consider it of course. Deleting the page only to then support it's undeletion would be disruption of the wiki to make a point, and as such is a very bad idea.
::::::If you take issue with my conduct as an administrator, please feel welcome to raise those concerns for community consideration.
::::::Until there is a consensus about what to do on this issue, please do not request speedy deletion, nor open a new VFD. To do so would be disruptive as I have stated previously. When there is a consensus among book contributors, you may then request that an administrator implement it. Depending on the situation, that may mean a speedy deletion, or it may mean getting wider input at VFD, or some other action. However, the key here is that you need consensus among book contributors first.
::::::Why don't we drop this rather unproductive discussion. When you have solicited opinions from other book contributors, or my closure of the VFD is invalidated, or the community sanctions me for conduct, we can consider these issues again. Until then, this discussion is, as I say, unproductive (and apparently causes us both some ire). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:10, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
*reset
'''I don't understand how removing the template is contrary to anything in that''', again you are invalidating a correctly executed proposal that reached a decission in accord with the pre-existing procedures, removing/reverting what rightfully resulted from the now closed discussion. We have even addressed, again in the formal timeframe, (your own words) '''I've switched that to a VFD as that is certainly not an uncontroversial deletion. I just used the reason you gave in the template; you may wish to edit the nomination.''', then the only stated objection was presented after you initiated the erroneous VFD, and so the new objection stated on VFD was addressed and the decission process extended to grant James his chance to participate.&lt;br&gt;
More, you asking me to force others to participate in a discussion, not I or you can make other participate in discussion and as I attempted to show you time and time again this is not how it is done, in this case and on many non specific decission processes, as I pointed out to you, in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] if you look in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Decision_making#Process process] in point 5 it states &quot;''If there are no objections, the proposal is accepted and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached on the proposal.''&quot;. You even fail to consider that this is common practice and that you execute proposals daily in exactly the same process (as speedy deletion). Depending on how you identify book contributors, I can claim that I'm the sole contributor working on the book at this time. So, if no one is around, how do we get to what you, against what is an active guideline, reach consensus? I was not joking but this requirement you are adding seems like a joke as it is probably unreachable, highly improbable and ultimately out of anyones power to obtain. That is why the execution of the deletion would switch the need to present an alternative to the other inexistent party, and is indeed a valid solution and that is why I proposed it, as it doesn't change any action future users would be able to take if so inclined even if your illusive concept for reaching a consensus is reached and the page deleted, not a &quot;disruption&quot; at all.&lt;br&gt;   
I've no wish to but if you are putting it on the terms it is my way or the highway and you don't advance any valid avenue for reaching a solution, don't restore the reached decission in the form of the speedy deletion, you live me no choice than to address your last action that invalidated a clean process of decission in the only possible way.&lt;br&gt;
I'll not drop the issue since the action was originated by several requests for a solution, this is not an attempt to steam roll the issue and even I as the main editor of the book have avoided to address a problem that does indeed causes me trouble and ultimately damages the usage of the book. As it is there are no standing objections, James was asked to express his feeling and alternatives. A valid reply and statement to have is views validated was made in the VFD and a chance to address them granted.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:00, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
:I've already stated that I'm not going to delete or move anything with respect to this issue, so I fail to understand why you continue harping on this issue with me. As I said, if you take issue with my conduct as an administrator, take it to the community.

Hello Mike,
yes I saw the Physics books the site already has, but mine uses a completely different formalism and is based around the N-body problem. It goes from the microscopic Physics to the the macroscopic scale.
This is the material one usually studies in Post-Graduate courses. The one already existing cover more what is usually taught during the first two years of University.
if you have some special book in mind, then include it and I'll have a closer look at it.

I am not sure how some pages look just like regulalr pages, and I have to insert a link back to the cover page, while others already have the link back, and called modules. How do you add a module?

Hi there,

I was trawling through wikipedia as per normal on a boring day at work and noticed there was a guide for gears of war, AMAZING i thought.

Unfortunately it has been removed and your name was next to it.  Do you have a copy? If so would you be kind/cool enough to email it to me?

Thanks

Ron

Page no longer serves any purpose (last edit 2007), as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions per proposal] to what page creator stated no objection to the deletion (stating '''&quot;Its not my problem any more.&quot;'''), this action will address [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC1#The_Tocs a major problem with the book].
This VFD was initiated since Whiteknight expressed concerns on the reason and the way previous discussions reached the deletion conclusion and has excused himself to perform a speedy deletion (a request that I directly addressed to him as the last admin that took an action on the subject.) To my knowledge there is no active dispute to the action ( [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC2 TOC2 Discussion page]), the last metrics I saw this month indicated that by day ~257 users reach the C++ Programming page and ~68 clicked on the TOC2 page.  -- [[User:Panic2k4|Panic2k4]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:18, July 22, 2008

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Based on the above reasons and due to a multitude of comments on and off wikibooks on how the problem stood.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:35, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' TOC2 arose as a great improvement on TOC1  I've hard no rational argument for its deletion, and a war of attrition isn't a good way to make progress. [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 05:27, 27 July 2008 (UTC)
::Since the work is not on the VFD for a reason to delete, but for getting objections and because you are an editor to the work but [[Talk:C++ Programming/Conventions|sadly you didn't state any objection before (on the proper forum)]], what are the valid reasons to keep this [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC2&amp;action=history stale page], since it doesn't have/serve any real purpose at this time?
::I call your attention that this is the first time the page was tagged or proposed for deletion. Calling it part of a war of attrition is a bit of an overstatement. I state again that I don't have any problem with the existence of other TOCs or even TOC2 if properly maintained. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions&amp;oldid=599420#new_presentation But we have deleted previous TOCs, in the same manner and for the same reason. (TOC2 creator removed 2 previous existing TOCs before implementing the TOC2 page after stating exactly the same reasons I do now).]
::Do you feel the page reflects the book, or serves the propose of a Table of Content ?   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:00, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

:{{keep}} I would like to know where you are getting your page hit data from, I'm not aware of a functioning page counter and I think it would be good to have for other books as well. If ~190/257 users are indeed going to the TOC1 page, I would like to know what effect ordering has on that number. If we reverse the order of the links, will more people still go to your TOC page, or will they just click the first link on the page? [[User:Darklama]] did indeed dispute deletion of this page, and you've said twice now that he didn't (are you reading the same reply I read?). When I protected the page [[C++ Programming]] because of wheel warring, I said that the page would not be unprotected until the authors of the book arrived at an acceptable agreement and compromise. If I remember correctly (and memory is all I have, since the talk pages appear to have been mangled beyond recognition) you, Panic, said that you preferred to leave the main page as it was and not work towards compromise. How you can claim now that a decision has been reached without any apparent discussion or compromise from anybody in the past few months is beyond me. I don't think that VFD is a good forum for forcing this issue, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:25, 28 July 2008 (UTC)
::Metrics from [http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikibooks/en/ a link posted on the Wikibooks:Analytics page] (196 on  the C++ Programming/TOC1 page :) most people do enter it directly and it is a must for navigational purposes, thats one reason that I bitch so much about that problem, it is even a major reason that I reduced contributions to the work as most of the time I forget and get sent back to the title page (It wouldn't surprise me that it would also happen to other users, then TOC1 would have the most clicks)... 
::In any case the main page is not the topic of the deletion request, nor is the TOC1 page directly relevant to this discussion, as I see it the TOC2 should have a reason to exist and someone dedicated to update and complete it so that it mirrors the work, it seems only reasonable, and I wouldn't have supported this path to solving the main problem otherwise (probably this is why James labeled it a war of attrition ), whatever order is implemented (I think James problem is how TOC1 is structured, but he is free to a) propose alternatives b) do them himself if they will not cause any major snafu (I've stated many times that James knowledge on the subject of standard C++ at least is better than mine, and he has more practical experience, the only comment I can make from his stance on C++ is that he seems very OOP oriented for what I could extrapolate for the comments he made so far, this could lead to a very small NPOV since the book should be kept paradigm agnostic, but I may be wrong on how I read things since I never asked him directly).
::Aren't we reading the same statement ? (I posted it on the VFD proposal) and even indicate the part that DL puts himself beyond the discussion (you have to consider the time frame), he is only commenting the situation as it existed at the time he replied not passing the problem of finding a solution to anyone else. (Is that how you were reading it ?)
::Since you are putting other issues on the same discussion, (I have avoided doing so). It seems that addressing the simple validity of the present TOC2 page would by default resolve any other pending issues. But you know perfectly well that I don't view the solution you made on the main title pages was impartial, right and in accord with the best practices as I see it, but lets not rehash the subject, if TOC2 survives and I hope you rethink your vote on the merit of the page as it stands now in place as merely taking sides again in a long passed dispute. If the page is given a purpose I will be the first to change my vote. Probably then we will have to revisit the title page situation since even you can seem how other people are being affected by it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(PS: Sorry taking so much space on the VFD page but since it is now a public discussion that got outside of the normal namespace of the book project, past events.

:::That you accuse me of &quot;taking sides&quot; is laughable. If I had my way, and if I were acting in what I thought to be the best interests of [[User:Darklama]], I would block you from wikibooks forever, unprotect the page at [[C++ Programming]] and redesign that page to support both TOCs in an aesthetic and explanatory way. I have been absolutely impartial in my actions there, stopping both parties from engaging in an edit war, adding both options to that page, and not taking any further action until the authors of the book reach a compromise. As you made perfectly clear previously, you were not interested in working towards compromise, and you should take some responsibility for that. You're asking the Wikibooks community to overrule the wishes of a book's authors and act, in an uncompromising way, to absolve you of the need to discuss the issue civilly and reach consensus. Forum-shopping does not preclude the need for discussion and compromise. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:10, 30 July 2008 (UTC)
::::I'm not accusing you of anything just asking that you provide a objective reason on the topic at hand and provide a reasonable analysis of the page that is proposed for deletion. I will not address past event here and don't see your last response as productive. But please don't say things that aren't true or I'll be forced to reply with the facts (history logs). Most of the events aren't as you describe them, repeating unrelated and unsubstantiated events as justification for your vote option doesn't seem productive to me nor a valid argument to substantiate your vote decission. I have already taken responsibility for the things I did and was driven to do and even been punishment for situations/conflicts I didn't originate. '''You're asking the Wikibooks community..''' this statement is deceitful, you have been given the reason this option was taken before you made this statement, but ultimately, your own actions drove it to be so, you chose not to address the issue and failed to provide a non imposed solution, consensus or cooperation can't be reached by imposition. You would be hard pressed to prove an event were I dind't attempt to reach a consensual decission even using a purest form of the concept (with no objections). I'm not attacking you or any other Wikibookian the action was initiated to address a pressing issue that needs a solution, more I consider my participation on the community as productive as yours, veiled block threats will not cow me (most probably the opposite) when you make statements like those you just did you lose any credibility on the situation, fact DL was informed of the situation before any escalation of the problem, the decission process was the same that has been used by the book community. I only took action since Wikibookians and even other editors have requested the issue to be addressed on that base I proposed a viable, transparent and conflict free way out of the problem.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:22, 30 July 2008 (UTC)      

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. If I remember correctly, TOC1 was the original TOC, and should be the only TOC. TOC2 caused a huge edit war(as I understand it) and has, basically, become a parasite to the whole C++ book, forcing all editors to stop edits or edit on both if they want to properly contribute to the book. Having said that, I don't care which of these gets deleted, as long as one does and we can start working on the book as a whole again.

::Txs for your input. Just to clarify things TOC2 didn't per se create a edit war (were multiple reverts were performed) it was a lot more complex than that (the only reversions done were on the title page), but you got the time frame right and I share that reason with you (primacy in grade and order). Deleting the now stale TOC2 page as proposed would resolve that issue and the last proposal passed as a book convention will address future alternative TOCs, not by blocking them (as I read it is you opinion we should) but putting them beyond a be bold action.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:42, 29 July 2008 (UTC)

Austin Wesley Rosecrans was born in Virginia Beach, VA on August 10,1986. Currently a full tine student at Old Dominion University, Austin is studying to become a high school history teacher.

== '''Teaching Philosophy''' ==


Albert Einstein couldn't say it better. &quot;Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school.&quot;

Education is the foundation for my being. I learned alot at Bayside High School, but my favorite subject was history. Because I had enthusiastic teachers, history  became a hobby. These teachers has inspired me to go above and beyond the classroom. I admired these educators, and I want to spread the same message as them.

Education spreads the message of thinking outside the box. Education lets people expand their mind and knowledge. Knowledge is one of the greatest gift. Educators want to spread knowledge of every aspect of life one student at the time. I believe teaching and spreading knowledge can expand your mind and let you explore uncharted territories. My goal as an educator is to spread knowledge of historial background to all my students.

=Hello Arose011!=
Thanks for the response! I also read your about the author page. I, too, like history, but not the Cowboys (HA!HA!)I'm a Raiders fan, even though they haven't played very well within the past few years.
I really enjoyed your teaching philosophy. And I agree, &quot;Knowledge is one of the greatest gifts.&quot; I know I sound like a nerd, but I LOVE to LEARN. I'm sure you will be an excellent history teacher one day:)!!

{{merge from| How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2nd Edition}}

Think Python is a concise introduction to software design using the Python programming language. Intended for people with no programming experience, this book starts with the most basic concepts and gradually adds new material. Some of the ideas students find most challenging, like recursion and object-oriented programming, are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters.

The focus is on the programming process, with special emphasis on debugging. The book includes a wide range of exercises, from short examples to substantial projects, so that students have ample opportunity to practice each new concept. Exercise solutions and code examples are available from [http://www.thinkpython.com thinkpython.com], along with [http://thinkpython.com/swampy Swampy], a suite of Python programs used in some of the exercises.

=== The strange history of this book ===

''(This section was written by Allen B. Downey&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/book001.html &quot;The strange history of this book&quot;]
by Allen B. Downey
&lt;/ref&gt;)''

In January 1999, I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.

One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the &quot;trapdoor effect&quot;: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.

Two weeks before the first day of class, I decided to write my own book. 

My goals were:

*Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than read 50 pages.
*Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.
*Build gradually. To avoid trapdoors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps. 
*Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.

I needed a title, so on a whim I chose ''How to Think Like a Computer Scientist''.

My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.

I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.

What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.

Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released ''How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python'', also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea Press are available at [http://www.greenteapress.com/ greenteapress.com].

In 2003, I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking.
Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.

Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision—at the same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!

The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title ''Think Python''. Some of the changes are:

*I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.
*I removed the material in the last few chapters about the implementation of lists and trees. I still love those topics, but I thought they were incongruent with the rest of the book.
*I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects.
*I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion. Some of them are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for use in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from [http://www.thinkpython.com thinkpython.com].
*I expanded the discussion of programming development plans and basic design patterns.
*The use of Python is more idiomatic. The book is still about programming, not Python, but now I think the book gets more leverage from the language.

I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like
a computer scientist.

=== Acknowledgements ===

First and most importantly, I thank Jeff Elkner, who
translated my Java book into Python, which got this project
started and introduced me to what has turned out to be my
favorite language.

I also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections
to ''How to Think Like a Computer Scientist''.

And I thank the Free Software Foundation for developing
the GNU Free Documentation License, which helped make
my collaboration with Jeff and Chris possible.

I also thank the editors at Lulu who worked on
''How to Think Like a Computer Scientist''.

I thank all the students who worked with earlier
versions of this book and all the contributors (listed
below) who sent in corrections and suggestions.

And I thank my wife, Lisa, for her work on this book, and Green
Tea Press, and everything else, too.
=== Contributor List ===

More than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in
suggestions and corrections over the past few years. Their
contributions, and enthusiasm for this project, have been a
huge help.

If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to 
&lt;TT&gt;feedback@thinkpython.com&lt;/TT&gt;. If I make a change based on your
feedback, I will add you to the contributor list
(unless you ask to be omitted).

If you include at least part of the sentence the
error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and
section numbers are fine, too, but not quite as easy to work with.

=== The further strange adventures of this book ===

In September of 2008, Whiteknight converted the HTML version of &quot;Think Python&quot; at Green Tea Press&lt;ref&gt;
[http://thinkpython.com/ &quot;Think Python&quot; at Green Tea Press]
&lt;/ref&gt;
to a Wikitext version at Wikibooks&lt;ref&gt;
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Think_Python Wikibooks: Think Python]
&lt;/ref&gt;.
Now anyone can improve the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a
computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features
of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians,
computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically
computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components
into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists,
they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test
predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is '''problem solving'''. Problem solving means the ability to formulate
problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly
and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That&amp;#X2019;s why
this chapter is called, &amp;#X201C;The way of the program.&amp;#X201D;

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful
skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to
an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.

=== The Python programming language ===
The programming language you will learn is Python. Python is
an example of a '''high-level language'''; other high-level languages
you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.

There are also '''low-level languages''', sometimes referred to as &amp;#X201C;machine
languages&amp;#X201D; or &amp;#X201C;assembly languages.&amp;#X201D; Loosely speaking, computers
can only execute programs written in low-level languages. So
programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before
they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small
disadvantage of high-level languages.

The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program
in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language
take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they
are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are '''portable''', meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers
with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one
kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
applications.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages
into low-level languages: '''interpreters''' and '''compilers'''.
An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it
does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time,
alternately reading lines and performing computations.

[[File:Interpreted Code Flow Diagram.svg|center]]

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the
program starts running. In this context, the high-level program is
called the '''source code''', and the translated program is called the
'''object code''' or the '''executable'''. Once a program is
compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

[[File:Compiled Code Flow Diagram.svg|center]]

Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs
are executed by an interpreter. There are two ways to use the
interpreter: '''interactive mode''' and '''script mode'''. In
interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter prints
the result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 1
2
&lt;/source&gt;
The chevron, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is the
'''prompt''' the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If
you type &lt;TT&gt;1 + 1&lt;/TT&gt;, the interpreter replies &lt;TT&gt;2&lt;/TT&gt;.

Alternatively, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to
execute the contents of the file, which is called a '''script'''. By
convention, Python scripts have names that end with &lt;TT&gt;.py&lt;/TT&gt;.

To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of
the file. In a UNIX command window, you would type &lt;TT&gt;python
dinsdale.py&lt;/TT&gt;. In other development environments, the details of
executing scripts are different. You can find instructions for
your environment at the Python Website &lt;TT&gt;python.org&lt;/TT&gt;.

Working in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of
code because you can type and execute them immediately. But for
anything more than a few lines, you should save your code
as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.

=== What is a program? ===
A '''program''' is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to
perform a computation. The computation might be something
mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the
roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such
as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough)
compiling a program.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic
instructions appear in just about every language:
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''input:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some
other device.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''output:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Display data on the screen or send data to a
file or other device.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''math:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
multiplication.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''conditional execution:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Check for certain conditions and
execute the appropriate sequence of statements.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''repetition:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Perform some action repeatedly, usually with
some variation.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
Believe it or not, that&amp;#X2019;s pretty much all there is to it. Every
program you&amp;#X2019;ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of
instructions that look pretty much like these. So you can think of
programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task
into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are
simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.

That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic
when we talk about '''algorithms'''.

=== What is debugging? ===
Programming is error-prone. For whimsical reasons, programming errors
are called '''bugs''' and the process of tracking them down is called
'''debugging'''.

Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime 
errors, and semantic errors. It is useful
to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.

==== Syntax errors ====
Python can only execute a program if the syntax is
correct; otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message.
'''Syntax''' refers to the structure of a program and the rules about
that structure.  
For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so
&lt;TT&gt;(1 + 2)&lt;/TT&gt; is legal, but &lt;TT&gt;8)&lt;/TT&gt; is a '''syntax error'''.

In English readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we
can read the poetry of E. E. Cummings without spewing error messages.
Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error
anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit,
and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few
weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of
time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will
make fewer errors and find them faster.

==== Runtime errors ====
The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the
error does not appear until after the program has started running.
These errors are also called '''exceptions''' because they usually
indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.

Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the
first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.

==== Semantic errors ====
The third type of error is the '''semantic error'''. If there is a
semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense
that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will
not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it
will do what you told it to do.

The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you
wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.
Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work
backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure
out what it is doing.

==== Experimental debugging ====
One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging.
Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most
intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of
programming.

In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted
with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led
to the results you see.

Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea
about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If
your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the
modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If
your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As
Sherlock Holmes pointed out, &amp;#X201C;When you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&amp;#X201D;
(A. Conan Doyle, ''The Sign of Four'')

For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That
is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until
it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a
program that does ''something'' and make small modifications,
debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.

For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of
lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds
used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield,
&amp;#X201C;One of Linus&amp;#X2019;s earlier projects was a program that would switch
between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.&amp;#X201D;
(''The Linux Users&amp;#X2019; Guide'' Beta Version 1).

Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other
programming practices.

=== Formal and natural languages ===
'''Natural languages''' are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.

'''Formal languages''' are languages that are designed by people for
specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians
use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting
relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal
language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And
most importantly:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
'''Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.'''
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example,
3 + 3 = 6 is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 
3 + = 3 $ 6 is not. &lt;I&gt;H&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;I&gt;O&lt;/I&gt; is a syntactically correct
chemical formula, but &lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;I&gt;Zz&lt;/I&gt; is not.

Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to '''tokens''' and
structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as
words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with 3 +
= 3 $ 6 is that &lt;CODE&gt;$&lt;/CODE&gt; is not a legal token in mathematics
(at least as far as I know). Similarly, &lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;I&gt;Zz&lt;/I&gt; is not legal because
there is no element with the abbreviation &lt;I&gt;Zz&lt;/I&gt;.

The second type of syntax error pertains to the structure of a
statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement 3
+ = 3 $ 6 is illegal because even though + and = are
legal tokens, you can&amp;#X2019;t have one right after the other. Similarly,
in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not
before.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;1'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a well-structured English
sentence with invalid tokens in it. Then write another sentence
with all valid tokens but with invalid structure.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;
When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal
language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is
(although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This
process is called '''parsing'''.

For example, when you hear the sentence, &amp;#X201C;The penny dropped,&amp;#X201D; you
understand that &amp;#X201C;the penny&amp;#X201D; is the subject and &amp;#X201C;dropped&amp;#X201D; is the
predicate. Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it
means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that you know
what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the
general implication of this sentence.

Although formal and natural languages have many features in
common&amp;#X2014;tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics&amp;#X2014;there are some
differences:

&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''ambiguity:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which
people deal with by using contextual clues and other information.
Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous,
which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,
regardless of context.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''redundancy:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce
misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of
redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages
are less redundant and more concise.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''literalness:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.
If I say, &amp;#X201C;The penny dropped,&amp;#X201D; there is probably no penny and
nothing dropping&lt;ref&gt;This idiom means that someone realized something
after a period of confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;. Formal languages
mean exactly what they say.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
People who grow up speaking a natural language&amp;#X2014;everyone&amp;#X2014;often have a
hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference
between formal and natural language is like the difference between
poetry and prose, but more so:

&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Poetry:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Words are used for their sounds as well as for
their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or
emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often
deliberate.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Prose:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; The literal meaning of words is more important,
and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to
analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Programs:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous
and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the
tokens and structure.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal
languages). First, remember that formal languages are much more dense
than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the
structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read
from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the
program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the
structure. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in
spelling and punctuation, which you can get away
with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal
language.

=== The first program ===
Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language
is called &amp;#X201C;Hello, World!&amp;#X201D; because all it does is display the
words, &amp;#X201C;Hello, World!&amp;#X201D; In Python, it looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Hello, World!'
&lt;/source&gt;

This is an example of a '''print statement'''&lt;ref&gt;In Python 3.0,
&lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; is a function, not a statement, so the syntax is &lt;TT&gt;print(&amp;#X2019;Hello, World!&amp;#X2019;)&lt;/TT&gt;. We will get to functions soon!&lt;/ref&gt;, which
doesn&amp;#X2019;t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the
screen. In this case, the result is the words

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;Hello, World!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end
of the text to be displayed; they don&amp;#X2019;t appear in the result.

Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the
simplicity of the &amp;#X201C;Hello, World!&amp;#X201D; program. By this standard, Python
does about as well as possible.

=== Debugging ===
It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can
try out the examples as you go. You can run most of the examples in
interactive mode, but if you put the code into a script, it is easier
to try out variations.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try
to make mistakes. For example, in the &amp;#X201C;Hello, world!&amp;#X201D; program,
what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What
if you leave out both? What if you spell &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; wrong?

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps
with debugging, because you get to know what the error messages mean.
It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later
and accidentally.

Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong
emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might 
feel angry, despondent or embarrassed.

There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if
they were people&lt;ref&gt;See Reeves and Nass, &lt;I&gt;The Media
Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media
Like Real People and Places&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. When they work well, we think
of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we
respond to them the same way we respond to rude,
obstinate people.

Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them.
One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with
certain strengths, like speed and precision, and
particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability
to grasp the big picture.

Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage
of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways
to use your emotions to engage with the problem,
without letting your reactions interfere with your ability
to work effectively.

Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill
that is useful for many activities beyond programming. At the
end of each chapter there is a debugging section, like this one,
with my thoughts about debugging. I hope they help!

=== Exercises ===

==== Exercise 2 ====
Use a web browser to go to the Python website, http://python.org/.
This page contains information about Python and links
to Python-related pages, and it gives you the ability to search
the Python documentation.
For example, if you enter &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; in the search window, the
first link that appears is the documentation of the &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt;
statement. At this point, not all of it will make sense to you,
but it is good to know where it is.

==== Exercise 3 ====
Start the Python interpreter and type ''''&lt;TT&gt;help()&lt;/TT&gt;'''' to start the online
help utility. Or you can type ''&lt;CODE&gt;''help('print')''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' to get information
about the ''''&lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt;'''' statement.''
''If this example doesn&amp;#X2019;t work, you
may need to install additional Python documentation or set an
environment variable; the details depend on your operating system and
version of Python.

==== Exercise 4 ====
Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
Python&amp;#X2019;s syntax for math operations is almost the same as
standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols
''''&lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;-&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;/&lt;/TT&gt;'''' denote addition, subtraction
and division, as you would expect. The symbol for
multiplication is ''''&lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''
''If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your
average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour?
(Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).''

=== Values and types ===
A '''value''' is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. The values we have seen so far are &lt;TT&gt;1&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;2&lt;/TT&gt;, and &lt;CODE&gt;'Hello, World!'&lt;/CODE&gt;.

These values belong to different '''types''':
&lt;TT&gt;2&lt;/TT&gt; is an integer, and &lt;CODE&gt;'Hello, World!'&lt;/CODE&gt; is a '''string''',
so-called because it contains a &amp;#X201C;string&amp;#X201D; of letters.
You (and the interpreter) can identify
strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.

The print statement also works for integers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 4
4
&lt;/source&gt;
If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type('Hello, World!')
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(17)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type &lt;TT&gt;str&lt;/TT&gt; and
integers belong to the type &lt;TT&gt;int&lt;/TT&gt;. Less obviously, numbers
with a decimal point belong to a type called &lt;TT&gt;float&lt;/TT&gt;,
because these numbers are represented in a
format called '''floating-point'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(3.2)
&lt;type 'float'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

What about values like &lt;CODE&gt;'17'&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;'3.2'&lt;/CODE&gt;?
They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like
strings.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type('17')
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type('3.2')
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

They're strings.

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas
between groups of three digits, as in &lt;TT&gt;1,000,000&lt;/TT&gt;. This is not a
legal integer in Python, but it is legal:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 1,000,000
1 0 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Well, that&amp;#X2019;s not what we expected at all! Python interprets &lt;TT&gt;1,000,000&lt;/TT&gt; as a comma-separated sequence of integers, which it
prints with spaces between.

This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code
runs without producing an error message, but it doesn't do the
&amp;#X201C;right&amp;#X201D; thing.

=== Variables ===
One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate '''variables'''. A variable is a name that
refers to a value.

An '''assignment statement''' creates new variables and gives
them values:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; message = 'And now for something completely different'
&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 17
&gt;&gt;&gt; pi = 3.1415926535897931
&lt;/source&gt;

This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string
to a new variable named &lt;TT&gt;message&lt;/TT&gt;;
the second gives the integer &lt;TT&gt;17&lt;/TT&gt; to &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;; the third
assigns the (approximate) value of &amp;#X3C0; to &lt;TT&gt;pi&lt;/TT&gt;.

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with
an arrow pointing to the variable&amp;#X2019;s value. This kind of figure is
called a '''state diagram''' because it shows what state each of the
variables is in (think of it as the variable&amp;#X2019;s state of mind).
This diagram shows the result of the previous example:

{|border=&quot;0&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;'And now for something completely different'&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;17&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;3.1415926535897931&lt;/code&gt;
|}

To display the value of a variable, you can use a print statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print n
17
&gt;&gt;&gt; print pi
3.14159265359
&lt;/source&gt;

The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(message)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(n)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(pi)
&lt;type 'float'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Exercise 1 ====
If you type an integer with a leading zero, you might get
a confusing error:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; zipcode = 02492
                 ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
&lt;/source&gt;

Other number seem to work, but the results are bizarre:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; zipcode = 02132
&gt;&gt;&gt; print zipcode
1114
&lt;/source&gt;

Can you figure out what is going on? Hint: print the values &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;010&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0100&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;01000&lt;/code&gt;.

===Variable names and keywords ===
Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful&amp;#X2014;they document what the variable is used for.

Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you'll see why later).

The underscore character (&lt;CODE&gt;_&lt;/CODE&gt;) can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as &lt;CODE&gt;my_name&lt;/CODE&gt; or &lt;CODE&gt;airspeed_of_unladen_swallow&lt;/CODE&gt;.

If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 76trombones = 'big parade'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; more@ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;76trombones&lt;/TT&gt; is illegal because it does not begin with a letter.
&lt;TT&gt;more@&lt;/TT&gt; is illegal because it contains an illegal character, &lt;TT&gt;@&lt;/TT&gt;. But what's wrong with &lt;TT&gt;class&lt;/TT&gt;?

It turns out that &lt;TT&gt;class&lt;/TT&gt; is one of Python's '''keywords'''. The
interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program,
and they cannot be used as variable names.

Python has 31 keywords:

{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;pass&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;
|-    
|&lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;
|-    
|&lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;raise&lt;/code&gt;          
|-
|&lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;             
|-
|&lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;
|}

You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains
about one of your variable names and you don't know why, see if it
is on this list.

If you write your code in a text editor that understands Python, you may find that it makes it easy for you to spot such keyword clashes by displaying keywords in a different color to ordinary variables. This feature is called ''syntax highlighting'', and most programmers find it indispensable. This book uses syntax highlighting for its example code, so in the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
ok_variable = 42
yield = 42
&lt;/source&gt;

you can see that &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; has been recognized as a keyword and not as an ordinary variable, since it is colored orange.

=== Statements ===
A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can
execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print
and assignment.

When you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter
executes it and displays the result, if there is one.

A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there
is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time
as the statements execute.

For example, the script
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;print 1
x = 2
print x
&lt;/PRE&gt;
produces the output
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;1
2
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The assignment statement produces no output.

=== Operators and operands ===
'''Operators''' are special symbols that represent computations like
addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to
are called '''operands'''.

The operators &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;-&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;/&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;**&lt;/TT&gt;
perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
exponentiation, as in the following examples:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;20+32   hour-1   hour*60+minute   minute/60   5**2   (5+9)*(15-7)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In some other languages, &lt;CODE&gt;^&lt;/CODE&gt; is used for exponentiation, but
in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. I won&amp;#X2019;t cover
bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about
them at &lt;TT&gt;wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators&lt;/TT&gt;.

The division operator might not do what you expect:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; minute = 59
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; minute/60
0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The value of &lt;TT&gt;minute&lt;/TT&gt; is 59, and in conventional arithmetic 59
divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0. The reason for the discrepancy is
that Python is performing '''floor division'''.&lt;ref&gt;In Python 3.0,
the result of this division is a &lt;TT&gt;float&lt;/TT&gt;. The new operator
&lt;TT&gt;//&lt;/TT&gt; performs integer division.&lt;/ref&gt;

When both of the operands are integers, the result is also an
integer; floor division chops off the fraction
part, so in this example it rounds down to zero.

If either of the operands is a floating-point number, Python performs
floating-point division, and the result is a &lt;TT&gt;float&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; minute/60.0
0.98333333333333328
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Expressions ===
An '''expression''' is a combination of values, variables, and operators.
A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is
a variable, so the following are all legal expressions
(assuming that the variable &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; has been assigned a value):

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;17
x
x + 17
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter
'''evaluates''' it and displays the result:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 + 1
2
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But in a script, an expression all by itself doesn&amp;#X2019;t
do anything! This is a common
source of confusion for beginners.

==== Exercise 2 ====
Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
5
x = 5
x + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Now put the same statements into a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.

=== Order of operations ===
When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of
evaluation depends on the '''rules of precedence'''. For
mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention.
The acronym '''PEMDAS''' is a useful way to
remember the rules:

*'''P'''arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, &lt;TT&gt;2 * (3-1)&lt;/TT&gt; is 4, and &lt;TT&gt;(1+1)**(5-2)&lt;/TT&gt; is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in &lt;TT&gt;(minute * 100) / 60&lt;/TT&gt;, even if it doesn't change the result.
*'''E'''xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so &lt;TT&gt;2**1+1&lt;/TT&gt; is 3, not 4, and &lt;TT&gt;3*1**3&lt;/TT&gt; is 3, not 27. 
*'''M'''ultiplication and '''D'''ivision have the same precedence, which is higher than '''A'''ddition and '''S'''ubtraction, which also have the same precedence. So &lt;TT&gt;2*3-1&lt;/TT&gt; is 5, not 4, and &lt;TT&gt;6+4/2&lt;/TT&gt; is 8, not 5.
*Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So in the expression &lt;TT&gt;degrees / 2 * pi&lt;/TT&gt;, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by &lt;TT&gt;pi&lt;/TT&gt;. To divide by 2 &amp;#X3C0;, you can reorder the operands or use parentheses.

=== String operations ===
In general, you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even
if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;'2'-'1'    'eggs'/'easy'    'third'*'a charm'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator works with strings, but it
might not do what you expect: it performs
'''concatenation''', which means joining the strings by
linking them end-to-end. For example:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;first = 'throat'
second = 'warbler'
print first + second
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The output of this program is &lt;TT&gt;throatwarbler&lt;/TT&gt;.

The &lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt; operator also works on strings; it performs repetition.
For example, &lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;Spam&amp;#X2019;*3&lt;/TT&gt; is &lt;CODE&gt;'SpamSpamSpam'&lt;/CODE&gt;. If one of the operands
is a string, the other has to be an integer.

This use of &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt; makes sense by
analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as &lt;TT&gt;4*3&lt;/TT&gt; is
equivalent to &lt;TT&gt;4+4+4&lt;/TT&gt;, we expect &lt;CODE&gt;'Spam'*3&lt;/CODE&gt; to be the same as
&lt;CODE&gt;'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam'&lt;/CODE&gt;, and it is. On the other hand, there is a
significant way in which string concatenation and repetition are
different from integer addition and multiplication.
Can you think of a property that addition has
that string concatenation does not?

=== Comments ===
As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult
to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to
look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.

For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain
in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called
'''comments''', and they start with the &lt;CODE&gt;#&lt;/CODE&gt; symbol:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour
&lt;/source&gt;

Everything from the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the line is ignored&amp;#X2014;it
has no effect on the program.

Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of
the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out
''what'' the code does; it is much more useful to explain ''why''.

This comment is redundant with the code and useless:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
v = 5     # assign 5 to v
&lt;/source&gt;

This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
v = 5     # velocity in meters/second.
&lt;/source&gt;

Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff.

=== Debugging ===
At this point the syntax error you are most likely to make is
an illegal variable name, like &lt;TT&gt;class&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;yield&lt;/TT&gt;, which
are keywords, or &lt;CODE&gt;odd~job&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;US$&lt;/CODE&gt;, which contain
illegal characters.

If you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two
operands without an operator:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bad name = 5
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For syntax errors, the error messages don&amp;#X2019;t help much.
The most common messages are &lt;TT&gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;SyntaxError: invalid token&lt;/TT&gt;, neither of which is very informative.

The runtime error you are most likely to make is a &amp;#X201C;use before
def;&amp;#X201D; that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned
a value. This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; principal = 327.68
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; interest = principle * rate
NameError: name 'principle' is not defined
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Variables names are case sensitive, so &lt;TT&gt;LaTeX&lt;/TT&gt; is not the
same as &lt;TT&gt;latex&lt;/TT&gt;.

At this point the most likely cause of a semantic error is
the order of operations. For example, to evaluate 1/2 &amp;#X3C0;,
you might be tempted to write
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1.0 / 2.0 * pi
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But the division happens first, so you would get &amp;#X3C0; / 2, which
is not the same thing! There is no way for Python
to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don&amp;#X2019;t
get an error message; you just get the wrong answer.

=== Exercises ===
==== Exercise 3 ====
Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
width = 17
height = 12.0
delimiter = '.'
&lt;/source&gt;

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
width/2
width/2.0
height/3
1 + 2 * 5
delimiter * 5
&lt;/source&gt;

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

==== Exercise 4 ====
Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

== Function calls ==
  
In the context of programming, a '''function''' is a named sequence of
statements that performs a computation. When you define a function,
you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can
&quot;call&quot; the function by name. 
We have already seen one example of a '''function call''':


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type(32)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses
is called the '''argument''' of the function. The result, for this
function, is the type of the argument.

It is common to say that a function &quot;takes&quot; an argument and &quot;returns&quot; a result. The result is called the '''return value'''.
 
== Type conversion functions ==
Python provides built-in functions that convert values
from one type to another. The int function takes any value and
converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; int('32')
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; int('Hello')
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello
&lt;/source&gt;

int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it
doesn't round off; it chops off the fraction part:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; int(3.99999)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(-2.3)
-2
&lt;/source&gt;

float converts integers and strings to floating-point
numbers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; float(32)
32.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; float('3.14159')
3.14159
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, str converts its argument to a string:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; str(32)
'32'
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(3.14159)
'3.14159'

&lt;/source&gt;

== Math functions ==
  
Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar
mathematical functions. A '''module''' is a file that contains a
collection of related functions.

 
Before we can use the module, we have to import it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import math

&lt;/source&gt;

This statement creates a '''module object''' named math. If
you print the module object, you get some information about it:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print math

&lt;module 'math' from '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/math.so'&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the
module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name
of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also
known as a period). This format is called '''dot notation'''.


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ratio = signal_power / noise_power
&gt;&gt;&gt; decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)

&gt;&gt;&gt; radians = 0.7
&gt;&gt;&gt; height = math.sin(radians)

&lt;/source&gt;

The first example computes the logarithm base 10 of the
signal-to-noise ratio. The math module also provides a
function called log that computes logarithms base e.

     
The second example finds the sine of radians. The name of the
variable is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric
functions (cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To
convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2
&amp;#X3C0;:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; degrees = 45

&gt;&gt;&gt; radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sin(radians)
0.707106781187

&lt;/source&gt;

The expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math
module. The value of this variable is an approximation
of &amp;#X3C0;, accurate to about 15 digits.


If you know
your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to
the square root of two divided by two:

 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(2) / 2.0
0.707106781187

&lt;/source&gt;

== Composition ==
So far, we have looked at the elements of a program&amp;#X2014;variables,
expressions, and statements&amp;#X2014;in isolation, without talking about how to
combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their
ability to take small building blocks and '''compose''' them. For
example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression,
including arithmetic operators:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)

&lt;/source&gt;

And even function calls:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))

&lt;/source&gt;

Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary
expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment
statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left
side is a syntax error.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes = hours * 60                 # right
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
&lt;/source&gt;
 
== Adding new functions ==
So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python,
but it is also possible to add new functions.
A '''function definition''' specifies the name of a new function and
the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.

Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def print_lyrics():
    print &quot;I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.&quot;
    print &quot;I sleep all night and I work all day.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function
definition. The name of the function is &lt;code&gt;print_lyrics&lt;/code&gt;. The
rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,
numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character
can't be a number. You can't use a keyword as the name of a function,
and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same
name.

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function
doesn't take any arguments.

The first line of the function definition is called the '''header''';
the rest is called the '''body'''. The header has to end with a colon
and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is
always four spaces (see Section&amp;#XA0;). The body can contain
any number of statements.

The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double
quotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing;
most people use single quotes except in cases like this where
a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.

If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter
prints ellipses (''...'') to let you know that the definition
isn't complete:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_lyrics():
...     print &quot;I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.&quot;
...     print &quot;I sleep all night and I work all day.&quot;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is
not necessary in a script).

Defining a function creates a variable with the same name.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print print_lyrics
&lt;function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(print_lyrics)
&lt;type 'function'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of &lt;code&gt;print_lyrics&lt;/code&gt; is a '''function object''', which
has type &lt;code&gt;'function'&lt;/code&gt;.

 
The syntax for calling the new function is the same as
for built-in functions:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.

&lt;/source&gt;

Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another
function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write
a function called &lt;code&gt;repeat_lyrics&lt;/code&gt;:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

&lt;/source&gt;

And then call &lt;code&gt;repeat_lyrics&lt;/code&gt;:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repeat_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.

&lt;/source&gt;

But that's not really how the song goes.


== Definitions and uses ==
 
Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the
whole program looks like this:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def print_lyrics():
    print &quot;I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.&quot;
    print &quot;I sleep all night and I work all day.&quot;

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()

&lt;/source&gt;

This program contains two function definitions: &lt;code&gt;print_lyrics&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;repeat_lyrics&lt;/code&gt;. Function definitions get executed just like other
statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements
inside the function do not get executed until the function is called, and
the function definition generates no output.


As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can
execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be
executed before the first time it is called.

=== Exercise 1 ===
Move the last line of this program
to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run 
the program and see what error
message you get.

=== Exercise 2 ===
Move the function call back to the bottom
and move the definition of &lt;code&gt;print_lyrics&lt;/code&gt; after the definition of
&lt;code&gt;repeat_lyrics&lt;/code&gt;. What happens when you run this program?

== Flow of execution ==
In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use,
you have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is
called the '''flow of execution'''.

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program.
Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.

Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the
program, but remember that statements inside the function are not
executed until the function is called.

A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of
going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of
the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back
to pick up where it left off.

That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can
call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might
have to execute the statements in another function. But while
executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet
another function!

Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each
time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in
the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program,
it terminates.


What's the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you
don't always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes
more sense if you follow the flow of execution.


== Parameters and arguments ==
     
Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For
example, when you call math.sin you pass a number
as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument:
math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.


Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to
variables called '''parameters'''. Here is an example of a
user-defined function that takes an argument:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def print_twice(bruce):
    print bruce
    print bruce

&lt;/source&gt;

This function assigns the argument to a parameter
named bruce. When the function is called, it prints the value of
the parameter (whatever it is) twice.


This function works with any value that can be printed.


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice('Spam')
Spam
Spam

&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(17)
17
17
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(math.pi)
3.14159265359
3.14159265359

&lt;/source&gt;

The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also
apply to user-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression
as an argument for &lt;code&gt;print_twice&lt;/code&gt;:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice('Spam '*4)
Spam Spam Spam Spam
Spam Spam Spam Spam
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))
-1.0
-1.0

&lt;/source&gt;

The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so
in the examples the expressions &lt;code&gt;'Spam '*4&lt;/code&gt; and
math.cos(math.pi) are only evaluated once.


You can also use a variable as an argument:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'

&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.

&lt;/source&gt;

The name of the variable we pass as an argument (michael) has
nothing to do with the name of the parameter (bruce). It
doesn't matter what the value was called back home (in the caller);
here in &lt;code&gt;print_twice&lt;/code&gt;, we call everybody bruce.


== Variables and parameters are local ==
  
When you create a variable inside a function, it is '''local''',
which means that it only
exists inside the function. For example:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def cat_twice(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print_twice(cat)


&lt;/source&gt;

This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints
the result twice. Here is an example that uses it:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line1 = 'Bing tiddle '
&gt;&gt;&gt; line2 = 'tiddle bang.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat_twice(line1, line2)
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.

&lt;/source&gt;

When &lt;code&gt;cat_twice&lt;/code&gt; terminates, the variable cat
is destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an exception:

 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print cat
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined


&lt;/source&gt;

Parameters are also local.
For example, outside &lt;code&gt;print_twice&lt;/code&gt;, there is no
such thing as bruce.


== Stack diagrams ==
    
To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes
useful to draw a '''stack diagram'''. Like state diagrams, stack
diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the
function each variable belongs to.

 
Each function is represented by a '''frame'''. A frame is a box
with the name of a function
beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it.
The stack diagram for the
previous example looks like this:

[[Image:book004.png]]
The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function
called which, and so on. In this example, &lt;code&gt;print_twice&lt;/code&gt;

was called by &lt;code&gt;cat_twice&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cat_twice&lt;/code&gt; was called by 
&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt;, which is a special name for the topmost frame. When
you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to 
&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt;.


Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding
argument. So, part1 has the same value as
line1, part2 has the same value as line2,
and bruce has the same value as cat.


If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the
name of the function, and the name of the function that called
it, and the name of the function that called ''that'', all the
way back to &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt;.


For example, if you try to access cat from within 

&lt;code&gt;print_twice&lt;/code&gt;, you get a NameError:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 13, in __main__
    cat_twice(line1, line2)
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 5, in cat_twice
    print_twice(cat)
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 9, in print_twice
    print cat
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined

&lt;/source&gt;

This list of functions is called a '''traceback'''. It tells you what
program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions
were executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that
caused the error.


The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the
order of the frames in the stack diagram. The function that is
currently running is at the bottom.


== Fruitful functions and void functions ==
    
Some of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield
results; for lack of a better name, I call them '''fruitful
functions'''. Other functions, like &lt;code&gt;print_twice&lt;/code&gt;, perform an
action but don't return a value. They are called '''void
functions'''.


When you call a fruitful function, you almost always
want to do something with the result; for example, you might
assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;x = math.cos(radians)
golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2


&lt;/source&gt;

When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays
the result:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(5)
2.2360679774997898

&lt;/source&gt;

But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself,
the return value is lost forever!


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;math.sqrt(5)

&lt;/source&gt;

This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn't store
or display the result, it is not very useful.

 
Void functions might display something on the screen or have some
other effect, but they don't have a return value. If you try to
assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called
None.

 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; result = print_twice('Bing')
Bing
Bing
&gt;&gt;&gt; print result
None


&lt;/source&gt;

The value None is not the same as the string &lt;code&gt;'None'&lt;/code&gt;. 
It is a special value that has its own type:


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(None)
&lt;type 'NoneType'&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The functions we have written so far are all void. We will start
writing fruitful functions in a few chapters.


== Why functions? ==
It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide
a program into functions. There are several reasons:

* Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.
* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.
* Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.
* Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.

== Debugging ==
If you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might
run into problems with spaces and tabs. The best way to avoid
these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most text
editors that know about Python do this by default, but some
don't.


Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them
hard to debug, so try to find an editor that manages indentation
for you.


Also, don't forget to save your program before you run it. Some
development environments do this automatically, but some don't.
In that case the program you are looking at in the text editor
is not the same as the program you are running.


Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same,
incorrect, program over and over!


Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running.
If you're not sure, put something like &lt;code&gt;print 'hello'&lt;/code&gt; at the
beginning of the program and run it again. If you don't see
&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;, you're not running the right program!

== Exercises ==
=== Exercise 3 ===
''Python provides a built-in function called len that
returns the length of a string, so the value of &lt;code&gt;len('allen')&lt;/code&gt; is 5.''

''Write a function named &lt;code&gt;right_justify&lt;/code&gt; that takes a string
named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough

=== TurtleWorld ===
To accompany this book, I have written a suite of modules called Swampy. One of these modules is TurtleWorld, which provides a set of functions for drawing lines by steering turtles around the screen.

You can download Swampy from &lt;TT&gt;[http://thinkpython.com/swampy thinkpython.com/swampy]&lt;/TT&gt;; follow the instructions there to install Swampy on your system.

Move into the directory that contains &lt;TT&gt;TurtleWorld.py&lt;/TT&gt;, create a file named &lt;TT&gt;polygon.py&lt;/TT&gt; and type in the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from TurtleWorld import *

world = TurtleWorld()
bob = Turtle()
print bob

wait_for_user()
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line is a variation of the &lt;TT&gt;import&lt;/TT&gt; statement we saw before;
instead of creating a module object, it imports the functions
from the module directly, so you can access them without using dot
notation.

The next lines create a TurtleWorld assigned to &lt;TT&gt;world&lt;/TT&gt; and
a Turtle assigned to &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt;. Printing &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; yields something
like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&lt;TurtleWorld.Turtle instance at 0xb7bfbf4c&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This means that &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; refers to an '''instance''' of a Turtle as defined in module &lt;TT&gt;TurtleWorld&lt;/TT&gt;. In this context, &quot;instance&quot; means a member of a set; this Turtle is one of the set of possible Turtles.

&lt;CODE&gt;wait_for_user&lt;/CODE&gt; tells TurtleWorld to wait for the user
to do something, although in this case there's not much for
the user to do except close the window.

TurtleWorld provides several
turtle-steering functions: &lt;TT&gt;fd&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;bk&lt;/TT&gt; for
forward and backward, and &lt;TT&gt;lt&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;rt&lt;/TT&gt; for left and
right turns. Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is
either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves
a trail when it moves. The functions &lt;TT&gt;pu&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;pd&lt;/TT&gt;
stand for &amp;#X201C;pen up&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;pen down.&amp;#X201D;

To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program
(after creating &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; and before calling &lt;CODE&gt;wait_for_user&lt;/CODE&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
fd(bob, 100)
rt(bob)
fd(bob, 100)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line tells &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; to take 100 steps
forward. The second line tells him to turn right.

When you run this program, you should see &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; move east and then
south, leaving two line segments behind.

Now modify the program to draw a square. Don&amp;#X2019;t turn the page until
you've got it working!

=== Simple repetition ===
Chances are you wrote something like this (leaving out the code
that creates TurtleWorld and waits for the user):
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)

fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)

fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)

fd(bob, 100)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
We can do the same thing more concisely with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement.
Add this example to &lt;TT&gt;polygon.py&lt;/TT&gt; and run it again:




&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for i in range(4):
    print 'Hello!'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You should see something like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This is the simplest use of the &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement; we will see
more later. But that should be enough to let you rewrite your
square-drawing program. Don&amp;#X2019;t turn the page until you do.

Here is a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement that draws a square:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for i in range(4):
    fd(bob, 100)
    lt(bob)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The syntax of a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement is similar to a function
definition. It has a header that ends with a colon and an indented
body. The body can contain any number of statements.

A &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement is sometimes called a '''loop''' because
the flow of execution runs through the body and then loops back
to the top. In this case, it runs the body four times.

This version is actually a little different from the previous
square-drawing code because it makes another left turn after
drawing the last side of the square. The extra turn takes a little
more time, but it simplifies the code if we do the same thing
every time through the loop. This version also has the effect
of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in
the starting direction.

=== Exercises ===
The following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld. They
are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too. While you are
working on them, think about what the point is.

The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so
don&amp;#X2019;t look until you have finished (or at least tried).

*Write a function called &lt;TT&gt;square&lt;/TT&gt; that takes a parameter
named &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw
a square.
Write a function call that passes &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; as an argument to
&lt;TT&gt;square&lt;/TT&gt;, and then run the program again.

*Add another parameter, named &lt;TT&gt;length&lt;/TT&gt;, to &lt;TT&gt;square&lt;/TT&gt;.
Modify the body so length of the sides is &lt;TT&gt;length&lt;/TT&gt;, and then
modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the
program again. Test your program with a range of values for &lt;TT&gt;length&lt;/TT&gt;.

*The functions &lt;TT&gt;lt&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;rt&lt;/TT&gt; make 90-degree turns by
default, but you can provide a second argument that specifies the
number of degrees. For example, &lt;TT&gt;lt(bob, 45)&lt;/TT&gt; turns &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; 45
degrees to the left.
Make a copy of &lt;TT&gt;square&lt;/TT&gt; and change the name to &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt;. Add
another parameter named &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; and modify the body so it draws an
n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The angles of an n-sided regular
polygon are 360.0 / &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; degrees.




*Write a function called &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt; that takes a turtle, &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;,
and radius, &lt;TT&gt;r&lt;/TT&gt;, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle
by invoking &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; with an appropriate length and number of
sides. Test your function with a range of values of &lt;TT&gt;r&lt;/TT&gt;.



Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that
&lt;TT&gt;length * n = circumference&lt;/TT&gt;.

Another hint: if &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt; is too slow for you, you can speed
him up by changing &lt;TT&gt;bob.delay&lt;/TT&gt;, which is the time between moves,
in seconds. &lt;TT&gt;bob.delay = 0.01&lt;/TT&gt; ought to get him moving.

*Make a more general version of &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt; called &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt;
that takes an additional parameter &lt;TT&gt;angle&lt;/TT&gt;, which determines
what fraction of a circle to draw. &lt;TT&gt;angle&lt;/TT&gt; is in units of
degrees, so when &lt;TT&gt;angle=360&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt; should draw a complete
circle.

=== Encapsulation ===
The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code
into a function definition and then call the function, passing
the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def square(t):
    for i in range(4):
        fd(t, 100)
        lt(t)

square(bob)
&lt;/source&gt;

The innermost statements, &lt;TT&gt;fd&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;lt&lt;/TT&gt; are
indented twice to show that they are inside the &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop,
which is inside the function definition. The next line,
&lt;TT&gt;square(bob)&lt;/TT&gt;, is flush with the left margin, so that is the
end of both the &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop and the function definition.

Inside the function, &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt; refers to the same turtle &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt;
refers to, so &lt;TT&gt;lt(t)&lt;/TT&gt; has the same effect as &lt;TT&gt;lt(bob)&lt;/TT&gt;.
So why not call the parameter &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt;? The idea is that &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;
can be any turtle, not just &lt;TT&gt;bob&lt;/TT&gt;, so you could create
a second turtle and pass it as an argument to &lt;TT&gt;square&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
ray = Turtle()
square(ray)
&lt;/source&gt;

Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called '''encapsulation'''. One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it
attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation.
Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise
to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!

=== Generalization ===

The next step is to add a &lt;TT&gt;length&lt;/TT&gt; parameter to &lt;TT&gt;square&lt;/TT&gt;.
Here is a solution:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def square(t, length):
    for i in range(4):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t)

square(bob, 100)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Adding a parameter to a function is called '''generalization'''
because it makes the function more general: in the previous
version, the square is always the same size; in this version
it can be any size.

The next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing
squares, &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; draws regular polygons with any number of
sides. Here is a solution:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def polygon(t, n, length):
    angle = 360.0 / n
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)

polygon(bob, 7, 70)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70. If you have
more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they
are, or what order they should be in. It is legal, and sometimes
helpful, to include the names of the parameters in the argument
list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
These are called '''keyword arguments''' because they include
the parameter names as &amp;#X201C;keywords&amp;#X201D; (not to be confused with
Python keywords like &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;def&lt;/TT&gt;).

This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder
about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the
arguments are assigned to the parameters.

=== Interface design ===
The next step is to write &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt;, which takes a radius,
&lt;TT&gt;r&lt;/TT&gt;, as a parameter. Here is a simple solution that uses
&lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; to draw a 50-sided polygon:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def circle(t, r):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r
    n = 50
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(t, n, length)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius
&lt;TT&gt;r&lt;/TT&gt; using the formula 2 &amp;#X3C0; &lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;. Since we use &lt;TT&gt;math.pi&lt;/TT&gt;, we
have to import &lt;TT&gt;math&lt;/TT&gt;. By convention, &lt;TT&gt;import&lt;/TT&gt; statements
are usually at the beginning of the script.

&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle,
so &lt;TT&gt;length&lt;/TT&gt; is the length of each segment. Thus, &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt;
draws a 50-sides polygon that approximates a circle with radius &lt;TT&gt;r&lt;/TT&gt;.

One limitation of this solution is that &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is a constant, which
means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and
for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments. One
solution would be to generalize the function by taking &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; as
a parameter. This would give the user (whoever calls &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt;)
more control, but the interface would be less clean.

The '''interface''' of a function is a summary of how it is used: what
are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return
value? An interface is &amp;#X201C;clean&amp;#X201D; if it is &amp;#X201C;as simple as
possible, but not simpler. (Einstein)&amp;#X201D;

In this example, &lt;TT&gt;r&lt;/TT&gt; belongs in the interface because it
specifies the circle to be drawn. &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is less appropriate
because it pertains to the details of ''how'' the circle should
be rendered.

Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better
to choose an appropriate value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;
depending on &lt;TT&gt;circumference&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def circle(t, r):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r
    n = int(circumference / 3) + 1
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(t, n, length)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Now the number of segments is (approximately) &lt;TT&gt;circumference/3&lt;/TT&gt;,
so the length of each segment is (approximately) 3, which is small
enough that the circles look good, but big enough to be efficient,
and appropriate for any size circle.

=== Refactoring ===
When I wrote &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt;, I was able to re-use &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt;
because a many-sided polygon is a good approximation of a circle.
But &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt; is not as cooperative; we can&amp;#X2019;t use &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt;
or &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt; to draw an arc.

One alternative is to start with a copy
of &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; and transform it into &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt;. The result
might look like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def arc(t, r, angle):
    arc_length = r * math.radians(angle)
    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = float(angle) / n
    
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, step_length)
        lt(t, step_angle)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The second half of this function looks like &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt;, but we
can&amp;#X2019;t re-use &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; without changing the interface. We could
generalize &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; to take an angle as a third argument,
but then &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; would no longer be an appropriate name!
Instead, let&amp;#X2019;s call the more general function &lt;TT&gt;polyline&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def polyline(t, n, length, angle):
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Now we can rewrite &lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt; to use &lt;TT&gt;polyline&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def polygon(t, n, length):
    angle = 360.0 / n
    polyline(t, n, length, angle)

def arc(t, r, angle):
    arc_length = r * math.radians(angle)
    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = float(angle) / n
    polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Finally, we can rewrite &lt;TT&gt;circle&lt;/TT&gt; to use &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def circle(t, r):
    arc(t, r, 360)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This process&amp;#X2014;rearranging a program to improve function
interfaces and facilitate code re-use&amp;#X2014;is called '''refactoring'''.
In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in &lt;TT&gt;arc&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;polygon&lt;/TT&gt;, so we &amp;#X201C;factored it out&amp;#X201D; into &lt;TT&gt;polyline&lt;/TT&gt;.

If we had planned ahead, we might have written &lt;TT&gt;polyline&lt;/TT&gt; first
and avoided refactoring, but often you don&amp;#X2019;t know enough at the
beginning of a project to design all the interfaces. Once you start
coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a
sign that you have learned something.

=== A development plan ===
A '''development plan''' is a process for writing programs.
The process we used
in this case study is &amp;#X201C;encapsulation and
generalization.&amp;#X201D; The steps of this process are:

*Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.

*Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function
and give it a name.

*Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.

*Repeat steps 1&amp;#X2013;3 until you have a set of working functions.
Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).

*Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring.
For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider
factoring it into an appropriately general function.

This process has some drawbacks&amp;#X2014;we will see alternatives later&amp;#X2014;but
it can be useful if you don&amp;#X2019;t know ahead of time how to divide the
program into functions. This approach lets you design as you go
along.

=== docstring ===
A '''docstring''' is a string at the beginning of a function that
explains the interface (&amp;#X201C;doc&amp;#X201D; is short for &amp;#X201C;documentation&amp;#X201D;). Here
is an example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def polyline(t, length, n, angle):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Draw n line segments with the given length and
    angle (in degrees) between them.  t is a turtle.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;    
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This docstring is a triple-quoted string, also known
as a multiline string because the triple quotes allow the string
to span more than one line.

It is terse, but it contains the essential information
someone would need to use this function. It explains concisely what
the function does (without getting into the details of how it does
it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of
the function and what type each parameter should be (if it is not
obvious).

Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface
design. A well-designed interface should be simple to explain;
if you are having a hard time explaining one of your functions,
that might be a sign that the interface could be improved.

=== Debugging ===
An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller.
The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function
agrees to do certain work.

For example, &lt;TT&gt;polyline&lt;/TT&gt; requires four arguments. The first
has to be a Turtle (or some other object that works with &lt;TT&gt;fd&lt;/TT&gt;
and &lt;TT&gt;lt&lt;/TT&gt;). The second has to be a number, and it should
probably be positive, although it turns out that the function
works even if it isn&amp;#X2019;t. The third argument should be an integer;
&lt;TT&gt;range&lt;/TT&gt; complains otherwise (depending on which version
of Python you are running). The fourth has to be a number,
which is understood to be in degrees.

These requirements are called '''preconditions''' because they
are supposed to be true before the function starts executing.
Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are
'''postconditions'''. Postconditions include the intended
effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any
side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes
in the World).

Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller
violates a (properly documented!) precondition and the function
doesn&amp;#X2019;t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.
However, for purposes of debugging it is often a good idea for
functions to check their preconditions rather than assume they are
true. If every function checks its preconditions before starting,
then if something goes wrong, you will know which function to blame.

=== Modulus operator ===
The '''[[modulus operator]]''' works on integers and yields the remainder
when the first operand is divided by the second. In Python, the
modulus operator is a percent sign (&lt;CODE&gt;%&lt;/CODE&gt;). The syntax is the same
as for other operators:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; quotient = 7 // 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(quotient)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; remainder = 7 % 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(remainder)
1
&lt;/source&gt;
So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.

The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For
example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another&amp;#X2014;if
&lt;TT&gt;x % y&lt;/TT&gt; is zero, then &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; is divisible by &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;.

Also, you can extract the right-most digit
or digits from a number. For example, &lt;TT&gt;x % 10&lt;/TT&gt; yields the
right-most digit of &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; (in base 10). Similarly &lt;TT&gt;x % 100&lt;/TT&gt;
yields the last two digits.

=== Boolean expressions ===
A '''boolean expression''' is an expression that is either true
or false. The following examples use the 
operator &lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt;, which compares two operands and produces
&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; if they are equal and &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt; otherwise:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5 == 5
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5 == 6
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt; are special
values that belong to the type &lt;TT&gt;bool&lt;/TT&gt;; they are not strings:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(True)
&amp;lt;type 'bool'&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(False)
&amp;lt;type 'bool'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt; operator is one of the '''comparison operators'''; the
others are:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;      x != y               # x is not equal to y
      x &amp;gt; y                # x is greater than y
      x &amp;lt; y                # x is less than y
      x &amp;gt;= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
      x &amp;lt;= y               # x is less than or equal to y
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python
symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error
is to use a single equal sign (&lt;TT&gt;=&lt;/TT&gt;) instead of a double equal sign
(&lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt;). Remember that &lt;TT&gt;=&lt;/TT&gt; is an assignment operator and
&lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt; is a comparison operator. There is no such thing as
&lt;TT&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/TT&gt;.

=== Logical operators ===
There are three '''logical operators''': &lt;TT&gt;and&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;or&lt;/TT&gt;, and &lt;TT&gt;not&lt;/TT&gt;. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is
similar to their meaning in English. For example,
&lt;TT&gt;x &amp;gt; 0 and x &amp;lt; 10&lt;/TT&gt; is true only if &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; is greater than 0
''and'' less than 10.

&lt;TT&gt;n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0&lt;/TT&gt; is true if ''either'' of the conditions
is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 ''or'' 3.

Finally, the &lt;TT&gt;not&lt;/TT&gt; operator negates a boolean
expression, so &lt;TT&gt;not (x &amp;gt; y)&lt;/TT&gt; is true if &lt;TT&gt;x &amp;gt; y&lt;/TT&gt; is false,
that is, if &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; is less than or equal to &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;.

Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be
boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict.
Any nonzero number is interpreted as &amp;#X201C;true.&amp;#X201D;
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 17 and True
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to
it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it (unless
you know what you are doing).

=== Conditional execution ===
In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability
to check conditions and change the behavior of the program
accordingly. '''Conditional statements''' give us this ability. The
simplest form is the &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if x &gt; 0:
    print 'x is positive'
&lt;/source&gt;

The boolean expression after the &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statement is
called the '''condition'''. If it is true, then the indented
statement gets executed. If not, nothing happens.

&lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statements have the same structure as function definitions:
a header followed by an indented block. Statements like this are
called '''compound statements'''.

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in
the body, but there has to be at least one.
Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually
as a place keeper for code you haven't written yet). In that
case, you can use the &lt;TT&gt;pass&lt;/TT&gt; statement, which does nothing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if x &lt; 0:
    pass          # need to handle negative values!
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alternative execution ===
A second form of the &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statement is '''alternative execution''',
in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines
which one gets executed. The syntax looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if x % 2 == 0:
    print 'x is even'
else:
    print 'x is odd'
&lt;/source&gt;

If the remainder when &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; is divided by 2 is 0, then we
know that &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; is even, and the program displays a message to that
effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is
executed. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of
the alternatives will be executed. The alternatives are called
'''branches''', because they are branches in the flow of execution.

=== Chained conditionals ===
Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than
two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a '''chained conditional''':
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if x &amp;lt; y:
    print 'x is less than y'
elif x &amp;gt; y:
    print 'x is greater than y'
else:
    print 'x and y are equal'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;elif&lt;/TT&gt; is an abbreviation of &amp;#X201C;else if.&amp;#X201D; Again, exactly one
branch will be executed. There is no limit on the number of &lt;TT&gt;elif&lt;/TT&gt; statements. If there is an &lt;TT&gt;else&lt;/TT&gt; clause, it has to be
at the end, but there doesn&amp;#X2019;t have to be one.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if choice == 'a':
    draw_a()
elif choice == 'b':
    draw_b()
elif choice == 'c':
    draw_c()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false,
the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is
true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement
ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the
first true branch executes.
 
=== Nested conditionals ===
One conditional can also be nested within another. We could have
written the trichotomy example like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if x == y:
    print 'x and y are equal'
else:
    if x &amp;lt; y:
        print 'x is less than y'
    else:
        print 'x is greater than y'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The outer conditional contains two branches. The
first branch contains a simple statement. The second branch
contains another &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statement, which has two branches of its
own. Those two branches are both simple statements,
although they could have been conditional statements as well.

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure
apparent, '''nested conditionals''' become difficult to read very
quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional
statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a
single conditional:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if 0 &amp;lt; x:
    if x &amp;lt; 10:
        print 'x is a positive single-digit number.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement is executed only if we make it past both
conditionals, so we can get the same effect with the &lt;TT&gt;and&lt;/TT&gt; operator:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if 0 &amp;lt; x and x &amp;lt; 10:
    print 'x is a positive single-digit number.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Recursion ===
It is legal for one function to call another;
it is also legal for a function to call itself. It may not be obvious
why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most
magical things a program can do.
For example, look at the following function:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def countdown(n):
    if n &amp;lt;= 0:
        print 'Blastoff!'
    else:
        print n
        countdown(n-1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, &amp;#X201C;Blastoff!&amp;#X201D;
Otherwise, it outputs &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; and then calls a function named &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt;&amp;#X2014;itself&amp;#X2014;passing &lt;TT&gt;n-1&lt;/TT&gt; as an argument.

What happens if we call this function like this?
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; countdown(3)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The execution of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; begins with &lt;TT&gt;n=3&lt;/TT&gt;, and since
&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is greater than 0, it outputs the value 3, and then calls itself...
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
The execution of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; begins with &lt;TT&gt;n=2&lt;/TT&gt;, and since
&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is greater than 0, it outputs the value 2, and then calls itself...&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
The execution of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; begins with &lt;TT&gt;n=1&lt;/TT&gt;, and since
&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is greater than 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
The execution of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; begins with &lt;TT&gt;n=0&lt;/TT&gt;, and since &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is not greater than 0, it outputs the word, &amp;#X201C;Blastoff!&amp;#X201D; and then
returns.
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; that got &lt;TT&gt;n=1&lt;/TT&gt; returns.

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; that got &lt;TT&gt;n=2&lt;/TT&gt; returns.

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; that got &lt;TT&gt;n=3&lt;/TT&gt; returns.

And then you&amp;#X2019;re back in &lt;CODE&gt;__main__&lt;/CODE&gt;. So, the
total output looks like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;3
2
1
Blastoff!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A function that calls itself is '''recursive'''; the process is
called '''recursion'''.

As another example, we can write a function that prints a
string &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; times.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def print_n(s, n):
    if n &amp;lt;= 0:
        return
    print s
    print_n(s, n-1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If &lt;TT&gt;n &amp;lt;= 0&lt;/TT&gt; the &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement exits the function. The
flow of execution immediately returns to the caller, and the remaining
lines of the function are not executed.

The rest of the function is similar to &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt;: if &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is
greater than 0, it displays &lt;TT&gt;s&lt;/TT&gt; and then calls itself to display
&lt;TT&gt;s&lt;/TT&gt; &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1 additional times. So the number of lines of output
is &lt;TT&gt;1 + (n - 1)&lt;/TT&gt;, which adds up to
&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;.

For simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop. But we will see examples later that are hard to write
with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop and easy to write with recursion, so it is
good to start early.

=== Stack diagrams for recursive functions ===
In Section&amp;#XA0;3.10, we used a stack diagram to represent
the state of a program during a function call. The same kind of
diagram can help interpret a recursive function.

Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function
frame, which contains the function&amp;#X2019;s local variables and parameters.
For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the
stack at the same time.

This figure shows a stack diagram for &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; called with
&lt;TT&gt;n = 3&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book007.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for &lt;CODE&gt;__main__&lt;/CODE&gt;.
It is empty because we did not create any variables in 
&lt;CODE&gt;__main__&lt;/CODE&gt; or pass any arguments to it.

The four &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; frames have different values for the
parameter &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;. The bottom of the stack, where &lt;TT&gt;n=0&lt;/TT&gt;, is
called the '''base case'''. It does not make a recursive call, so
there are no more frames.
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Draw a stack diagram for &lt;CODE&gt;print_n&lt;/CODE&gt; called with
&lt;CODE&gt;s = 'Hello'&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;n=2&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Write a function called &lt;CODE&gt;do_n&lt;/CODE&gt; that takes a function
object and a number, &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; as arguments, and that calls
the given function &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; times.
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

=== Infinite recursion ===
If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making
recursive calls forever, and the program never terminates. This is
known as '''infinite recursion''', and it is generally not
a good idea. Here is a minimal program with an infinite recursion:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def recurse():
    recurse()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion
does not really run forever. Python reports an error
message when the maximum recursion depth is reached:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
                  .   
                  .
                  .
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the
previous chapter. When the error occurs, there are 1000
&lt;TT&gt;recurse&lt;/TT&gt; frames on the stack!

=== Keyboard input ===
The programs we have written so far are a bit rude in the sense that
they accept no input from the user. They just do the same thing every
time.

Python provides a built-in function called &lt;CODE&gt;raw_input&lt;/CODE&gt; that gets
input from the keyboard&lt;ref&gt;In Python 3.0, this function is named &lt;TT&gt;input&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. When this function is called, the program stops and
waits for the user to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter, the program resumes and &lt;CODE&gt;raw_input&lt;/CODE&gt;
returns what the user typed as a string.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; input = raw_input()
What are you waiting for?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print input
What are you waiting for?
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a
prompt telling the user what to input. &lt;CODE&gt;raw_input&lt;/CODE&gt; can take a
prompt as an argument:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; name = raw_input('What...is your name?\n')
What...is your name?
Arthur, King of the Britons!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print name
Arthur, King of the Britons!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The sequence &lt;CODE&gt;\n&lt;/CODE&gt; at the end of the prompt represents a '''newline''',
which is a special character that causes a line break.
That&amp;#X2019;s why the user&amp;#X2019;s input appears below the prompt.

If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert
the return value to &lt;TT&gt;int&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; speed = raw_input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
17
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; int(speed)
17
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But if the user types something other than a string of digits,
you get an error:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; speed = raw_input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; int(speed)
ValueError: invalid literal for int()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
We will see how to handle this kind of error later.

=== Debugging ===
The traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains
a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming, especially
when there are many frames on the stack. The most
useful parts are usually:

*What kind of error it was, and

*Where it occurred.

Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few
gotchas. Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and
tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = 5
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  y = 6
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1
    y = 6
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by
one space. But the error message points to &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;, which is
misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the problem was
discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code,
sometimes on a previous line.

The same is true of runtime errors. Suppose you are trying
to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels. The formula
is &lt;I&gt;SNR&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;I&gt;db&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; = 10 log&lt;SUB&gt;10&lt;/SUB&gt; (&lt;I&gt;P&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;I&gt;signal&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; / &lt;I&gt;P&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;I&gt;noise&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;). In Python,
you might write something like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;import math
signal_power = 9
noise_power = 10
ratio = signal_power / noise_power
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
print decibels
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But when you run it, you get an error message:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;snr.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
    decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
OverflowError: math range error
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing
wrong with that line. To find the real error, it might be
useful to print the value of &lt;TT&gt;ratio&lt;/TT&gt;, which turns out to
be 0. The problem is in line 4, because dividing two integers
does floor division. The solution is to represent signal power
and noise power with floating-point values.

In general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered,

== Return values ==
Some of the built-in functions we have used, such as the math
functions, produce results. Calling the function generates a
value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an
expression.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
e = math.exp(1.0)
height = radius * math.sin(radians)
&lt;/source&gt;

All of the functions we have written so far are void; they print
something or move turtles around, but their return value is &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;.

In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions.
The first example is &lt;TT&gt;area&lt;/TT&gt;, which returns the area of a circle
with the given radius:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def area(radius):
    temp = math.pi * radius**2
    return temp
&lt;/source&gt;
We have seen the &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement before, but in a fruitful
function the &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement includes
an expression. This statement means: &amp;#X201C;Return immediately from
this function and use the following expression as a return value.&amp;#X201D;
The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could
have written this function more concisely:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius**2
&lt;/source&gt;

On the other hand, '''temporary variables''' like &lt;TT&gt;temp&lt;/TT&gt; often make
debugging easier.

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each
branch of a conditional:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def absolute_value(x):
    if x &lt; 0:
        return -x
    else:
        return x
&lt;/source&gt;

Since these &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statements are in an alternative conditional,
only one will be executed.

As soon as a return statement executes, the function
terminates without executing any subsequent statements.
Code that appears after a &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement, or any other place
the flow of execution can never reach, is called '''dead code'''.

In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure
that every possible path through the program hits a
&lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def absolute_value(x):
    if x &lt; 0:
        return -x
    if x &gt; 0:
        return x
&lt;/source&gt;

This function is incorrect because if &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; happens to be 0,
neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a
&lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end
of a function, the return value is &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;, which is not
the absolute value of 0.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print absolute_value(0)
None
&lt;/source&gt;

By the way, Python provides a built-in function called 
&lt;TT&gt;abs&lt;/TT&gt; that computes absolute values.

=== Exercise 1 ===
''Write a ''''&lt;TT&gt;compare&lt;/TT&gt;'''' function
that returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;1&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if ''''&lt;TT&gt;x &amp;gt; y&lt;/TT&gt;'''',
''''&lt;TT&gt;0&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if ''''&lt;TT&gt;x == y&lt;/TT&gt;'''', and ''''&lt;TT&gt;-1&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if ''''&lt;TT&gt;x &amp;lt; y&lt;/TT&gt;''''.

== Incremental development ==
As you write larger functions, you might find yourself
spending more time debugging.

To deal with increasingly complex programs,
you might want to try a process called
'''incremental development'''. The goal of incremental development
is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only
a small amount of code at a time.

As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two
points, given by the coordinates (&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;, &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;) and (&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;).
By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{distance} = \sqrt{ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to consider what a &lt;TT&gt;distance&lt;/TT&gt; function should
look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters)
and what is the output (return value)?

In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent
using four numbers. The return value is the distance, which is
a floating-point value.

Already you can write an outline of the function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

Obviously, this version doesn't compute distances; it always returns
zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that
you can test it before you make it more complicated.

To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the
vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5
(the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle). When testing a function, it is
useful to know the right answer.

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically
correct, and we can start adding code to the body.
A reasonable next step is to find the differences
&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;#X2212; &lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;#X2212; &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;. The next version stores those values in
temporary variables and prints them.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    print 'dx is', dx
    print 'dy is', dy
    return 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

If the function is working, it should display &lt;CODE&gt;'dx is 3'&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;dy is 4&amp;#X2019;&lt;/TT&gt;. If so, we know that the function is getting the right
arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not,
there are only a few lines to check.

Next we compute the sum of squares of &lt;TT&gt;dx&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;dy&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    print 'dsquared is: ', dsquared
    return 0.0
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output
(which should be 25).
Finally, you can use &lt;TT&gt;math.sqrt&lt;/TT&gt; to compute and return the result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
    return result
&lt;/source&gt;

If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might
want to print the value of &lt;TT&gt;result&lt;/TT&gt; before the return
statement.

The final version of the function doesn&amp;#X2019;t display anything when it
runs; it only returns a value. The &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statements we wrote
are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you
should remove them. Code like that is called '''scaffolding'''
because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the
final product.

When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a
time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing
and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development
can save you a lot of debugging time.

The key aspects of the process are:

*Start with a working program and make small incremental changes.  At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.
*Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.
*Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read.

=== Exercise 2 ===
''Use incremental development to write a function
called ''''&lt;TT&gt;hypotenuse&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle given the lengths of the two legs as arguments.
Record each stage of the development process as you go.
''

== Composition ==
As you should expect by now, you can call one function from
within another. This ability is called '''composition'''.

As an example, we&amp;#X2019;ll write a function that takes two points,
the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes
the area of the circle.

Assume that the center point is stored in the variables &lt;TT&gt;xc&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;yc&lt;/TT&gt;, and the perimeter point is in &lt;TT&gt;xp&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;yp&lt;/TT&gt;. The
first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance
between the two points. We just wrote a function, &lt;TT&gt;distance&lt;/TT&gt;, that does that:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
&lt;/source&gt;

The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius;
we just wrote that, too:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
result = area(radius)
&lt;/source&gt;

Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    result = area(radius)
    return result
&lt;/source&gt;

The temporary variables &lt;TT&gt;radius&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;result&lt;/TT&gt; are useful for
development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can
make it more concise by composing the function calls:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Boolean functions ==
Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding
complicated tests inside functions. For example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_divisible(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no
questions; &lt;CODE&gt;is_divisible&lt;/CODE&gt; returns either &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;
to indicate whether &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; is divisible by &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;.

Here is an example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;   is_divisible(6, 4)
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;   is_divisible(6, 3)
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The result of the &lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt; operator is a boolean, so we can write the
function more concisely by returning it directly:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_divisible(x, y):
    return x % y == 0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if is_divisible(x, y):
    print 'x is divisible by y'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It might be tempting to write something like:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if is_divisible(x, y) == True:
    print 'x is divisible by y'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But the extra comparison is unnecessary.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;3'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a function ''&lt;CODE&gt;''is_between(x, y, z)''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that
returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if ''''&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt; &amp;#X2264; &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt; &amp;#X2264; &lt;I&gt;z&lt;/I&gt;'''' or ''''&lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;'''' otherwise.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;

== More recursion ==
We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might
be interested to know that this subset is a ''complete''
programming language, which means that anything that can be
computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written
could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned
so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices
like the keyboard, mouse, disks, etc., but that&amp;#X2019;s all).

Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan
Turing, one of the first computer scientists (some would argue that he
was a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as
mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis.
For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis,
I recommend Michael Sipser&amp;#X2019;s book ''Introduction to the
Theory of Computation''.

To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned
so far, we&amp;#X2019;ll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical
functions. A recursive definition is similar to a circular
definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to
the thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very
useful:
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''frabjuous:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; An adjective used to describe something that is frabjuous.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On
the other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial
function, denoted with the symbol !, you might get something like
this:
&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display dcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;TR VALIGN=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=0&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=right NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP&gt;0!&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;1&amp;#XA0;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=right NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP&gt;&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;!&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;(&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1)!&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial
of any other value, &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;, is &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; multiplied by the factorial of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1.

So 3! is 3 times 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 times
0!. Putting it all together, 3! equals 3 times 2 times 1 times 1,
which is 6.

If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can usually
write a Python program to evaluate it. The first step is to decide
what the parameters should be. In this case it should be clear
that &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt; takes an integer:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def factorial(n):
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a
recursive call to find the factorial of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1 and then multiply it by
&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        return result
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; in Section&amp;#XA0;5.8. If we call &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt;
with the value 3:

Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
of &lt;TT&gt;n-1&lt;/TT&gt;...
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of
&lt;TT&gt;n-1&lt;/TT&gt;...&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
of &lt;TT&gt;n-1&lt;/TT&gt;...&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Since 0 ''is'' 0, we take the first branch and return 1
without making any more recursive calls.
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
The return value (1) is multiplied by &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;, which is 1, and the
result is returned.

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
The return value (1) is multiplied by &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;, which is 2, and the
result is returned.

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
The return value (2) is multiplied by &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;, which is 3, and the result, 6,
becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole
process.

Here is what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function
calls:

&lt;BR&gt;


&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book009.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;


The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each
frame, the return value is the value of &lt;TT&gt;result&lt;/TT&gt;, which is the
product of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;recurse&lt;/TT&gt;.

In the last frame, the local
variables &lt;TT&gt;recurse&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;result&lt;/TT&gt; do not exist, because
the branch that creates them does not execute.

== Leap of faith ==
Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but
it can quickly become labyrinthine. An
alternative is what I call the &amp;#X201C;leap of faith.&amp;#X201D; When you come to a
function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you ''assume'' that the function works correctly and returns the right
result.

In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use
built-in functions. When you call &lt;TT&gt;math.cos&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;math.exp&lt;/TT&gt;,
you don&amp;#X2019;t examine the bodies of those functions. You just
assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in
functions were good programmers.

The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For
example, in Section&amp;#XA0;6.4, we wrote a function called 
&lt;CODE&gt;is_divisible&lt;/CODE&gt; that determines whether one number is divisible by
another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is
correct&amp;#X2014;by examining the code and testing&amp;#X2014;we can use the function
without looking at the body again.

The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive
call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume
that the recursive call works (yields the correct result) and then ask
yourself, &amp;#X201C;Assuming that I can find the factorial of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1, can I
compute the factorial of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;?&amp;#X201D; In this case, it is clear that you
can, by multiplying by &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;.

Of course, it's a bit strange to assume that the function works
correctly when you haven't finished writing it, but that's why
it's called a leap of faith!

== One more example ==
After &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt;, the most common example of a recursively
defined mathematical function is &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt;, which has the
following definition&lt;ref&gt;See
&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number&lt;/TT&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display dcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;TR VALIGN=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=0&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=right NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP&gt;&lt;I&gt;fibonacci&lt;/I&gt;(0)&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;0&amp;#XA0;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=right NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP&gt;&lt;I&gt;fibonacci&lt;/I&gt;(1)&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;1&amp;#XA0;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=right NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP&gt;&lt;I&gt;fibonacci&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;)&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;fibonacci&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1)&amp;#XA0;+&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;fibonacci&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;2);&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Translated into Python, it looks like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def fibonacci (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif  n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly
small values of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;, your head explodes. But according to the
leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls
work correctly, then it is clear that you get
the right result by adding them together.

== Checking types ==
What happens if we call &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt; and give it 1.5 as an argument?

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; factorial(1.5)
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It looks like an infinite recursion. But how can that be? There is a
base case&amp;#X2014;when &lt;TT&gt;n == 0&lt;/TT&gt;. But if &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is not an integer,
we can ''miss'' the base case and recurse forever.

In the first recursive call, the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is 0.5.
In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets smaller
(more negative), but it will never be 0.

We have two choices. We can try to generalize the &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt;
function to work with floating-point numbers, or we can make &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt; check the type of its argument. The first option is
called the gamma function&lt;ref&gt;See
&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function&lt;/TT&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and it&amp;#X2019;s a
little beyond the scope of this book. So we&amp;#X2019;ll go for the second.

We can use the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;isinstance&lt;/TT&gt; to verify the type
of the argument. While we&amp;#X2019;re at it, we can also make sure the
argument is positive:



&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def factorial (n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        print 'Factorial is only defined for integers.'
        return None
    elif n &amp;lt; 0:
        print 'Factorial is only defined for positive integers.'
        return None
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first base case handles nonintegers; the
second catches negative integers. In both cases, the program prints
an error message and returns &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt; to indicate that something
went wrong:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; factorial('fred')
Factorial is only defined for integers.
None
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; factorial(-2)
Factorial is only defined for positive integers.
None
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If we get past both checks, then we know that &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; is a positive
integer, and we can prove that the recursion terminates.

This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a '''guardian'''.
The first two conditionals act as guardians, protecting the code that
follows from values that might cause an error. The guardians make it
possible to prove the correctness of the code.

== Debugging ==
Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural
checkpoints for debugging. If a function is not working, there are
three possibilities to consider:

*There is something wrong with the arguments the function
is getting; a precondition is violated.

*There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition
is violated.

*There is something wrong with the return value or the
way it is being used.

To rule out the first possibility, you can add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement
at the beginning of the function and display the values of the
parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can write code
that checks the preconditions explicitly.

If the parameters look good, add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement before each
&lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement that displays the return value. If
possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the
function with values that make it easy to check the result
(as in Section&amp;#XA0;6.2).

If the function seems to be working, look at the function call
to make sure the return value is being used correctly (or used
at all!).

Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function
can help make the flow of execution more visible.
For example, here is a version of &lt;TT&gt;factorial&lt;/TT&gt; with
print statements:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def factorial(n):
    space = ' ' * (4 * n)
    print space, 'factorial', n
    if n == 0:
        print space, 'returning 1'
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        print space, 'returning', result
        return result
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;space&lt;/TT&gt; is a string of space characters that controls the
indentation of the output. Here is the result of &lt;TT&gt;factorial(5)&lt;/TT&gt; :
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;                     factorial 5
                 factorial 4
             factorial 3
         factorial 2
     factorial 1
 factorial 0
 returning 1
     returning 1
         returning 2
             returning 6
                 returning 24
                     returning 120
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you are confused about the flow of execution, this kind of
output can be helpful. It takes some time to develop effective
scaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of debugging.

== Exercises ==
=== Exercise 4 ===
''Draw a stack diagram for the following program. What does the program print?''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def b(z):
    prod = a(z, z)
    print z, prod
    return prod

def a(x, y):
    x = x + 1
    return x * y

def c(x, y, z):
    sum = x + y + z
    pow = b(sum)**2
    return pow

x = 1
y = x + 1
print c(x, y+3, x+y)
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 5 ===
''The Ackermann function, ''''&lt;I&gt;A&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;m&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;)'''' is defined&lt;ref&gt;See
&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;:''
&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display dcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;TR VALIGN=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;''

&lt;math&gt;
A(M, N) = 
\begin{cases}
n + 1 &amp; \mbox{if }m = 0 \\
A(m-1, 1) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n &gt; 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Write a function named ''''&lt;TT&gt;ack&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that evaluates Ackerman&amp;#X2019;s function.
Use your function to evaluate ''''&lt;TT&gt;ack(3, 4)&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which should be 125.
What happens for larger values of ''''&lt;TT&gt;m&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;''''?''

=== Exercise 6 ===
''A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and
forward, like &amp;#X201C;noon&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;redivider&amp;#X201D;. Recursively, a word
is a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same
and the middle is a palindrome.''

''The following are functions that take a string argument and
return the first, last, and middle letters:''

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;
def first(word):
    return word[0]

def last(word):
    return word[-1]

def middle(word):
    return word[1:-1]
&lt;/PRE&gt;

''We&amp;#X2019;ll see how they work in Chapter&amp;#XA0;''''8''''.''

*''Type these functions into a file named ''''&lt;TT&gt;palindrome.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and test them out. What happens if you call ''''&lt;TT&gt;middle&lt;/TT&gt;'''' with
a string with two letters? One letter? What about the empty
string, which is written ''&lt;CODE&gt;''''''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' and contains no letters?''

*''Write a function called ''&lt;CODE&gt;''is_palindrome''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes
a string argument and returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if it is a palindrome
and ''''&lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;'''' otherwise. Remember that you can use the
built-in function ''''&lt;TT&gt;len&lt;/TT&gt;'''' to check the length of a string.''

=== Exercise 7 ===
A number, ''''&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;'''', is a power of ''''&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;'''' if it is divisible by ''''&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;''''
and ''''&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;/&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;'''' is a power of ''''&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;''''. Write a function called
''&lt;CODE&gt;''is_power''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes parameters ''''&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if ''''&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is a power of ''''&lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt;''''.

=== Exercise 8 ===
''The greatest common divisor (GCD) of ''''&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;'''' is the largest number
that divides both of them with no remainder''&lt;ref&gt;This exercise is
based on an example from Abelson and Sussman&amp;#X2019;s ''Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs''.&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

''One way to find the GCD of two numbers is Euclid&amp;#X2019;s algorithm,
which is based on the observation that if ''''&lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;'''' is the remainder
when ''''&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;'''' is divided by ''''&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;'''', then ''''&lt;I&gt;gcd&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;) = &lt;I&gt;gcd&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;)''''.
As a base case, we can consider ''''&lt;I&gt;gcd&lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;, 0) = &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;''''.''

''Write a function called
''&lt;CODE&gt;''gcd''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes parameters ''''&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and returns their greatest common divisor. If you need
help, see ''''&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Think Python/Page}}

== Multiple assignment ==
As you may have discovered, it is legal to
make more than one assignment to the same variable. A
new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new
value (and stop referring to the old value).

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
bruce = 5
print bruce,
bruce = 7
print bruce
&lt;/source&gt;

The output of this program is &lt;TT&gt;5 7&lt;/TT&gt;, because the first time &lt;TT&gt;bruce&lt;/TT&gt; is printed, its value is 5, and the second time, its value is 7. The comma at the end of the first &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement suppresses the newline, which is why both outputs appear on the same line.

Here is what '''multiple assignment''' looks like in a state diagram:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book010.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;

With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish
between an assignment operation and a statement of equality. Because
Python uses the equal sign (&lt;TT&gt;=&lt;/TT&gt;) for assignment, it is tempting to
interpret a statement like &lt;TT&gt;a = b&lt;/TT&gt; as a statement of equality. It
is not!

First, equality is a symmetric relation and assignment is not. For
example, in mathematics, if &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt; = 7 then 7 = &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;. But in Python, the
statement &lt;TT&gt;a = 7&lt;/TT&gt; is legal and &lt;TT&gt;7 = a&lt;/TT&gt; is not.

Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is either true or
false, for all time. If &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt; = &lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt; now, then &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt; will always equal &lt;I&gt;b&lt;/I&gt;.
In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but
they don&amp;#X2019;t have to stay that way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 5
b = a    # a and b are now equal
a = 3    # a and b are no longer equal
&lt;/source&gt;

The third line changes the value of &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; but does not change the
value of &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt;, so they are no longer equal. 

Although multiple assignment is frequently helpful, you should use it
with caution. If the values of variables change frequently, it can
make the code difficult to read and debug.

== Updating variables ==
One of the most common forms of multiple assignment is an '''update''',
where the new value of the variable depends on the old.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;x = x+1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This means &amp;#X201C;get the current value of &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;, add one, and then
update &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; with the new value.&amp;#X201D;

If you try to update a variable that doesn&amp;#X2019;t exist, you get an
error, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns
a value to &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = x+1
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Before you can update a variable, you have to '''initialize'''
it, usually with a simple assignment:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = 0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = x+1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an '''increment''';
subtracting 1 is called a '''decrement'''.

== The &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; statement ==
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating
identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that
computers do well and people do poorly.

We have seen two programs, &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;print_n&lt;/CODE&gt;, that
use recursion to perform repetition, which is also called '''iteration'''. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several
language features to make it easier. One is the &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement
we saw in Section&amp;#XA0;4.2. We&amp;#X2019;ll get back to that later.

Another is the &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; statement. Here is a version of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt; that uses a &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; statement:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def countdown(n):
    while n &amp;gt; 0:
        print n
        n = n-1
    print 'Blastoff!'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can almost read the &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; statement as if it were English.
It means, &amp;#X201C;While &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is greater than 0,
display the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; and then reduce the value of
&lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; by 1. When you get to 0, display the word &lt;TT&gt;Blastoff!&lt;/TT&gt;&amp;#X201D;

More formally, here is the flow of execution for a &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; statement:

*Evaluate the condition, yielding &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;.
*If the condition is false, exit the &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; statement and continue execution at the next statement.
*If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.

This type of flow is called a '''loop''' because the third step
loops back around to the top. 

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables
so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop
terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called
an '''infinite loop'''. An endless source of amusement for computer
scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo,
&amp;#X201C;Lather, rinse, repeat,&amp;#X201D; are an infinite loop.

In the case of &lt;TT&gt;countdown&lt;/TT&gt;, we can prove that the loop
terminates because we know that the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is finite, and we
can see that the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; gets smaller each time through the
loop, so eventually we have to get to 0. In other
cases, it is not so easy to tell:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def sequence(n):
    while n != 1:
        print n,
        if n%2 == 0:        # n is even
            n = n/2
        else:               # n is odd
            n = n*3+1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The condition for this loop is &lt;TT&gt;n != 1&lt;/TT&gt;, so the loop will continue
until &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is &lt;TT&gt;1&lt;/TT&gt;, which makes the condition false.

Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;
and then checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is 
divided by 2. If it is odd, the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is replaced with
&lt;TT&gt;n*3+1&lt;/TT&gt;. For example, if the argument passed
to &lt;TT&gt;sequence&lt;/TT&gt; is 3, the resulting sequence is 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Since &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no
obvious proof that &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; will ever reach 1, or that the program
terminates. For some particular values of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;, we can prove
termination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two,
then the value of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; will be even each time through the loop
until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence,
starting with 16.

The hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates
for ''all positive values'' of &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt;. So far&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;, no one has
been able to prove it ''or'' disprove it!
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;1'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Rewrite the function ''&lt;CODE&gt;''print_n''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' from
Section&amp;#XA0;''''5.8'''' using iteration instead of recursion.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;

== &lt;TT&gt;break&lt;/TT&gt; ==
Sometimes you don&amp;#X2019;t know it&amp;#X2019;s time to end a loop until you get half
way through the body. In that case you can use the &lt;TT&gt;break&lt;/TT&gt;
statement to jump out of the loop.

For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they
type &lt;TT&gt;done&lt;/TT&gt;. You could write:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;while True:
    line = raw_input('&amp;gt; ')
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print line

print 'Done!'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The loop condition is &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;, which is always true, so the
loop runs until it hits the break statement.

Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket.
If the user types &lt;TT&gt;done&lt;/TT&gt;, the &lt;TT&gt;break&lt;/TT&gt; statement exits
the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types
and goes back to the top of the loop. Here&amp;#X2019;s a sample run:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; not done
not done
&amp;gt; done
Done!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This way of writing &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; loops is common because you
can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the
top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively
(&amp;#X201C;stop when this happens&amp;#X201D;) rather than negatively (&amp;#X201C;keep going
until that happens.&amp;#X201D;).

== Square roots ==
Loops are often used in programs that compute
numerical results by starting with an approximate answer and
iteratively improving it.

For example, one way of computing square roots is Newton&amp;#X2019;s method.
Suppose that you want to know the square root of &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;. If you start
with almost any estimate, &lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;, you can compute a better
estimate with the following formula:
&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display dcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;TR VALIGN=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;+&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;/&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;hbar&quot;&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;&amp;#XA0;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

For example, if &lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt; is 4 and &lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt; is 3:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = 4.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = 3.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print y
2.16666666667
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Which is closer to the correct answer (&amp;#X221A;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;4&lt;/SPAN&gt; = 2). If we
repeat the process with the new estimate, it gets even closer:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = y
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print y
2.00641025641
&lt;/PRE&gt;
After a few more updates, the estimate is almost exact:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = y
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print y
2.00001024003
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = y
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print y
2.00000000003
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In general we don&amp;#X2019;t know ahead of time how many steps it takes
to get to the right answer, but we know when we get there
because the estimate
stops changing:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = y
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print y
2.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = y
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print y
2.0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When &lt;TT&gt;y == x&lt;/TT&gt;, we can stop. Here is a loop that starts
with an initial estimate, &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;, and improves it until it
stops changing:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;while True:
    print x
    y = (x + a/x) / 2
    if y == x:
        break
    x = y
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For most values of &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; this works fine, but in general it is
dangerous to test &lt;TT&gt;float&lt;/TT&gt; equality.
Floating-point values are only approximately right:
most rational numbers, like 1/3, and irrational numbers, like
&amp;#X221A;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SPAN&gt;, can&amp;#X2019;t be represented exactly with a &lt;TT&gt;float&lt;/TT&gt;.

Rather than checking whether &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt; are exactly equal, it
is safer to use the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;abs&lt;/TT&gt; to compute the
absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;    if abs(y-x) &amp;lt; epsilon:
        break
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Where &lt;CODE&gt;epsilon&lt;/CODE&gt; has a value like &lt;TT&gt;0.0000001&lt;/TT&gt; that
determines how close is close enough.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;2'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
''''
''
''Encapsulate this loop in a function called ''&lt;CODE&gt;''square_root''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
that takes ''''&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;'''' as a parameter, chooses a reasonable
value of ''''&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;'''', and returns an estimate of the square root
of ''''&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;''''.
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Algorithms ==
Newton&amp;#X2019;s method is an example of an '''algorithm''': it is a
mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this
case, computing square roots).

It is not easy to define an algorithm. It might help to start
with something that is not an algorithm. When you learned
to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the
multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions.
That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.

But if you were &amp;#X201C;lazy,&amp;#X201D; you probably cheated by learning a few
tricks. For example, to find the product of &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; and 9, you can
write &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1 as the first digit and 10&amp;#X2212;&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; as the second
digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any
single-digit number by 9. That&amp;#X2019;s an algorithm!

Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying,
subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One
of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any
intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes in which
each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.

In my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in
school learning to execute algorithms that, quite literally, require
no intelligence.

On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting,
intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call
programming.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or
conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically.
Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but
so far no one has been able to explain ''how'' we do it, at least
not in the form of an algorithm.

== Debugging ==
As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself
spending more time debugging. More code means more chances to
make an error and more place for bugs to hide.

One way to cut your debugging time is &amp;#X201C;debugging by bisection.&amp;#X201D;
For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you
check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.

Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle
of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you
can check. Add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement (or something else
that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.

If the mid-point check is incorrect, the problem must be in the
first half of the program. If it is correct, the problem is
in the second half.

Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number
of lines you have to search. After six steps (which is much
less than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code,
at least in theory.

In practice it is not always clear what
the &amp;#X201C;middle of the program&amp;#X201D; is and not always possible to
check it. It doesn&amp;#X2019;t make sense to count lines and find the
exact midpoint. Instead, think about places
in the program where there might be errors and places where it
is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you
think the chances are about the same that the bug is before
or after the check.

== Glossary ==

&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''multiple assignment:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Making more than one assignment to the same
variable during the execution of a program.

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''update:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; An assignment where the new value of the variable
depends on the old.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''initialize:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; An assignment that gives an initial value to
a variable that will be updated.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''increment:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; An update that increases the value of a variable
(often by one).
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''decrement:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; An update that decreases the value of a variable.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''iteration:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Repeated execution of a set of statements using
either a recursive function call or a loop.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''infinite loop:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; A loop in which the terminating condition is
never satisfied.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

=== Exercise 3 ===

''To test the square root algorithm in this chapter, you could compare
it with ''''&lt;TT&gt;math.sqrt&lt;/TT&gt;''''. Write a function named ''&lt;CODE&gt;''test_square_root''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
that prints a table like this:''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''1.0 1.0           1.0           0.0

''The first column is a number, ''''&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;''''; the second column is
the square root of ''''&lt;I&gt;a&lt;/I&gt;'''' computed with the function from
Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''7.2''''; the third column is the square root computed
by ''''&lt;TT&gt;math.sqrt&lt;/TT&gt;''''; the fourth column is the absolute value
of the difference between the two estimates.

=== Exercise 4 ===
''The built-in function ''''&lt;TT&gt;eval&lt;/TT&gt;'''' takes a string and evaluates
it using the Python interpreter. For example:''

''It should continue until the user enters ''&lt;CODE&gt;'''done'''&lt;/CODE&gt;'', and then
return the value of the last expression it evaluated.''

=== Exercise 5 ===

''The brilliant mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an

that can be used to generate a numerical
approximation of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:''

loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is
smaller than ''''&lt;TT&gt;1e-15&lt;/TT&gt;'''' (which is Python notation for ''''10''&lt;SUP&gt;''&amp;#X2212;15''&lt;/SUP&gt;'').

== A string is a sequence ==
A string is a '''sequence''' of characters. 
You can access the characters one at a time with the
bracket operator:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; letter = fruit[1]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The second statement selects character number 1 from &lt;TT&gt;fruit&lt;/TT&gt; and assigns it to &lt;TT&gt;letter&lt;/TT&gt;. 

The expression in brackets is called an '''index'''. 
The index indicates which character in the sequence you
want (hence the name).

But you might not get what you expect:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print letter
a
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For most people, the first letter of &lt;CODE&gt;'banana'&lt;/CODE&gt; is &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt;, not
&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;. But for computer scientists, the index is an offset from the
beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; letter = fruit[0]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print letter
b
&lt;/PRE&gt;
So &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt; is the 0th letter (&amp;#X201C;zero-eth&amp;#X201D;) of &lt;CODE&gt;'banana'&lt;/CODE&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;
is the 1th letter (&amp;#X201C;one-eth&amp;#X201D;), and &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; is the 2th (&amp;#X201C;two-eth&amp;#X201D;)
letter.

You can use any expression, including variables and operators, as an
index, but the value of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you
get:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; letter = fruit[1.5]
TypeError: string indices must be integers
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== &lt;TT&gt;len&lt;/TT&gt; ==
&lt;TT&gt;len&lt;/TT&gt; is a built-in function that returns the number of characters
in a string:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; len(fruit)
6
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something
like this:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; length = len(fruit)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; last = fruit[length]
IndexError: string index out of range
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The reason for the &lt;TT&gt;IndexError&lt;/TT&gt; is that there is no letter in &lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;banana&amp;#X2019;&lt;/TT&gt; with the index 6. Since we started counting at zero, the
six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, you have
to subtract 1 from &lt;TT&gt;length&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; last = fruit[length-1]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print last
a
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Alternatively, you can use negative indices, which count backward from
the end of the string. The expression &lt;TT&gt;fruit[-1]&lt;/TT&gt; yields the last
letter, &lt;TT&gt;fruit[-2]&lt;/TT&gt; yields the second to last, and so on.

== Traversal with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop ==
A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a
time. Often they start at the beginning, select each character in
turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of
processing is called a '''traversal'''. One way to write a traversal
is with a &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; loop:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;index = 0
while index &amp;lt; len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print letter
    index = index + 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by
itself. The loop condition is &lt;TT&gt;index &amp;lt; len(fruit)&lt;/TT&gt;, so
when &lt;TT&gt;index&lt;/TT&gt; is equal to the length of the string, the
condition is false, and the body of the loop is not executed. The
last character accessed is the one with the index &lt;TT&gt;len(fruit)-1&lt;/TT&gt;,
which is the last character in the string.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;1'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a function that takes a string as an argument
and displays the letters backward, one per line.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;
Another way to write a traversal is with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for char in fruit:
    print char
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned
to the variable &lt;TT&gt;char&lt;/TT&gt;. The loop continues until no characters are
left.

The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition)
and a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop to generate an abecedarian series (that is, in
alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey&amp;#X2019;s book ''Make
Way for Ducklings'', the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack,
Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in
order:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'

for letter in prefixes:
    print letter + suffix
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The output is:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Oack
Pack
Qack
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Of course, that&amp;#X2019;s not quite right because &amp;#X201C;Ouack&amp;#X201D; and
&amp;#X201C;Quack&amp;#X201D; are misspelled.

=== Exercise 2 ===
Modify the program to fix this error.

== String slices ==
A segment of a string is called a '''slice'''. Selecting a slice is
similar to selecting a character:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 'Monty Python'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print s[0:5]
Monty
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print s[6:13]
Python
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The operator &lt;TT&gt;[n:m]&lt;/TT&gt; returns the part of the string from the 
&amp;#X201C;n-eth&amp;#X201D; character to the &amp;#X201C;m-eth&amp;#X201D; character, including the first but
excluding the last. This behavior is counterintuitive, but it might
help to imagine the indices pointing ''between'' the
characters, as in the following diagram:
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book011.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at
the beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice
goes to the end of the string:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit[:3]
'ban'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit[3:]
'ana'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result
is an '''empty string''', represented by two quotation marks:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit[3:3]
''
&lt;/PRE&gt;
An empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other
than that, it is the same as any other string.

=== Exercise 3 ===
Given that ''''&lt;TT&gt;fruit&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is a string, what does
''''&lt;TT&gt;fruit[:]&lt;/TT&gt;'''' mean?''

== Strings are immutable ==
It is tempting to use the &lt;TT&gt;[]&lt;/TT&gt; operator on the left side of an
assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string.
For example:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; greeting = 'Hello, world!'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; greeting[0] = 'J'
TypeError: object does not support item assignment
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &amp;#X201C;object&amp;#X201D; in this case is the string and the &amp;#X201C;item&amp;#X201D; is
the character you tried to assign. For now, an '''object''' is
the same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition
later. An '''item''' is one of the values in a sequence.

The reason for the error is that
strings are '''immutable''', which means you can&amp;#X2019;t change an
existing string. The best you can do is create a new string
that is a variation on the original:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; greeting = 'Hello, world!'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print new_greeting
Jello, world!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This example concatenates a new first letter onto
a slice of &lt;TT&gt;greeting&lt;/TT&gt;. It has no effect on
the original string.

== Searching ==
What does the following function do?

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def find(word, letter):
    index = 0
    while index &amp;lt; len(word):
        if word[index] == letter:
            return index
        index = index + 1
    return -1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In a sense, &lt;TT&gt;find&lt;/TT&gt; is the opposite of the &lt;TT&gt;[]&lt;/TT&gt; operator.
Instead of taking an index and extracting the corresponding character,
it takes a character and finds the index where that character
appears. If the character is not found, the function returns &lt;TT&gt;-1&lt;/TT&gt;.

This is the first example we have seen of a &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement
inside a loop. If &lt;TT&gt;word[index] == letter&lt;/TT&gt;, the function breaks
out of the loop and returns immediately.

If the character doesn&amp;#X2019;t appear in the string, the program
exits the loop normally and returns &lt;TT&gt;-1&lt;/TT&gt;.

This pattern of computation&amp;#X2014;traversing a sequence and returning
when we find what we are looking for&amp;#X2014;is a called a '''search'''.

=== Exercise 4 ===
Modify ''''&lt;TT&gt;find&lt;/TT&gt;'''' so that it has a
third parameter, the index in ''''&lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;'''' where it should start
looking.

== Looping and counting ==
The following program counts the number of times the letter &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;
appears in a string:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print count
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a '''counter'''. The variable &lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt; is initialized to 0 and then
incremented each time an &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; is found.
When the loop exits, &lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt;
contains the result&amp;#X2014;the total number of &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;s.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;5'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
''
''Encapsulate this code in a function named ''''&lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt;'''', and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the
letter as arguments.
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;6'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Rewrite this function so that instead of
traversing the string, it uses the three-parameter version of ''''&lt;TT&gt;find&lt;/TT&gt;'''' from the previous section.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;

== &lt;TT&gt;string&lt;/TT&gt; methods ==
A '''method''' is similar to a function&amp;#X2014;it takes arguments and
returns a value&amp;#X2014;but the syntax is different. For example, the
method &lt;TT&gt;upper&lt;/TT&gt; takes a string and returns a new string with
all uppercase letters:

Instead of the function syntax &lt;TT&gt;upper(word)&lt;/TT&gt;, it uses
the method syntax &lt;TT&gt;word.upper()&lt;/TT&gt;.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; word = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new_word = word.upper()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print new_word
BANANA
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This form of dot notation specifies the name of the method, &lt;TT&gt;upper&lt;/TT&gt;, and the name of the string to apply the method to, &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;. The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no
argument.

A method call is called an '''invocation'''; in this case, we would
say that we are invoking &lt;TT&gt;upper&lt;/TT&gt; on the &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;.

As it turns out, there is a string method named &lt;TT&gt;find&lt;/TT&gt; that
is remarkably similar to the function we wrote:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; word = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; index = word.find('a')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print index
1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this example, we invoke &lt;TT&gt;find&lt;/TT&gt; on &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt; and pass
the letter we are looking for as a parameter.

Actually, the &lt;TT&gt;find&lt;/TT&gt; method is more general than our function;
it can find substrings, not just characters:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; word.find('na')
2
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It can take as a second argument the index where it should start:



&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; word.find('na', 3)
4
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And as a third argument the index where it should stop:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; name = 'bob'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; name.find('b', 1, 2)
-1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This search fails because &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt; does not
appear in the index range from &lt;TT&gt;1&lt;/TT&gt; to &lt;TT&gt;2&lt;/TT&gt; (not including &lt;TT&gt;2&lt;/TT&gt;).
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;7'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
''''
''
''There is a string method called ''''&lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that is similar
to the function in the previous exercise. Read the documentation
of this method
and write an invocation that counts the number of ''''&lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt;''''s
in ''&lt;CODE&gt;'''banana'''&lt;/CODE&gt;''.
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;

== The &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator ==
The word &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; is a boolean operator that takes two strings and
returns &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; if the first appears as a substring in the second:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'a' in 'banana'
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'seed' in 'banana'
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For example, the following function prints all the
letters from &lt;TT&gt;word1&lt;/TT&gt; that also appear in &lt;TT&gt;word2&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def in_both(word1, word2):
    for letter in word1:
        if letter in word2:
            print letter
&lt;/PRE&gt;
With well-chosen variable names,
Python sometimes reads like English. You could read
this loop, &amp;#X201C;for (each) letter in (the first) word, if (the) letter 
(appears) in (the second) word, print (the) letter.&amp;#X201D;

Here&amp;#X2019;s what you get if you compare apples and oranges:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in_both('apples', 'oranges')
a
e
s
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== String comparison ==
The comparison operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if word == 'banana':
    print  'All right, bananas.'
&lt;/source&gt;

Other comparison operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical
order:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if word &lt; 'banana':
    print 'Your word,' + word + ', comes before banana.'
elif word &gt; 'banana':
    print 'Your word,' + word + ', comes after banana.'
else:
    print 'All right, bananas.'
&lt;/source&gt;

Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way
that people do. All the uppercase letters come before all the
lowercase letters, so:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;Your word, Pineapple, comes before banana.
&lt;/PRE&gt;

A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a
standard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the
comparison. Keep that in mind in case you have to defend yourself
against a man armed with a Pineapple.

== Debugging ==
When you use indices to traverse the values in a sequence,
it is tricky to get the beginning and end of the traversal
right. Here is a function that is supposed to compare two
words and return &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; if one of the words is the reverse
of the other, but it contains two errors:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_reverse(word1, word2):
    if len(word1) != len(word2):
        return False
    
    i = 0
    j = len(word2)

    while j &amp;gt; 0:
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statement checks whether the words are the
same length. If not, we can return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt; immediately
and then, for the rest of the function, we can assume that the words
are the same length. This is an example of the guardian pattern
in Section&amp;#XA0;6.8.

&lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;j&lt;/TT&gt; are indices: &lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt; traverses &lt;TT&gt;word1&lt;/TT&gt;
forward while &lt;TT&gt;j&lt;/TT&gt; traverses &lt;TT&gt;word2&lt;/TT&gt; backward. If we find
two letters that don&amp;#X2019;t match, we can return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt; immediately.
If we get through the whole loop and all the letters match, we
return &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;.

If we test this function with the words &amp;#X201C;pots&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;stop&amp;#X201D;, we
expect the return value &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;, but we get an IndexError:



&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is_reverse('pots', 'stop')
...
  File &quot;reverse.py&quot;, line 15, in is_reverse
    if word1[i] != word2[j]:
IndexError: string index out of range
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For debugging this kind of error, my first move is to
print the values of the indices immediately before the line
where the error appears.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;    while j &amp;gt; 0:
        print i, j        # print here
        
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Now when I run the program again, I get more information:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is_reverse('pots', 'stop')
0 4
...
IndexError: string index out of range
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first time through the loop, the value of &lt;TT&gt;j&lt;/TT&gt; is 4,
which is out of range for the string &lt;CODE&gt;'pots'&lt;/CODE&gt;.
The index of the last character is 3, so the
initial value for &lt;TT&gt;j&lt;/TT&gt; should be &lt;TT&gt;len(word2)-1&lt;/TT&gt;.




If I fix that error and run the program again, I get:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is_reverse('pots', 'stop')
0 3
1 2
2 1
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This time we get the right answer, but it looks like the loop only ran
three times, which is suspicious. To get a better idea of what is
happening, it is useful to draw a state diagram. During the first
iteration, the frame for &lt;CODE&gt;is_reverse&lt;/CODE&gt; looks like this:



&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book012.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
I took a little license by arranging the variables in the frame
and adding dotted lines to show that the values of &lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;j&lt;/TT&gt; indicate characters in &lt;TT&gt;word1&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;word2&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;8'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
''''
Starting with this diagram, execute the program on paper, changing the
values of ''''&lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;j&lt;/TT&gt;'''' during each iteration. Find and fix the
second error in this function.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 9 ===
A string slice can take a third index that specifies the &amp;#X201C;step
size;&amp;#X201D; that is, the number of spaces between successive characters.
A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third,
etc.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fruit[0:5:2]
'bnn'
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''A step size of -1 goes through the word backwards, so
the slice ''&lt;CODE&gt;''[::-1]''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' generates a reversed string.''

''Use this idiom to write a one-line version of ''&lt;CODE&gt;''is_palindrome''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
from Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''6.6''''.

=== Exercise 10 ===
Read the documentation of the string methods at
''''&lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html&lt;/TT&gt;''''. You
might want to experiment with some of them to make sure
you understand how they work. ''''&lt;TT&gt;strip&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and
''''&lt;TT&gt;replace&lt;/TT&gt;'''' are particularly useful.''

''The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing.
For example, in ''&lt;CODE&gt;''find(sub[, start[, end]])''&lt;/CODE&gt;'', the brackets
indicate optional arguments. So ''''&lt;TT&gt;sub&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is required, but
''''&lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is optional, and if you include ''''&lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt;'''',
then ''''&lt;TT&gt;end&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is optional.

=== Exercise 11 ===
The following functions are all ''intended'' to check whether a
string contains any lowercase letters, but at least some of them are
wrong. For each function, describe what the function actually does.''&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''def any_lowercase1(s):
    for c in s:
        if c.islower():
            return True
        else:
            return False

def any_lowercase2(s):
    for c in s:
        if 'c'.islower():
            return 'True'
        else:
            return 'False'

def any_lowercase3(s):
    for c in s:
        flag = c.islower()
    return flag

def any_lowercase4(s):
    flag = False
    for c in s:
        flag = flag or c.islower()
    return flag

def any_lowercase5(s):
    for c in s:
        if not c.islower():
            return False
    return True
''&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 12 ===
ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves &amp;#X201C;rotating&amp;#X201D; each
letter in a word by 13 places&lt;ref&gt;See &lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13&lt;/ref&gt;. To rotate a letter means
to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if
necessary, so &amp;#X2019;A&amp;#X2019; shifted by 3 is &amp;#X2019;D&amp;#X2019; and &amp;#X2019;Z&amp;#X2019; shifted by 1 is &amp;#X2019;A&amp;#X2019;.''

''Write a function called ''&lt;CODE&gt;''rotate_word''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that returns
a new string that contains the letters from the original string
&amp;#X201C;rotated&amp;#X201D; by the given amount. ''

''For example, &amp;#X201C;cheer&amp;#X201D; rotated by 7 is &amp;#X201C;jolly&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;melon&amp;#X201D; rotated
by -10 is &amp;#X201C;cubed&amp;#X201D;. ''

''You might want to use the built-in functions ''''&lt;TT&gt;ord&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which converts
a character to a numeric code, and ''''&lt;TT&gt;chr&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which converts numeric
codes to characters.''

''Potentially offensive jokes on the Internet are sometimes encoded
in ROT13. If you are not easily offended, find and decode some
of them.

== Reading word lists ==
For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words.
There are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most
suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and
contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby
lexicon project&lt;ref&gt;&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. It
is a list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is, words that are
considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games. In the
Moby collection, the filename is &lt;TT&gt;113809of.fic&lt;/TT&gt;; I include a copy
of this file, with the simpler name &lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt;, along with
Swampy.

This file is in plain text, so you can open it with a text
editor, but you can also read it from Python. (You may need to move the file from the swampy folder into the main python folder) The built-in
function &lt;TT&gt;open&lt;/TT&gt; takes the name of the file as a parameter
and returns a '''file object''' you can use to read the file.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fin = open('words.txt')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print fin
&amp;lt;open file 'words.txt', mode 'r' at 0xb7f4b380&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;fin&lt;/TT&gt; is a common name for a file object used for
input. Mode &lt;CODE&gt;'r'&lt;/CODE&gt; indicates that this file is open for
reading (as opposed to &lt;CODE&gt;'w'&lt;/CODE&gt; for writing).

The file object provides several methods for reading, including
&lt;TT&gt;readline&lt;/TT&gt;, which reads characters from the file
until it gets to a newline and returns the result as a
string:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fin.readline()
'aa\r\n'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first word in this particular list is &amp;#X201C;aa,&amp;#X201D; which is a kind of
lava. The sequence &lt;CODE&gt;\r\n&lt;/CODE&gt; represents two whitespace characters,
a carriage return and a newline, that separate this word from the
next.

The file object keeps track of where it is in the file, so
if you call &lt;TT&gt;readline&lt;/TT&gt; again, you get the next word:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fin.readline()
'aah\r\n'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The next word is &amp;#X201C;aah,&amp;#X201D; which is a perfectly legitimate
word, so stop looking at me like that.
Or, if it&amp;#X2019;s the whitespace that&amp;#X2019;s bothering you,
we can get rid of it with the string method &lt;TT&gt;strip&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; line = fin.readline()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; word = line.strip()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print word
aahed
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can also use a file object as part of a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop.
This program reads &lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt; and prints each word, one
per line:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;fin = open('words.txt')
for line in fin:
    word = line.strip()
    print word
&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;1'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a program that reads ''''&lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and prints only the
words with more than 20 characters (not counting whitespace).''

&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Exercises ==

There are solutions to these exercises in the next section.
You should at least attempt each one before you read the solutions.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;2'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called
''Gadsby'' that does not contain the letter &amp;#X201C;e.&amp;#X201D; Since &amp;#X201C;e&amp;#X201D; is
the most common letter in English, that&amp;#X2019;s not easy to do.''
''In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using
that most common symbol. It is slow going at first, but with caution
and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.''

''All right, I&amp;#X2019;ll stop now.''

''Write a function called ''&lt;CODE&gt;''has_no_e''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if
the given word doesn&amp;#X2019;t have the letter &amp;#X201C;e&amp;#X201D; in it.''

''Modify your program from the previous section to print only the words
that have no &amp;#X201C;e&amp;#X201D; and compute the percentage of the words in the list
have no &amp;#X201C;e.&amp;#X201D;''

&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;3'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;'' 
Write a function named ''''&lt;TT&gt;avoids&lt;/TT&gt;''''
that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and
that returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if the word doesn&amp;#X2019;t use any of the forbidden
letters.''
''Modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string
of forbidden letters and then print the number of words that
don&amp;#X2019;t contain any of them.
Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that
excludes the smallest number of words?
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;4'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a function named ''&lt;CODE&gt;''uses_only''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes a word and a
string of letters, and that returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if the word contains
only letters in the list. Can you make a sentence using only the
letters ''''&lt;TT&gt;acefhlo&lt;/TT&gt;''''? Other than &amp;#X201C;Hoe alfalfa?&amp;#X201D;
''&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;5'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;'' 
Write a function named ''&lt;CODE&gt;''uses_all''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes a word and a
string of required letters, and that returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if the word
uses all the required letters at least once. How many words are there
that use all the vowels ''''&lt;TT&gt;aeiou&lt;/TT&gt;''''? How about ''''&lt;TT&gt;aeiouy&lt;/TT&gt;''''?
''&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;6'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a function called ''&lt;CODE&gt;''is_abecedarian''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that returns
''''&lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;'''' if the letters in a word appear in alphabetical order
(double letters are ok). 
How many abecedarian words are there?
''&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Search ==
All of the exercises in the previous section have something
in common; they can be solved with the search pattern we saw
in Section&amp;#XA0;8.6. The simplest example is:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def has_no_e(word):
    for letter in word:
        if letter == 'e':
            return False
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop traverses the characters in &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;. If we find
the letter &amp;#X201C;e&amp;#X201D;, we can immediately return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;; otherwise we
have to go to the next letter. If we exit the loop normally, that
means we didn&amp;#X2019;t find an &amp;#X201C;e&amp;#X201D;, so we return &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;.

You can write this function more concisely using the &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt;
operator, but I started with this version because it 
demonstrates the logic of the search pattern.

&lt;TT&gt;avoids&lt;/TT&gt; is a more general version of &lt;CODE&gt;has_no_e&lt;/CODE&gt; but it
has the same structure:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def avoids(word, forbidden):
    for letter in word:
        if letter in forbidden:
            return False
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
We can return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt; as soon as we find a forbidden letter;
if we get to the end of the loop, we return &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;.

&lt;CODE&gt;uses_only&lt;/CODE&gt; is similar except that the sense of the condition
is reversed:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word: 
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Instead of a list of forbidden words, we have a list of available
words. If we find a letter in &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt; that is not in
&lt;TT&gt;available&lt;/TT&gt;, we can return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;.

&lt;CODE&gt;uses_all&lt;/CODE&gt; is similar except that we reverse the role
of the word and the string of letters:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def uses_all(word, required):
    for letter in required: 
        if letter not in word:
            return False
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Instead of traversing the letters in &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;, the loop
traverses the required letters. If any of the required letters
do not appear in the word, we can return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;.

If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would
have recognized that &lt;CODE&gt;uses_all&lt;/CODE&gt; was an instance of a
previously-solved problem, and you would have written:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def uses_all(word, required):
    return uses_only(required, word)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This is an example of a program development method called '''problem
recognition''', which means that you recognize the problem you are
working on as an instance of a previously-solved problem, and apply a
previously-developed solution.

== Looping with indices ==
I wrote the functions in the previous section with &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt;
loops because I only needed the characters in the strings; I didn&amp;#X2019;t
have to do anything with the indices.

For &lt;CODE&gt;is_abecedarian&lt;/CODE&gt; we have to compare adjacent letters,
which is a little tricky with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_abecedarian(word):
    previous = word[0]
    for c in word:
        if c &amp;lt; previous:
            return False
        previous = c
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
An alternative is to
use recursion:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_abecedarian(word):
    if len(word) &amp;lt;= 1:
        return True
    if word[0] &amp;gt; word[1]:
        return False
    return is_abecedarian(word[1:])
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Another option is to use a &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt; loop:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_abecedarian(word):
    i = 0
    while i &amp;lt; len(word)-1:
        if word[i+1] &amp;lt; word[i]:
            return False
        i = i+1
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The loop starts at &lt;TT&gt;i=0&lt;/TT&gt; and ends when &lt;TT&gt;i=len(word)-1&lt;/TT&gt;. Each
time through the loop, it compares the &lt;I&gt;i&lt;/I&gt;th character (which you can
think of as the current character) to the &lt;I&gt;i&lt;/I&gt;+1th character (which you
can think of as the next).

If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current
one, then we have discovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and
we return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;.

If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the
word passes the test. To convince yourself that the loop ends
correctly, consider an example like &lt;CODE&gt;'flossy'&lt;/CODE&gt;. The
length of the word is 6, so
the last time the loop runs is when &lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt; is 4, which is the
index of the second-to-last character. On the last iteration,
it compares the second-to-last character to the last, which is
what we want.

Here is a version of &lt;CODE&gt;is_palindrome&lt;/CODE&gt; (see
Exercise&amp;#XA0;6.6) that uses two indices; one starts at the
beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_palindrome(word):
    i = 0
    j = len(word)-1

    while i&amp;lt;j:
        if word[i] != word[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Or, if you noticed that this is an instance of a previously-solved
problem, you might have written:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def is_palindrome(word):
    return is_reverse(word, word)
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Assuming you did Exercise&amp;#XA0;8.8.

== Debugging ==
Testing programs is hard. The functions in this chapter are
relatively easy to test because you can check the results by hand.
Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to choose a
set of words that test for all possible errors.

Taking &lt;CODE&gt;has_no_e&lt;/CODE&gt; as an example, there are two obvious
cases to check: words that have an &amp;#X2019;e&amp;#X2019; should return &lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt;;
words that don&amp;#X2019;t should return &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt;. You should have no
trouble coming up with one of each.

Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the
words that have an &amp;#X201C;e,&amp;#X201D; you should test words with an &amp;#X201C;e&amp;#X201D; at the
beginning, the end, and somewhere in the middle. You should test long
words, short words, and very short words, like the empty string. The
empty string is an example of a '''special case''', which is one of
the non-obvious cases where errors often lurk.

In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test
your program with a word list like &lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt;. By scanning
the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:
you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be
included, but are) and not another (words that should be included,
but aren&amp;#X2019;t).

In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to
generate a good set of test cases, and even if you do, you can&amp;#X2019;t
be sure your program is correct.

According to a legendary computer scientist:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to
show their absence!
&amp;#X2014; Edsger W. Dijkstra

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

== Glossary ==

&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''file object:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; A value that represents an open file.

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''problem recognition:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; A way of solving a problem by
expressing it as an instance of a previously-solved problem.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''special case:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; A test case that is atypical or non-obvious
(and less likely to be handled correctly).
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 7 ===
This question is based on a Puzzler that was broadcast on the radio
program ''Car Talk&lt;ref&gt;&lt;TT&gt;www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200725&lt;/ref&gt;'':''
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I'll give you a
couple of words that almost qualify, but don't. For example, the word
committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It would be great except for the &amp;#X2018;i&amp;#X2019; that
sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could
take out those i&amp;#X2019;s it would work. But there is a word that has three
consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may
be the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only
think of one. What is the word?
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
''Write a program to find it. You can see my solution at
''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/cartalk.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

=== Exercise 8 ===
Here&amp;#X2019;s another ''Car Talk Puzzler''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;TT&gt;www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200803&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;'':
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;''
&amp;#X201C;I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to
notice my odometer. Like most odometers, it shows six digits,
in whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000
miles, for example, I&amp;#X2019;d see 3-0-0-0-0-0.''
''&amp;#X201C;Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the
last 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as
backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer
could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.''

''&amp;#X201C;One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it
could have read 3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle 4 out of
6 numbers were palindromic. And you ready for this? One mile later,
all 6 were palindromic!''

''&amp;#X201C;The question is, what was on the odometer when I first looked?&amp;#X201D;
''
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
''Write a Python program that tests all the six-digit numbers and prints
any numbers that satisfy these requirements. You can see my solution
at ''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/cartalk.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

=== Exercise 9 ===
Here&amp;#X2019;s another ''Car Talk'' Puzzler you can solve with a
search''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;TT&gt;www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200813&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;'':
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;''
&amp;#X201C;Recently I had a visit with my mom and we realized that
the two digits that make up my age when reversed resulted in her
age. For example, if she&amp;#X2019;s 73, I&amp;#X2019;m 37. We wondered how often this has
happened over the years but we got sidetracked with other topics and
we never came up with an answer.''
''&amp;#X201C;When I got home I figured out that the digits of our ages have been
reversible six times so far. I also figured out that if we&amp;#X2019;re lucky it
would happen again in a few years, and if we&amp;#X2019;re really lucky it would
happen one more time after that. In other words, it would have
happened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?&amp;#X201D;''
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
''Write a Python program that searches for solutions to this Puzzler.
Hint: you might find the string method ''''&lt;TT&gt;zfill&lt;/TT&gt;'''' useful.''

''You can see my solution at ''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/cartalk.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

== A list is a sequence ==
Like a string, a '''list''' is a sequence of values. In a string, the
values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in
list are called '''elements''' or sometimes '''items'''.

There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to
enclose the elements in square brackets (&lt;CODE&gt;[&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;]&lt;/CODE&gt;):
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;[10, 20, 30, 40]
['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of
three strings. The elements of a list don&amp;#X2019;t have to be the same type.
The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and
(lo!) another list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A list within another list is '''nested'''.

A list that contains no elements is
called an empty list; you can create one with empty
brackets, &lt;CODE&gt;[]&lt;/CODE&gt;.

As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; numbers = [17, 123]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; empty = []
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print cheeses, numbers, empty
['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [17, 123] []
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Lists are mutable ==
The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for
accessing the characters of a string&amp;#X2014;the bracket operator. The
expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the
indices start at 0:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print cheeses[0]
Cheddar
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Unlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears
on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the
list that will be assigned.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; numbers = [17, 123]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; numbers[1] = 5
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print numbers
[17, 5]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The one-eth element of &lt;TT&gt;numbers&lt;/TT&gt;, which
used to be 123, is now 5.

You can think of a list as a relationship between indices and
elements. This relationship is called a '''mapping'''; each index
&amp;#X201C;maps to&amp;#X201D; one of the elements. Here is a state diagram showing &lt;TT&gt;cheeses&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;numbers&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;empty&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book013.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
Lists are represented by boxes with the word &amp;#X201C;list&amp;#X201D; outside
and the elements of the list inside. &lt;TT&gt;cheeses&lt;/TT&gt; refers to
a list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2.
&lt;TT&gt;numbers&lt;/TT&gt; contains two elements; the diagram shows that the
value of the second element has been reassigned from 123 to 5.
&lt;TT&gt;empty&lt;/TT&gt; refers to a list with no elements.

List indices work the same way as string indices:

*Any integer expression can be used as an index.
*If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an &lt;TT&gt;IndexError&lt;/TT&gt;.
*If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.

The &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator also works on lists.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'Edam' in cheeses
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'Brie' in cheeses
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Traversing a list ==
The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is
with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for cheese in cheeses:
    print cheese
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This works well if you only need to read the elements of the
list. But if you want to write or update the elements, you
need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine
the functions &lt;TT&gt;range&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;len&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This loop traverses the list and updates each element. &lt;TT&gt;len&lt;/TT&gt;
returns the number of elements in the list. &lt;TT&gt;range&lt;/TT&gt; returns
a list of indices from 0 to &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#X2212;1, where &lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt; is the length of
the list. Each time through the loop &lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt; gets the index
of the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses
&lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt; to read the old value of the element and to assign the
new value.

A &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop over an empty list never executes the body:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for x in empty:
    print 'This never happens.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Although a list can contain another list, the nested
list still counts as a single element. The length of this list is
four:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== List operations ==
The &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator concatenates lists:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = [4, 5, 6]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; c = a + b
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Similarly, the &lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt; operator repeats a list a given number of times:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first example repeats &lt;TT&gt;[0]&lt;/TT&gt; four times. The second example
repeats the list &lt;TT&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/TT&gt; three times.

== List slices ==
The slice operator also works on lists:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t[1:3]
['b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t[3:]
['d', 'e', 'f']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning.
If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you
omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t[:]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy
before performing operations that fold, spindle or mutilate
lists.

A slice operator on the left side of an assignment
can update multiple elements:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== List methods ==
Python provides methods that operate on lists. For example,
&lt;TT&gt;append&lt;/TT&gt; adds a new element to the end of a list:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.append('d')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;extend&lt;/TT&gt; takes a list as an argument and appends all of
the elements:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 = ['d', 'e']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t1.extend(t2)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t1
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This example leaves &lt;TT&gt;t2&lt;/TT&gt; unmodified.

&lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; arranges the elements of the list from low to high:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.sort()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
List methods are all void; they modify the list and return &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;.
If you accidentally write &lt;TT&gt;t = t.sort()&lt;/TT&gt;, you will be disappointed
with the result.

== Map, filter and reduce ==
To add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def add_all(t):
    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x
    return total
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;total&lt;/TT&gt; is initialized to 0. Each time through the loop,
&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; gets one element from the list. The &lt;TT&gt;+=&lt;/TT&gt; operator
provides a short way to update a variable:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;    total += x
&lt;/PRE&gt;
is equivalent to:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;    total = total + x
&lt;/PRE&gt;
As the loop executes, &lt;TT&gt;total&lt;/TT&gt; accumulates the sum of the
elements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an
'''accumulator'''.

Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation
that Python provides it as a built-in function, &lt;TT&gt;sum&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sum(t)
6
&lt;/PRE&gt;
An operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into
a single value is sometimes called '''reduce'''.

Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building
another. For example, the following function takes a list of strings
and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;res&lt;/TT&gt; is initialized with an empty list; each time through
the loop, we append the next element. So &lt;TT&gt;res&lt;/TT&gt; is another
kind of accumulator.

An operation like &lt;CODE&gt;capitalize_all&lt;/CODE&gt; is sometimes called a '''map''' because it &amp;#X201C;maps&amp;#X201D; a function (in this case the method &lt;TT&gt;capitalize&lt;/TT&gt;) onto each of the elements in a sequence.

Another common operation is to select some of the elements from
a list and return a sublist. For example, the following
function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains
only the uppercase strings:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;isupper&lt;/TT&gt; is a string method that returns &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; if
the string contains only upper case letters.

An operation like &lt;CODE&gt;only_upper&lt;/CODE&gt; is called a '''filter''' because
it selects some of the elements and filters out the others.

Most common list operations can be expressed as a combination
of map, filter and reduce. Because these operations are
so common, Python provides language features to support them,
including the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;map&lt;/TT&gt; and an operator
called a &amp;#X201C;list comprehension.&amp;#X201D;

=== Exercise 1 ===
''Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the
cumulative sum; that is, a new list where the ''''&lt;I&gt;i&lt;/I&gt;''''th element
is the sum of the first ''''&lt;I&gt;i&lt;/I&gt;+1'''' elements from the original list.
For example, the cumulative sum of ''''&lt;TT&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is
''''&lt;TT&gt;[1, 3, 6]&lt;/TT&gt;''''.

== Deleting elements ==
There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you
know the index of the element you want, you can use
&lt;TT&gt;pop&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = t.pop(1)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print x
b
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;pop&lt;/TT&gt; modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.
If you don&amp;#X2019;t provide an index, it deletes and returns the
last element.

If you don&amp;#X2019;t need the removed value, you can use the &lt;TT&gt;del&lt;/TT&gt;
operator:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; del t[1]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'c']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you
can use &lt;TT&gt;remove&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t.remove('b')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'c']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The return value from &lt;TT&gt;remove&lt;/TT&gt; is &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;.

To remove more than one element, you can use &lt;TT&gt;del&lt;/TT&gt; with
a slice index:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; del t[1:5]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['a', 'f']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
As usual, the slice selects all the elements up to, but not
including, the second index.

== Lists and strings ==
A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence
of values, but a list of characters is not the same as a
string. To convert from a string to a list of characters,
you can use &lt;TT&gt;list&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 'spam'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = list(s)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']
&lt;/PRE&gt;

Because &lt;TT&gt;list&lt;/TT&gt; is the name of a built-in function, you should
avoid using it as a variable name. I also avoid &lt;TT&gt;l&lt;/TT&gt; because
it looks too much like &lt;TT&gt;1&lt;/TT&gt;. So that&amp;#X2019;s why I use &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt;.

The &lt;TT&gt;list&lt;/TT&gt; function breaks a string into individual letters. If
you want to break a string into words, you can use the &lt;TT&gt;split&lt;/TT&gt;
method:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 'pining for the fjords'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = s.split()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
&lt;/PRE&gt;

An optional argument called a '''delimiter''' specifies which
characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 'spam-spam-spam'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; delimiter = '-'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s.split(delimiter)
['spam', 'spam', 'spam']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;join&lt;/TT&gt; is the inverse of &lt;TT&gt;split&lt;/TT&gt;. It
takes a list of strings and
concatenates the elements. &lt;TT&gt;join&lt;/TT&gt; is a string method,
so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the
list as a parameter:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; delimiter = ' '
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; delimiter.join(t)
'pining for the fjords'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this case the delimiter is a space character, so
&lt;TT&gt;join&lt;/TT&gt; puts a space between words. To concatenate
strings without spaces, you can use the empty string,
&lt;CODE&gt;''&lt;/CODE&gt;, as a delimiter. 

== Objects and values ==
If we execute these assignment statements:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
We know that &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt; both refer to a
string, but we don&amp;#X2019;t
know whether they refer to the ''same'' string.
There are two possible states:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book014.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
In one case, &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt; refer to two different objects that
have the same value. In the second case, they refer to the same
object.

To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can
use the &lt;TT&gt;is&lt;/TT&gt; operator.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = 'banana'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this example, Python only created one string object,
and both &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt; refer to it.

But when you create two lists, you get two objects:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a is b
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
So the state diagram looks like this:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book015.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
In this case we would say that the two lists are '''equivalent''',
because they have the same elements, but not '''identical''', because
they are not the same object. If two objects are identical, they are
also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily
identical.

Until now, we have been using &amp;#X201C;object&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;value&amp;#X201D;
interchangeably, but it is more precise to say that an object has a
value. If you execute &lt;TT&gt;a = [1,2,3]&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; refers to a list
object whose value is a particular sequence of elements. If another
list has the same elements, we would say it has the same value.

== Aliasing ==
If &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; refers to an object and you assign &lt;TT&gt;b = a&lt;/TT&gt;,
then both variables refer to the same object:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b is a
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The state diagram looks like this:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book016.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
The association of a variable with an object is called a '''reference'''. In this example, there are two references to the same
object.

An object with more than one reference has more
than one name, so we say that the object is '''aliased'''.

If the aliased object is mutable, 
changes made with one alias affect
the other:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b[0] = 17
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print a
[17, 2, 3]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general,
it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable
objects.

For immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a
problem. In this example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It almost never makes a difference whether &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt; refer
to the same string or not.

== List arguments ==
When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference
to the list.
If the function modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the change.
For example, &lt;CODE&gt;delete_head&lt;/CODE&gt; removes the first element from a list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here&amp;#X2019;s how it is used:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; delete_head(letters)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print letters
['b', 'c']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The parameter &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt; and the variable &lt;TT&gt;letters&lt;/TT&gt; are
aliases for the same object. The stack diagram looks like
this:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book017.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
Since the list is shared by two frames, I drew
it between them.

It is important to distinguish between operations that
modify lists and operations that create new lists. For
example, the &lt;TT&gt;append&lt;/TT&gt; method modifies a list, but the
&lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator creates a new list:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t1 = [1, 2]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 = t1.append(3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t1
[1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t2
None

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t3 = t1 + [3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t3
[1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 is t3
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This difference is important when you write functions that
are supposed to modify lists. For example, this function
''does not'' delete the head of a list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def bad_delete_head(t):
    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment
makes &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt; refer to it, but none of that has any effect
on the list that was passed as an argument.

An alternative is to write a function that creates and
returns a new list. For
example, &lt;TT&gt;tail&lt;/TT&gt; returns all but the first
element of a list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def tail(t):
    return t[1:]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This function leaves the original list unmodified.
Here&amp;#X2019;s how it is used:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rest = tail(letters)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print rest
['b', 'c']
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 2 ===
Write a function called ''''&lt;TT&gt;chop&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that takes a list and modifies
it, removing the first and last elements, and returns ''''&lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;''''.

Then write a function called ''''&lt;TT&gt;middle&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that takes a list and
returns a new list that contains all but the first and last
elements.

== Debugging ==
Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:

*Don&amp;#X2019;t forget that most list methods modify the argument and
return &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;. This is the opposite of the string methods,
which return a new string and leave the original alone.
If you are used to writing string code like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;word = word.strip()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It is tempting to write list code like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;t = t.sort()           # WRONG!
&lt;/PRE&gt;



Because &lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; returns &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;, the
next operation you perform with &lt;TT&gt;t&lt;/TT&gt; is likely to fail.

Before using list methods and operators, you should read the
documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. The
methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like
strings) are documented at
&lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/lib/typesseq.html&lt;/TT&gt;. The
methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences
are documented at &lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-mutable.html&lt;/TT&gt;.

*Pick an idiom and stick with it.
Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many
ways to do things. For example, to remove an element from
a list, you can use &lt;TT&gt;pop&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;remove&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;del&lt;/TT&gt;,
or even a slice assignment.

To add an element, you can use the &lt;TT&gt;append&lt;/TT&gt; method or
the &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator. But don&amp;#X2019;t forget that these are right: 
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;t.append(x)
t = t + [x]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And these are wrong:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;t.append([x])          # WRONG!
t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!
t + [x]                # WRONG!
t = t + x              # WRONG!
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure
you understand what they do. Notice that only the last
one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they
do the wrong thing.

*Make copies to avoid aliasing.



If you want to use a method like &lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; that modifies
the argument, but you need to keep the original list as
well, you can make a copy.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;orig = t[:]
t.sort()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this example you could also use the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;sorted&lt;/TT&gt;,
which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone.
But in that case you should avoid using &lt;TT&gt;sorted&lt;/TT&gt; as a variable
name!

A '''dictionary''' is like a list, but more general. In a list,
the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can
be (almost) any type.

You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices
(which are called '''keys''') and a set of values. Each key maps to a
value. The association of a key and a value is called a '''key-value pair''' or sometimes an '''item'''.

As an example, we'll build a dictionary that maps from English
to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.

The function &lt;TT&gt;dict&lt;/TT&gt; creates a new dictionary with no items.
Because &lt;TT&gt;dict&lt;/TT&gt; is the name of a built-in function, you
should avoid using it as a variable name.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; eng2sp = dict()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print eng2sp
{}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The squiggly-brackets, &lt;CODE&gt;{}&lt;/CODE&gt;, represent an empty dictionary.
To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
&lt;/PRE&gt;

This line creates an item that maps from the key
&lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;one&amp;#X2019;&lt;/TT&gt; to the value &lt;CODE&gt;'uno'&lt;/CODE&gt;. If we print the
dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon
between the key and value:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print eng2sp
{'one': 'uno'}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This output format is also an input format. For example,
you can create a new dictionary with three items:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But if you print &lt;TT&gt;eng2sp&lt;/TT&gt;, you might be surprised:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print eng2sp
{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if
you type the same example on your computer, you might get a
different result. In general, the order of items in
a dictionary is unpredictable.

But that&amp;#X2019;s not a problem because
the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices.
Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print eng2sp['two']
'dos'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The key &lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;two&amp;#X2019;&lt;/TT&gt; always maps to the value &lt;CODE&gt;'dos'&lt;/CODE&gt; so the order
of the items doesn&amp;#X2019;t matter.

If the key isn&amp;#X2019;t in the dictionary, you get an exception:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print eng2sp['four']
KeyError: 'four'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;len&lt;/TT&gt; function works on dictionaries; it returns the
number of key-value pairs:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; len(eng2sp)
3
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether
something appears as a ''key'' in the dictionary (appearing
as a value is not good enough).

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'one' in eng2sp
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'uno' in eng2sp
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you
can use the method &lt;TT&gt;values&lt;/TT&gt;, which returns the values as
a list, and then use the &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vals = eng2sp.values()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'uno' in vals
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator uses different algorithms for lists and
dictionaries. For lists, it uses a search algorithm, as in
Section&amp;#XA0;8.6. As the list gets longer, the search time gets
longer in direct proportion. For dictionaries, Python uses an
algorithm called a '''hashtable''' that has a remarkable property: the
&lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how
many items there are in a dictionary. I won&amp;#X2019;t explain how that&amp;#X2019;s
possible, but you can read more about it at
&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table&lt;/TT&gt;.

=== Exercise 1 ===
''Write a function that reads the words in ''''&lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and
stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn&amp;#X2019;t matter what the
values are. Then you can use the ''''&lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt;'''' operator
as a fast way to check whether a string is in
the dictionary.''

''If you did Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''10.8'''', you can compare the speed
of this implementation with the list ''''&lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt;'''' operator and the
bisection search.''
&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Dictionary as a set of counters ==
Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many
times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:

*You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.
*You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;ord&lt;/TT&gt;), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.
*You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.

Each of these options performs the same computation, but each
of them implements that computation in a different way.

An '''implementation''' is a way of performing a computation;
some implementations are better than others. For example,
an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don&amp;#X2019;t
have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string
and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.

Here is what the code might look like:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] += 1
    return d
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The name of the function is '''histogram''', which is a statistical
term for a set of counters (or frequencies).

The first line of the
function creates an empty dictionary. The &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop traverses
the string. Each time through the loop, if the character &lt;TT&gt;c&lt;/TT&gt; is
not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key &lt;TT&gt;c&lt;/TT&gt; and the
initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If &lt;TT&gt;c&lt;/TT&gt; is
already in the dictionary we increment &lt;TT&gt;d[c]&lt;/TT&gt;.

Here&amp;#X2019;s how it works:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h = histogram('brontosaurus')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print h
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The histogram indicates that the letters &lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;a&amp;#X2019;&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;'b'&lt;/CODE&gt;
appear once; &lt;CODE&gt;'o'&lt;/CODE&gt; appears twice, and so on.

=== Exercise 2 ===
''Dictionaries have a method called ''''&lt;TT&gt;get&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that takes a key
and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary,
''''&lt;TT&gt;get&lt;/TT&gt;'''' returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns
the default value. For example:''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h = histogram('a')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print h
{'a': 1}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h.get('a', 0)
1
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h.get('b', 0)
0
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''Use ''''&lt;TT&gt;get&lt;/TT&gt;'''' to write ''''&lt;TT&gt;histogram&lt;/TT&gt;'''' more concisely. You
should be able to eliminate the ''''&lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt;'''' statement.
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Looping and dictionaries ==
If you use a dictionary in a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; statement, it traverses
the keys of the dictionary. For example, &lt;CODE&gt;print_hist&lt;/CODE&gt;
prints each key and the corresponding value:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def print_hist(h):
    for c in h:
        print c, h[c]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here&amp;#X2019;s what the output looks like:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h = histogram('parrot')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_hist(h)
a 1
p 1
r 2
t 1
o 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Again, the keys are in no particular order.

=== Exercise 3 ===
''Dictionaries have a method called ''''&lt;TT&gt;keys&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that returns
the keys of the dictionary, in no particular order, as a list.''

''Modify ''&lt;CODE&gt;''print_hist''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' to print the keys and their values
in alphabetical order.

== Reverse lookup ==
Given a dictionary &lt;TT&gt;d&lt;/TT&gt; and a key &lt;TT&gt;k&lt;/TT&gt;, it is easy to
find the corresponding value &lt;TT&gt;v = d[k]&lt;/TT&gt;. This operation
is called a '''lookup'''.

But what if you have &lt;TT&gt;v&lt;/TT&gt; and you want to find &lt;TT&gt;k&lt;/TT&gt;?
You have two problems: first, there might be more than one
key that maps to the value &lt;TT&gt;v&lt;/TT&gt;. Depending on the application,
you might be able to pick one, or you might have to make
a list that contains all of them. Second, there is no
simple syntax to do a '''reverse lookup'''; you have to search.

Here is a function that takes a value and returns the first
key that maps to that value:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def reverse_lookup(d, v):
    for k in d:
        if d[k] == v:
            return k
    raise ValueError
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This function is yet another example of the search pattern, but it
uses a feature we haven&amp;#X2019;t seen before, &lt;TT&gt;raise&lt;/TT&gt;. The &lt;TT&gt;raise&lt;/TT&gt;
statement causes an exception; in this case it causes a &lt;TT&gt;ValueError&lt;/TT&gt;, which generally indicates that there is something wrong
with the value of a parameter.

If we get to the end of the loop, that means &lt;TT&gt;v&lt;/TT&gt;
doesn&amp;#X2019;t appear in the dictionary as a value, so we raise an
exception.

Here is an example of a successful reverse lookup:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h = histogram('parrot')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; k = reverse_lookup(h, 2)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print k
r
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And an unsuccessful one:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; k = reverse_lookup(h, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 5, in reverse_lookup
ValueError
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The result when you raise an exception is the same as when
Python raises one: it prints a traceback and an error message.

The &lt;TT&gt;raise&lt;/TT&gt; statement takes a detailed error message as an
optional argument. For example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; raise ValueError, 'value does not appear in the dictionary'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
ValueError: value does not appear in the dictionary
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A reverse lookup is much slower than a forward lookup; if you
have to do it often, or if the dictionary gets big, the performance
of your program will suffer.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;4'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Modify ''&lt;CODE&gt;''reverse_lookup''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' so that it builds and returns a list
of ''all'' keys that map to ''''&lt;TT&gt;v&lt;/TT&gt;'''', or an empty list if there
are none.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Dictionaries and lists ==
Lists can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you
were given a dictionary that maps from letters to frequencies, you
might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary that maps
from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters
with the same frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary
should be a list of letters.

Here is a function that inverts a dictionary:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def invert_dict(d):
    inv = dict()
    for key in d:
        val = d[key]
        if val not in inv:
            inv[val] = [key]
        else:
            inv[val].append(key)
    return inv
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Each time through the loop, &lt;TT&gt;key&lt;/TT&gt; gets a key from &lt;TT&gt;d&lt;/TT&gt; and 
&lt;TT&gt;val&lt;/TT&gt; gets the corresponding value. If &lt;TT&gt;val&lt;/TT&gt; is not in &lt;TT&gt;inv&lt;/TT&gt;,
that means we haven&amp;#X2019;t seen it before, so we create a new item and
initialize it with a '''singleton''' (a list that contains a
single element). Otherwise we have seen this value before, so we
append the corresponding key to the list.

Here is an example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hist = histogram('parrot')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print hist
{'a': 1, 'p': 1, 'r': 2, 't': 1, 'o': 1}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; inv = invert_dict(hist)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print inv
{1: ['a', 'p', 't', 'o'], 2: ['r']}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And here is a diagram showing &lt;TT&gt;hist&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;inv&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book018.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
A dictionary is represented as a box with the type &lt;TT&gt;dict&lt;/TT&gt; above it
and the key-value pairs inside. If the values are integers, floats or
strings, I usually draw them inside the box, but I usually draw lists
outside the box, just to keep the diagram simple.

Lists can be values in a dictionary, as this example shows, but they
cannot be keys. Here&amp;#X2019;s what happens if you try:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = dict()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d[t] = 'oops'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
TypeError: list objects are unhashable
&lt;/PRE&gt;
I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using
a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be '''hashable'''.

A '''hash''' is a function that takes a value (of any kind)
and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers,
called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.

This system works fine if the keys are immutable. But if the
keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen. For example,
when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and 
stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the
key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location.
In that case you might have two entries for the same key,
or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the
dictionary wouldn&amp;#X2019;t work correctly.

That&amp;#X2019;s why the keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like
lists aren&amp;#X2019;t. The simplest way to get around this limitation is to
use tuples, which we will see in the next chapter.

Since dictionaries are mutable, they can&amp;#X2019;t be used as keys,
but they ''can'' be used as values.

=== Exercise 5 ===
Read the documentation of the dictionary method ''''&lt;TT&gt;setdefault&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and use it to write a more concise version of ''&lt;CODE&gt;''invert_dict''&lt;/CODE&gt;''.''

== Memos ==
If you played with the &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; function from
Section&amp;#XA0;6.7, you might have noticed that the bigger
the argument you provide, the longer the function takes to run.
Furthermore, the run time increases very quickly.

To understand why, consider this '''call graph''' for
&lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;n=4&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book019.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
A call graph shows a set of function frames, with lines connecting each
frame to the frames of the functions it calls. At the top of the
graph, &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;n=4&lt;/TT&gt; calls &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;n=3&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;n=2&lt;/TT&gt;. In turn, &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;n=3&lt;/TT&gt; calls
&lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;n=2&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;n=1&lt;/TT&gt;. And so on.

Count how many times &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci(0)&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci(1)&lt;/TT&gt; are
called. This is an inefficient solution to the problem, and it gets
worse as the argument gets bigger.

One solution is to keep track of values that have already been
computed by storing them in a dictionary. A previously computed value
that is stored for later use is called a '''memo'''&lt;ref&gt;See
&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Here is an
implementation of &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; using memos:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;known = {0:0, 1:1}

def fibonacci(n):
    if n in known:
        return known[n]

    res = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    known[n] = res
    return res
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;known&lt;/TT&gt; is a dictionary that keeps track of the Fibonacci
numbers we already know. It starts with
two items: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1.

Whenever &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt; is called, it checks &lt;TT&gt;known&lt;/TT&gt;.
If the result is already there, it can return
immediately. Otherwise it has to 
compute the new value, add it to the dictionary, and return it.

=== Exercise 6 ===
Run this version of ''''&lt;TT&gt;fibonacci&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and the original with
a range of parameters and compare their run times.

== Global variables ==
In the previous example, &lt;TT&gt;known&lt;/TT&gt; is created outside the function,
so it belongs to the special frame called &lt;CODE&gt;__main__&lt;/CODE&gt;.
Variables in &lt;CODE&gt;__main__&lt;/CODE&gt; are sometimes called '''global'''
because they can be accessed from any function. Unlike local
variables, which disappear when their function ends, global variables
persist from one function call to the next.

It is common to use global variables for '''flags'''; that is, 
boolean variables that indicate (&amp;#X201C;flag&amp;#X201D;) whether a condition
is true. For example, some programs use
a flag named &lt;TT&gt;verbose&lt;/TT&gt; to control the level of detail in the
output:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;verbose = True

def example1():
    if verbose:
        print 'Running example1'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised.
The following example is supposed to keep track of whether the
function has been called:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;been_called = False

def example2():
    been_called = True         # WRONG
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But if you run it you will see that the value of &lt;CODE&gt;been_called&lt;/CODE&gt;
doesn&amp;#X2019;t change. The problem is that &lt;TT&gt;example2&lt;/TT&gt; creates a new local
variable named &lt;CODE&gt;been_called&lt;/CODE&gt;. The local variable goes away when
the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.

To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to
'''declare''' the global variable before you use it:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;been_called = False

def example2():
    global been_called 
    been_called = True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;global&lt;/TT&gt; statement tells the interpreter
something like, &amp;#X201C;In this function, when I say &lt;CODE&gt;been_called&lt;/CODE&gt;, I
mean the global variable; don&amp;#X2019;t create a local one.&amp;#X201D;

Here&amp;#X2019;s an example that tries to update a global variable:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;count = 0

def example3():
    count = count + 1          # WRONG
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you run it you get:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Python assumes that &lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt; is local, which means
that you are reading it before writing it. The solution, again,
is to declare &lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt; global.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def example3():
    global count
    count += 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If the global value is mutable, you can modify it without
declaring it:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;known = {0:0, 1:1}

def example4():
    known[2] = 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
So you can add, remove and replace elements of a global list or
dictionary, but if you want to reassign the variable, you
have to declare it:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def example5():
    global known
    known = dict()
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Long integers ==
If you compute &lt;TT&gt;fibonacci(50)&lt;/TT&gt;, you get:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fibonacci(50)
12586269025L
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;L&lt;/TT&gt; at the end indicates that the result is a long
integer&lt;ref&gt;In Python 3.0, type &lt;TT&gt;long&lt;/TT&gt; is gone; all integers,
even really big ones, are type &lt;TT&gt;int&lt;/TT&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;, or type &lt;TT&gt;long&lt;/TT&gt;.

Values with type &lt;TT&gt;int&lt;/TT&gt; have a limited range;
long integers can be arbitrarily big, but as they get bigger
they consume more space and time.

The mathematical operators work on long integers, and the functions
in the &lt;TT&gt;math&lt;/TT&gt; module, too, so in general any code that
works with &lt;TT&gt;int&lt;/TT&gt; will also work with &lt;TT&gt;long&lt;/TT&gt;.

Any time the result of a computation is too big to be represented with
an integer, Python converts the result as a long integer:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1000 * 1000
1000000
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 100000 * 100000
10000000000L
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In the first case the result has type &lt;TT&gt;int&lt;/TT&gt;; in the
second case it is &lt;TT&gt;long&lt;/TT&gt;.

=== Exercise 7 ===
''Exponentiation of large integers is the basis of common
algorithms for public-key encryption. Read the Wikipedia
page on the RSA algorithm&lt;ref&gt;&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA&lt;/TT&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
and write functions to encode and decode messages.''

== Debugging ==
As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to
debug by printing and checking data by hand. Here are some
suggestions for debugging large datasets:
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Scale down the input:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; If possible, reduce the size of the
dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with
just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find.
You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the
program so it reads only the first &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; lines.
If there is an error, you can reduce &lt;TT&gt;n&lt;/TT&gt; to the smallest
value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually
as you find and correct errors.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Check summaries and types:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Instead of printing and checking the
entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example,
the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.
A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right
type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print
the type of a value.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Write self-checks:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Sometimes you can write code to check
for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the
average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is
not greater than the largest element in the list or less than
the smallest. This is called a &amp;#X201C;sanity check&amp;#X201D; because it detects
results that are &amp;#X201C;insane.&amp;#X201D;

Another kind of check compares the results of two different
computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a
&amp;#X201C;consistency check.&amp;#X201D;
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Pretty print the output:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Formatting debugging output
can make it easier to spot an error. We saw an example in
Section&amp;#XA0;6.9. The &lt;TT&gt;pprint&lt;/TT&gt; module provides
a &lt;TT&gt;pprint&lt;/TT&gt; function that displays built-in types in
a more human-readable format.

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce
the time you spend debugging.

== Exercise-8 ==
         Dictionaries have a method called 'keys' that returns the keys of the dictionary, in

Modify print_hist to print the keys and their values in alphabetical order.

=== Exercise 9 ===
''Two words are &amp;#X201C;rotate pairs&amp;#X201D; if you can rotate one of them
and get the other (see ''&lt;CODE&gt;''rotate_word''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' in Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''8.12'''').''

''Write a program that reads a wordlist and finds all the rotate

''Here&amp;#X2019;s another Puzzler from ''Car
Talk&lt;ref&gt;&lt;TT&gt;www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200717&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;'':''
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;''
This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O&amp;#X2019;Leary. He came upon a common
one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique
property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form
a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly
the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove
the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the
original word. And the question is, what&amp;#X2019;s the word?''
''Now I&amp;#X2019;m going to give you an example that doesn&amp;#X2019;t work. Let&amp;#X2019;s look at
the five-letter word, &amp;#X2018;wrack.&amp;#X2019; W-R-A-C-K, you know like to &amp;#X2018;wrack with
pain.&amp;#X2019; If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter
word, &amp;#X2019;R-A-C-K.&amp;#X2019; As in, &amp;#X2018;Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck!
It must have been a nine-pointer!&amp;#X2019; It&amp;#X2019;s a perfect homophone. If you
put the &amp;#X2018;w&amp;#X2019; back, and remove the &amp;#X2018;r,&amp;#X2019; instead, you&amp;#X2019;re left with the
word, &amp;#X2018;wack,&amp;#X2019; which is a real word, it&amp;#X2019;s just not a homophone of the
other two words.''

''But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of,
which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two
letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what&amp;#X2019;s
the word?
''
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
''
''''
''

''You can use the dictionary from Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''11.1'''' to check
whether a string is in the word list.''

''To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU
Pronouncing Dictionary. You can download it from
''''&lt;TT&gt;www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict&lt;/TT&gt;'''' or from
''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/c06d&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and you can also download
''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/pronounce.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which provides a function
named ''&lt;CODE&gt;''read_dictionary''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that reads the pronouncing dictionary and
returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that
describes its primary pronunciation.''

''Write a program that lists all the words that solve the Puzzler.

== Tuples are immutable ==
A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and
they are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot
like lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable.

Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in
parentheses:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final
comma:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t1 = ('a',)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(t1)
&amp;lt;type 'tuple'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Without the comma, Python treats &lt;CODE&gt;('a')&lt;/CODE&gt; as a string in
parentheses:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 = ('a')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(t2)
&amp;lt;type 'str'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Another way to create a tuple is the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;tuple&lt;/TT&gt;.
With no argument, it creates an empty tuple:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = tuple()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result
is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = tuple('lupins')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Because &lt;TT&gt;tuple&lt;/TT&gt; is the name of a built-in function, you should
avoid using it as a variable name.

Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator
indexes an element:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t[0]
'a'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And the slice operator selects a range of elements.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t[1:3]
('b', 'c')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get
an error:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t[0] = 'A'
TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can&amp;#X2019;t modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace
one tuple with another:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ('A',) + t[1:]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Tuple assignment ==
It is often useful to swap the values of two variables.
With conventional assignments, you have to use a temporary
variable. For example, to swap &lt;TT&gt;a&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;b&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; temp = a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = b
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = temp
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This solution is cumbersome; '''tuple assignment''' is more elegant:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a, b = b, a
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of
expressions. Each value is assigned to its respective variable. 
All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any
of the assignments.

The number of variables on the left and the number of
values on the right have to be the same:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a, b = 1, 2, 3
ValueError: too many values to unpack
&lt;/PRE&gt;
More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence
(string, list or tuple). For example, to split an email address
into a user name and a domain, you could write:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; addr = 'monty@python.org'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; uname, domain = addr.split('@')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The return value from &lt;TT&gt;split&lt;/TT&gt; is a list with two elements;
the first element is assigned to &lt;TT&gt;uname&lt;/TT&gt;, the second to
&lt;TT&gt;domain&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print uname
monty
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print domain
python.org
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Tuples as return values ==
Strictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but
if the value is a tuple, the effect is the same as returning
multiple values. For example, if you want to divide two integers
and compute the quotient and remainder, it is inefficient to
compute &lt;TT&gt;x/y&lt;/TT&gt; and then &lt;TT&gt;x%y&lt;/TT&gt;. It is better to compute
them both at the same time.

The built-in function &lt;TT&gt;divmod&lt;/TT&gt; takes two arguments and
returns a tuple of two values, the quotient and remainder.
You can store the result as a tuple:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = divmod(7, 3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
(2, 1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Or use tuple assignment to store the elements separately:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; quot, rem = divmod(7, 3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print quot
2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print rem
1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here is an example of a function that returns a tuple:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def min_max(t):
    return min(t), max(t)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;max&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;min&lt;/TT&gt; are built-in functions that find
the largest and smallest elements of a sequence. &lt;CODE&gt;min_max&lt;/CODE&gt;
computes both and returns a tuple of two values.

== Variable-length argument tuples ==
Functions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter
name that begins with &lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt; '''gathers''' arguments into
a tuple. For example, &lt;TT&gt;printall&lt;/TT&gt;
takes any number of arguments and prints them:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def printall(*args):
    print args
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The gather parameter can have any name you like, but &lt;TT&gt;args&lt;/TT&gt; is
conventional. Here&amp;#X2019;s how the function works:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; printall(1, 2.0, '3')
(1, 2.0, '3')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can combine the gather operator with required and positional
arguments:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def pointless(required, optional=0, *args):
    print required, optional, args
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Run this function with 1, 2, 3 and 4 or more arguments and
make sure you understand what it does.

The complement of gather is '''scatter'''. If you have a
sequence of values and you want to pass it to a function
as multiple arguments, you can use the &lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt; operator.
For example, &lt;TT&gt;divmod&lt;/TT&gt; takes exactly two arguments; it
doesn&amp;#X2019;t work with a tuple:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = (7, 3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; divmod(t)
TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But if you scatter the tuple, it works:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; divmod(*t)
(2, 1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 1 ===
Many of the built-in functions use
variable-length argument tuples. For example, ''''&lt;TT&gt;max&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and ''''&lt;TT&gt;min&lt;/TT&gt;'''' can take any number of arguments:''

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; max(1,2,3)
3
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''But ''''&lt;TT&gt;sum&lt;/TT&gt;'''' does not.''

''
''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sum(1,2,3)
TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''Write a function called ''''&lt;TT&gt;sumall&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that takes any number
of arguments and returns their sum.''

== Lists and tuples ==
&lt;TT&gt;zip&lt;/TT&gt; is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and
&amp;#X201C;zips&amp;#X201D; them into a list&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt; of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each
sequence.

This example zips a string and a list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 'abc'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [0, 1, 2]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; zip(s, t)
[('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The result is a list of tuples where each tuple contains
a character from the string and the corresponding element from
the list.

If the sequences are not the same length, the result has the
length of the shorter one.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; zip('Anne', 'Elk')
[('A', 'E'), ('n', 'l'), ('n', 'k')]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can use tuple assignment in a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; loop to traverse a list of
tuples:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;t = [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]
for letter, number in t:
    print number, letter
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Each time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in
the list and assigns the elements to &lt;TT&gt;letter&lt;/TT&gt; and 
&lt;TT&gt;number&lt;/TT&gt;. The output of this loop is:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;0 a
1 b
2 c
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you combine &lt;TT&gt;zip&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt; and tuple assignment, you get a
useful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same
time. For example, &lt;CODE&gt;has_match&lt;/CODE&gt; takes two sequences, &lt;TT&gt;t1&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;t2&lt;/TT&gt;, and returns &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; if there is an index &lt;TT&gt;i&lt;/TT&gt;
such that &lt;TT&gt;t1[i] == t2[i]&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def has_match(t1, t2):
    for x, y in zip(t1, t2):
        if x == y:
            return True
    return False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their
indices, you can use the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;enumerate&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for index, element in enumerate('abc'):
    print index, element
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The output of this loop is:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;0 a
1 b
2 c
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Again.

== Dictionaries and tuples ==
Dictionaries have a method called &lt;TT&gt;items&lt;/TT&gt; that returns a list of
tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = d.items()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t
[('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no
particular order.

Conversely, you can use a list of tuples to initialize
a new dictionary:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = dict(t)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print d
{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Combining &lt;TT&gt;dict&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;zip&lt;/TT&gt; yields a concise way
to create a dictionary:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = dict(zip('abc', range(3)))
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print d
{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The dictionary method &lt;TT&gt;update&lt;/TT&gt; also takes a list of tuples
and adds them, as key-value pairs, to an existing dictionary.

Combining &lt;TT&gt;items&lt;/TT&gt;, tuple assignment and &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt;, you
get the idiom for traversing the keys and values of a dictionary:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for key, val in d.items():
    print val, key
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The output of this loop is:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;0 a
2 c
1 b
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Again.

It is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because
you can&amp;#X2019;t use lists). For example, a telephone directory might map
from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone numbers. Assuming
that we have defined &lt;TT&gt;last&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;first&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;number&lt;/TT&gt;, we
could write:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;directory[last,first] = number
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple
assignment to traverse this dictionary.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for last, first in directory:
    print first, last, directory[last,first]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This loop traverses the keys in &lt;TT&gt;directory&lt;/TT&gt;, which are tuples. It
assigns the elements of each tuple to &lt;TT&gt;last&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;first&lt;/TT&gt;, then
prints the name and corresponding telephone number.

There are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram. The more
detailed version shows the indices and elements just as they appear in
a list. For example, the tuple &lt;CODE&gt;('Cleese', 'John')&lt;/CODE&gt; would appear:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book020.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
But in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the
details. For example, a diagram of the telephone directory might
appear:
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book021.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
Here the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical
shorthand.

The telephone number in the diagram is the complaints line for the
BBC, so please don&amp;#X2019;t call it.

== Comparing tuples ==
The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences;
Python starts by comparing the first element from each
sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements,
and so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent
elements are not considered (even if they are really big).
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (0, 1, 2) &amp;lt; (0, 3, 4)
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (0, 1, 2000000) &amp;lt; (0, 3, 4)
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; function works the same way. It sorts 
primarily by first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts
by second element, and so on. 

This feature lends itself to a pattern called '''DSU''' for 
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Decorate'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; a sequence by building a list of tuples
with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Sort'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; the list of tuples, and&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''Undecorate'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

For example, suppose you have a list of words and you want to
sort them from longest to shortest:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def sort_by_length(words):
    t = []
    for word in words:
       t.append((len(word), word))

    t.sort(reverse=True)

    res = []
    for length, word in t:
        res.append(word)
    return res
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first loop builds a list of tuples, where each
tuple is a word preceded by its length.

&lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; compares the first element, length, first, and
only considers the second element to break ties. The keyword argument
&lt;TT&gt;reverse=True&lt;/TT&gt; tells &lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; to go in decreasing order.

The second loop traverses the list of tuples and builds a list of
words in descending order of length.

=== Exercise 2 ===
In this example, ties are broken by comparing words, so words
with the same length appear in alphabetical order. For other
applications you might want to break ties at random. Modify
this example so that words with the same length appear in
random order. Hint: see the ''''&lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt;'''' function in the
''''&lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt;'''' module.''

== Sequences of sequences ==
I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in
this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and
tuples of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it
is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.

In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and
tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how and why do you choose one
over the others?

To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other
sequences because the elements have to be characters. They are
also immutable. If you need the ability to change the characters
in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might
want to use a list of characters instead.

Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable.
But there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:

*In some contexts, like a &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.
*If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.
*If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.

Because tuples are immutable, they don&amp;#X2019;t provide methods
like &lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;reverse&lt;/TT&gt;, which modify existing lists.
But Python provides the built-in functions &lt;TT&gt;sorted&lt;/TT&gt;
and &lt;TT&gt;reversed&lt;/TT&gt;, which take any sequence as a parameter
and return a new list with the same elements in a different
order.

== Debugging ==
Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as '''data
structures'''; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data
structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that contain tuples
as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but
they are prone to what I call '''shape errors'''; that is, errors
caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size or composition.
For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I
give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won&amp;#X2019;t work.

To help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module
called &lt;TT&gt;structshape&lt;/TT&gt; that provides a function, also called
&lt;TT&gt;structshape&lt;/TT&gt;, that takes any kind of data structure as
an argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape.
You can download it from &lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py&lt;/TT&gt;

Here&amp;#X2019;s the result for a simple list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from structshape import structshape
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [1,2,3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print structshape(t)
list of 3 int
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A fancier program might write &amp;#X201C;list of 3 int''s'',&amp;#X201D; but it
was easier not to deal with plurals. Here&amp;#X2019;s a list of lists:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print structshape(t2)
list of 3 list of 2 int
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If the elements of the list are not the same type,
&lt;TT&gt;structshape&lt;/TT&gt; groups them, in order, by type:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t3 = [1, 2, 3, 4.0, '5', '6', [7], [8], 9]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print structshape(t3)
list of (3 int, float, 2 str, 2 list of int, int)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here&amp;#X2019;s a list of tuples:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 'abc'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lt = zip(t, s)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print structshape(lt)
list of 3 tuple of (int, str)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And here&amp;#X2019;s a dictionary with 3 items that map integers to strings.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; d = dict(lt) 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print structshape(d)
dict of 3 int-&amp;gt;str
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you are having trouble keeping track of your data structures,
&lt;TT&gt;structshape&lt;/TT&gt; can help.

== Word frequency analysis ==
As usual, you should at least attempt the following exercises
before you read my solutions.

=== Exercise 1 ===
Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into
words, strips whitespace and punctuation from the words, and
converts them to lowercase.

''Hint: The ''''&lt;TT&gt;string&lt;/TT&gt;'''' module provides strings named ''''&lt;TT&gt;whitespace&lt;/TT&gt;'''',
which contains space, tab, newline, etc., and ''''&lt;TT&gt;punctuation&lt;/TT&gt;'''' which contains the punctuation characters. Let&amp;#X2019;s see
if we can make Python swear:''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; print string.punctuation
!&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~
&lt;/source&gt;

''Also, you might consider using the string methods ''''&lt;TT&gt;strip&lt;/TT&gt;'''',
''''&lt;TT&gt;replace&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;translate&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

=== Exercise 2 ===
''Go to Project Gutenberg (''''&lt;TT&gt;gutenberg.org&lt;/TT&gt;'''') and download 
your favorite out-of-copyright book in plain text format.''

''Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book
you downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning
of the file, and process the rest of the words as before.''

''Then modify the program to count the total number of words in
the book, and the number of times each word is used.''

''Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare
different books by different authors, written in different eras.
Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?
''

=== Exercise 3 ===
Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the
20 most frequently-used words in the book.

=== Exercise 4 ===
Modify the previous program to read a word list (see
Section&amp;#XA0;''''9.1'''') and then print all the words in the book that
are not in the word list. How many of them are typos? How many of
them are common words that ''should'' be in the word list, and how
many of them are really obscure?

== Random numbers ==
Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same
outputs every time, so they are said to be '''deterministic'''.
Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same
calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though,
we want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious
example, but there are more.

Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not so easy,
but there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of
them is to use algorithms that generate '''pseudorandom''' numbers.
Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated
by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it
is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.

The &lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt; module provides functions that generate
pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call &amp;#X201C;random&amp;#X201D; from
here on).

The function &lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt; returns a random float
between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you
call &lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt;, you get the next number in a long series. To see a
sample, run this loop:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;import random

for i in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print x
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The function &lt;TT&gt;randint&lt;/TT&gt; takes parameters &lt;TT&gt;low&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;high&lt;/TT&gt; and returns an integer between &lt;TT&gt;low&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;high&lt;/TT&gt; (including both).

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; random.randint(5, 10)
5
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; random.randint(5, 10)
9
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use
&lt;TT&gt;choice&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; random.choice(t)
2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; random.choice(t)
3
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt; module also provides functions to generate
random values from continuous distributions including
Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.

=== Exercise 5 ===
''Write a function named ''&lt;CODE&gt;''choose_from_hist''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes
a histogram as defined in Section&amp;#XA0;''''11.1'''' and returns a 
random value from the histogram, chosen with probability
in proportion to frequency. For example, for this histogram:''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['a', 'a', 'b']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; h = histogram(t)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print h
{'a': 2, 'b': 1}
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''your function should ''''&lt;TT&gt;&amp;#X2019;a&amp;#X2019;&lt;/TT&gt;'''' with probability ''''2/3'''' and ''&lt;CODE&gt;'''b'''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
with probability ''''1/3''''.

== Word histogram ==
Here is a program that reads a file and builds a histogram of the
words in the file:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;import string

def process_file(filename):
    h = dict()
    fp = open(filename)
    for line in fp:
        process_line(line, h)
    return h

def process_line(line, h):
    line = line.replace('-', ' ')
    
    for word in line.split():
        word = word.strip(string.punctuation + string.whitespace)
        word = word.lower()

        h[word] = h.get(word, 0) + 1

hist = process_file('emma.txt')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This program reads &lt;TT&gt;emma.txt&lt;/TT&gt;, which contains the text of ''Emma'' by Jane Austen.

&lt;CODE&gt;process_file&lt;/CODE&gt; loops through the lines of the file,
passing them one at a time to &lt;CODE&gt;process_line&lt;/CODE&gt;. The histogram
&lt;TT&gt;h&lt;/TT&gt; is being used as an accumulator.

&lt;CODE&gt;process_line&lt;/CODE&gt; uses the string method &lt;TT&gt;replace&lt;/TT&gt; to replace
hyphens with spaces before using &lt;TT&gt;split&lt;/TT&gt; to break the line into a
list of strings. It traverses the list of words and uses &lt;TT&gt;strip&lt;/TT&gt;
and &lt;TT&gt;lower&lt;/TT&gt; to remove punctuation and convert to lower case. (It
is a shorthand to say that strings are &amp;#X201C;converted;&amp;#X201D; remember that
string are immutable, so methods like &lt;TT&gt;strip&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;lower&lt;/TT&gt;
return new strings.)

Finally, &lt;CODE&gt;process_line&lt;/CODE&gt; updates the histogram by creating a new
item or incrementing an existing one.

To count the total number of words in the file, we can add up
the frequencies in the histogram:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def total_words(h):
    return sum(h.values())
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The number of different words is just the number of items in
the dictionary:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def different_words(h):
    return len(h)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here is some code to print the results:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;print 'Total number of words:', total_words(hist)
print 'Number of different words:', different_words(hist)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And the results:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;Total number of words: 161073
Number of different words: 7212
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Most common words ==
To find the most common words, we can apply the DSU pattern;
&lt;CODE&gt;most_common&lt;/CODE&gt; takes a histogram and returns a list of
word-frequency tuples, sorted in reverse order by frequency:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def most_common(h):
    t = []
    for key, value in h.items():
        t.append((value, key))

    t.sort(reverse=True)
    return t
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here is a loop that prints the ten most common words:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;t = most_common(hist)
print 'The most common words are:'
for freq, word in t[0:10]:
    print word, '\t', freq
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And here are the results from ''Emma'':
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;The most common words are:
to      5242
the     5204
and     4897
of      4293
i       3191
a       3130
it      2529
her     2483
was     2400
she     2364
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Optional parameters ==
We have seen built-in functions and methods that take a variable
number of arguments. It is possible to write user-defined functions
with optional arguments, too. For example, here is a function that
prints the most common words in a histogram
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def print_most_common(hist, num=10)
    t = most_common(hist)
    print 'The most common words are:'
    for freq, word in t[0:num]:
        print word, '\t', freq
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first parameter is required; the second is optional.
The '''default value''' of &lt;TT&gt;num&lt;/TT&gt; is 10.

If you only provide one argument:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;print_most_common(hist)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;num&lt;/TT&gt; gets the default value. If you provide two arguments:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;print_most_common(hist, 20)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;num&lt;/TT&gt; gets the value of the argument instead. In other
words, the optional argument '''overrides''' the default value.

If a function has both required and optional parameters, all
the required parameters have to come first, followed by the
optional ones.

== Dictionary subtraction ==
Finding the words from the book that are not in the word list
from &lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt; is a problem you might recognize as set
subtraction; that is, we want to find all the words from one
set (the words in the book) that are not in another set (the
words in the list).

&lt;TT&gt;subtract&lt;/TT&gt; takes dictionaries &lt;TT&gt;d1&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;d2&lt;/TT&gt; and returns a
new dictionary that contains all the keys from &lt;TT&gt;d1&lt;/TT&gt; that are not
in &lt;TT&gt;d2&lt;/TT&gt;. Since we don&amp;#X2019;t really care about the values, we
set them all to None.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def subtract(d1, d2):
    res = dict()
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            res[key] = None
    return res
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To find the words in the book that are not in &lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt;,
we can use &lt;CODE&gt;process_file&lt;/CODE&gt; to build a histogram for
&lt;TT&gt;words.txt&lt;/TT&gt;, and then subtract:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;words = process_file('words.txt')
diff = subtract(hist, words)

print &quot;The words in the book that aren't in the word list are:&quot;
for word in diff.keys():
    print word,
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here are some of the results from ''Emma'':
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;The words in the book that aren't in the word list are:
 rencontre jane's blanche woodhouses disingenuousness 
friend's venice apartment ...
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Some of these words are names and possessives. Others, like
&amp;#X201C;rencontre,&amp;#X201D; are no longer in common use. But a few are common
words that should really be in the list!

=== Exercise 6 ===
''Python provides a data structure called ''''&lt;TT&gt;set&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that provides many
common set operations. Read the documentation at
''''&lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/lib/types-set.html&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and write a program
that uses set subtraction to find words in the book that are not in
the word list.

== Random words ==
To choose a random word from the histogram, the simplest algorithm
is to build a list with multiple copies of each word, according
to the observed frequency, and then choose from the list:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def random_word(h):
    t = []
    for word, freq in h.items():
        t.extend([word] * freq)

    return random.choice(t)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The expression &lt;TT&gt;[word] * freq&lt;/TT&gt; creates a list with &lt;TT&gt;freq&lt;/TT&gt;
copies of the string &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;. The &lt;TT&gt;extend&lt;/TT&gt;
method is similar to &lt;TT&gt;append&lt;/TT&gt; except that the argument is
a sequence.

=== Exercise 7 ===
''This algorithm works, but it is not very efficient; each time you
choose a random word, it rebuilds the list, which is as big as
the original book. An obvious improvement is to build the list
once and then make multiple selections, but the list is still big.''

''An alternative is:''

*''Use ''''&lt;TT&gt;keys&lt;/TT&gt;'''' to get a list of the words in the book.''

*''Build a list that contains the cumulative sum of the word
frequencies (see Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''10.1''''). The last item
in this list is the total number of words in the book, ''''&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;''''.''

*''Choose a random number from 1 to ''''&lt;I&gt;n&lt;/I&gt;''''. Use a bisection search
(See Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''10.8'''') to find the index where the random
number would be inserted in the cumulative sum.''

*''Use the index to find the corresponding word in the word list.''

''Write a program that uses this algorithm to choose a random
word from the book.

== Markov analysis ==
If you choose words from the book at random, you can get a
sense of the vocabulary, you probably won&amp;#X2019;t get a sentence:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;this the small regard harriet which knightley's it most things
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A series of random words seldom makes sense because there
is no relationship between successive words. For example, in
a real sentence you would expect an article like &amp;#X201C;the&amp;#X201D; to
be followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb
or adverb.

One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov
analysis, which characterizes, for a given sequence of words,
the probability of the word that comes next. For example,
the song ''Eric, the Half a Bee'' begins:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Half a bee, philosophically,&lt;BR&gt;
Must, ipso facto, half not be.&lt;BR&gt;
But half the bee has got to be&lt;BR&gt;
Vis a vis, its entity. D&amp;#X2019;you see?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
But can a bee be said to be&lt;BR&gt;
Or not to be an entire bee&lt;BR&gt;
When half the bee is not a bee&lt;BR&gt;
Due to some ancient injury?&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

In this text,
the phrase &amp;#X201C;half the&amp;#X201D; is always followed by the word &amp;#X201C;bee,&amp;#X201D;
but the phrase &amp;#X201C;the bee&amp;#X201D; might be followed by either
&amp;#X201C;has&amp;#X201D; or &amp;#X201C;is&amp;#X201D;.

The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix
(like &amp;#X201C;half the&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;the bee&amp;#X201D;) to all possible suffixes
(like &amp;#X201C;has&amp;#X201D; and &amp;#X201C;is&amp;#X201D;).

Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by
starting with any prefix and choosing at random from the
possible suffixes. Next, you can combine the end of the
prefix and the new suffix to form the next prefix, and repeat.

For example, if you start with the prefix &amp;#X201C;Half a,&amp;#X201D; then the
next word has to be &amp;#X201C;bee,&amp;#X201D; because the prefix only appears
once in the text. The next prefix is &amp;#X201C;a bee,&amp;#X201D; so the
next suffix might be &amp;#X201C;philosophically,&amp;#X201D; &amp;#X201C;be&amp;#X201D; or &amp;#X201C;due.&amp;#X201D;

In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but
you can do Markov analysis with any prefix length. The length
of the prefix is called the &amp;#X201C;order&amp;#X201D; of the analysis.

=== Exercise 8 ===
Markov analysis:''

*''Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov analysis. The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes to a collection of possible suffixes. The collection might be a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your program with prefix length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy to try other lengths.''
*''Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based on the Markov analysis. Here is an example from ''Emma'' with prefix length 2:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only
amused, at such a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you
were never meant for me?&quot; &quot;I cannot make speeches, Emma:&quot; he soon cut
it all himself.
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
''For this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The result is almost syntactically correct, but not quite. Semantically, it almost makes sense, but not quite.
*''What happens if you increase the prefix length? Does the random text make more sense?''
*''Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if you analyze text from two or more books, the random text you generate will blend the vocabulary and phrases from the sources in interesting ways.''

== Data structures ==
Using Markov analysis to generate random text is fun, but there is
also a point to this exercise: data structure selection. In your
solution to the previous exercises, you had to choose:

*How to represent the prefixes.

*How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.

*How to represent the mapping from each prefix to the collection of possible suffixes.

Ok, the last one is the easy; the only mapping type we have
seen is a dictionary, so it is the natural choice.

For the prefixes, the most obvious options are string,
list of strings, or tuple of strings. For the suffixes,
one option is a list; another is a histogram (dictionary).

How should you choose? The first step is to think about
the operations you will need to implement for each data structure.
For the prefixes, we need to be able to remove words from
the beginning and add to the end. For example, if the current
prefix is &amp;#X201C;Half a,&amp;#X201D; and the next word is &amp;#X201C;bee,&amp;#X201D; you need
to be able to form the next prefix, &amp;#X201C;a bee.&amp;#X201D;

Your first choice might be a list, since it is easy to add
and remove elements, but we also need to be able to use the
prefixes as keys in a dictionary, so that rules out lists.
With tuples, you can&amp;#X2019;t append or remove, but you can use
the addition operator to form a new tuple:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def shift(prefix, word):
    return prefix[1:] + (word,)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;shift&lt;/TT&gt; takes a tuple of words, &lt;TT&gt;prefix&lt;/TT&gt;, and a string, 
&lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt;, and forms a new tuple that has all the words
in &lt;TT&gt;prefix&lt;/TT&gt; except the first, and &lt;TT&gt;word&lt;/TT&gt; added to
the end.

For the collection of suffixes, the operations we need to
perform include adding a new suffix (or increasing the frequency
of an existing one), and choosing a random suffix.

Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the list implementation
or the histogram. Choosing a random element from a list
is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do
efficiently (see Exercise&amp;#XA0;13.7).

So far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation,
but there are other factors to consider in choosing data structures.
One is run time. Sometimes there is a theoretical reason to expect
one data structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned
that the &lt;TT&gt;in&lt;/TT&gt; operator is faster for dictionaries than for lists,
at least when the number of elements is large.

But often you don&amp;#X2019;t know ahead of time which implementation will
be faster. One option is to implement both of them and see which
is better. This approach is called '''benchmarking'''. A practical
alternative is to choose the data structure that is
easiest to implement, and then see if it is fast enough for the
intended application. If so, there is no need to go on. If not,
there are tools, like the &lt;TT&gt;profile&lt;/TT&gt; module, that can identify
the places in a program that take the most time.

The other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a
histogram for the collection of suffixes might take less space because
you only have to store each word once, no matter how many times it
appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make your
program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at
all if you run out of memory. But for many applications, space is a
secondary consideration after run time.

One final thought: in this discussion, I have implied that
we should use one data structure for both analysis and generation. But
since these are separate phases, it would also be possible to use one
structure for analysis and then convert to another structure for
generation. This would be a net win if the time saved during
generation exceeded the time spent in conversion.

== Debugging ==
When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are
working on a hard bug, there are four things to try:
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''reading:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and
check that it says what you meant to say.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''running:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Experiment by making changes and running different
versions. Often if you display the right thing at the right place
in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to
spend some time to build scaffolding.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''ruminating:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; Take some time to think! What kind of error
is it: syntax, runtime, semantic? What information can you get from
the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of
error could cause the problem you&amp;#X2019;re seeing? What did you change
last, before the problem appeared?&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''retreating:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; At some point, the best thing to do is back
off, undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that
works and that you understand. Then you can starting rebuilding.&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities
and forget the others. Each activity comes with its own failure
mode.

For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a
typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual
misunderstanding. If you don&amp;#X2019;t understand what your program does, you
can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in
your head.

Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple
tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your
code, you might fall into a pattern I call &amp;#X201C;random walk programming,&amp;#X201D;
which is the process of making random changes until the program
does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming
can take a long time.

You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an
experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about
what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to
think of a test that would eliminate one of them.

Taking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking.
If you explain the problem to someone else (or even yourself), you
will sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question.

But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many
errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and
complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the
program until you get to something that works and that you
understand.

Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because
they can&amp;#X2019;t stand to delete a line of code (even if it&amp;#X2019;s wrong).
If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another file
before you start stripping it down. Then you can paste the pieces
back in a little bit at a time.

Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and
sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities,
try the others.

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 9 ===
''The &amp;#X201C;rank&amp;#X201D; of a word is its position in a list of words
sorted by frequency: the most common word has rank 1, the
second most common has rank 2, etc.''

''Zipf&amp;#X2019;s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies
of words in natural languages''&lt;SUP&gt;''1''&lt;/SUP&gt;''. Specifically, it
predicts that the frequency, ''''&lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;'''', of the word with rank ''''&lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;'''' is:''
&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display dcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;TR VALIGN=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;''&lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;c&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;''&lt;SUP&gt;''&amp;#X2212;&lt;I&gt;s&lt;/I&gt;''&lt;/SUP&gt;''&amp;#XA0;''&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
''
where ''''&lt;I&gt;s&lt;/I&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;I&gt;c&lt;/I&gt;'''' are parameters that depend on the language and the
text. If you take the logarithm of both sides of this equation, you
get:''

&lt;TABLE CLASS=&quot;display dcenter&quot;&gt;&lt;TR VALIGN=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;TD CLASS=&quot;dcell&quot;&gt;''log''''&lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;=&amp;#XA0;''''log''''&lt;I&gt;c&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;&amp;#X2212;&amp;#XA0;&lt;I&gt;s&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;''''log''''&lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#XA0;''&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
''
So if you plot ''''log''''&lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;'''' versus ''''log''''&lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;'''', you should get
a straight line with slope ''''&amp;#X2212;&lt;I&gt;s&lt;/I&gt;'''' and intercept ''''log''''&lt;I&gt;c&lt;/I&gt;''''.''

''Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts
word frequencies, and prints one line
for each word, in descending order of frequency, with
''''log''''&lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;'''' and ''''log''''&lt;I&gt;r&lt;/I&gt;''''. Use the graphing program of your
choice to plot the results and check whether they form
a straight line. Can you estimate the value of ''''&lt;I&gt;s&lt;/I&gt;''''?

== Persistence ==

Most of the programs we have seen so far are transient in the
sense that they run for a short time and produce some output,
but when they end, their data disappears. If you run the program
again, it starts with a clean slate.

Other programs are '''persistent''': they run for a long time
(or all the time); they keep at least some of their data
in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and
if they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off.

Examples of persistent programs are operating systems, which
run pretty much whenever a computer is on, and web servers,
which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in on
the network.

One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data
is by reading and writing text files. We have already seen
programs that read text files; in this chapters we will see programs
that write them.

An alternative is to store the state of the program in a database.
In this chapter I will present a simple database and a module,
&lt;TT&gt;pickle&lt;/TT&gt;, that makes it easy to store program data.

== Reading and writing ==
A text file is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent
medium like a hard drive, flash memory, or CD-ROM. We saw how
to open and read a file in Section&amp;#XA0;9.1.

To write a file, you have to open it with mode
&lt;CODE&gt;'w'&lt;/CODE&gt; as a second parameter:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fout = open('output.txt', 'w')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print fout
&amp;lt;open file 'output.txt', mode 'w' at 0xb7eb2410&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out
the old data and starts fresh, so be careful!
If the file doesn&amp;#X2019;t exist, a new one is created.

The &lt;TT&gt;write&lt;/TT&gt; method puts data into the file.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; line1 = &quot;This here's the wattle,\n&quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fout.write(line1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Again, the file object keeps track of where it is, so if
you call &lt;TT&gt;write&lt;/TT&gt; again, it adds the new data to the end.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; line2 = &quot;the emblem of our land.\n&quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fout.write(line2)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When you are done writing, you have to close the file.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fout.close()
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Format operator ==
The argument of &lt;TT&gt;write&lt;/TT&gt; has to be a string, so if we want
to put other values in a file, we have to convert them to
strings. The easiest way to do that is with &lt;TT&gt;str&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = 52
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f.write(str(x))
&lt;/PRE&gt;
An alternative is to use the '''format operator''', &lt;TT&gt;%&lt;/TT&gt;. When
applied to integers, &lt;TT&gt;%&lt;/TT&gt; is the modulus operator. But
when the first operand is a string, &lt;TT&gt;%&lt;/TT&gt; is the format operator.

The first operand is the '''format string''', and the second operand
is a tuple of expressions. The result is a string that contains
the values of the expressions, formatted according to the format
string.

As an example, the '''format sequence''' &lt;CODE&gt;'%d'&lt;/CODE&gt; means that
the first expression in the tuple should be formatted as an
integer (&lt;TT&gt;d&lt;/TT&gt; stands for &amp;#X201C;decimal&amp;#X201D;):
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; camels = 42
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; '%d' % camels
'42'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The result is the string &lt;CODE&gt;'42'&lt;/CODE&gt;, which is not to be confused
with the integer value &lt;TT&gt;42&lt;/TT&gt;.

A format sequence can appear anywhere in the format string,
so you can embed a value in a sentence:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; camels = 42
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels
'I have spotted 42 camels.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The format sequence &lt;CODE&gt;'%g'&lt;/CODE&gt; formats the next element in the tuple
as a floating-point number (don&amp;#X2019;t ask why), and &lt;CODE&gt;'%s'&lt;/CODE&gt; formats
the next item as a string:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')
'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The number of elements in the tuple has to match the number
of format sequences in the string. Also, the types of the
elements have to match the format sequences:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; '%d %d %d' % (1, 2)
TypeError: not enough arguments for format string
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; '%d' % 'dollars'
TypeError: illegal argument type for built-in operation
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In the first example, there aren&amp;#X2019;t enough elements; in the
second, the element is the wrong type.

The format operator is powerful but difficult to use. You can
read more about it at &lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html&lt;/TT&gt;.
== Filenames and paths ==
Files are organized into '''directories''' (also called &amp;#X201C;folders&amp;#X201D;).
Every running program has a &amp;#X201C;current directory,&amp;#X201D; which is the
default directory for most operations. 
For example, when you open a file for reading, Python looks for it in the
current directory.

The &lt;TT&gt;os&lt;/TT&gt; module provides functions for working with files and
directories (&amp;#X201C;os&amp;#X201D; stands for &amp;#X201C;operating system&amp;#X201D;). &lt;TT&gt;os.getcwd&lt;/TT&gt;
returns the name of the current directory:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import os
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cwd = os.getcwd()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print cwd
/home/dinsdale
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;cwd&lt;/TT&gt; stands for &amp;#X201C;current working directory.&amp;#X201D; The result in
this example is &lt;TT&gt;/home/dinsdale&lt;/TT&gt;, which is the home directory of a
user named &lt;TT&gt;dinsdale&lt;/TT&gt;.

A string like &lt;TT&gt;cwd&lt;/TT&gt; that identifies a file is called a '''path'''.
A '''relative path''' starts from the current directory;
an '''absolute path''' starts from the topmost directory in the
file system.

The paths we have seen so far are simple filenames, so they are
relative to the current directory. To find the absolute path to
a file, you can use &lt;TT&gt;os.path.abspath&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; os.path.abspath('memo.txt')
'/home/dinsdale/memo.txt'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;os.path.exists&lt;/TT&gt; checks
whether a file or directory exists:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; os.path.exists('memo.txt')
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If it exists, &lt;TT&gt;os.path.isdir&lt;/TT&gt; checks whether it&amp;#X2019;s a directory:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; os.path.isdir('memo.txt')
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; os.path.isdir('music')
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Similarly, &lt;TT&gt;os.path.isfile&lt;/TT&gt; checks whether it&amp;#X2019;s a file.

&lt;TT&gt;os.listdir&lt;/TT&gt; returns a list of the files (and other directories)
in the given directory:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; os.listdir(cwd)
['music', 'photos', 'memo.txt']
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To demonstrate these functions, the following example
&amp;#X201C;walks&amp;#X201D; through a directory, prints
the names of all the files, and calls itself recursively on
all the directories.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def walk(dir):
    for name in os.listdir(dir):
        path = os.path.join(dir, name)

        if os.path.isfile(path):
            print path
        else:
            walk(path)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;TT&gt;os.path.join&lt;/TT&gt; takes a directory and a file name and joins
them into a complete path.

=== Exercise 1 ===
Modify ''''&lt;TT&gt;walk&lt;/TT&gt;'''' so that instead of printing the names of
the files, it returns a list of names.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;2'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
The ''''&lt;TT&gt;os&lt;/TT&gt;'''' module provides a function called ''''&lt;TT&gt;walk&lt;/TT&gt;''''
that is similar to this one but more versatile. Read
the documentation and use it to print the names of the
files in a given directory and its subdirectories.

== Catching exceptions ==
A lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write
files. If you try to open a file that doesn&amp;#X2019;t exist, you get an
&lt;TT&gt;IOError&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fin = open('bad_file')
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'bad_file'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you don&amp;#X2019;t have permission to access a file:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fout = open('/etc/passwd', 'w')
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/passwd'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And if you try to open a directory for reading, you get
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fin = open('/home')
IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To avoid these errors, you could use functions like &lt;TT&gt;os.path.exists&lt;/TT&gt;
and &lt;TT&gt;os.path.isfile&lt;/TT&gt;, but it would take a lot of time and code
to check all the possibilities (if &amp;#X201C;&lt;TT&gt;Errno 21&lt;/TT&gt;&amp;#X201D; is any
indication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong).

It is better to go ahead and try, and deal with problems if they
happen, which is exactly what the &lt;TT&gt;try&lt;/TT&gt; statement does. The
syntax is similar to an &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statement:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;try:    
    fin = open('bad_file')
    for line in fin:
        print line
    fin.close()
except:
    print 'Something went wrong.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Python starts by executing the &lt;TT&gt;try&lt;/TT&gt; clause. If all goes
well, it skips the &lt;TT&gt;except&lt;/TT&gt; clause and proceeds. If an
exception occurs, it jumps out of the &lt;TT&gt;try&lt;/TT&gt; clause and
executes the &lt;TT&gt;except&lt;/TT&gt; clause.

Handling an exception with a &lt;TT&gt;try&lt;/TT&gt; statement is called '''catching''' an exception. In this example, the &lt;TT&gt;except&lt;/TT&gt; clause
prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general,
catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try
again, or at least end the program gracefully.

== Databases ==
A '''database''' is a file that is organized for storing data.
Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense
that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference
is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage),
so it persists after the program ends.

The module &lt;TT&gt;anydbm&lt;/TT&gt; provides an interface for creating
and updating database files. As an example, I&amp;#X2019;ll create a database
that contains captions for image files.

Opening a database is similar
to opening other files:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import anydbm
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; db = anydbm.open('captions.db', 'c')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The mode &lt;CODE&gt;'c'&lt;/CODE&gt; means that the database should be created if
it doesn&amp;#X2019;t already exist. The result is a database object
that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.
If you create a new item, &lt;TT&gt;anydbm&lt;/TT&gt; updates the database file.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When you access one of the items, &lt;TT&gt;anydbm&lt;/TT&gt; reads the file:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print db['cleese.png']
Photo of John Cleese.
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you make another assignment to an existing key, &lt;TT&gt;anydbm&lt;/TT&gt; replaces
the old value:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print db['cleese.png']
Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Many dictionary methods, like &lt;TT&gt;keys&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;items&lt;/TT&gt;, also
work with database objects. So does iteration with a &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt;
statement.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;for key in db:
     print key
&lt;/PRE&gt;
As with other files, you should close the database when you are
done:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; db.close()
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Pickling ==
A limitation of &lt;TT&gt;anydbm&lt;/TT&gt; is that the keys and values have
to be strings. If you try to use any other type, you get an
error.

The &lt;TT&gt;pickle&lt;/TT&gt; module can help. It translates
almost any type of object into a string suitable for storage in a
database, and then translates strings back into objects.

&lt;TT&gt;pickle.dumps&lt;/TT&gt; takes an object as a parameter and returns
a string representation (&lt;TT&gt;dumps&lt;/TT&gt; is short for &amp;#X201C;dump string&amp;#X201D;):
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import pickle
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pickle.dumps(t)
'(lp0\nI1\naI2\naI3\na.'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The format isn&amp;#X2019;t obvious to human readers; it is meant to be
easy for &lt;TT&gt;pickle&lt;/TT&gt; to interpret. &lt;TT&gt;pickle.loads&lt;/TT&gt;
(&amp;#X201C;load string&amp;#X201D;) reconstitutes the object:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t1 = [1, 2, 3]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = pickle.dumps(t1)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 = pickle.loads(s)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print t2
[1, 2, 3]
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Although the new object has the same value as the old, it is
not (in general) the same object:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t == t2
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t is t2
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In other words, pickling and then unpickling has the same effect
as copying the object.

You can use &lt;TT&gt;pickle&lt;/TT&gt; to store non-strings in a database.
In fact, this combination is so common that it has been
encapsulated in a module called &lt;TT&gt;shelve&lt;/TT&gt;. 

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;3'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;
''
''

''If you did Exercise&amp;#XA0;''''12.4'''', modify your solution so that
it creates a database that maps from each word in the list to
a list of words that use the same set of letters.''

''Write a different program that opens the database and prints
the contents in a human-readable format.
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Pipes ==
Most operating systems provide a command-line interface,
also known as a '''shell'''. Shells usually provide commands
to navigate the file system and launch applications. For
example, in Unix, you can change directories with &lt;TT&gt;cd&lt;/TT&gt;,
display the contents of a directory with &lt;TT&gt;ls&lt;/TT&gt;, and launch
a web browser by typing (for example) &lt;TT&gt;firefox&lt;/TT&gt;.

Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be
launched from Python using a '''pipe'''. A pipe is an object
that represents a running process.

For example, the Unix command &lt;TT&gt;ls -l&lt;/TT&gt; normally displays the
contents of the current directory (in long format). You can
launch &lt;TT&gt;ls&lt;/TT&gt; with &lt;TT&gt;os.popen&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cmd = 'ls -l'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fp = os.popen(cmd)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The argument is a string that contains a shell command. The
return value is a file pointer that behaves just like an open
file. You can read the output from the &lt;TT&gt;ls&lt;/TT&gt; process one
line at a time with &lt;TT&gt;readline&lt;/TT&gt; or get the whole thing at
once with &lt;TT&gt;read&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; res = fp.read()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When you are done, you close the pipe like a file:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stat = fp.close()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print stat
None
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The return value is the final status of the &lt;TT&gt;ls&lt;/TT&gt; process;
&lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt; means that it ended normally (with no errors).

A common use of pipes is to read a compressed file incrementally;
that is, without uncompressing the whole thing at once. The
following function takes the name of a compressed file as a
parameter and returns a pipe that uses &lt;TT&gt;gzip&lt;/TT&gt; to decompress
the contents:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def open_gzip(filename):
    cmd = 'gunzip -c ' + filename
    fp = os.popen(cmd)
    return fp
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you read lines from &lt;TT&gt;fp&lt;/TT&gt; one at a time, you never have
to store the uncompressed file in memory or on disk.

== Writing modules ==
Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module.
For example, suppose you have a file named &lt;TT&gt;wc.py&lt;/TT&gt; with the following
code:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def linecount(filename):
    count = 0
    for line in open(filename):
        count += 1
    return count

print linecount('wc.py')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number
of lines in the file, which is 7.
You can also import it like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import wc
7
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Now you have a module object &lt;TT&gt;wc&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print wc
&amp;lt;module 'wc' from 'wc.py'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
That provides a function called &lt;CODE&gt;linecount&lt;/CODE&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; wc.linecount('wc.py')
7
&lt;/PRE&gt;
So that&amp;#X2019;s how you write modules in Python.

The only problem with this example is that when you import
the module it executes the test code at the bottom. Normally
when you import a module, it defines new functions but it
doesn&amp;#X2019;t execute them.

Programs that will be imported as modules often
use the following idiom:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;if __name__ == '__main__':
    print linecount('wc.py')
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;__name__&lt;/CODE&gt; is a built-in variable that is set when the
program starts. If the program is running as a script,
&lt;CODE&gt;__name__&lt;/CODE&gt; has the value &lt;CODE&gt;__main__&lt;/CODE&gt;; in that
case, the test code is executed. Otherwise,
if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;4'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Type this example into a file named ''''&lt;TT&gt;wc.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and run
it as a script. Then run the Python interpreter and
''''&lt;TT&gt;import wc&lt;/TT&gt;''''. What is the value of ''&lt;CODE&gt;''__name__''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
when the module is being imported?''
''Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported,
Python does nothing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has
changed.''

''If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function 
''''&lt;TT&gt;reload&lt;/TT&gt;'''', but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is
restart the interpreter and then import the module again.
''
&lt;/DIV&gt;

== Debugging ==
When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems
with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces,
tabs and newlines are normally invisible:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = '1 2\t 3\n 4'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print s
1 2  3
 4
&lt;/PRE&gt;

The built-in function &lt;TT&gt;repr&lt;/TT&gt; can help. It takes any object as an
argument and returns a string representation of the object. For
strings, it represents whitespace
characters with backslash sequences:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print repr(s)
'1 2\t 3\n 4'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This can be helpful for debugging.

One other problem you might run into is that different systems
use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some
systems use a newline, represented &lt;CODE&gt;\n&lt;/CODE&gt;. Others use
a return character, represented &lt;CODE&gt;\r&lt;/CODE&gt;. Some use both.
If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies
might cause problems.

For most systems, there are applications to convert from one
format to another. You can find them (and read more about this
issue) at &lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline&lt;/TT&gt;. Or, of course, you
could write one yourself.

process the file. The arguments are a filename, a function
object and an optional number of lines to process. Here is

== User-defined types ==
We have used many of Python&amp;#X2019;s built-in types; now we are going
to define a new type. As an example, we will create a type
called &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt; that represents a point in two-dimensional
space.

In mathematical notation, points are often written in
parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example,
(0, 0) represents the origin, and (&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;) represents the
point &lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt; units to the right and &lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt; units up from the origin.

There are several ways we might represent points in Python:

*We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;.
*We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.
*We could create a new type to represent points as objects.

Creating a new type
is (a little) more complicated than the other options, but
it has advantages that will be apparent soon.

A user-defined type is also called a '''class'''.
A class definition looks like this:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Point(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;represents a point in 2-D space&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This header indicates that the new class is a &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt;,
which is a kind of &lt;TT&gt;object&lt;/TT&gt;, which is a built-in
type.

The body is a docstring that explains what the class is for.
You can define variables and functions inside a class definition,
but we will get back to that later.

Defining a class named &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt; creates a class object.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print Point
&amp;lt;class '__main__.Point'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Because &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt; is defined at the top level, its &amp;#X201C;full
name&amp;#X201D; is &lt;CODE&gt;__main__.Point&lt;/CODE&gt;.

The class object is like a factory for creating objects. To create a
Point, you call &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt; as if it were a function.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blank = Point()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print blank
&amp;lt;__main__.Point instance at 0xb7e9d3ac&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The return value is a reference to a Point object, which we
assign to &lt;TT&gt;blank&lt;/TT&gt;. 
Creating a new object is called
'''instantiation''', and the object is an '''instance''' of
the class.

When you print an instance, Python tells you what class it
belongs to and where it is stored in memory (the prefix
&lt;TT&gt;0x&lt;/TT&gt; means that the following number is in hexadecimal).

== Attributes ==
You can assign values to an instance using dot notation:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blank.x = 3.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blank.y = 4.0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a
module, such as &lt;TT&gt;math.pi&lt;/TT&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;string.whitespace&lt;/TT&gt;. In this case,
though, we are assigning values to named elements of an object.
These elements are called '''attributes'''.

As a noun, &amp;#X201C;AT-trib-ute&amp;#X201D; is pronounced with emphasis on the first
syllable, as opposed to &amp;#X201C;a-TRIB-ute,&amp;#X201D; which is a verb.

The following diagram shows the result of these assignments.
A state diagram that shows an object and its attributes is
called an '''object diagram''':

[[Image:book022.png]]

The variable &lt;TT&gt;blank&lt;/TT&gt; refers to a Point object, which
contains two attributes. Each attribute refers to a
floating-point number.

You can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print blank.y
4.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = blank.x
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print x
3.0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The expression &lt;TT&gt;blank.x&lt;/TT&gt; means, &amp;#X201C;Go to the object &lt;TT&gt;blank&lt;/TT&gt;
refers to and get the value of &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;.&amp;#X201D; In this case, we assign that
value to a variable named &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;. There is no conflict between
the variable &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; and the attribute &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;.

You can use dot notation as part of any expression. For example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print '(%g, %g)' % (blank.x, blank.y)
(3.0, 4.0)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; distance = math.sqrt(blank.x**2 + blank.y**2)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print distance
5.0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way.
For example:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def print_point(p):
    print '(%g, %g)' % (p.x, p.y)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;print_point&lt;/CODE&gt; takes a point as an argument and displays it in
mathematical notation. To invoke it, you can pass &lt;TT&gt;blank&lt;/TT&gt; as
an argument:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_point(blank)
(3.0, 4.0)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Inside the function, &lt;TT&gt;p&lt;/TT&gt; is an alias for &lt;TT&gt;blank&lt;/TT&gt;, so if
the function modifies &lt;TT&gt;p&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;blank&lt;/TT&gt; changes.

=== Exercise 1 ===
Write a function called ''''&lt;TT&gt;distance&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that it takes two Points
as arguments and returns the distance between them.

== Rectangles ==
Sometimes it is obvious what the attributes of an object should be,
but other times you have to make decisions. For example, imagine you
are designing a class to represent rectangles. What attributes would
you use to specify the location and size of a rectangle? You can
ignore angle; to keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is
either vertical or horizontal.

There are at least two possibilities: 

*You could specify one corner of the rectangle (or the center), the width, and the height.
*You could specify two opposing corners.

At this point it is hard to say whether either is better than
the other, so we&amp;#X2019;ll implement the first one, just as an example.

Here is the class definition:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Rectangle(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;represent a rectangle. 
       attributes: width, height, corner.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The docstring lists the attributes: &lt;TT&gt;width&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;height&lt;/TT&gt; are numbers; &lt;TT&gt;corner&lt;/TT&gt; is a Point object that
specifies the lower-left corner.

To represent a rectangle, you have to instantiate a Rectangle
object and assign values to the attributes:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;box = Rectangle()
box.width = 100.0
box.height = 200.0
box.corner = Point()
box.corner.x = 0.0
box.corner.y = 0.0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The expression &lt;TT&gt;box.corner.x&lt;/TT&gt; means,
&amp;#X201C;Go to the object &lt;TT&gt;box&lt;/TT&gt; refers to and select the attribute named
&lt;TT&gt;corner&lt;/TT&gt;; then go to that object and select the attribute named
&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;.&amp;#X201D;

The figure shows the state of this object:

[[Image:book023.png]]
An object that is an attribute of another object is '''embedded'''.

== Instances as return values ==
Functions can return instances. For example, &lt;CODE&gt;find_center&lt;/CODE&gt;
takes a &lt;TT&gt;Rectangle&lt;/TT&gt; as an argument and returns a &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt;
that contains the coordinates of the center of the &lt;TT&gt;Rectangle&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def find_center(box):
    p = Point()
    p.x = box.corner.x + box.width/2.0
    p.y = box.corner.y + box.height/2.0
    return p
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here is an example that passes &lt;TT&gt;box&lt;/TT&gt; as an argument and assigns
the resulting Point to &lt;TT&gt;center&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; center = find_center(box)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_point(center)
(50.0, 100.0)
&lt;/PRE&gt;

== Objects are mutable ==
You can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of
its attributes. For example, to change the size of a rectangle
without changing its position, you can modify the values of &lt;TT&gt;width&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;height&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;box.width = box.width + 50
box.height = box.height + 100
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can also write functions that modify objects. For example,
&lt;CODE&gt;grow_rectangle&lt;/CODE&gt; takes a Rectangle object and two numbers,
&lt;TT&gt;dwidth&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;dheight&lt;/TT&gt;, and adds the numbers to the
width and height of the rectangle:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def grow_rectangle(rect, dwidth, dheight) :
    rect.width += dwidth
    rect.height += dheight
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here is an example that demonstrates the effect:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print box.width
100.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print box.height
200.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; grow_rectangle(box, 50, 100)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print box.width
150.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print box.height
300.0
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Inside the function, &lt;TT&gt;rect&lt;/TT&gt; is an
alias for &lt;TT&gt;box&lt;/TT&gt;, so if the function modifies &lt;TT&gt;rect&lt;/TT&gt;, 
&lt;TT&gt;box&lt;/TT&gt; changes.

=== Exercise 2 ===
Write a function named ''&lt;CODE&gt;''move_rectangle''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes
a Rectangle and two numbers named ''''&lt;TT&gt;dx&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;dy&lt;/TT&gt;''''. It
should change the location of the rectangle by adding ''''&lt;TT&gt;dx&lt;/TT&gt;''''
to the ''''&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;'''' coordinate of ''''&lt;TT&gt;corner&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and adding ''''&lt;TT&gt;dy&lt;/TT&gt;''''
to the ''''&lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;'''' coordinate of ''''&lt;TT&gt;corner&lt;/TT&gt;''''.

== Copying ==
Aliasing can make a program difficult to read because changes
in one place might have unexpected effects in another place.
It is hard to keep track of all the variables that might refer
to a given object.

Copying an object is often an alternative to aliasing.
The &lt;TT&gt;copy&lt;/TT&gt; module contains a function called &lt;TT&gt;copy&lt;/TT&gt; that
can duplicate any object:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p1 = Point()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p1.x = 3.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p1.y = 4.0

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import copy
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p2 = copy.copy(p1)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;p1&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;p2&lt;/TT&gt; contain the same data, but they are
not the same Point.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_point(p1)
(3.0, 4.0)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_point(p2)
(3.0, 4.0)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p1 is p2
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p1 == p2
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The &lt;TT&gt;is&lt;/TT&gt; operator indicates that &lt;TT&gt;p1&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;p2&lt;/TT&gt; are not the
same object, which is what we expected. But you might have expected
&lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt; to yield &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; because these points contain the same
data. In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for
instances, the default behavior of the &lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt; operator is the same
as the &lt;TT&gt;is&lt;/TT&gt; operator; it checks object identity, not object
equivalence. This behavior can be changed&amp;#X2014;we&amp;#X2019;ll see how later.

If you use &lt;TT&gt;copy.copy&lt;/TT&gt; to duplicate a Rectangle, you will find
that it copies the Rectangle object but not the embedded Point.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; box2 = copy.copy(box)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; box2 is box
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; box2.corner is box.corner
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here is what the object diagram looks like:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book024.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;

This operation is called a '''shallow copy''' because it copies the
object and any references it contains, but not the embedded objects.

For most applications, this is not what you want. In this example,
invoking &lt;CODE&gt;grow_rectangle&lt;/CODE&gt; on one of the Rectangles would not
affect the other, but invoking &lt;CODE&gt;move_rectangle&lt;/CODE&gt; on either would
affect both! This behavior is confusing and error-prone.

Fortunately, the &lt;TT&gt;copy&lt;/TT&gt; module contains a method named &lt;TT&gt;deepcopy&lt;/TT&gt; that copies not only the object but also 
the objects it refers to, and the objects ''they'' refer to,
and so on.
You will not be surprised to learn that this operation is
called a '''deep copy'''.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; box3 = copy.deepcopy(box)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; box3 is box
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; box3.corner is box.corner
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;box3&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;box&lt;/TT&gt; are completely separate objects.

=== Exercise 3 ===
Write a version of ''&lt;CODE&gt;''move_rectangle''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that creates and
returns a new Rectangle instead of modifying the old one.

== Debugging ==
When you start working with objects, you are likely to encounter
some new exceptions. If you try to access an attribute
that doesn&amp;#X2019;t exist, you get an &lt;TT&gt;AttributeError&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p = Point()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print p.z
AttributeError: Point instance has no attribute 'z'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you are not sure what type an object is, you can ask:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(p)
&amp;lt;type '__main__.Point'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute,
you can use the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;hasattr&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hasattr(p, 'x')
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hasattr(p, 'z')
False
&lt;/PRE&gt;

The first argument can be any object; the second argument is a ''string'' that contains the name of the attribute.

== Exercises ==
=== Exercise 4 ===
''&lt;TT&gt;World.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which is part of Swampy (see Chapter&amp;#XA0;''''4''''),
contains a class definition for a user-defined type called 
''''&lt;TT&gt;World&lt;/TT&gt;''''. If you run this code:''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''from World import *
world = World()
wait_for_user()
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''A window should appear with a title bar and an empty square.
In this exercise we will use this window to draw Points,
Rectangles and other shapes. 
Add the following lines before
''&lt;CODE&gt;''wait_for_user''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' and run the program again''

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''canvas = world.ca(width=500, height=500, background='white')
bbox = [[-150,-100], [150, 100]]
canvas.rectangle(bbox, outline='black', width=2, fill='green4')
''&lt;/PRE&gt;
''You should see a green rectangle with a black outline.
The first line creates a Canvas, which appears in the window
as a white square. The Canvas object provides methods like
''''&lt;TT&gt;rectangle&lt;/TT&gt;'''' for drawing various shapes.''

''&lt;TT&gt;bbox&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is a list of lists that represents the &amp;#X201C;bounding box&amp;#X201D;
of the rectangle. The first pair of coordinates is the lower-left
corner of the rectangle; the second pair is the upper-right corner.''

''You can draw a circle like this:''
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;''canvas.circle([-25,0], 70, outline=None, fill='red')
''&lt;/PRE&gt;

''The first parameter is the coordinate pair for the center of the
circle; the second parameter is the radius.''

''If you add this line to the program, 
the result should resemble the national flag of Bangladesh
(see ''''&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign-state_flags&lt;/TT&gt;'''').''

== Time ==

As another example of a user-defined type, we'll define a class called
&lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; that records the time of day. The class definition looks
like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Time(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;represents the time of day.
       attributes: hour, minute, second&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can create a new &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; object and assign
attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
time = Time()
time.hour = 11
time.minute = 59
time.second = 30
&lt;/source&gt;

The state diagram for the &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; object looks like this:


&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book025.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;

=== Exercise 1 ===

Write a function called &lt;code&gt;print_time&lt;/code&gt; that takes a 
Time object and prints it in the form &lt;code&gt;hour:minute:second&lt;/code&gt;.

Hint: the format sequence &lt;code&gt;%.2d&lt;/code&gt; prints an integer using
at least two digits, including a leading zero if necessary.

=== Exercise 2 ===

Write a boolean function called &lt;code&gt;is_after&lt;/code&gt; that
takes two Time objects, &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;t2&lt;/code&gt;, and
returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt; follows &lt;code&gt;t2&lt;/code&gt;
chronologically and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. 

Challenge: don't use an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.

== Pure functions ==

In the next few sections, we&amp;#X2019;ll write two functions that add time
values. They demonstrate two kinds of functions: pure functions and
modifiers. They also demonstrate a development plan I&amp;#X2019;ll call '''prototype and patch''', which is a way of tackling a complex problem
by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with the
complications.

Here is a simple prototype of &lt;CODE&gt;add_time&lt;/CODE&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second
    return sum
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The function creates a new &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; object, initializes its
attributes, and returns a reference to the new object. This is called
a '''pure function''' because it does not modify any of the objects
passed to it as arguments and it has no effect,
like displaying a value or getting user input, 
other than returning a value.

To test this function, I&amp;#X2019;ll create two Time objects: &lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt;
contains the start time of a movie, like ''Monty Python and the
Holy Grail'', and &lt;TT&gt;duration&lt;/TT&gt; contains the run time of the movie,
which is one hour 35 minutes.

&lt;CODE&gt;add_time&lt;/CODE&gt; figures out when the movie will be done.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start = Time()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.hour = 9
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.minute = 45
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.second =  0

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; duration = Time()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; duration.hour = 1
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; duration.minute = 35
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; duration.second = 0

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; done = add_time(start, duration)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_time(done)
10:80:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The result, &lt;TT&gt;10:80:00&lt;/TT&gt; might not be what you were hoping
for. The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the
number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty. When that
happens, we have to &amp;#X201C;carry&amp;#X201D; the extra seconds into the minute column
or the extra minutes into the hour column.

Here&amp;#X2019;s an improved version:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second

    if sum.second &amp;gt;= 60:
        sum.second -= 60
        sum.minute += 1

    if sum.minute &amp;gt;= 60:
        sum.minute -= 60
        sum.hour += 1

    return sum
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Although this function is correct, it is starting to get big.
We will see a shorter alternative later.

== Modifiers ==
Sometimes it is useful for a function to modify the objects it gets as
parameters. In that case, the changes are visible to the caller.
Functions that work this way are called '''modifiers'''.

&lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;, which adds a given number of seconds to a &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt;
object, can be written naturally as a
modifier. Here is a rough draft:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def increment(time, seconds):
    time.second += seconds

    if time.second &amp;gt;= 60:
        time.second -= 60
        time.minute += 1

    if time.minute &amp;gt;= 60:
        time.minute -= 60
        time.hour += 1
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals
with the special cases we saw before.

Is this function correct? What happens if the parameter &lt;TT&gt;seconds&lt;/TT&gt;
is much greater than sixty? 

In that case, it is not enough to carry
once; we have to keep doing it until &lt;TT&gt;time.second&lt;/TT&gt; is less than sixty.
One solution is to replace the &lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt; statements with &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt;
statements. That would make the function correct, but not
very efficient.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;3'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a correct version of ''''&lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that
doesn&amp;#X2019;t contain any loops.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;
Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure
functions. In fact, some programming languages only allow pure
functions. There is some evidence that programs that use pure
functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs
that use modifiers. But modifiers are convenient at times,
and functional programs tend to be less efficient.

In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is
reasonable and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling
advantage. This approach might be called a '''functional
programming style'''.

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;4'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a &amp;#X201C;pure&amp;#X201D; version of ''''&lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that creates and returns
a new Time object rather than modifying the parameter.

== Prototyping versus planning ==
The development plan I am demonstrating is called &amp;#X201C;prototype and
patch.&amp;#X201D; For each function, I wrote a prototype that performed the
basic calculation and then tested it, patching errors along the
way.

This approach can be effective, especially if you don&amp;#X2019;t yet have a
deep understanding of the problem. But incremental corrections can
generate code that is unnecessarily complicated&amp;#X2014;since it deals with
many special cases&amp;#X2014;and unreliable&amp;#X2014;since it is hard to know if you
have found all the errors.

An alternative is '''planned development''', in which high-level
insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. In
this case, the insight is that a Time object is really a three-digit
number in base 60 (see &lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal&lt;/TT&gt;)! The
&lt;TT&gt;second&lt;/TT&gt; attribute is the &amp;#X201C;ones column,&amp;#X201D; the &lt;TT&gt;minute&lt;/TT&gt;
attribute is the &amp;#X201C;sixties column,&amp;#X201D; and the &lt;TT&gt;hour&lt;/TT&gt; attribute is
the &amp;#X201C;thirty-six hundreds column.&amp;#X201D;

When we wrote &lt;CODE&gt;add_time&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;, we were effectively
doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one
column to the next.

This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem&amp;#X2014;we
can convert Time objects to integers and take advantage of the fact
that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic. 

Here is a function that converts Times to integers:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def time_to_int(time):
    minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute
    seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second
    return seconds
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And here is the function that converts integers to Times
(recall that &lt;TT&gt;divmod&lt;/TT&gt; divides the first argument by the second
and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def int_to_time(seconds):
    time = Time()
    minutes, time.second = divmod(seconds, 60)
    time.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)
    return time
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince
yourself that these functions are correct. One way to test them is to
check that &lt;CODE&gt;time_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x&lt;/CODE&gt; for many values of
&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;. This is an example of a consistency check.

Once you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to 
rewrite &lt;CODE&gt;add_time&lt;/CODE&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def add_time(t1, t2):
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;5'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Rewrite ''''&lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;'''' using ''&lt;CODE&gt;''time_to_int''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' and ''&lt;CODE&gt;''int_to_time''&lt;/CODE&gt;''.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;
In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder
than just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our
intuition for dealing with time values is better.

But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make
the investment of writing the conversion functions (&lt;CODE&gt;time_to_int&lt;/CODE&gt;
and &lt;CODE&gt;int_to_time&lt;/CODE&gt;), we get a program that is shorter, easier to
read and debug, and more reliable.

It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine
subtracting two Times to find the duration between them. The
na&amp;#XEF;ve approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing.
Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be
correct.

Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it
easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities
for error).

== Debugging ==
A Time object is well-formed if the values of &lt;TT&gt;minutes&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;seconds&lt;/TT&gt; are between 0 and 60 (including 0 but not 60) and if 
&lt;TT&gt;hours&lt;/TT&gt; is positive. &lt;TT&gt;hours&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;minutes&lt;/TT&gt; should be
integral values, but we might allow &lt;TT&gt;seconds&lt;/TT&gt; to have a
fraction part.

These kind of requirements are called '''invariants''' because
they should always be true. To put it a different way, if they
are not true, then something has gone wrong.

Writing code to check your invariants can help you detect errors
and find their causes. For example, you might have a function
like &lt;CODE&gt;valid_time&lt;/CODE&gt; that takes a Time object and returns
&lt;TT&gt;False&lt;/TT&gt; if it violates an invariant:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def valid_time(time):
    if time.hours &amp;lt; 0 or time.minutes &amp;lt; 0 or time.seconds &amp;lt; 0:
        return False
    if time.minutes &amp;gt;= 60 or time.seconds &amp;gt;= 60:
        return False
    return True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Then at the beginning of each function you could check the
arguments to make sure they are valid:



&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def add_time(t1, t2):
    if not valid_time(t1) or not valid_time(t2):
        raise ValueError, 'invalid Time object in add_time'
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Or you could use an &lt;TT&gt;assert&lt;/TT&gt; statement, which checks a given invariant
and raises an exception if it fails:



&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def add_time(t1, t2):
    assert valid_time(t1) and valid_time(t2)
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;assert&lt;/TT&gt; statements are useful because they distinguish
code that deals with normal conditions from code
that checks for errors.

== Object-oriented features ==

Python is an '''object-oriented programming language''', which means
that it provides features that support object-oriented
programming.

It is not easy to define object-oriented programming, but we have
already seen some of its characteristics:

*Programs are made up of object definitions and function
definitions, and most of the computation is expressed in terms
of operations on objects.

*Each object definition corresponds to some object or concept
in the real world, and the functions that operate on that object
correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.

For example, the &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; class defined in Chapter&amp;#XA0;16
corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the
functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with
times. Similarly, the &lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;Rectangle&lt;/TT&gt; classes
correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.

So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to
support object-oriented programming. These
features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide
alternative syntax for things we have already done. But in many cases,
the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the
structure of the program.

For example, in the &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; program, there is no obvious
connection between the class definition and the function definitions
that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that every function
takes at least one &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; object as an argument.

This observation is the motivation for '''methods'''; a method is
a function that is associated with a particular class.
We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples.
In this chapter, we will define methods for user-defined types.

Methods are semantically the same as functions, but there are
two syntactic differences:

*Methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.
*The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.

In the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous
two chapters and transform them into methods. This transformation is
purely mechanical; you can do it simply by following a sequence of
steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form to another,
you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.

== Printing objects ==
In Chapter&amp;#XA0;16, we defined a class named
&lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; and in Exercise&amp;#XA0;16.1, you 
wrote a function named &lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Time(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;represents the time of day.
       attributes: hour, minute, second&quot;&quot;&quot;

def print_time(time):
    print '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To call this function, you have to pass a &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; object as an
argument:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start = Time()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.hour = 9
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.minute = 45
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.second = 00
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print_time(start)
09:45:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To make &lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt; a method, all we have to do is
move the function definition inside the class definition. Notice
the change in indentation.

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Time(object):
    def print_time(time):
        print '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Now there are two ways to call &lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt;. The first
(and less common) way is to use function syntax:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Time.print_time(start)
09:45:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this use of dot notation, &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; is the name of the class,
and &lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt; is the name of the method. &lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt; is
passed as a parameter.

The second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.print_time()
09:45:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In this use of dot notation, &lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt; is the name of the
method (again), and &lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt; is the object the method is
invoked on, which is called the '''subject'''. Just as the
subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about, the subject
of a method invocation is what the method is about.

Inside the method, the subject is assigned to the first
parameter, so in this case &lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt; is assigned
to &lt;TT&gt;time&lt;/TT&gt;.

By convention, the first parameter of a method is
called &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt;, so it would be more common to write
&lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt; like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Time(object):
    def print_time(self):
        print '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The reason for this convention is an implicit metaphor:

*The syntax for a function call, &lt;CODE&gt;print_time(start)&lt;/CODE&gt;,
suggests that the function is the active agent. It says something
like, &amp;#X201C;Hey &lt;CODE&gt;print_time&lt;/CODE&gt;! Here&amp;#X2019;s an object for you to print.&amp;#X201D;

*In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active
agents. A method invocation like &lt;CODE&gt;start.print_time()&lt;/CODE&gt; says
&amp;#X201C;Hey &lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt;! Please print yourself.&amp;#X201D;

This change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious
that it is useful. In the examples we have seen so far, it may not
be. But sometimes shifting responsibility from the functions onto the
objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions, and makes
it easier to maintain and reuse code.

=== Exercise 1 ===
Rewrite ''&lt;CODE&gt;''time_to_int''&lt;/CODE&gt;''
(from Section&amp;#XA0;''''16.4'''') as a method. It is probably not
appropriate to rewrite ''&lt;CODE&gt;''int_to_time''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' as a method; it&amp;#X2019;s not
clear what object you would invoke it on!

== Another example ==
Here&amp;#X2019;s a version of &lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt; (from Section&amp;#XA0;16.3)
rewritten as a method:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This version assumes that &lt;CODE&gt;time_to_int&lt;/CODE&gt; is written
as a method, as in Exercise&amp;#XA0;17.1. Also, note that
it is a pure function, not a modifier.

Here&amp;#X2019;s how you would invoke &lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start.print_time()
09:45:00
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; end = start.increment(1337)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; end.print_time()
10:07:17
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The subject, &lt;TT&gt;start&lt;/TT&gt;, gets assigned to the first parameter,
&lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt;. The argument, &lt;TT&gt;1337&lt;/TT&gt;, gets assigned to the
second parameter, &lt;TT&gt;seconds&lt;/TT&gt;.

This mechanism can be confusing, especially if you make an error.
For example, if you invoke &lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt; with two arguments, you
get:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; end = start.increment(1337, 460)
TypeError: increment() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The error message is initially confusing, because there are
only two arguments in parentheses. But the subject is also
considered an argument, so all together that&amp;#X2019;s three.

== A more complicated example ==
&lt;CODE&gt;is_after&lt;/CODE&gt; (from Exercise&amp;#XA0;16.2) is slightly more complicated
because it takes two Time objects as parameters. In this case it is
conventional to name the first parameter &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt; and the second
parameter &lt;TT&gt;other&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def is_after(self, other):
        return self.time_to_int() &amp;gt; other.time_to_int()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
To use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass
the other as an argument:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; end.is_after(start)
True
&lt;/PRE&gt;
One nice thing about this syntax is that it almost reads
like English: &amp;#X201C;end is after start?&amp;#X201D;

== The init method ==
The init method (short for &amp;#X201C;initialization&amp;#X201D;) is
a special method that gets invoked when an object is instantiated. 
Its full name is &lt;CODE&gt;__init__&lt;/CODE&gt; (two underscore characters,
followed by &lt;TT&gt;init&lt;/TT&gt;, and then two more underscores). An
init method for the &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; class might look like this:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second
&lt;/PRE&gt;
It is common for the parameters of &lt;CODE&gt;__init__&lt;/CODE&gt;
to have the same names as the attributes. The statement
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;        self.hour = hour
&lt;/PRE&gt;
stores the value of the parameter &lt;TT&gt;hour&lt;/TT&gt; as an attribute
of &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt;.

The parameters are optional, so if you call &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; with
no arguments, you get the default values.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time = Time()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time.print_time()
00:00:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you provide one argument, it overrides &lt;TT&gt;hour&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time = Time (9)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time.print_time()
09:00:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
If you provide two arguments, they override &lt;TT&gt;hour&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;minute&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time = Time(9, 45)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time.print_time()
09:45:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And if you provide three arguments, they override all three
default values.

=== Exercise 2 ===
''Write an init method for the ''''&lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt;'''' class that takes
''''&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;'''' as optional parameters and assigns
them to the corresponding attributes.''

== The &lt;TT&gt;__str__&lt;/TT&gt; method ==
&lt;CODE&gt;__str__&lt;/CODE&gt; is a special method, like &lt;CODE&gt;__init__&lt;/CODE&gt;,
that is supposed to return a string representation of an object.

For example, here is a &lt;TT&gt;str&lt;/TT&gt; method for Time objects:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def __str__(self):
        return '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When you &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; an object, Python invokes the &lt;TT&gt;str&lt;/TT&gt; method:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time = Time(9, 45)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print time
09:45:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When I write a new class, I almost always start by writing 
&lt;CODE&gt;__init__&lt;/CODE&gt;, which makes it easier to instantiate objects, and 
&lt;CODE&gt;__str__&lt;/CODE&gt;, which is useful for debugging.

=== Exercise 3 ===
Write a ''''&lt;TT&gt;str&lt;/TT&gt;'''' method for the ''''&lt;TT&gt;Point&lt;/TT&gt;'''' class. Create
a Point object and print it.

== Operator overloading ==
By defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior
of operators on user-defined types. For example, if you define
a method named &lt;CODE&gt;__add__&lt;/CODE&gt; for the &lt;TT&gt;Time&lt;/TT&gt; class, you can use the
&lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator on Time objects.

Here is what the definition might look like:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And here is how you could use it:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start = Time(9, 45)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; duration = Time(1, 35)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print start + duration
11:20:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
When you apply the &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator to Time objects, Python invokes
&lt;CODE&gt;__add__&lt;/CODE&gt;. When you print the result, Python invokes 
&lt;CODE&gt;__str__&lt;/CODE&gt;. So there is quite a lot happening behind the scenes!

Changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with
user-defined types is called '''operator overloading'''. For every
operator in Python there is a corresponding special method, like 
&lt;CODE&gt;__add__&lt;/CODE&gt;. For more details, see
&lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/ref/specialnames.html&lt;/TT&gt;.

=== Exercise 4 ===
Write an ''''&lt;TT&gt;add&lt;/TT&gt;'''' method for the Point class. 

== Type-based dispatch ==
In the previous section we added two Time objects, but you
also might want to add an integer to a Time object. The
following is a version of &lt;CODE&gt;__add__&lt;/CODE&gt;
that checks the type of &lt;TT&gt;other&lt;/TT&gt; and invokes either
&lt;CODE&gt;add_time&lt;/CODE&gt; or &lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Time):
            return self.add_time(other)
        else:
            return self.increment(other)

    def add_time(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The built-in function &lt;TT&gt;isinstance&lt;/TT&gt; takes a value and a
class object, and returns &lt;TT&gt;True&lt;/TT&gt; if the value is an instance
of the class.

If &lt;TT&gt;other&lt;/TT&gt; is a Time object, &lt;CODE&gt;__add__&lt;/CODE&gt; invokes
&lt;CODE&gt;add_time&lt;/CODE&gt;. Otherwise it assumes that the parameter
is a number and invokes &lt;TT&gt;increment&lt;/TT&gt;. This operation is
called a '''type-based dispatch''' because it dispatches the
computation to different methods based on the type of the
arguments.

Here are examples that use the &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator with different
types:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start = Time(9, 45)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; duration = Time(1, 35)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print start + duration
11:20:00
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print start + 1337
10:07:17
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Unfortunately, this implementation of addition is not commutative.
If the integer is the first operand, you get

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print 1337 + start
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'instance'
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The problem is, instead of asking the Time object to add an integer,
Python is asking an integer to add a Time object, and it doesn&amp;#X2019;t know
how to do that. But there is a clever solution for this problem: the
special method &lt;CODE&gt;__radd__&lt;/CODE&gt;, which stands for &amp;#X201C;right-side add.&amp;#X201D;
This method is invoked when a Time object appears on the right side of
the &lt;TT&gt;+&lt;/TT&gt; operator. Here&amp;#X2019;s the definition:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Time:

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self.__add__(other)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
And here&amp;#X2019;s how it&amp;#X2019;s used:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print 1337 + start
10:07:17
&lt;/PRE&gt;

=== Exercise 5 ===
Write an ''''&lt;TT&gt;add&lt;/TT&gt;'''' method for Points that works with either a
Point object or a tuple: ''

*''If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point whose ''''&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;'''' coordinate is the sum of the ''''&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;'''' coordinates of the operands, and likewise for the ''''&lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;'''' coordinates.''
*''If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element of the tuple to the ''''&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;'''' coordinate and the second element to the ''''&lt;I&gt;y&lt;/I&gt;'''' coordinate, and return a new Point with the result. ''

== Polymorphism ==
Type-based dispatch is useful when it is necessary, but (fortunately)
it is not always necessary. Often you can avoid it by writing functions
that work correctly for arguments with different types.

Many of the functions we wrote for strings will actually
work for any kind of sequence.
For example, in Section&amp;#XA0;11.1
we used &lt;TT&gt;histogram&lt;/TT&gt; to count the number of times each letter
appears in a word.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] = d[c]+1
    return d
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries,
as long as the elements of &lt;TT&gt;s&lt;/TT&gt; are hashable, so they can be used
as keys in &lt;TT&gt;d&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t = ['spam', 'egg', 'spam', 'spam', 'bacon', 'spam']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; histogram(t)
{'bacon': 1, 'egg': 1, 'spam': 4}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Functions that can work with several types are called '''polymorphic'''.
Polymorphism can facilitate code reuse. For example, the built-in
function &lt;TT&gt;sum&lt;/TT&gt;, which adds the elements of a sequence, works
as long as the elements of the sequence support addition.

Since Time objects provide an &lt;TT&gt;add&lt;/TT&gt; method, they work
with &lt;TT&gt;sum&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t1 = Time(7, 43)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t2 = Time(7, 41)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; t3 = Time(7, 37)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; total = sum([t1, t2, t3])
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print total
23:01:00
&lt;/PRE&gt;
In general, if all of the operations inside a function 
work with a given type, then the function works with that type.

The best kind of polymorphism is the unintentional kind, where
you discover that a function you already wrote can be
applied to a type you never planned for.

== Debugging ==
It is legal to add attributes to objects at any point in the execution
of a program, but if you are a stickler for type theory, it is a
dubious practice to have objects of the same type with different
attribute sets. It is usually a good idea to
initialize all of an objects attributes in the init method.

If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you
can use the built-in function &lt;TT&gt;hasattr&lt;/TT&gt; (see Section&amp;#XA0;15.7).

Another way to access the attributes of an object is through the
special attribute &lt;CODE&gt;__dict__&lt;/CODE&gt;, which is a dictionary that maps
attribute names (as strings) and values:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p = Point(3, 4)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print p.__dict__
{'y': 4, 'x': 3}
&lt;/PRE&gt;
For purposes of debugging, you might find it useful to keep this
function handy:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def print_attributes(obj):
    for attr in obj.__dict__:
        print attr, getattr(obj, attr)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;print_attributes&lt;/CODE&gt; traverses the items in the object&amp;#X2019;s dictionary
and prints each attribute name and its corresponding value.

The built-in function &lt;TT&gt;getattr&lt;/TT&gt; takes an object and an attribute
name (as a string) and returns the attribute&amp;#X2019;s value.

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 6 ===

In this chapter we will develop classes to represent playing cards,
decks of cards, and poker hands. If you don&amp;#X2019;t play poker, you can
read about it at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker &lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker&lt;/TT&gt;], but you don't have
to; I'll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.

If you are not familiar with Anglo-American playing cards,
you can read about them at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards &lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards&lt;/TT&gt;].

== Card objects ==
There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of
four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts,
Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are
Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on
the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King
or lower than 2.

If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is
obvious what the attributes should be: &lt;TT&gt;rank&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;suit&lt;/TT&gt;. It is not as obvious what type the attributes
should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like
&lt;CODE&gt;'Spade'&lt;/CODE&gt; for suits and &lt;CODE&gt;'Queen'&lt;/CODE&gt; for ranks. One problem with
this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to
see which had a higher rank or suit.

An alternative is to use integers to '''encode''' the ranks and suits.
In this context, &amp;#X201C;encode&amp;#X201D; means that we are going to define a mapping
between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This
kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that
would be &amp;#X201C;encryption&amp;#X201D;).

For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer
codes:
{| CELLSPACING=&quot;6&quot; CELLPADDING=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |Spades || ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6; || ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |3
|-
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |Hearts|| ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6;|| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |2
|-
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |Diamonds|| ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6;|| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |1
|-
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |Clubs|| ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6;|| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |0
|}
This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to
higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes.

The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks
maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:
{| CELLSPACING=&quot;6&quot; CELLPADDING=&quot;0&quot;
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |Jack|| ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6;|| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |11
|-
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |Queen|| ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6;|| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |12
|-
| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |King|| ALIGN=&quot;center&quot; |&amp;#X21A6;|| ALIGN=&quot;left&quot; |13
|}
I am using the &amp;#X21A6; symbol to make it clear that these mappings
are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program
design, but they don&amp;#X2019;t appear explicitly in the code.

The class definition for &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt; looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Card:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;represents a standard playing card.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank
&lt;/source&gt;

As usual, the init method takes an optional
parameter for each attribute. The default card is
the 2 of Clubs.

To create a Card, you call &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt; with the
suit and rank of the card you want.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
queen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Class attributes ==
In order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily
read, we need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding
ranks and suits. A natural way to
do that is with lists of strings. We assign these lists to '''class
attributes''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# inside class Card:

    suit_names = ['Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts', 'Spades']
    rank_names = [None, 'Ace', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', 
              '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King']

    def __str__(self):
        return '%s of %s' % (Card.rank_names[self.rank],
                             Card.suit_names[self.suit])
&lt;/source&gt;

Variables like &lt;CODE&gt;suit_names&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;rank_names&lt;/CODE&gt;, which are
defined inside a class but outside of any method, are called
class attributes because they are associated with the class object 
&lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt;.

This term distinguished them from variables like &lt;TT&gt;suit&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;rank&lt;/TT&gt;, which are called '''instance attributes''' because they are
associated with a particular instance.

Both kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For
example, in &lt;CODE&gt;__str__&lt;/CODE&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt; is a Card object,
and &lt;TT&gt;self.rank&lt;/TT&gt; is its rank. Similarly, &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt;
is a class object, and &lt;CODE&gt;Card.rank_names&lt;/CODE&gt; is a
list of strings associated with the class.

Every card has its own &lt;TT&gt;suit&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;rank&lt;/TT&gt;, but there
is only one copy of &lt;CODE&gt;suit_names&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;rank_names&lt;/CODE&gt;.

Putting it all together, the expression
&lt;CODE&gt;Card.rank_names[self.rank]&lt;/CODE&gt; means &amp;#X201C;use the attribute &lt;TT&gt;rank&lt;/TT&gt;
from the object &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt; as an index into the list &lt;CODE&gt;rank_names&lt;/CODE&gt;
from the class &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt;, and select the appropriate string.&amp;#X201D;

The first element of &lt;CODE&gt;rank_names&lt;/CODE&gt; is &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt; because there
is no card with rank zero. By including &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt; as a place-keeper,
we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the
string &lt;CODE&gt;'2'&lt;/CODE&gt;, and so on. To avoid this tweak, we could have
used a dictionary instead of a list.

With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; card1 = Card(2, 11)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print card1
Jack of Hearts
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a diagram that shows the &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt; class object
and one Card instance:

&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book026.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt; is a class object, so it has type &lt;TT&gt;type&lt;/TT&gt;. &lt;TT&gt;card1&lt;/TT&gt; has type &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt;. (To save space, I didn&amp;#X2019;t draw the
contents of &lt;CODE&gt;suit_names&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;rank_names&lt;/CODE&gt;).

== Comparing cards ==
For built-in types, there are conditional operators
(&lt;TT&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt;, etc.)
that compare
values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or equal to
another. For user-defined types, we can override the behavior of
the built-in operators by providing a method named
&lt;CODE&gt;__cmp__&lt;/CODE&gt;. 

&lt;CODE&gt;__cmp__&lt;/CODE&gt; takes two parameters, &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;other&lt;/TT&gt;,
and returns a positive number if the first object is greater, a
negative number if the second object is greater, and 0 if they are
equal to each other.

The correct ordering for cards is not obvious.
For example, which
is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher
rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to compare
cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.

The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep
things simple, we&amp;#X2019;ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more
important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds,
and so on.

With that decided, we can write &lt;CODE&gt;__cmp__&lt;/CODE&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Card:

    def __cmp__(self, other):
        # check the suits
        if self.suit &amp;gt; other.suit: return 1
        if self.suit &amp;lt; other.suit: return -1

        # suits are the same... check ranks
        if self.rank &amp;gt; other.rank: return 1
        if self.rank &amp;lt; other.rank: return -1

        # ranks are the same... it's a tie
        return 0    
&lt;/PRE&gt;
You can write this more concisely using tuple comparison:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Card:

    def __cmp__(self, other):
        t1 = self.suit, self.rank
        t2 = other.suit, other.rank
        return cmp(t1, t2)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The built-in function &lt;TT&gt;cmp&lt;/TT&gt; has the same interface as
the method &lt;CODE&gt;__cmp__&lt;/CODE&gt;: it takes two values and returns
a positive number if the first is larger, a negative number
of the second is larger, and 0 if they are equal.

=== Exercise 1 ===
Write a ''&lt;CODE&gt;''__cmp__''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' method for Time objects. Hint: you
can use tuple comparison, but you also might consider using
integer subtraction.''

== Decks ==
Now that we have Cards, the next step is to define Decks. Since a
deck is made up of cards, it is natural for each Deck to contain a
list of cards as an attribute.

The following is a class definition for &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;. The
init method creates the attribute &lt;TT&gt;cards&lt;/TT&gt; and generates
the standard set of fifty-two cards:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Deck:

    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        for suit in range(4):
            for rank in range(1, 14):
                card = Card(suit, rank)
                self.cards.append(card)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer
loop enumerates the suits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the
ranks from 1 to 13. Each iteration
creates a new Card with the current suit and rank,
and appends it to &lt;TT&gt;self.cards&lt;/TT&gt;.

== Printing the deck ==
Here is a &lt;CODE&gt;__str__&lt;/CODE&gt; method for &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;#inside class Deck:

    def __str__(self):
        res = [str(card) for card in self.cards]
        return '\n'.join(res)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This method demonstrates an efficient way to accumulate a large
string: building a list of strings and then using &lt;TT&gt;join&lt;/TT&gt;.
The built-in function &lt;TT&gt;str&lt;/TT&gt; invokes the &lt;CODE&gt;__str__&lt;/CODE&gt;
method on each card and returns the string representation.

Since we invoke &lt;TT&gt;join&lt;/TT&gt; on a newline character, the cards
are separated by newlines. Here&amp;#X2019;s what the result looks like:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deck = Deck()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print deck
Ace of Clubs
2 of Clubs
3 of Clubs
...
10 of Spades
Jack of Spades
Queen of Spades
King of Spades
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Even though the result appears on 52 lines, it is
one long string that contains newlines.

== Add, remove, shuffle and sort ==
To deal cards, we would like a method that
removes a card from the deck and returns it.
The list method &lt;TT&gt;pop&lt;/TT&gt; provides a convenient way to do that:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;#inside class Deck:

    def pop_card(self):
        return self.cards.pop()
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Since &lt;TT&gt;pop&lt;/TT&gt; removes the ''last'' card in the list, we are
dealing from the bottom of the deck. In real life bottom dealing is
frowned upon&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;,
but in this context it&amp;#X2019;s ok.

To add a card, we can use the list method &lt;TT&gt;append&lt;/TT&gt;:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;#inside class Deck:

    def add_card(self, card):
        self.cards.append(card)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A method like this that uses another function without doing
much real work is sometimes called a '''veneer'''. The metaphor
comes from woodworking, where it is common to glue a thin
layer of good quality wood to the surface of a cheaper piece of
wood.

In this case we are defining a &amp;#X201C;thin&amp;#X201D; method that expresses
a list operation in terms that are appropriate for decks.

As another example, we can write a Deck method named &lt;TT&gt;shuffle&lt;/TT&gt;
using the function &lt;TT&gt;shuffle&lt;/TT&gt; from the &lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt; module:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Deck:
            
    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Don&amp;#X2019;t forget to import &lt;TT&gt;random&lt;/TT&gt;.

=== Exercise 2 ===
''Write a Deck method named ''''&lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that uses the list method
''''&lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt;'''' to sort the cards in a ''''&lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;''''. ''''&lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt;'''' uses
the ''&lt;CODE&gt;''__cmp__''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' method we defined to determine sort order.''

== Inheritance ==
The language feature most often associated with object-oriented
programming is '''inheritance'''. Inheritance is the ability to
define a new class that is a modified version of an existing
class.

It is called &amp;#X201C;inheritance&amp;#X201D; because the new class inherits the
methods of the existing class. Extending this metaphor, the existing
class is called the '''parent''' and the new class is
called the '''child'''.

As an example, let&amp;#X2019;s say we want a class to represent a &amp;#X201C;hand,&amp;#X201D;
that is, the set of cards held by one player. A hand is similar to a
deck: both are made up of a set of cards, and both require operations
like adding and removing cards.

A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for
hands that don&amp;#X2019;t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we
might compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might
compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.

This relationship between classes&amp;#X2014;similar, but different&amp;#X2014;lends
itself to inheritance. 

The definition of a child class is like other class definitions,
but the name of the parent class appears in parentheses:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;class Hand(Deck):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;represents a hand of playing cards&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
This definition indicates that &lt;TT&gt;Hand&lt;/TT&gt; inherits from &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;;
that means we can use methods like &lt;CODE&gt;pop_card&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;add_card&lt;/CODE&gt;
for Hands as well as Decks.

&lt;TT&gt;Hand&lt;/TT&gt; also inherits &lt;CODE&gt;__init__&lt;/CODE&gt; from &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;, but
it doesn&amp;#X2019;t really do what we want: instead of populating the hand
with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should initialize
&lt;TT&gt;cards&lt;/TT&gt; with an empty list.

If we provide an init method in the &lt;TT&gt;Hand&lt;/TT&gt; class, it overrides the
one in the &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt; class:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;# inside class Hand:

    def __init__(self, label=''):
        self.cards = []
        self.label = label
&lt;/PRE&gt;
So when you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hand = Hand('new hand')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print hand.cards
[]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print hand.label
new hand
&lt;/PRE&gt;
But the other methods are inherited from &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;, so we can use
&lt;CODE&gt;pop_card&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;add_card&lt;/CODE&gt; to deal a card:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deck = Deck()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card = deck.pop_card()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hand.add_card(card)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print hand
King of Spades
&lt;/PRE&gt;
A natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method
called &lt;CODE&gt;move_cards&lt;/CODE&gt;:

&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;#inside class Deck:

    def move_cards(self, hand, num):
        for i in range(num):
            hand.add_card(self.pop_card())
&lt;/PRE&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;move_cards&lt;/CODE&gt; takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of
cards to deal. It modifies both &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;hand&lt;/TT&gt;, and
returns &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;.

In some games, cards are moved from one hand to another,
or from a hand back to the deck. You can use &lt;CODE&gt;move_cards&lt;/CODE&gt;
for any of these operations: &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt; can be either a Deck
or a Hand, and &lt;TT&gt;hand&lt;/TT&gt;, despite the name, can also be a &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;theorem&quot;&gt;'''Exercise&amp;#XA0;3'''&amp;#XA0;&amp;#XA0;''
Write a Deck method called ''&lt;CODE&gt;''deal_hands''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' that takes two
parameters, the number of hands and the number of cards per
hand, and that creates new Hand objects, deals the appropriate
number of cards per hand, and returns a list of Hand objects.
''&lt;/DIV&gt;
Inheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be
repetitive without inheritance can be written more elegantly
with it. Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can
customize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify
them. In some cases, the inheritance structure reflects the natural
structure of the problem, which makes the program easier to
understand.

On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read.
When a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its
definition. The relevant code may be scattered among several modules.
Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be
done as well or better without it.

== Class diagrams ==

So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of
a program, and object diagrams, which show the attributes
of an object and their values. These diagrams represent a snapshot
in the execution of a program, so they change as the program
runs.

They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too
detailed. A class diagrams is a more abstract representation
of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual
objects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.

There are several kinds of relationship between classes:

*Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example, each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to many Cards. This kind of relationship is called '''HAS-A''', as in, &amp;#X201C;a Rectangle has a Point.&amp;#X201D;
*One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called '''IS-A''', as in, &amp;#X201C;a Hand is a kind of a Deck.&amp;#X201D;
*One class might depend on another in the sense that changes in one class would require changes in the other.

A '''class diagram''' is a graphical representation of these
relationships&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;. For example, this diagram shows the
relationships between &lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;Hand&lt;/TT&gt;.
&lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;book027.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A
relationship; in this case it indicates that Hand inherits
from Deck.

The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A
relationship; in this case a Deck has references to Card
objects.

The star (&lt;TT&gt;*&lt;/TT&gt;) near the arrow head is a 
'''multiplicity'''; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has.
A multiplicity can be a simple number, like &lt;TT&gt;52&lt;/TT&gt;, a range,
like &lt;TT&gt;5..7&lt;/TT&gt; or a star, which indicates that a Deck can
have any number of Cards.

A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually
contains a ''list'' of Cards, but built-in types
like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.

=== Exercise 4 ===
Read ''''&lt;TT&gt;TurtleWorld.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;World.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;Gui.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and draw a class diagram that shows the relationships among
the classes defined there.

== Debugging ==
Inheritance can make debugging a challenge because when you
invoke a method on an object, you might not know which method
will be invoked.

Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects.
You would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like
PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method like
&lt;TT&gt;shuffle&lt;/TT&gt;, you might get the one defined in &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;,
but if any of the subclasses override this method, you&amp;#X2019;ll
get that version instead. 

Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your
program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the
beginning of the relevant methods. If &lt;TT&gt;Deck.shuffle&lt;/TT&gt; prints a
message that says something like &lt;TT&gt;Running Deck.shuffle&lt;/TT&gt;, then as
the program runs it traces the flow of execution.

As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an
object and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that
provides the definition of the method:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;def find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):
    for ty in type(obj).mro():
        if meth_name in ty.__dict__:
            return ty
&lt;/PRE&gt;
Here&amp;#X2019;s an example:
&lt;PRE CLASS=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hand = Hand()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print find_defining_class(hand, 'shuffle')
&amp;lt;class 'Card.Deck'&amp;gt;
&lt;/PRE&gt;
So the &lt;TT&gt;shuffle&lt;/TT&gt; method for this Hand is the one in &lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;.

&lt;CODE&gt;find_defining_class&lt;/CODE&gt; uses the &lt;TT&gt;mro&lt;/TT&gt; method to get the list
of class objects (types) that will be searched for methods. &amp;#X201C;MRO&amp;#X201D;
stands for &amp;#X201C;method resolution order.&amp;#X201D;

Here&amp;#X2019;s a program design suggestion: whenever you override a method,
the interface of the new method should be the same as the old. It
should take the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the
same preconditions and postconditions. If you obey this rule, you
will find that any function designed to work with an instance of a
superclass, like a Deck, will also work with instances of subclasses
like a Hand or PokerHand.

If you violate this rule, your code will collapse like (sorry)
a house of cards.

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 5 ===
''The following are the possible hands in poker, in increasing order
of value (and decreasing order of probability):''
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''''pair:'''''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt;'' two cards with the same rank

''&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''''''straight:'''''''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt;'' five cards with ranks in sequence (aces can
be high or low, so ''''&lt;TT&gt;Ace-2-3-4-5&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is a straight and so is ''''&lt;TT&gt;10-Jack-Queen-King-Ace&lt;/TT&gt;'''', but ''''&lt;TT&gt;Queen-King-Ace-2-3&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is not.)
''&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''''''flush:'''''''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt;'' five cards with the same suit

with the same suit
''&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
''
The goal of these exercises is to estimate
the probability of drawing these various hands.''

*''Download the following files from ''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code&lt;/TT&gt;'''':''&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''''&lt;TT&gt;Card.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt;'': A complete version of the ''''&lt;TT&gt;Card&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;Deck&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and ''''&lt;TT&gt;Hand&lt;/TT&gt;'''' classes in this chapter.''&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''''''&lt;TT&gt;PokerHand.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''''''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt;'': An incomplete implementation of a class
that represents a poker hand, and some code that tests it.''&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

*''''If you run ''''''''&lt;TT&gt;PokerHand.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''''''', it deals six 7-card poker hands
and checks to see if any of them contains a flush. Read this
code carefully before you go on.''''

*''''Add methods to ''''''''&lt;TT&gt;PokerHand.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''''''' named ''''&lt;CODE&gt;''''has_pair''''&lt;/CODE&gt;'''',
''''&lt;CODE&gt;''''has_twopair''''&lt;/CODE&gt;'''', etc. that return True or False according to
whether or not the hand meets the relevant criteria. Your code should
work correctly for &amp;#X201C;hands&amp;#X201D; that contain any number of cards
(although 5 and 7 are the most common sizes).''''

*''''Write a method named ''''''''&lt;TT&gt;classify&lt;/TT&gt;'''''''' that figures out
the highest-value classification for a hand and sets the
''''''''&lt;TT&gt;label&lt;/TT&gt;'''''''' attribute accordingly. For example, a 7-card hand
might contain a flush and a pair; it should be labeled &amp;#X201C;flush&amp;#X201D;.''''

*''''When you are convinced that your classification methods are
working, the next step is to estimate the probabilities of the various
hands. Write a function in ''''''''&lt;TT&gt;PokerHand.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''''''' that shuffles a deck of
cards, divides it into hands, classifies the hands, and counts the
number of times various classifications appear.''''

*''''Print a table of the classifications and their probabilities.
Run your program with larger and larger numbers of hands until the
output values converge to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Compare
your results to the values at ''''''''&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_rankings&lt;/TT&gt;''''''''.''''

=== Exercise 6 ===
''This exercise uses TurtleWorld from Chapter&amp;#XA0;''''4''''.
You will write code that makes Turtles play tag. If you
are not familiar with the rules of tag, see
''''&lt;TT&gt;wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

*''Download ''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/Wobbler.py&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and run it. You
should see a TurtleWorld with three Turtles. If you press the
''''Run'''' button, the Turtles wander at random.''

*''Read the code and make sure you understand how it works.
The ''''&lt;TT&gt;Wobbler&lt;/TT&gt;'''' class inherits from ''''&lt;TT&gt;Turtle&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which means
that the ''''&lt;TT&gt;Turtle&lt;/TT&gt;'''' methods ''''&lt;TT&gt;lt&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;rt&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;fd&lt;/TT&gt;''''
and ''''&lt;TT&gt;bk&lt;/TT&gt;'''' work on Wobblers.''
''The ''''&lt;TT&gt;step&lt;/TT&gt;'''' method gets invoked by TurtleWorld. It invokes 
''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which turns the Turtle in the desired direction,
''''&lt;TT&gt;wobble&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which makes a random turn in proportion to the Turtle&amp;#X2019;s
clumsiness, and ''''&lt;TT&gt;move&lt;/TT&gt;'''', which moves forward a few pixels,
depending on the Turtle&amp;#X2019;s speed.''

*''Create a file named ''''&lt;TT&gt;Tagger.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''. Import everything from
''''&lt;TT&gt;Wobbler&lt;/TT&gt;'''', then define a class named ''''&lt;TT&gt;Tagger&lt;/TT&gt;'''' that inherits
from ''''&lt;TT&gt;Wobbler&lt;/TT&gt;''''. Call ''&lt;CODE&gt;''make_world''&lt;/CODE&gt;'' passing the ''''&lt;TT&gt;Tagger&lt;/TT&gt;'''' class object as an argument.''

*''Add a ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' method to ''''&lt;TT&gt;Tagger&lt;/TT&gt;'''' to override the one in
''''&lt;TT&gt;Wobbler&lt;/TT&gt;''''. As a starting place, write a version that always
points the Turtle toward the origin. Hint: use the math function
''''&lt;TT&gt;atan2&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and the Turtle attributes ''''&lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and
''''&lt;TT&gt;heading&lt;/TT&gt;''''.''

*''Modify ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' so that the Turtles stay in bounds.
For debugging, you might want to use the ''''Step'''' button,
which invokes ''''&lt;TT&gt;step&lt;/TT&gt;'''' once on each Turtle.''

*''Modify ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' so that each Turtle points toward its nearest
neighbor. Hint: Turtles have an attribute, ''''&lt;TT&gt;world&lt;/TT&gt;'''', that is a
reference to the TurtleWorld they live in, and the TurtleWorld has
an attribute, ''''&lt;TT&gt;animals&lt;/TT&gt;'''', that is a list of all Turtles in the
world.''

*''Modify ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' so the Turtles play tag. You can add methods
to ''''&lt;TT&gt;Tagger&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and you can override ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' and
''&lt;CODE&gt;''__init__''&lt;/CODE&gt;'', but you may not modify or override ''''&lt;TT&gt;step&lt;/TT&gt;'''', ''''&lt;TT&gt;wobble&lt;/TT&gt;'''' or ''''&lt;TT&gt;move&lt;/TT&gt;''''. Also, ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' is allowed to change the
heading of the Turtle but not the position.''
''Adjust the rules and your ''''&lt;TT&gt;steer&lt;/TT&gt;'''' method for good quality play;
for example, it should be possible for the slow Turtle to tag the
faster Turtles eventually.''

''You can get my solution from ''''&lt;TT&gt;thinkpython.com/code/Tagger.py&lt;/TT&gt;''''.

Different kinds of errors can occur
in a program, and it is useful to distinguish among them
in order to track them down more quickly:

*Syntax errors are produced by Python when it is translating the source code into byte code. They usually indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program. Example: Omitting the colon at the end of a &lt;TT&gt;def&lt;/TT&gt; statement yields the somewhat redundant message &lt;TT&gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&lt;/TT&gt;.
*Runtime errors are produced by the interpreter if something goes wrong while the program is running. Most runtime error messages include information about where the error occurred and what functions were executing. Example: An infinite recursion eventually causes the runtime error &amp;#X201C;maximum recursion depth exceeded.&amp;#X201D;
*Semantic errors are problems with a program that runs without producing error messages but doesn&amp;#X2019;t do the right thing. Example: An expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect, yielding an incorrect result.

The first step in debugging is to figure out which kind of
error you are dealing with. Although the following sections are
organized by error type, some techniques are
applicable in more than one situation.

== Syntax errors ==
Syntax errors are usually easy to fix once you figure out what they
are. Unfortunately, the error messages are often not helpful.
The most common messages are &lt;TT&gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&lt;/TT&gt; and
&lt;TT&gt;SyntaxError: invalid token&lt;/TT&gt;, neither of which is very informative.

On the other hand, the message does tell you where in the program the
problem occurred. Actually, it tells you where Python
noticed a problem, which is not necessarily where the error
is. Sometimes the error is prior to the location of the error
message, often on the preceding line.

If you are building the program incrementally, you should have
a good idea about where the error is. It will be in the last
line you added.

If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing
your code to the book&amp;#X2019;s code very carefully. Check every character.
At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so
if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.

Here are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:

*Make sure you are not using a Python keyword for a variable name.

*Check that you have a colon at the end of the header of every
compound statement, including &lt;TT&gt;for&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;while&lt;/TT&gt;,
&lt;TT&gt;if&lt;/TT&gt;, and &lt;TT&gt;def&lt;/TT&gt; statements.



*Make sure that any strings in the code have matching
quotation marks.

*If you have multiline strings with triple quotes (single or double), make
sure you have terminated the string properly. An unterminated string
may cause an &lt;TT&gt;invalid token&lt;/TT&gt; error at the end of your program,
or it may treat the following part of the program as a string until it
comes to the next string. In the second case, it might not produce an error
message at all!



*An unclosed opening operator&amp;#X2014;&lt;CODE&gt;(&lt;/CODE&gt;, &lt;CODE&gt;{&lt;/CODE&gt;, or
&lt;CODE&gt;[&lt;/CODE&gt;&amp;#X2014;makes Python continue with the next line as part of the
current statement. Generally, an error occurs almost immediately in
the next line.

*Check for the classic &lt;TT&gt;=&lt;/TT&gt; instead of &lt;TT&gt;==&lt;/TT&gt; inside
a conditional.

*Check the indentation to make sure it lines up the way it
is supposed to. Python can handle space and tabs, but if you mix
them it can cause problems. The best way to avoid this problem
is to use a text editor that knows about Python and generates
consistent indentation.

If nothing works, move on to the next section...

=== I keep making changes and it makes no difference. ===

If the interpreter says there is an error and you don&amp;#X2019;t see it, that
might be because you and the interpreter are not looking at the same
code. Check your programming environment to make sure that the
program you are editing is the one Python is trying to run.

If you are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax
error at the beginning of the program. Now run it again. If the
interpreter doesn&amp;#X2019;t find the new error, you are not running the
new code.

There are a few likely culprits:

*You edited the file and forgot to save the changes before running it again. Some programming environments do this for you, but some don&amp;#X2019;t.
*You changed the name of the file, but you are still running the old name.
*Something in your development environment is configured incorrectly.
*If you are writing a module and using &lt;TT&gt;import&lt;/TT&gt;, make sure you don&amp;#X2019;t give your module the same name as one of the standard Python modules.
*If you are using &lt;TT&gt;import&lt;/TT&gt; to read a module, remember that you have to restart the interpreter or use &lt;TT&gt;reload&lt;/TT&gt; to read a modified file. If you import the module again, it doesn&amp;#X2019;t do anything.

If you get stuck and you can&amp;#X2019;t figure out what is going on, one
approach is to start again with a new program like &amp;#X201C;Hello, World!,&amp;#X201D;
and make sure you can get a known program to run. Then gradually add
the pieces of the original program to the new one.

== Runtime errors ==

Once your program is syntactically correct,
Python can compile it and at least start running it. What could
possibly go wrong?
=== My program does absolutely nothing. ===

This problem is most common when your file consists of functions and
classes but does not actually invoke anything to start execution.
This may be intentional if you only plan to import this module to
supply classes and functions.

If it is not intentional, make sure that you
are invoking a function to start execution, or execute one from
the interactive prompt. Also see the &amp;#X201C;Flow of Execution&amp;#X201D; section
below.
=== My program hangs ===
If a program stops and seems to be doing nothing, it is &amp;#X201C;hanging.&amp;#X201D;
Often that means that it is caught in an infinite loop or infinite
recursion.

*If there is a particular loop that you suspect is the problem, add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement immediately before the loop that says &amp;#X201C;entering the loop&amp;#X201D; and another immediately after that says &amp;#X201C;exiting the loop.&amp;#X201D; Run the program. If you get the first message and not the second, you&amp;#X2019;ve got an infinite loop. Go to the &amp;#X201C;Infinite Loop&amp;#X201D; section below.
*Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to run for a while and then produce a &amp;#X201C;RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded&amp;#X201D; error. If that happens, go to the &amp;#X201C;Infinite Recursion&amp;#X201D; section below. If you are not getting this error but you suspect there is a problem with a recursive method or function, you can still use the techniques in the &amp;#X201C;Infinite Recursion&amp;#X201D; section.
*If neither of those steps works, start testing other loops and other recursive functions and methods.
*If that doesn&amp;#X2019;t work, then it is possible that you don&amp;#X2019;t understand the flow of execution in your program. Go to the &amp;#X201C;Flow of Execution&amp;#X201D; section below.

==== Infinite Loop ====
If you think you have an infinite loop and you think you know
what loop is causing the problem, add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement at
the end of the loop that prints the values of the variables in
the condition and the value of the condition.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while x &gt; 0 and y &lt; 0 :
    # do something to x
    # do something to y

    print  &quot;x: &quot;, x
    print  &quot;y: &quot;, y
    print  &quot;condition: &quot;, (x &gt; 0 and y &lt; 0)
&lt;/source&gt;
Now when you run the program, you will see three lines of output
for each time through the loop. The last time through the
loop, the condition should be &lt;TT&gt;false&lt;/TT&gt;. If the loop keeps
going, you will be able to see the values of &lt;TT&gt;x&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;y&lt;/TT&gt;,
and you might figure out why they are not being updated correctly.

==== Infinite Recursion====
Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to run
for a while and then produce a &lt;TT&gt;Maximum recursion depth exceeded&lt;/TT&gt;
error.

If you suspect that a function or method is causing an infinite
recursion, start by checking to make sure that there is a base case.
In other words, there should be some condition that will cause the
function or method to return without making a recursive invocation.
If not, then you need to rethink the algorithm and identify a base
case.

If there is a base case but the program doesn&amp;#X2019;t seem to be reaching
it, add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement at the beginning of the function or method
that prints the parameters. Now when you run the program, you will see
a few lines of output every time the function or method is invoked,
and you will see the parameters. If the parameters are not moving
toward the base case, you will get some ideas about why not.

====Flow of Execution====
If you are not sure how the flow of execution is moving through
your program, add &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statements to the beginning of each
function with a message like &amp;#X201C;entering function &lt;TT&gt;foo&lt;/TT&gt;,&amp;#X201D; where
&lt;TT&gt;foo&lt;/TT&gt; is the name of the function.

Now when you run the program, it will print a trace of each
function as it is invoked.

=== When I run the program I get an exception. ===
If something goes wrong during runtime, Python
prints a message that includes the name of the
exception, the line of the program where the problem occurred,
and a traceback.

The traceback identifies the function that is currently running,
and then the function that invoked it, and then the function that
invoked ''that'', and so on. In other words, it traces the
sequence of function invocations that got you to where you are. It
also includes the line number in your file where each of these
calls occurs.

The first step is to examine the place in the program where
the error occurred and see if you can figure out what happened.
These are some of the most common runtime errors:
&lt;DL CLASS=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''NameError:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; You are trying to use a variable that doesn&amp;#X2019;t
exist in the current environment.
Remember that local variables are local. You
cannot refer to them from outside the function where they are defined.
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''TypeError:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; There are several possible causes:

*You are trying to use a value improperly. Example: indexing a string, list, or tuple with something other than an integer.
*There is a mismatch between the items in a format string and the items passed for conversion. This can happen if either the number of items does not match or an invalid conversion is called for.
*You are passing the wrong number of arguments to a function or method. For methods, look at the method definition and check that the first parameter is &lt;TT&gt;self&lt;/TT&gt;. Then look at the method invocation; make sure you are invoking the method on an object with the right type and providing the other arguments correctly.

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''KeyError:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; You are trying to access an element of a dictionary
using a key that the dictionary does not contain.

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''AttributeError:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; You are trying to access an attribute or method
that does not exist. Check the spelling! You can use
&lt;TT&gt;dir&lt;/TT&gt; to list the attributes that do exist.
If an AttributeError indicates that an object has &lt;TT&gt;NoneType&lt;/TT&gt;,
that means that it is &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;. One common cause is forgetting
to return a value from a function; if you get to the end of
a function without hitting a &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement, it returns
&lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;. Another common cause is using the result from
a list method, like &lt;TT&gt;sort&lt;/TT&gt;, that returns &lt;TT&gt;None&lt;/TT&gt;.

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;DT CLASS=&quot;dt-description&quot;&gt;'''IndexError:'''&lt;/DT&gt;&lt;DD CLASS=&quot;dd-description&quot;&gt; The index you are using
to access a list, string, or tuple is greater than
its length minus one. Immediately before the site of the error,
add a &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statement to display
the value of the index and the length of the array.
Is the array the right size? Is the index the right value?

&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

The Python debugger (&lt;TT&gt;pdb&lt;/TT&gt;) is useful for tracking down
Exceptions because it allows you to examine the state of the
program immediately before the error. You can read
about &lt;TT&gt;pdb&lt;/TT&gt; at &lt;TT&gt;docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html&lt;/TT&gt;.

===I added so many &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statements I get inundated with output ===

One of the problems with using &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statements for debugging
is that you can end up buried in output. There are two ways
to proceed: simplify the output or simplify the program.

To simplify the output, you can remove or comment out &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt;
statements that aren&amp;#X2019;t helping, or combine them, or format
the output so it is easier to understand.

To simplify the program, there are several things you can do. First,
scale down the problem the program is working on. For example, if you
are searching a list, search a ''small'' list. If the program takes
input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the
problem.

Second, clean up the program. Remove dead code and reorganize the
program to make it as easy to read as possible. For example, if you
suspect that the problem is in a deeply nested part of the program,
try rewriting that part with simpler structure. If you suspect a
large function, try splitting it into smaller functions and testing them
separately.

Often the process of finding the minimal test case leads you to the
bug. If you find that a program works in one situation but not in
another, that gives you a clue about what is going on.

Similarly, rewriting a piece of code can help you find subtle
bugs. If you make a change that you think doesn&amp;#X2019;t affect the
program, and it does, that can tip you off.

== Semantic errors ==
In some ways, semantic errors are the hardest to debug,
because the interpreter provides no information
about what is wrong. Only you know what the program is supposed to
do.

The first step is to make a connection between the program
text and the behavior you are seeing. You need a hypothesis
about what the program is actually doing. One of the things
that makes that hard is that computers run so fast.

You will often wish that you could slow the program down to human
speed, and with some debuggers you can. But the time it takes to
insert a few well-placed &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statements is often short compared to
setting up the debugger, inserting and removing breakpoints, and
&amp;#X201C;stepping&amp;#X201D; the program to where the error is occurring.
=== My program doesn&amp;#X2019;t work. ===

You should ask yourself these questions:

*Is there something the program was supposed to do but which doesn&amp;#X2019;t seem to be happening? Find the section of the code that performs that function and make sure it is executing when you think it should.
*Is something happening that shouldn&amp;#X2019;t? Find code in your program that performs that function and see if it is executing when it shouldn&amp;#X2019;t.

*Is a section of code producing an effect that is not what you expected? Make sure that you understand the code in question, especially if it involves invocations to functions or methods in other Python modules. Read the documentation for the functions you invoke. Try them out by writing simple test cases and checking the results.

In order to program, you need to have a mental model of how
programs work. If you write a program that doesn&amp;#X2019;t do what you expect,
very often the problem is not in the program; it&amp;#X2019;s in your mental
model.

The best way to correct your mental model is to break the program
into its components (usually the functions and methods) and test
each component independently. Once you find the discrepancy
between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.

Of course, you should be building and testing components as you
develop the program. If you encounter a problem,
there should be only a small amount of new code
that is not known to be correct.

=== I&amp;#X2019;ve got a big hairy expression and it doesn&amp;#X2019;t do what I expect. ===

Writing complex expressions is fine as long as they are readable,
but they can be hard to debug. It is often a good idea to
break a complex expression into a series of assignments to
temporary variables.

For example:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
self.hands[i].addCard(self.hands[self.findNeighbor(i)].popCard())
&lt;/source&gt;
This can be rewritten as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
neighbor = self.findNeighbor(i)
pickedCard = self.hands[neighbor].popCard()
self.hands[i].addCard(pickedCard)
&lt;/source&gt;
The explicit version is easier to read because the variable
names provide additional documentation, and it is easier to debug
because you can check the types of the intermediate variables
and display their values.

Another problem that can occur with big expressions is
that the order of evaluation may not be what you expect.
For example, if you are translating the expression
&lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt;/2 &amp;#X3C0; into Python, you might write:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
y = x / 2 * math.pi
&lt;/source&gt;
That is not correct because multiplication and division have
the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.
So this expression computes &lt;I&gt;x&lt;/I&gt; &amp;#X3C0; / 2.

A good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make
the order of evaluation explicit:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
y = x / (2 * math.pi)
&lt;/source&gt;
Whenever you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use
parentheses. Not only will the program be correct (in the sense
of doing what you intended), it will also be more readable for
other people who haven&amp;#X2019;t memorized the rules of precedence.

=== I&amp;#X2019;ve got a function or method that doesn&amp;#X2019;t return what I expect ===

If you have a &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; statement with a complex expression,
you don&amp;#X2019;t have a chance to print the &lt;TT&gt;return&lt;/TT&gt; value before
returning. Again, you can use a temporary variable. For
example, instead of:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
return self.hands[i].removeMatches()
&lt;/source&gt;
you could write:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
count = self.hands[i].removeMatches()
return count
&lt;/source&gt;
Now you have the opportunity to display the value of
&lt;TT&gt;count&lt;/TT&gt; before returning.

=== I'm really, really stuck and I need help. ===

First, try getting away from the computer for a few minutes.
Computers emit waves that affect the brain, causing these
symptoms:

*Frustration and rage.

*Superstitious beliefs (&amp;#X201C;the computer hates me&amp;#X201D;) and
magical thinking (&amp;#X201C;the program only works when I wear my
hat backward&amp;#X201D;).

*Random walk programming (the attempt to program by writing
every possible program and choosing the one that does the right
thing).

If you find yourself suffering from any of these symptoms, get
up and go for a walk. When you are calm, think about the program.
What is it doing? What are some possible causes of that
behavior? When was the last time you had a working program,
and what did you do next?

Sometimes it just takes time to find a bug. I often find bugs
when I am away from the computer and let my mind wander. Some
of the best places to find bugs are trains, showers, and in bed,
just before you fall asleep.
=== No, I really need help. ===

It happens. Even the best programmers occasionally get stuck.
Sometimes you work on a program so long that you can&amp;#X2019;t see the
error. A fresh pair of eyes is just the thing.

Before you bring someone else in, make sure you are prepared.
Your program should be as simple
as possible, and you should be working on the smallest input
that causes the error. You should have &lt;TT&gt;print&lt;/TT&gt; statements in the
appropriate places (and the output they produce should be
comprehensible). You should understand the problem well enough
to describe it concisely.

When you bring someone in to help, be sure to give
them the information they need:

*If there is an error message, what is it and what part of the program does it indicate?
*What was the last thing you did before this error occurred? What were the last lines of code that you wrote, or what is the new test case that fails?
*What have you tried so far, and what have you learned?

When you find the bug, take a second to think about what you
could have done to find it faster. Next time you see something
similar, you will be able to find the bug more quickly.

Remember, the goal is not just to make the program
work. The goal is to learn how to make the program work.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the fundamental tasks for Doctoral students is to figure out to take and keep notes about the reading and research he/she is conducting.  Somehow, middle school note cards seem a bit dated.  Surely there are better ways of doing this.  The purpose of this chapter is for people to write down how they keep their notes and find them later.  The skill of capturing information and storing it for later use is something that every scholar must figure out for a successful life of research.
 
Some people are visual. They want to see and touch everything at the right time.  You’ve heard of “just in time inventory?” Well these folks like &quot;just in time data!&quot;  Now, some have been known to have strings hung from wall to wall in their homes with their notes taped to the strings. That certainly is visual!  
 
Some people make copies of entire articles then highlight the relevant sections. Next they cut and paste on pages with citation numbers that match the source of that information.  Organizing the pages in order is easy and can be easily changed.  Whew!  Sounds like a lot of work.
 
Another solution is to use Excel software.  This simple spreadsheet software is usually used to work with numbers but it can be useful for words and sentences as well.  Opening up a blank spread sheet, one creates enough columns for the project.  The first column might be a cue about the citation or the whole citation but I prefer to link it to the Endnotes citation with either a number or author name/year.  Next is a column for key words that describe what that data is about. You can also put a column in for where the data might go in your paper (introduction, argument for/against, methodology, etc.).  Finally, the last column is where the actual information is typed.  By turning on the wrap around feature, you can type as much as you like.
 
After collecting your data, you can use your computer to move text around or highlight it in different colors. Each color may be assigned a meaning such as a location in your paper or all information about a particular strand in one color. This makes it easy for scholars who are visual to find “just in time” data from their notes! For those of us whose handwriting is not the most readable, using Excel is a good way to ensure that notes are legible.
 
There are other techniques for those who aren’t visual or who learn by feeling (kinetics), hearing, etc.  How do you keep track of your notes so that you can find the right information when needed?

=Charts and Graphs=
Graphs and charts serve as a form of communication in many business settings. Since many businesses travel internationally language barriers often result, causing frustrations between businesses. Graphs and charts are used as a form of wordless communication to facilitate conversations, instructions, and  directions. Graphs and charts can be used to convey important information, such as numeric quantities, trends and relationships between values. It is important to choose the right type of graph or chart to easily and accurately convey information. Make sure you define the graph or chart, give an explanation of the graph or chart in addition to choosing one that is easily read that conveys your information accurately. 


When using a chart or graph, a key and title are essential for the reader to understand what the chart or graph is representing. Typically a chart is graphical, containing very little text. It has been proven that people are able to understand and process information better when it is presented in a graphical format, rather than in text. Using charts with accurate information in persuasive ways can help to engage your audience and get your point across clearly and resourcefully.

=='''Scatter Plots'''==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:center; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:R-car_stopping_distances_1920.svg‎‎|thumb|An example of a scatter plot.]]
 |}
Scatter plots are good way to display the values of two variables for a set of data. This means that for each separate point of data on the graph, there are two separate pieces of data, an independent and dependent variable, that determine the location of the point. The independent or controlled variable is usually on the horizontal axis. The dependent variable is then measured and placed on the vertical axis. A scatter plot is not good for measuring multiple sets of data.

Main things to be included in a scatter plot are as follows:
*'''Title:''' Most important thing (what is a chart without a title).  Must be to the point.
*'''X-axis''' (''Horizontal'') and '''Y-axis''' (''Vertical''): Both axis should be labeled and provide units of measurement. 
*'''Points:''' The data points should be placed on the graph according to the experimental outcomes independent and dependent variables.
*'''R squared value:''' Used to sense trends and correlation of the data.
*'''Equations:''' Any equation that my help a reader interpret the data more clearly.
*'''Trend Line:''' Shows if the data has a trend and can also show outliers and how well correlated the data is.
Example: x = 3 and Y = 5 would be graphed (3, 5) on the scatter plot.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=='''Line Graphs'''==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:center; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:Common_Logarithms.svg‎|thumb|An example of a comparative line graph.]]
 |}
Line graphs are a good way to compare anything between two or more variables. These are one of the easier types of graphs to look at because you can clearly see the changes in the line as time goes on. A line graph should never be used to show statistics at a set moment in time.
A disadvantage of line graphs is it can be difficult to see exactly what number is being specified at a data point. If it is important that the numbers be easily read, they may be inserted within the graph at their respective data points.  Since most line graphs are used to convey a trend over time, however, specific numbers are not always necessary. 

Main things to be included in a line graph are as follows:
*'''Title:''' The most important thing (what is a chart without a title).  Must be to the point.
*'''X-axis''' (''Horizontal'') and '''Y-axis''' (''Vertical''): Both axes should be labeled and provide units of measurement. They should extend slightly past the highest graphed value. 
*'''Tick Marks:''' Use tick marks on both axes to show units. Make sure they are not cluttering the graph.
*'''Line:''' The line shows the actual data being displayed. It can be displayed as a single data point, data points with a line connecting the points, or as a single smooth line with no data points. Different colors can also be used to designate various elements.
*'''Source:''' Should be included if the source will not be obvious to readers.

Tips for making line graphs:
*Use different colors to ensure that the reader can distinguish between the lines. If you cannot use different colors, use different types of lines, for example, dots or dashes.
*If possible, start axes at zero to avoid misleading readers. If this is not possible, use hash marks to inform your readers that your graph does not start at zero.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=='''Bar Graphs'''==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:center; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:Incarceration_Rates_Worldwide_ZP.svg‎|thumb|An example of a bar graph.]]
 |}
Bar graphs can be used as a simple and easy way to compare quantities. The bars can extend up from the base of the graph, or extend horizontally from the sides of the graph. Bar graphs work best when comparing quantities over time and give a better visual when the changes are rather large.
Main things to be included in a bar graph are as follows: 
*&lt;big&gt;'''Title'''&lt;/big&gt;: This is the most important thing.  Make sure to give a title that readers will easily understand and that will successfully convey the information that is contained in the bar graph.
*&lt;big&gt;'''X-axis'''&lt;/big&gt; (''Horizontal'') and &lt;big&gt;'''Y-axis'''&lt;/big&gt; (''Vertical''): Both axes should be labeled and provide units of measurement.
*&lt;big&gt;'''Bars'''&lt;/big&gt;: This is what shows the actual data being displayed. The bars start at zero and extend to the value which is necessary. Appropriate colors and a key should be used if multiple bars could be used to simplify the reading process. The bars can be touching or separate, depending on space and preference.
*&lt;big&gt;'''Labels'''&lt;/big&gt;: Label every piece of data so it is clear what each bar in the graph represents.  It is important to do so, in order to promote clarity and usability of the graph.
*&lt;big&gt;'''Source'''&lt;/big&gt;: This should be included if it will not be obvious to readers.
*&lt;big&gt;'''Key'''&lt;/big&gt;: When bars are repeated, include a key of the colors, or place labels next to each bar to clarify what they represent.

Tips for creating bar graphs:
*Arrange bars in an order that readers will find most helpful. They could be arranged alphabetically, chronologically, from longest to shortest, or vice versa.
*If possible, begin bars at zero. If this is not possible, use hash marks to inform your readers the bars do not start at zero.

=='''Pie Charts'''==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:center; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:English_dialects1997.svg‎‎|thumb|An example of a pie chart.]]
 |}
Pie charts are effective for showing pieces of information that have a direct correlation to one another. Pie charts are one of the most commonly used graphics to communicate varying values or percentages in relation to each other.  However, they are not useful for demonstrating changes over time. They only show parts of a whole at a specific moment in time.

The chart is made up of a circle that contains many &quot;slices&quot; representing values in percentages or magnitudes that add up to a whole circle, or 100%. These are used in the business world, but are rarely used in technical or scientific reports because of their inability to communicate differences between the slices of the pie, as well as the inability to compare multiple pie charts to each other. 
The main things to be included in a pie chart are the following:
*Title-Most important piece of information.
*Labeling on all sections of the pie (including percentages). 
  -A legend could also be used to inform the reader of the set of data being compared. 
*Use Color, it makes the chart more visually attractive and may help distinguish between slices of the chart. Color coding and a legend may also be used if the slices are to small to be labeled individually, of if you do not want to label the slices individually.

=='''Other charts'''==

'''Organization charts'''
:*Note that the purpose of an organization chart is to map the various divisions and levels of responsibility within an organization.
:*Make the chart as simple as the organization itself, with the levels of hierarchy organized highest to lowest and positioned on the chart from top to bottom. The more levels of hierarchy in the organization, the more vertical the chart; the more divisions in the organization, the more horizontal the chart.
:*Use the same shape in the same size for all divisions of the organization that are at the same level in the hierarchy.
:*Label each division of the organization.
:*If space allows, put the labels directly on the division; if not, attach the label to the subject with thin rules (never arrows).
:*Position all the labels on the horizontal so that the view doesn't have to rotate the page or screen to read the labels.
:*Connect each level of the organization to the higher and lower levels with a clear line (never arrows).
:*Connect optional, informal, or temporary relationships with a dotted line.

'''Flow charts'''
:*Note that the purpose of a flow chart is to show the sequence of steps in a process or procedure.
:*Make the flow chart as simple as the process itself. If a process is simple, design the flow chart so that it progresses in a single direction, usually top to bottom or left to right. Complicated designs that spiral and zigzag imply a more complicated process.
:*Use the same shape in the same size for all equivalent steps or phases, but different shapes for steps or phases of a different kind (e.g., circles for the stages in researching a document, squares for the stages of writing, and diamonds for the production stages of printing and binding).
:*Label each of the steps or phases.
:*If space allows, put the labels directly on the step; if not, attach the label to the step with thin rules (never arrows).
:*Position all the labels on the horizontal so that the viewer doesn't have to rotate the page or screen to read the labels.
:*Connect each step or phase in the sequence to the next step or phase with a clear directional arrow.
:*Connect reversible or interactive steps or phases with double-headed arrows.
:*Connect recursive or cyclical steps or phases with circular arrows.
:*Connect optional steps or phases with dotted-line arrows.

'''Diagrams'''
:*Note that the purpose of a diagram is to identify the parts of a subject and their spatial or functional relationship.
:*Keep the diagram as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary details or distracting decorations and focusing the viewer's attention on the key features or parts of the subject.
:*Label each of the pertinent parts of the subject.
:*If space allows, put the labels directly on the part; if not, attach the label to the part with thin rules (never arrows).
:*Position all the labels on the horizontal so that the viewer doesn't have to rotate the page or screen to read the labels.


=='''&lt;big&gt;Pictographs&lt;/big&gt;'''==
Pictographs are similar to bar graphs except, instead of bars, symbols are used in order to simplify the viewing process. Pictographs are not seen often in professional work. They can best be put to use in communicating with children or young adults that may not have adequate reading skills.

Main things to be included in a pictograph:
*'''Title:''' Most important thing
*'''Key:''' a key should be present in order to show the viewer how much each symbol represents. Each symbol should be as simple as possible. Color, size, or orientation can be varied to represent different items. 
**'''For Example:''' A ticket stub could equal 2 movies watched. If the number the symbol is assigned to is simple, it can be cut in half in order to show fractions. For Example: Half of the ticket stub equals 1 movie watched. 

The definition of a pictogram or pictograph is a symbol used to represent an object or place that is widely recognized and understood, sometimes even across cultures. This form of showing and representing information could be extremely useful when dealing with multiple cultures and languages. A common example of a pictogram is the man and woman symbols used to distinguish the woman's bathroom from the man's bathroom. These two symbols are recognized throughout the world and, in each situation, mean the same thing. So, a pictogram would be appropriate for communicating to a varied audience either of young children or people of many languages. The pictures and symbols along with a proper key will convey meaning without the necessity of words.

{{drop|F}}or Australian followers of Neopagan philosophies and customs, the traditional seasonal festivals, rituals, and practises taught by the European based disciplines, make it difficult for Australian witches to correctly synchronise with mother nature in the Southern Hemisphere. The '''Australian Esoterica''' aims to realign the traditional Northern Hemisphere Neopagan seasonal customs in accordance with Southern Hemisphere seasonal changes, while at the same time offering a comprehensive guide to Neopagan philosophies for Australian followers of the faith. Nevertheless, this book is not just a rehash of European spiritual practises turned upside down, but also aspires to become an internet [[/Mystical Books|Book of Shadows]] for all [[/Neopaganism in Australia|Australian Neopagans]] by describing culturally relevant mythologies, philosophies, and practises.

==Style Guidelines==

* '''Language:''' British English.
* '''Reading Level:''' [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels|Intermediate]].
* '''Chapter Organisation:''' Flat structure (example: ''Australian Esoterica/Chapter Title'') so that chapters may be rearranged if required. Do not number chapter titles.
* '''Heading Format:''' Titlecase - the first letter of important words in chapter titles and section headings are capitalised (example: ''Neopaganism in Australia'').
* '''Drop Capitals:''' Use the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{drop|D}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template for the first letter at the start of each page. Do not use the drop template for any further sections on the same page. Do not use the drop template if the page begins with a level 2 heading.
* '''Jargon:''' List explanations for all relevant terminology alphabetically in the [[Australian Esoterica/Glossary|''Glossary'']].
* '''Resources:''' Reference all resources that you have used for your research in the [[Australian Esoterica/Bibliography|''Bibliography'']] beneath the relevant chapter heading.
* '''Authors:''' Don't forget to add your username to the list of [[Australian_Esoterica/Authors|''Contributing Authors'']] if you make any significant additions to this book.

&lt;br&gt;{{toplink}}

===Consistent Terminology===
'''Directions - North, South, East, West and Hemisphere:''' In this book the first letter is capitalised for directions of the compass.  This is also true when referring to specific hemispheres, with the first letter of ''both'' words capitalised - Southern Hemisphere or Northern Hemisphere.


'''Elements - Earth, Fire, Water, Air:''' When referring to the four elements, the first letter is capitalised. If a term is not used in this context then the first letter of the word should not be capitalised unless otherwise required to do so (such as the start of a sentence).


'''Neopagan or Neo-pagan:''' This book does not hyphenate the word Neopagan and capitalises the first letter. From Wikipedia: ''&quot;Pagan&quot; and &quot;Neopagan&quot;, when capitalized, refer to religions, or members of a Pagan or Neopagan religion, &quot;in the same way as one would describe a 'Christian' or a 'Jew'.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopaganism]&lt;/sup&gt;'' Neopagan and Pagan are defined as separate terms and must not be used interchanagbly.


'''Pagan:''' This book capitalises the first letter (see ''Neopagan'' above). Neopagan and Pagan are defined as separate terms and must not be used interchanagbly.


'''Sabbat and Esbat:''' This book capitalises the first letter. Never use the religious term ''&quot;Sabbath&quot;'' when referring to a Neopagan Sabbat festival.  Also, the first letter for names of the individual Sabbat and Esbat observances should also be capitalised (such as Samhain or Mabon).


'''Seasons - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter:''' This book capitalises the first letter of the four seasons.

==Discussion==
===Where did Indigenous Australian Culture go?===
I have removed the entire section about Indigenous Australian Culture, prefering to instead incorporate the information through out the book in relevant areas. For example Bush medicine or Bush Tucker ---&gt; Botanica --&gt; Essential Oils and how used by Indigenous Australians ... or Australian Ceremonies ---&gt; observances and symmetries. I have preserved the original items listed in the contents ([[User:PoizonMyst/Australian_Esoterica#Indigenous_Australian_Culture|here]]) to keep a note of areas I want to cover.
===Where did Equipment go?===
Again ... this area needs a complete rework/reordering ... possibily incorporating ARTS and also Botanica? or better chapter titles/definitions. Anyway, list of orinial preserved [[User:PoizonMyst/Australian_Esoterica#Equipment_and_Arts_need_to_be_changed_around_and_sections_better_clarified|here]].

      <comment>As the user who added this stub in 2008 did not add any discussion, and the edit summary was thoroughly unhelpful, I'm removing this.  On the other hand, I'm not sure it should be on WB in the first place.  Also, spelling.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A good place to start to answer this question might be The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a treatise by Eric S. Raymond, who considered theories of software engineering in terms of two fundamentally different development styles - the hierarchical and secretive model of Bill Gates' proprietary Microsoft which he dubbed the 'cathedral' model used by most of the commercial design organizations, and contrasted that with the apparently chaotic approach of Linus Torvalds during the development of Linux, in which the source was freely available and anyone could participate - which Raymond compared with the activities of an open market, or bazaar where people organize themselves.

There are essentially two sorts of authority: 

 - Hierarchical or 'religious' authority led by a ubiquitous monotheistic god who appoints a single mortal monarch /royal family/ king / pope
   a few cardinals or nobles selected by the monarch, 
   several priests or knights trained and selected by the nobles but authorized by the  monarch, 
   a majority of followers who either do as they are told or are liable to be punished.

 - Sapient or 'wisdom' authority, in which people specialise and refine their skills, 
   combine their experience and accept that there is a limitation to their superior knowledge. 

Unfortunately, most of us are intellectually lazy, and tend to defer to 'experts' who then establish universities and protect themselves from criticism in the so-called '''ivory towers''' of a hierarchy!  
For wise experts like every one else tend to laziness and hate having their pet theories mauled by challenges that are difficult to meet.

We humans were, for much of our history, hunters and gatherers. Then hunters and gatherers specialized, with the gatherers turning to agriculture and settlements, whilst the hunters and herdsmen continued the traditional seasonal migration and exploration lifestyle. Much human history is about wars and invasions in which the trained hunters turned their attention to the rich agriculturalists, whom they 'hunted' killed and finally 'herded' by fear of torture or death, the very same technique used to entrap wild animals.

Religion placed a cloak of respectability over the brutality of warfare, and also trained the followers to obey orders, and to react to common threats, which is why heresy and apostasy was, and in some societies, still is commonly a capital offense punishable by death. However, religion also includes moral and cultural aspects which regulate normal civilized behaviour, as well as the conduct of participants on the battlefield or during war time.

Globalization is mainly a European phenomenon following the discovery of the New World, for societies in Asia and China were tightly regulated, and had little opportunity for exploration, whilst in Africa and the Americas, there was enough space for everyone and so tribes and communities were common, whilst kingdoms and empires were relatively rare. 

It may be significant that '''the age of the enlightenment''' which followed the colonization and exploitation of the New World in the 18th and 18th centuries allowed  'outrageous' 'heretical' and 'disgusting' intellectual and philosophical ideas &amp; thoughts to be developed which had a dramatic impact in moral and social reform. The most significant reforms were the French Revolution, and '''Les droits d'Homme''' and the '''American Constitution''' which followed shortly afterwards.

Reformers aspired towards governmental consolidation, centralisation and primacy of the nation-state, and perversely, greater rights for common people. There was also a strong attempt to supplant the authority of aristocracy and established churches in social and political life, forces that reformers considered to be reactionary, oppressive and superstitious.The Enlightenment also focused on natural rights, the social contract and checks and balances to power. It opened up peoples eyes to knowledge, and saw the birth of the scientific method.

In the 20th century, warfare became industrialized and highly efficient killing machines and fearful weapons emerged. In in reaction to a global conflict, the '''United Nations''' was formed and in 1948 issued '''The Universal Declaration of Human Rights''' without which modern anarchic ideas could not have taken root.

Like every other human society, despite its philosophy of equality, anarchist leaders emerged, and the movement was colonized by opportunists intent on punishing what they saw as 'evil'. Anarchy has thus come to mean anyone who uses force against 'regular authorities'.

*[[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons|'''SPANISHPOD LESSONS''']]
*:Lessons based on [http://spanishpod.com SpanishPod] newbie lessons for beginners without knowledge of Spanish; teaching language is English; no prerequisites.



&lt;!--
*Aesop's Fables [[Image:00%.svg]]
*:For beginners with some knowledge of Spanish.

*:Spanish short stories from the book “Novelas Cortas” by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón read by Karen Savage. For intermediate learners.



== Introduction ==
===What is this wikibook?===
This wikibook is quite different from a normal Spanish course. In fact, it is more like a collection of booklets, which accompany audio courses and audio books. As it is an electronic wikibook, it combines audio files with transcripts, vocabulary lists, interactive exercises, images, forums, etc.

===How to read this wikibook===
As suggested by its title, the structure of this wikibook emphasizes ''choice''; thus, there really isn't a single way of reading it but you can ''choose'' how to explore the material offered in this wikibook. Here are some common user types:
* ''Hoppers'' jump from one lesson to another using the tables of contents, the index of dialogue lines, links between related lessons, or just random browsing. If they encounter a lesson they already know, they often listen to it again to see what they remember.
* ''Old-school learners'' listen to the lessons in the order they are indexed in the tables of contents. They also have a system to listen to the lessons again after certain time intervals (typically after some days, after some weeks, and after some months). 
* ''Commuters'' download audio lessons to their audio players or burn them on CDs to listen to them multiple times on their daily commute. In the evening they read through the corresponding pages of this wikibook and choose the next lessons.
* ''Fans'' of particular podcasts don't really care about the order in which they enjoy their favourite shows. They also tend to listen to particular lessons over and over again just for the fun of it.

===How to use this wikibook===
A few additional technical warnings and tips:
*The built-in audio player of Firefox is not recommended for playing the audio files because it tends to skip the last second of each file. The VLC media player is also not recommended because it tends to skip the first second of each file. 
*For printing use the links to printable versions and PDF versions on the '''top, right'''. Printing with the links on the '''left''' (&quot;Create a book&quot;, &quot;Download as PDF&quot;, and &quot;Printable version&quot;) generates inferior results. 
*Note that all printable pages include a copy of the complete GNU free documentation license.
*To organize your personal sets of lessons, use the &quot;Create a book&quot; link on the left. 
*The SpanishPod newbie lessons are also available as a '''podcast''': see the [http://www.martin-kraus.org/feeds/spanishbychoice.rss RSS file] and the [http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=300660557 iTunes page]. 

===How to contribute to this wikibook===
Please correct any typos and errors that you find. If you want to include a link or image: be bold and just do it! Apart from the SpanishPod newbie lessons licensed under a creative commons license and the LibriVox recording of Novelas Cortas, further suitable podcasts and audio material should be included in this wikibook. Unfortunately, most podcasts are not published under a suitable license for Wikimedia Commons and/or make (fair) use of copyrighted material, which is not acceptable for Wikimedia Commons. On the other hand, the public domain [http://librivox.org/newcatalog/search_advanced.php?title=&amp;author=&amp;cat=&amp;genre=&amp;status=all&amp;type=&amp;language=Spanish&amp;date=&amp;reader=&amp;bc=&amp;mc=&amp;action=Search Spanish audiobooks at librivox.org] and the articles in the
[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiproyecto:Wikipedia_grabada Spanish version of spoken Wikipedia] should be suitable. Please discuss any suggestions or ideas on the discussion page or contact [[User:Martin Kraus|Martin]].

===Activities===

====[[Canvas 2D Web Apps]]====
I've been thinking about how to teach programming web apps for some years. What is the best technology? What are the best tools? What is the best literature? I'm still not sure; thus, I'm writing a wikibook to try one approach. So far, I'm quite happy with the results: the book uses JavaScript and the HTML Canvas 2D Context and shows how to use this for a combination of automata-based programming and reactive programming. The resulting web apps can be used in desktop and mobile web browsers as well as in iBooks. 

====[[Cg Programming]]====
After having spent quite a bit of time on the GLSL wikibook, I adapted it to Cg (and slightly extended it); mainly in order to provide students with more suitable learning material.

====[[GLSL Programming]]====
I've written a wikibook on GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) programming to support a course that I've been teaching in October 2011. One of the basic ideas is to introduce learners to the way GLSL is used in context, in particular in Unity, Blender, and OpenGL+GLUT. This could be extended to WebGL, Android, and iOS. Notable feature: section numbers in the PDF version.

====[[German]]====
I've been working a bit on reorganizing [[German]], making the Level II levels accessible again and trying to integrate the exercises in the Level I lessons. There is still a lot of work to do on this book but I'm not really finding the time or motivation to do it.

====[[Spanish by Choice]]====
I'm the main author of [[Spanish by Choice]], a collection of wikibooklets for everyone who wants to learn Spanish. With this wikibook I've also been trying to better understand the possibilities of wikibooks in general. There could be a lot of stuff done with the Novelas Cortas because there are excellent open-source audio recordings available but I'm not quite sure how to do it with reasonable effort.

Hi Leonid, Your corrections are welcome. Russia is still not complete as you can see by the several missing images, but USSR is OK. Rick

Hi Leonid,  The stamp is USSR type B1, B2 or B3. I cannot tell which one because the picture is not accurate. Someone shorted the distance between the town mark and the frank. By the way, the Russia stamp, 9th from the top, is new to me. Thanks for showing me this web site.   Rick</text>

== Introduction to Biological Databases ==

Organisms are categorized as [[w:Prokaryotes|Prokaryotes]] and [[w:Eukaryotes|Eukaryotes]].
The central dogma of molecular biology lays down that DNA is transcribed to mRNA, which is then translated to proteins. The proteins carry out life functions in the cell.

The genetic material in a cell consists of several strands of DNA double helix formed into a super coiled structure. The DNA molecule consists of sugar-phosphate backbone on which nucleotides form base pairs. The 4 bases are denoted by the letters A,C,T and G.
T pairs with A and C pairs with G in the DNA double helix.

== The Relational Model ==

;Set: A collection of objects

: Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be two sets, &lt;math&gt;A = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \{1, 2, 4\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Cartesian Product: of &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; is the set consisting all possible pairs taking one object from set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the other from set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

: {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;times; &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt; {{=}} {(&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;,1),(&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;,2),(&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;,4),(&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;,1),(&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;,2),(&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;,4),(&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;,1),(&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;,2),(&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;,4)}}}

;Relation: is a subset of the Cartesian product.


=== An example of a relation ===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!Gene ID|| Name|| Annotation || Expt ID || Expt. Desc. || Expression Level
|-
|g2347|| p53|| Tumor Suppressor || e0 || Heat Shock || +2
|-
|g2347|| p53|| Tumor Suppressor || e1 || Cold Shock || -1
|-
|g2347|| p53|| Tumor Suppressor || e2 || Desiccation || 0
|-
|...|| ...|| ... || ... || ... || ...
|}

The above is an example of an Un-Normalized Relation. And has the following problems:
* '''Redundancy''': The gene information is repeated for different experiments and potentially experiment information can be common to several genes
* '''Update Anomaly''': If the annotation of a gene needs to be updated, several rows of the table need update.
* '''Deletion Anomaly''': Deleting a gene can result in loss of information about an experiment.

== Designing Tables ==

=== Entity-Relationship Diagrams ===

[[Image:BulbgraphOnOff.gif]] &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; E/R Diagram &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; Relations/Tables

The above figure suggests how the E/R model is used in database design. We start with ideas about the information we want to model and render them in the E/R model. The abstract E/R design is then converted to a schema in the data-specification language of some DBMS. Most commonly, this DBMS uses the relational model. If so, then by a fairly mechanical process, the abstract design is converted to a concrete, relational design, called a &quot;relational database schema&quot;.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
!Entity (Nouns)|| Relation (Verbs)
|-
|Gene|| Subjected To
|-
|Experiment||
|}

==== Reading a 2-way relationship ====
[[Image:2-way-relation.svg|center|400px]]

Many-to-many relation (no arrows)
# One A '''can''' be related to many B's e.g one '''gene''' can be '''subjected to''' many '''experiments'''
# One B '''can''' be related to many A's e.g. one '''experiment''' can '''subject''' many '''genes'''

[[Image:2-way-relation-with-arrow.png|center|400px]]

One-to-one (arrows in both sides)
# One A '''can''' be related '''at most''' one B e.g. one '''DNA molecule''' can be '''transcribed''' to at most one '''RNA primary transcript'''
# One B '''can''' be related '''at most''' one A e.g. one '''RNA primary transcript''' can be '''transcribed''' from at most one '''DNA molecule'''

[[Image:2-way-many-to-one-relation.png|center|600px]]

many-to-one (an arrow to the '''one''' side)
# One A '''can''' be related to '''at most''' one B e.g. one '''codon''' can '''encode''' at most one '''amino acid'''
# One B '''can''' be related to '''many''' A's e.g. one '''amino acid''' can be '''encoded''' by many '''codons'''

==== A 3-way relationship ====
[[Image:3-way-ERD.svg|center|400px]]

S =&gt; Student, C =&gt; Course, I =&gt; Instructor
# Any (S,C) pair '''can''' have many I's
# Any (S,I) pair '''can''' have many C's
# Any (C,I) pair '''can''' have many S's

==== Replacing a 3-way relationship ====

The following is another example of the 3-way relationship (ternary relationship)
[[Image:cs5634-3-way-prescribe.png|center|250px]]
The relationship can be replaced with a set of binary relationships as in the following:

For instance, 

A = &gt; Doctor, B =&gt; Patient, C =&gt; Drug, R =&gt; Prescribe

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!R|| A|| B|| C
|-
|r1||	a1||	b1||	c2
|-
|r2||	a1||	b2||	c1
|-
|r3||	a2||	b1||	c1
|-
|r4||	a2||	b1||	c2
|-
|}

However, the diagram is not equivalent to the following diagram:

[[Image:cs5634-2-way-prescribe-notequiv.png|center|220px]]

The 2=way relations in the diagram are (A,B), (B,C), and (C,A). The three binary relations have different meaning with the given ternary relation. For example, association of a set of doctors with a certain pair of a patient and a drug cannot be modeled with the binary relationships.

It is modeling decision whether a relation should be represented as a ternary relation or a set binary relations such as the above.

==== Boxing a 2-way relationship ====
Usually, boxing a thing means that the entity is important to have its own space rather than a concept to model relationships. When boxing a relation, the name of the entity often becomes the noun phrases from the verb in the relation name.

For example, the ER model such as the following 
[[Image:cs5634-2-way-birth.png|center|300px]]

An examples of tables for the model is:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!Birth|| Mother|| Baby
|-
|b1||	Sue ||	Tom
|-
|b2||	Sue ||	Marry
|-
|b3||	Jane ||	Robert
|-

|}

The following model also can be used to replace the original model. But it has different meaning with the previous model.  
An example of tables for the model is:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!Birth|| Mother|| Baby
|-
|b1||	Sue ||	Tom
|-
|b1||	Sue ||	Marry
|-
|b2||	Jane ||	Robert
|-
|}

Such a boxing of an relationship give more flexibility.

=== Attributes, Keys  ===

The properties of a entity or a relation is called as attributes. The attributes are denoted as balloons attached to the entity or the relation. The attributes are also required to be in table as columns.

Gene expression process can be divided into several steps and transcription process is one of the steps. mRNA is synthesized from DNA through the transcription process. Also, cDNA is synthesized from the mRNA through reverse transcription process. A microarray is a chip that a lot of DNA sequences are aligned on its surface. In DNA microarray experiment, the synthesized cDNA is poured on the chip and the cDNA binds to complementing DNA sequence on the chip by hybridization. The bound cDNA is measured to quantify the gene expression level in the experiment. 

As mentioned before, a relation also can have attributes.

Here is an example of relations with attributes.

[[Image:cs5634-2-way-takes-attr.png|center|250px]]


An attribute or a set of attributes whose value is unique for each instance of entity is called a candidate key. There can be multiple candidate keys for an entity and the candidate key selected to identify the entity is called a (primary) key. The name of the key is underlined in ER digram. For example, ssn and sid is unique for all students so both are candidate keys. either ssn or sid can be selected as the primary key for entity type 'student'.

=== Creating tables from ERD ===
Converting an E/R design to a relational database schema is fairly mechanical and straightforward
# Turn each entity set into a relation with the same set of attributes, and
# Replace a relationship by a relation whose attributes are the keys for the connected entity sets

For 
# many-many relation - the key for the relation representing relationship must be the union of keys from the participating entity sets
# many-one relation - the key for the relation representing relationship must come from the many part
# one-one relation - key for either of the participating entity set could be a key for the relation

For example, 

[[Image:cs5634-2-way-takes-key.png|center|300px]]

The key of 'takes' depend on the cardinality of the relation. The key for each cardinality of the relation is:

#many to many relation -&gt; a,c
#one to many relation -&gt; c
#one to one relation -&gt; a or c

If 'takes' is an one to many cardinality relation, the tables generated from the model would be
# &lt;math&gt;Student(\underline{a}, b)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Courses(\underline{c}, d)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Takes(\underline{a}, \underline{c})&lt;/math&gt;

Here are examples of generated tables for 3-way relations. Tables for A,B, and C is omitted.

[[Image:cs5634-3-way-ABC-key-noarrow.png|center|150px]]

# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a}, \underline{b},\underline{c})&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:cs5634-3-way-ABC-key-onearrow.png|center|150px]]

# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a}, \underline{b}, c )&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:cs5634-3-way-ABC-key-twoarrows.png|center|150px]]

either one of the following two tables is possible.
# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a}, \underline{b}, c)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a}, b, \underline{c})&lt;/math&gt;

The following is an example for an unary relation.
[[Image:cs5634-1-way-key.png|center|200px]]

# &lt;math&gt;A(\underline{a})&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a1}, \underline{a2})&lt;/math&gt;

Here is another example. 
[[Image:cs5634-2-way-takes-rel-key.png|center|350px]]

# &lt;math&gt;A(\underline{a})&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;C(\underline{c})&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a}, \underline{c}, r)&lt;/math&gt;

== Weak sets ==

There can be many counties with the same name in different states. For example, counties with the name of Montgomery are in Virginia, Texas, Maryland, so on. So the name of a county cannot be the key for the entity of counties. However, a key for counties can be acquired by combining the name of states and the name of the county. Such entities that do not have key in their attributes are called weak sets or weak entities. The keys of such entities can be acquired from attributes of certain related entities. The related entities are often called identifying entities. The relation from the weak set to its identifying entities are called identifying relations. 
 
[[Image:CS5634-counties-weak-set.png|center|400px]]

The above ER diagram models shows a binary relation between States and Counties. The double bordered rectangle denotes the weak set 
and the identifying entity is States because combination of two characters for a state and the name of a county identify a county. The notation of double bordered relation in the diagram denotes the identifying relation too. The identifying entities can be found by searching the double bordered diamonds and see the arrow from the diamonds. 


[[Image:DMiB weak set.svg|center|400px]]

''Weak sets'' are entity sets that don't supply all of their own keys (see diagram)  They rely on other entity sets to supply some or all of their keys. We encode this E/R diagram as:
# &lt;math&gt;A(\underline{a}, c)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;B(\underline{a}, \underline{c}, d)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;R(\underline{a}, \underline{c})&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; does not have &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; written twice.  We do not need to encode the weak relationship completely.  It is implicit from the encoding of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:DMiB weak set more.svg|center|600px]]

We encode the entity sets of this next E/R diagram as:
# &lt;math&gt;A(\underline{a}, b)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;B(\underline{a}, \underline{c}, \underline{e}, d)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;C(\underline{e})&lt;/math&gt;

=== Questions about weak sets ===

}}

[[Image:DMiB weak set 3.svg|center|400px]]

{{dynamic navigation
|title = Is this E/R diagram valid?
|bodystyle=text-align:left;
margin:10px;
|body =
No, it is not valid.  This diagram means:
# For every &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, there is one &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;
# For every &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, there are many &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;s
# For every &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, there is one &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;}
This does not exclude the possibility of one &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; having many &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;s.  There is no unambiguous way to draw a weak set that draws keys from two other entity sets with an E/R diagram without having two separate relationships.
}}

=== Causes of weak sets ===

[[Image:DMiB convert relation to entity set.svg|center|700px]]

# Converting a relationship to an entity set (see diagram)
# Hierarchy

Notice in #1 that there are arrows pointing to all the original entity sets.  We need these, because each relation entity may only have one &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

Hierarchy is an interesting situation, which leads us into inheritance.

== Inheritance ==

In this section, we will discuss inheritance; what it is, why we use it, and how to use it.

=== What is inheritance? ===

''Inheritance'' occurs when one thing (an entity set) is a subset of something else (some other entity set).

One way to start examining if an entity set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; inherits from another entity set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is to ask if &quot;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; IS A &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inheritance is when you can say `$A$ IS A $B$' with a straight face, and if you ever run for office no one will point out that you said it. ~Naren Ramakrishnan&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Are the following valid inheritance?''
# apple IS A fruit
# apple IS A cow
# g23 IS A gene

#1 is correct, because an apple is a fruit.  #2 is not correct, because an apple is not a cow.  #3, however, is not correct because g23 is a specific gene, it does not quite demonstrate what we want to see in inheritance.  A better way to test for inheritance is if you can say &quot;$A$ IS A TYPE OF $B$&quot;.

=== Why do we use inheritance? ===

We use inheritance to give subsets of entity sets the attributes of its parent entity set, and let it extend that with extra information.  When we say that &quot;$A$ IS A $B$&quot;, we are already communicating a lot
of information.  For example, when we say that an &quot;apple IS A fruit&quot;, even if we don't quite know what an &quot;apple&quot; is, we've communicated that an &quot;apple&quot; has seeds, is a part of a larger plant, and tastes better than a typical vegetable.

[[Image:DMiB multiple inheritance.svg|center|500px]]

Examine the diagram.  A mammal is an animal, and so is a reptile.  Both have an id, genus, weight, species, and safety level (whatever that means).  Both mammals and reptiles inherit these attributes.  It's important to note that in an inheritance relationship, the child entity set inherits the key of the parent entity set.  In this example, the key for both mammals and reptiles is their animal id.

The reason why we bother creating separate entity sets for mammals and reptiles is that we want to add attributes to each.  Notice that mammals have a hair count and reptiles have an egg count.  Instead of
creating an entirely new entity set to explain this, we simply use inheritance to say that a mammal is an animal that has a hair count, and a reptile is an animal that has an egg count.  Some animals have both a hair count, and an egg count.  Let's call these animals ``weirdos''.  We can see from the diagram, that we do not have to add any extra attributes to weirdos if we just use multiple inheritance and make a weirdo both a mammal and a reptile.  Implicitly, a weirdo is also an animal and has all the attributes of an animal, including the key, id.  In other words, inheritance is transitive.

=== How do we use inheritance? ===

We encode the entity sets in the diagram as:
# &lt;math&gt;Animals(\underline{id}, genus, species, weight, safetylevel)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Mammals(\underline{id}, hair count)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;Reptiles(\underline{id}, egg count)&lt;/math&gt;

We don't have to encode weirdos, they are implicit.  Notice that while weak sets have different keys, inheriting sets don't have different keys.  Notice also that inheriting sets get ''all'' of their
parents' attributes, not just some of them.

=== Questions about inheritance ===

{{dynamic navigation

margin:10px;
|body =
Yes, it could be valid, depending on the relationships.  Consider the relationship between rural counties and states as &quot;sells to&quot;.  Also, notice that because we have single inheritance, we have to add
an attribute to rural counties.

== Introduction of FD ==

Functional Dependency: X-&gt;Y  if two tuples agree on X, then they agree on Y.
e.g.   &quot;gene_id -&gt; name&quot; and &quot;gid-&gt; annotation&quot; are FDs, but &quot;name-&gt;gene_id&quot; and &quot;name-&gt;annotation&quot; are NOT FDs.

'''Relationship between key and FD:'''

A set of attribute{A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...A&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;} is a key for relation R if 

(1) {A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...A&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;} functionally determines all other attributes;

(2) when no proper subset of {A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...A&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;} functionally determin all other attributes, it is called superkey (or Candidate key?)

'''rules of FDs:'''
  
Observation:
         Correct: 
                X-&gt;Y, A-&gt;B:   XA-&gt;BY;   
                X-&gt;AY:   X-&gt;A, X-&gt;Y;
                X-&gt;Y, A-&gt;Y: XA-&gt;Y;
         Incorrect:
                XY-&gt;A: X-&gt;A, Y-&gt;A;
Formal inference rules for functional dependencies:
         Armstrong’s axioms:
                1. Reflexivity: If Y &amp;sube; X then X -&gt; Y (called trivial FD);
                2. Transitivity: If X -&gt; Y and Y -&gt; Z then X -&gt; Z;
                3. Augmentation: If X -&gt; Y then XZ -&gt; YZ where Z is a set of attributes.

'''Where do FDs come from?'''

looking either at 
               (1) Domain Knowledge (the meaning of the attributes); 
               (2) the data;

|-
!a|| b|| c
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3
|-

|}

b-&gt;a is not FD, but a-&gt;b is a valid FD.

== BCNF ==

'''Formal way to break tables:'''

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!gene|| name|| annotation || experiment id || experiment description || experiment level 
|-
|...|| ...|| ... || ... || ... || ...
|}

&amp;rArr;  
          R1 (gid, name, annotation);    gid-&gt;name annotation;
          R2 (exp id, exp desc);         exp id -&gt; exp desc;
          R3 (gid, expid, exp level);   gid, expid -&gt; exp level;


&lt;math&gt;
Original Relation -&gt; find\ \ a \  FD \  X-&gt;Y \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    {X, Y}, &amp; \hbox{gid, name, annotation;} \\
    {everything\ \  except Y}, &amp; \hbox{gid, exp id, exp desc, exp level;} 
  \end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
gid, exp id, exp desc, exp level \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    {exp id, exp desc}, &amp; \hbox{;} \\
    {gid, \  exp id, \ exp level }, &amp; \hbox{;} 
  \end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

A relation R is in BCNF if for all dependencies X -&gt; Y , at least one of the following holds:

• X  -&gt; Y is a trivial FD (Y &amp;sube; X)

• X is a superkey for R

== 3NF ==

Formal Definition: a relation R is in 3NF if for all dependencies X® Y in F+, at least one of the following holds:

• X  -&gt; Y is a trivial FD (Y &amp;sube; X)

• X is a superkey for R

• Y &amp;sub; a candidate key for R


== Comparison of BCNF and 3NF ==

== Lossy Decomposition ==

Suppose we have a table such as the one below.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!a || b || c
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3
|-
| 4 || 2 || 6
|}

into the following &quot;normalized&quot; tables

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;46%&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!a || b
|-
| 1 || 2
|-
| 4 || 2
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;46%&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!b || c
|-
|2 || 3
|-
|2 || 6
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This means we followed

: b → a or
: b → c

as our FD for the decomposition of the original table. (Remember, BCNF decomposes X → Y to the sets {X, Y} and {everything except Y}). However, notice that column b has non-unique values (two of digit 2). When we recombine these two tables in a join, we wind up with a table in which the original relationships are lost:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!a || b || c
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3
|-
| 1 || 2 || 6
|-
| 4 || 2 || 3
|-
| 4 || 2 || 6
|}

We declare this as a '''lossy decomposition''', because the FDs assumed by the decomposed tables do not hold true (both b → a and b → c are false). Thus, BCNF can not remove all forms of redundancy. We will need to use another model, Multivalued Dependency (MD), to aid us in decomposing tables properly for normalization.

= Multivalued Dependency (MD) =

Let's explore a concrete scenario. We'd like to represent belongings of affluent students. We create a '''multivalued dependency (MD)''' of

: SID →→ car

read as, &quot;A given student ID can have many cars.&quot; 

Compare this to an FD like

: SID → name

which we read as, &quot;A given SID can have at most one name.&quot;

Suppose we also had the following MD:

: SID →→ clothes

We can get the following table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!SID || car || clothes
|-
| 1 || Honda || jeans
|-
| 1 || Toyota || khakis
|-
| 1 || Toyota || jeans
|-
| 1 || Honda || khakis
|-
| … || … || …
|}

Perhaps we want to decompose this table further. We decompose along the MD of

: SID →→ car

This leaves us with {SID, clothes}, leaving us with the following tables

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; SID →→ car &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; {SID, clothes} &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;46%&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!SID || car
|-
| 1 || Honda
|-
| 1 || Toyota
|-
| … || …
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;46%&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
!sid || clothes
|-
|1 || jeans
|-
|1 || khakis
|-
| … || …
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

We can't ''actually'' do this, because these are ''not'' FDs! Neither SID →→ car or SID →→ clothes have a superkey. The key must be all three attributes. We need new rules for decomposing MDs.

== Rules for MDs ==

=== Spotting trivial MDs ===

We say that an MD {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;X&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;Y&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is trivial in {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;/VAR&gt;}} if {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;X&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;cup; &lt;VAR&gt;Y&lt;/VAR&gt; {{=}} {all attributes} }}.

For example, consider the following relation {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;}} where we have the MD {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
! a || b
|-
|1 || 2
|-
|1 || 3
|-
|2 || 2
|-
| … || …
|}

Because we can have many {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}s to each {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, we can not generate data to violate the MD.

Now consider the following relation {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; | {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
! a || b || c
|-
|1 || 2 || 6
|-
|1 || 3 || 7
|-
|2 || 2 || 6
|-
| … || … || …
|}

In this case, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is non-trivial, because the relation is three-way.

=== Non-trivial MDs come in pairs ===

In fact, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}} has a partner MD which is also non-trivial: {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;}}

Here are the listings of all non-trivial pairs of MDs in {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
|
{|
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|-
|
{|
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|-
|
{|
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}

Compare this to examples of trivial MDs for {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;bc&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;ab&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;ac&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;bc&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;ab&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;ca&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|…
|}

=== Implications of FDs do not hold for MDs ===

In FDs, we know &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow YZ \iff \begin{array}{c}
  X \rightarrow Y \\
  \mbox{and} \\
  X \rightarrow Z
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

However, this same implication does not exist for MDs. That is,  &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow\rightarrow YZ \nLeftrightarrow \begin{array}{c}
  X \rightarrow\rightarrow Y \\
  \mbox{and} \\
  X \rightarrow\rightarrow Z
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== MDs are actually about independence ===

Given the MDs
: {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
: and
: {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;}}

We know that, for each {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
* there can be many {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
* there can be many {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
* and, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}s are independent of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;c&lt;/VAR&gt;}}s with respect to {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which we represent symbolically as &lt;math&gt;b \perp c | a&lt;/math&gt; [NOTE: the actual first binary relation symbol should be &lt;tt&gt;\Perp&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;\perp&lt;/tt&gt;, but this symbol is not supported by Mediawiki.]

=== Every FD is an MD ===

By definition, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;X&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;Y&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;VAR&gt;X&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;Y&lt;/VAR&gt;}}. If {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;X&lt;/VAR&gt;}} has at most one {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;Y&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, then it satisfies the condition of having many {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;Y&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

For example, given the following relation

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
! a || b
|-
| … || …
|}

and an FD of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, then we also have a trivial MD of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

Now, consider the FD {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}} with following relation:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto&quot;
|-
! a || b || c || d
|-
| … || … || … || …
|}

In this case, we actually have two ''non''-trivial MDs:

{|
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;b&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;a&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rarr;&amp;rarr; &lt;VAR&gt;cd&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}

(Remember, [[#Non-trivial_MDs_come_in_pairs|non-trivial MDs come in pairs]].)

Sometimes people are just too slow! And then they hurry too much! 
In this lesson JP and Liliana teach us how to create time pressure and how to react to it 
and—most importantly—to relax. The keyword is '''tranquila''' – relaxed (for feminine nouns).

** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

:Thank you! I'm really curious to see how things work here. Well, I started working on a wikibook, which I called [[Spanish by Choice]]. I just started it today; thus, there isn't much to see yet. Could you have a look nonetheless? I think this project fits best in wikibooks but other people might think differently; thus, I'm curious to get your opinion about it. Thanks again! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:00, 16 September 2008 (UTC)

::I've been patrolling some pages of the book it seems ok (still much work to be done yet but going along great and at a very high speed), one can even use the layout you adopted to create similar books for other languages.

::You can chose to create a template on the book to include into those pages in place of adding all the text. (see about templates [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Template here], that page makes it a bit more confusing than it is make a try and see if you like it, at a basic level it is like a macro that can be used to replace repetitive texts or structures), if you have any problem talk to me and I will attempt to help you. 
:::Thanks for the hint!

::Since you have invested much energy and effort in the structuring and layout, you should document some of the options and why you have taken then on the main talk (or a similar arrangement) so to avoid any edit conflicts if some other editor decides to rework it, for instance take a look on the [[C++ Programming/Conventions|book conventions]] adopted on the [[C++ Programming]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:02, 21 September 2008 (UTC)
:::Yes, I'll do that. But right now, everything is still quite unclear... for example I just changed the overall structure from a level-based to a podcast-based hierarchy (because this way there are no broken links on the top level and the number of lessons on the second level is limited to the number of lessons in each podcast). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:51, 22 September 2008 (UTC)
::On the page [[Spanish by Choice/Lessons of level A1]] the table lists ''source and ID'' but the last items seem to have some ids missing 9,12,14,15 did you name the pages in error? if so you can move them to the right location and tag them with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, if they are still to be done you probably should add a place holder so to inform others that you are still working on them...
:::The IDs were defined by SpanishPod.com and are included to identify the original SpanishPod lessons more easily; I don't know why they don't use a continuous sequence. (Well, I accidentally created one page for A0009, but this should be deleted. I set a rederict to A0010 for now.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:51, 22 September 2008 (UTC) 
::If you need advertisement or help with the book make a post into the some of the [[Wikibooks:Reading room]] sub pages, it still wont guarantee high visibility but you would find some people working on similar projects or without an active project . For publicity the best option is making posts on other sites specially forums or blogs that deal with the book subject, other interesting sites are newsgroups or url sharing services like http://delicious.com (example [http://delicious.com/url/03ce0a42ec3f416444d630c194fe9bbe using C++ Programming]).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:23, 21 September 2008 (UTC)

== Re: [[Template:Print version change]] ==

Hello Martin, how are you doing?

The {{tlx|Print version change}} template uses CSS classes to change the text that's displayed on different display media, like print and on screen. To see the difference, you actually need to print the page, or click &quot;Print Preview&quot; in your browser. The changes should be apparent when you do that. Unfortunately, there isn't a good way to show text that only appears on the printable version page here on the wiki.

Let me know if you have any other questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:03, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

In case you don't mind, I just wanna ask u. What are these forums all about? And why forums for each and every chapter? A single forum would be enough, wouldn't it - &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 16:19, 14 November 2008 (UTC)
:These forums are for discussions of the lesson content of each lesson. If there was only one forum for all lessons then readers would have to always specify, which lesson they refer to. Also, readers who are studying a certain lesson are probably only interested in the discussions about this lesson. I consider it a service to the reader to offer one forum for each lesson. (Note that there is also a talk/discussion page for each page/module of a wikibook, not just one for the whole book!) Thus, no, one forum wouldn't be enough.--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:33, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

== Vandalism fixing ==

Keep up the nice work on the Spanish book and such. I just though you might want to check out [[Wikibooks:Reverting]]. It showa how you don't have to undo each edit one by one, you can clean up the whole page all at once. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] ([[User talk:Taxman|talk]]) 13:23, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks! Funny, I read this before but didn't really understand it, I guess. Also I realized that I put the warning on the user page instead of the talk page. Well, I guess that user doesn't really care. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:45, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

::Yeah, they don't care for sure. Undo is great for past edits in the middle and sometimes you need to do both. It was a pain before the undo feature was available, since everything that couldn't be simply reverted had to be fixed manually. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] ([[User talk:Taxman|talk]]) 14:00, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

== Discussions and contributing ==

Discussions don't mean that people must stop contributing. Discussion and contributing can go on simultaneously. In fact a few pages recently discussed on votes for deletion that was initially for deletion ended up closing as keep due to substantial changes having been made. Sometimes people may find solutions other than through discussion, and sometimes people may decide changes were not enough or things need to go in a different direction. I think when conflict arises than having people stop contributing might make sense in order to reduce conflict and help prevent things from becoming heated, but even than other people who were not involved in the conflict might find solutions by continuing to contribute. As [[Wikibooks:Decision making#Following this Guideline]] says: &lt;tt&gt;''Wikibookians are encouraged to be '''bold'''''&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;''there is no single &quot;right way&quot; to achieve community consensus''&lt;/tt&gt;. I'm posting this here rather than in VFD, because I think its a bit off topic. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:21, 17 December 2008 (UTC)

== Help pages ==

I noticed some of your changed in the help namespace. I was actually hoping to remove dependency on &lt;tt&gt;Help:Introduction 2&lt;/tt&gt; completely, and to eventually merge pages which just list other pages in the help namespace together into [[Help:Contents]], so that there would be one table of contents. I hadn't done so yet because I was trying to weed out duplicates and the like first, and have been taking things one step at a time on and off. I was hoping to eventually have a table of contents for the Help namespace similar to [[Cookbook]]'s or [[Wikiversity:Community Portal]] at some point, with other help pages being formatted more like most pages in books on Wikibooks are. Maybe even eventually create a printable version.

What do you think? Do you have any objections to that? Do you mind if I remove inclusion of Help:Introduction 2 from pages you added it to? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:38, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

:Well, I was just playing around to make the design of the most important help pages more consistent using &lt;tt&gt;Help:Introduction 2&lt;/tt&gt; as a common navigational element. If you want to replace it by another navigational element to browse through the help pages just go ahead. Also, just go ahead and change [[Help:Contents]] if you want to. (But I don't see why you would want to remove the navigational element from pages that you want to delete anyways once [[Help:Contents]] contains all the links.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:56, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

:: Well I'm not sure what is left to delete. Like recipes in the cookbook , I don't think the help namespace is really meant to be read in a certain reading order. I think the navigational aids of going from one page to the next hinders more than it helps. Most help pages don't even bother with navigational aids and I think for now at least that is a good thing. I've mostly been using some of the pages that just list help pages to aid in a clean up effort with the intentions to eventually use them as a bases for how to list things on Help:Contents. However with recent renewed interest in the help namespace, I might need to rethink some of my approach and go ahead and change Help:Contents like you said. I've probably been taking lack of interest in the help namespace for granted and relying on it too much. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:46, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

:::I agree that the linear order doesn't make much sense, I just added the links to the &quot;next&quot; page because it was included in some pages and needed to be fixed anyways. I guess my main motivation for all this was that I was annoyed by the different designs of the help pages. The main benefit of the topmost navigational element is probably to provide a link back to Help:Contents; thus, new users can more easily search for something on the pages named introduction, browsing, account settings, and contributing if they are not sure where to look for it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:56, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

:::I edited [[Help:Contents]] a bit and added a temporary warning to make the transition to the new design as painless as possible. Some users (like myself) might want to have links to the old help pages until all the important links have been included in the Help:Contents page. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:58, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

:::: That's fine.

Hello gentlemen,

I noticed Martin Kraus' edits on a few help pages. I've been looking into the available content in the help namespace myself. I pasted a list on [[User:Swift/Help pages]] and have been sorting through it. Would you be interested in collaborating on a help-page-cleanup project? I'll be pretty busy and might not be able to contribute much in about a week or so, but am very interested in bringing about some order to the mess.

Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:34, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:Sorry, I don't have the time to contribute to a systematic help clean up; however, I've decided to clean up help pages when I discover missing links, out-dated or inconsistent help pages, etc. Thus, I guess I will contribute in an unsystematic way. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:05, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:: No worries! Thanks for your efforts and Happy Editing. :-) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:46, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

: Ya I've been operating mostly in an unsystematic way too. My only real vision has been to treat the namespace more like a single book with similar basic style guide as used with others books on Wikibooks, to try to get pages to use a consistent style like with other books, to add illustrations, diagrams and other images to pages to make understanding concepts covered easier, and to try to shift the reading level and audience to a more general one. Ambiguous, just not well organized or systematic. I don't expect anything to change overnight, and I'm a bit surprised that anyone has retained an interest in the help namespace. I've been merging, deleting, renaming, changing, etc. pages in the help namespace mostly alone for awhile now, sometimes there has been talk of doing something, but people seem to not have been motivated to really do anything. Disagreement of where to go or what to do with the help namespace hasn't really helped either. I'd be willing to try to collaborate. We probably need to discuss stuff so we're working together instead of against each other. Maybe on [[Help talk:Contents]] --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:09, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

== Re:dynamicpagelist ==

The version of DPL we use here at Wikibooks is very limited. I don't know all the exact restrictions, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that only 5 notcategories could be used with it. Unfortunately, this is the best we can get. More recent versions of DPL are too resource-intensive to be used by the WMF projects because of our high traffic volume. We've asked in the past to have it upgraded and all requests have been denied.

Fortunately, even in this state DPL is a very useful tool for us, and it has helped us to generate some very helpful and informative pages. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:19, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

:I noticed that [[Subject:Languages]] suffers strongly from these limitations as almost all of the books in the &quot;Languages Books&quot; column are actually in one of the &quot;Subtopics&quot;. It's just a question of which subtopics were not included the list of &quot;notcategory&quot;s in the employed dynamicpagelist command. Thus, the selection of &quot;Languages Books&quot; shown on [[Subject:Languages]] is more or less random (in addition it is not sorted alphabetically). All this could be fixed manually, if you wouldn't overwrite manual changes of the page [[Subject:Languages]] using your template for generating subject pages. Thus, I actually don't know how to help improving [[Subject:Languages]] since any of my changes might be lost the next time you recreate the whole page using your template. I wouldn't be worried about all this if I hadn't learned that [[Subject:Languages]] is supposed to replace [[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf]] sooner or later. But I probably shouldn't worry anyways. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:40, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

Is there a reason you moved things from Visual languages to Sign languages? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:29, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

: I think that the term &quot;sign languages&quot; is more common in everyday language and therefore more appropriate for a categorization in Wikibooks, even if the term &quot;visual languages&quot; is more precise. (Personally, I associate &quot;visual languages&quot; with the use of icons and symbols for communication, e.g. the icons in graphical user interfaces of computers or in airports etc., compare &quot;visual programming&quot;, but that might be because I'm working in the field of computer visualization.) Moreover, I didn't like the idea of a whole category for a single book. On second thoughts, I guess no harm is done by the additional category and, in fact, my strategy is to keep all categories (unless I rename them); thus, I've now undone my changes to the category &quot;visual languages&quot;. However, I insist that the book is easier to find for many users if it is also categorized under &quot;sign languages&quot;. I hope you agree. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 00:15, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

:: On third thoughts I realize that &quot;sign languages&quot; should be a subcategory of &quot;visual languages&quot;, but I think that it would be rather hard to find if it is there.

::Ah, it was me who removed the category &quot;visual languages&quot; from the &quot;American Sign Language&quot; book. :) I've inserted it again.

Just noticed your hard work on the subjects and wanted to leave a note of appreciation! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:14, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: Thanks! :) Actually, it's a bit frustrating. Bookshelves have their weaknesses but since there is no way to alphabetically sort the items in the &quot;automatically&quot; generated subject pages, we should definitely not have switched to the new subject pages. IMHO the &quot;unsorted&quot; (i.e. not alphabetically sorted) lists on the subject pages look like crap: like random, incomplete sets of links. Another point is that IMHO featured books (and books with PDF versions, etc) should appear in the top level subject pages, even if they are categorized in a subtopic. The term &quot;featured&quot; implies this almost by definition. I'm currently using a hack for the language subject pages which requires manual editing, which violates the very idea of automatically generated subjet pages. Thus, from my point of view the step from bookshelves to the new subject pages was a step backwards.  --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:20, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

:: That's a real pity. Would it be possible to merge the benefits of the bookshelves with the subject pages? As far as I know, subject pages weren't thought of as automatic bookshelves, but rather a category-like organisation structure where a book can belong to multiple subjects. There is no reason why there couldn't be a part of the subject page for a manually updated list of alphabetically ordered books.

::: Well, books can belong to multiple bookshelves and at least the language bookshelves are  already organized hierarchically. The only new thing about subject pages, as far as I understand it, are that they are automatically generated from the categories set on each book. (Which has benefits for new books but makes changes to the categorization a pain.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 17:14, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

:: Furthermore, subject pages don't seem to have been intended as a replacement for bookshelves. The latter were simply seen as redundant once subject pages were starting to get implemented.

::: OK. For some reason I thought that the main page no longer links to the bookshelves. But this isn't the case. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 17:14, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

:: I haven't looked at the templates that are used to generate the automatic lists on the subject pages. We might be able to work on a feature to allow alphabetic ordering (we already have sortable tables). A (temporary) alternative would be to simply refer to the subject category for an alphabetical index.

::: Well, the subject category will usually include categories, which make it more difficult to browse the books. For example, language books are categorized by continents as well as by their difficulty for native English speakers and then there are additional linguistic categories and further technical categories (e.g. the category for all book categories). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 17:14, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

== OpenGL wikibooks ==

Following our discussion, I found myself confused about what level of portability EGL, GLUT, etc. provide, so I wrote [[OpenGL_Programming/Technologies]] . Maybe you'll have some comments :)
I also thought some more about the Modern OpenGL tutorials and GLSL books: I think I'm likely to cover topics that GLSL programmers are not interested with, such as texture loading. As a result I see the Modern OpenGL tutorials as a prequel to the GLSL book. At that point, we might want to think how to factor out identical sections in the GLSL book :) (I see that the Blender chapter is a copy/paste of Unity chapter and vice-versa, or isn't it?)[[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 18:15, 13 August 2011 (UTC)

:I'll have a look at [[OpenGL_Programming/Technologies]]. 
:In a way I agree that texture and mesh loading, state setting etc. is not of much interest to GLSL programmers. However, I think this makes it even more important to have tutorials that show how to painlessly load meshes and textures! I think the best would be to actually include some open-source code in the tutorial (maybe in expandable boxes, see the JavaScript code here: [[GLSL_Programming/Unity/Many_Light_Sources#Computation_of_Diffuse_Environment_Maps]]). The second best solution would be to link to open-source code that can be easily downloaded and integrated. I think the lack of import functionality is a major problem of OpenGL (ES) and even more of WebGL (compare with OpenAL which has at least basic support for importing audio files). At some point, tutorials for OpenGL (ES) and WebGL probably have to show how to deal with these challenges. I think that would be really useful for many users - regardless of whether the tutorial is only about OpenGL or about OpenGL+GLSL.
:I did factor out some identical sections (the last block &quot;OpenGL (ES) Topics&quot; in the table of contents at [[GLSL_Programming]]). In fact, those sections are probably known to readers of your tutorials. (Thinking about it, one might also factor out - or summarize - the Phong lighting model ... oops, I actually have a stub for that already. :) And I ''really'' wish the Blender chapters were copy&amp;paste versions of the Unity chapters! :) Actually, some of it is (images, most section titles, introductions), but then the details and the code are very different: in Blender you have to write a Python script to specify GLSL shaders, in Unity you have to write &quot;ShaderLab&quot; code to specify OpenGL states and GLSL shaders for various passes. In Blender you do all the lighting computations in view space (because you are given positions of light sources in view space and by default there is no way to transform to world space), in Unity you do all the lighting computations in world space because you are given the positions of light sources in world space and the transformations to and from world space are given by built-in uniforms. Blender supports only single-pass shaders and provides all light sources in the array gl_LightSource[] (of the OpenGL compatibility profile); Unity handles each of the important lights by a single pass; thus, you have to write one shader for the first light source and ambient light, and a second shader to additively blend additional light sources onto the image. In Blender, deactivation of back-face culling is ridiculously difficult, in Unity you just write &quot;Cull Off&quot; ... I could continue the list. The point is: I'm happy if I can just copy&amp;paste since the common parts of the tutorials are in fact relatively small. Also, I don't expect many readers to read more than one part of the GLSL wikibook (i.e. either Blender or Unity or ...). Even if readers do read more than one part, they might actually appreciate that the structure is the same because then it is easier for them to find their way around. 
:So, I guess it all comes down to my original motivation for the structure of the GLSL book: in order to actually apply GLSL, you have to know a lot about the specific framework you are in, whether it is how to specify OpenGL states in Unity or in Blender or whether it is how to load textures from image files in OpenGL+GLUT or to load them via an URL in WebGL. Addressing these practical issues is really important for &quot;modern&quot; learners who will be reluctant to learn from books that try to convey important concepts (e.g. the Phong reflection model and the vertex transformation pipeline) but are missing a lot of relevant practical information and therefore cannot be put into practice without additional significant effort. Moreover, there aren't many tutorials that address all these practical issues; thus, our tutorials could really fill a gap and thereby help a lot of people to get started with OpenGL/GLSL. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 20:24, 13 August 2011 (UTC)

:: I thought that the &quot;Minimal Shader&quot; chapters covered the initial Blender/Unity setup, and then everything was identical except for some code snippets - apparently I was wrong :)
:: By &quot;factor out&quot;, I mean trying to include the same bits of text in both Blender and Unity parts somehow automatically, but it's just an idea.
:: I believe that as WebGL, etc., matures, there will be more libraries to do basic jobs like texture loading, so the code provided in tutorials should tend to shrink. But you're right, there's still the need to explain coding tricks.
:: By the way, I believe we need to clarify the license of code snippets, since placing them under the CC-BY-SA or GFDL is inconvenient (incompatibility with other free licenses, etc.). I place the first snippets in the public domain, though I may use an actual license if the code becomes more complex. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 07:50, 14 August 2011 (UTC)

:::In principle, this &quot;factor out&quot; idea is nice. One would use templates to do it. For example, instead of including the same image directly in multiple pages, one could write a template that includes the image. And then include the same template in multiple pages. The advantage would be that it is easier to change an image in all versions. (Which sometimes is necessary when an image is removed from Wikimedia Commons or when a better alternative becomes available.) The disadvantage is that it requires more work when writing the first page. ;) Also, it makes the wiki code more difficult to read (at least if you start to take the idea seriously and include many templates). So far, I tried to keep it as simple as possible by trying to avoid templates except the footer template. (Also, I realized that I start wasting a lot of time trying to format the layout when I introduce my own templates.) It might make sense to avoid templates when writing the initial version and introduce specific templates later whenever systematic changes (i.e. the same change in multiple pages) become necessary. I.e. instead of just changing each page, one would define a template with the correction and include it in all pages that need to be changed. In this way, one can be sure to include templates only where they are actually needed and it isn't much more effort than without templates at all.
:::Yes, I think I have read that Google already offers a math library in JavaScript for matrix computations for WebGL. It would be nice to show how to use this kind of common utilities libraries. 
:::The licensing is a good point. I think I'll use public domain by default and mention in the introduction of the book and in the footer template that all code is released to the public domain unless stated otherwise such that I don't have to include a separate note in each code block. What would be the advantage of an actual license (in comparison to public domain and CC-BY-SA)? The problem I see is that another license might be incompatible with wikibooks and it might be difficult to defend it because by using another license you are basically admitting that you violate the [[Wikibooks:Original research|no original research guideline]]. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 08:37, 14 August 2011 (UTC)

::::: Yeah, I think manipulating templates will quickly become difficult to maintain as well. There could be another way, based on programmatically grabbing a version, look for markers (such as HTML comments) for sections, grab those sections, and replace the matching sections in another wiki page. Again, just a wild idea.
::::: Licensing: an actual license this would require attribution/credit and would flatter my ego ;)  A copyleft license would make users contribute back their own improvements.  I believe one can use any license to describe existing research - I mean, most OpenGL introductory books are under a clear, non-permissive copyright license, without being original research.  However, adding a license to the sample code is not what readers intuitively expect, and I'll probably not write anything really useful that is not already present in the free / open source 3D engines out there, so I guess we can stick with public domain :)
::::: Btw, I opened a project at https://gitorious.org/wikibooks-opengl/ to store the code. If you're interested I can give you access to create another repository there. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 12:41, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

:::::: Thanks but right now I prefer to keep the code only on wikibooks such that I can fix errors more easily. (In the long run, it might make sense to offer complete Unity or Blender files with the examples.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 12:59, 15 August 2011 (UTC)



Hello again,

I'm now at a point where readers would benefit from your lightning tutorials, and it seems appropriate that I start &quot;porting&quot; them to bare C/C++.

The tutorials I wrote so far will allow readers to meet the GLSL book right after the Basics section; then after discussing lightning I'll probably split again from the GLSL book to discuss non-GLSL topics.

Do you have recommendations on how to proceed?  Should I start copy/pasting/editing each Blender page to the 'GLUT' chapter?  Or do you see other ways to organize this?

Regards. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 13:18, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

:Copy&amp;paste might be a good idea for consistency and to spare you some time. Note that I'm taking a rather uncommon approach by introducing diffuse reflection first, then different light sources, and then the Phong reflection model. Usually, one would introduce the Phong reflection model first and then the different light sources. The motivation for my approach was that a shader for diffuse reflection is potentially useful for Lambertian surfaces provided that it is be able to deal with different light sources. On the other hand, a shader for the Phong reflection model that is limited to directional light sources is more or less useless since non-programmers would be very confused why the shader works only with directional light sources. (The principle is that each tutorial should be as close to an actually useful shader as possible.) The most important concern for you might be how to deal with the &quot;compatibility profile&quot;? All the information about light sources (gl_LightSource[] etc.) should only be available if the compatibility profile is used. But you probably don't want to do that. Thus, it might be best to link to the legacy code for how to set the parameters of the fixed-function lighting and to the appendix about the compatibility profile&quot; in the OpenGL specification for how to access these parameters in a shader. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 13:47, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

::I like the approach with the diffuse reflection model first, because it makes the learning more progressive (learning all the Phong + matrix transformations at once is quite tedious).
::Indeed I plan to skip the compatibility profile, so the code can be used in OpenGL ES 2.0 as well.  I plan to pass uniforms similar to the ones in the compatibility profile, created manually in the C++ code.  This will make it easier for readers familiar with OpenGL 1.x to understand how to upgrade.
::Are some chapters in progress, or subject to change soon?  I can avoid them for a while if you plan to make non-trivial changes to them. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 14:15, 29 August 2011 (UTC)
:::No, it should be rather stable unless readers point out problems. I don't plan to work on the wikibook for a while since I'm busy with other things. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 15:52, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

== Quadrics ==

Hello,

I'm searching how to draw Quadrics in OpenGL ES 2.0 (so at first glance, without GLU), and I found [http://www.math.umn.edu/~rogness/quadrics/index.shtml this page] which uses a [http://wwwvis.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~kraus/LiveGraphics3D/index.html piece of software] by a certain Martin Kraus -- small world :)

Do you happen to know about papers or webpages that describe how to draw Quadrics? [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 22:19, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

:Hi Beuc, I'm not aware of particular solutions for quadrics. In the more general case of algebraic surfaces (or even more general: isosurfaces), the standard approach would be to use the &quot;marching cubes&quot; algorithm. (Easier to implement is the &quot;marching tetrahedra&quot; algorithm.) Wikipedia has reasonable descriptions and you probably find code on the internet. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 15:36, 7 October 2011 (UTC)

== Help with translucent body shader ==

Hallo Herr Kraus,
für ein Studienprojekt benötige ich bitte Ihre Hilfe bei der Erstellung eines Shaders für transluzente Objekte. 
Ihr ShaderCode auf der Seite - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Unity/Translucent_Bodies - war schon sehr hilfreich. Jedoch habe ich noch Probleme. Wäre es ev. möglich noch Bilder von den einzelnen Render passes von Ihnen zu bekommen, damit ich meine Ergebnisse vergleichen kann und Fehlerquellen ausschließen kann.

Könnten Sie ev noch einmal kurz beschreiben, was Sie in den jeweiligen Renderpasses machen, dass ist mir noch ziemlich unklar. 

LG TO81

: Hallo TO81, ich habe leider im Moment nicht viel Zeit. Die Bilder von den einzelnen Render passes kannst du wahrscheinlich relativ leicht selbst machen, indem du (von hinten anfangend) einen Pass nach dem anderen entfernst. Es hilft auch mit nur einer direktionalen Lichtquelle zu arbeiten. Bilder fuer den Alpha-Buffer sind etwas schwerer zu erzeugen. Da hilft es wohl, sich aufzuschreiben wann, welche Pixel eine 0 oder eine 1 im Alpha-Buffer haben. Das ist wohl auch die beste Strategie, um die Renderpasses zu verstehen. Viele Gruesse --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 11:57, 13 January 2012 (UTC)

== German/Level I/Wie heißt du?&quot; ==

You can´t say in Germany &quot;Ich bin Franz&quot;. It is grammatically incorrect. You have to use an article. For a male you use &quot;der&quot; for a female you use &quot;die&quot;. Fore exampel: Ich bin der Franz. Ich bin die Sara. The expression &quot;Ich bin Franz&quot; is incomplete. It would be like &quot;I Franz&quot;.
In Bavaria You raly say &quot;Mahlzeit&quot; around 12:00 am. If you are at work in bavaria peopel say Mahlzeit if they have lunch brake at about 12:00 or see each other on the street at 12:00.

:Hi, I'm a native German speaker and I think it depends on the part of Germany which version is more common. &quot;Ich bin der Franz.&quot; might be slightly more common in the south, but standard German is &quot;Ich bin Franz.&quot; meaning the same as &quot;Ich heiße Franz.&quot; See also here: http://www.canoo.net/services/OnlineGrammar/Wort/Artikel/Gebrauch/Namen.html?lang=en . In any case, you shouldn't change the dialogue without changing the audio file. With respect to &quot;Mahlzeit&quot;: I think you didn't put it in the correct column of the table, that's why I undid your change. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 18:43, 17 December 2012 (UTC)

== Proposal to implement metadata on Wikibooks==

Hi Martin,  
I wanted to give you an update on the previously discussed implementation of LRMI metatags on Wikibooks.  There is no longer the need to use the html tag extension as was discussed in the previous proposal, because it is now supported by core mediawiki. In addition, these changes sanction all mediawiki installations by default and increase the assurance of LRMI as a long-term standard.  If you're not familiar with  [http://schema.org/CreativeWork Schema.org], it is a shared collection of standard schemas that was developed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex to allow webmasters to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers.  [http://wikisource-dev.wmflabs.org/w/index.php/CreativeWork This] page demonstrates these features in the context of wikisource and can demonstrate the optimization within a Google search engine [http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikisource-dev.wmflabs.org%2Fw%2Findex.php%2FMicrodata here].  With this said, let me know if you think it would be worthwhile to implement these metatags now that it will be done via Schema.org, or if you have further questions.
The tagging scheme isn't intended to be a way to be &quot;clever&quot; or to mislead people, but instead have them be able to find more accurate and specific information (in both popular and lesser-known spheres), especially in the context of educational materials.  Especially now as a part of Schema.org, it has great potential to increase the findability of materials in Wikibooks that could potentially be very valuable for those searching the Web.

{{recipe}}

'''Racuszki''' are [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]] made from [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] fried on a hot griddle or a pan.  They are a traditional Polish meal, however they exist in several variations in many different local [[Cookbook:Cuisine|cuisine]]s, such as Danish [http://xphiles.typepad.com/table/2006/04/easter_ebleskiv.html|Ebleskivers].  Usually it's the form (small pancakes or something akin to donuts) or the stuffing: apple&amp;cinnamon, or raisins, etc., that varies.

==Ingredients==
*1 l sour milk or buttermilk
*1 cup white [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]

==Variations==
*1 kg [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]] (preferably cooking apples)
*½ teaspoon cinnamon
*½ cup raisins

==Procedure==
#In large bowl, [[Cookbook:Mix|mix]] dry ingredients (baking soda, salt, and flour) well.
#Add sour milk, and eggs and [[Cookbook:Mix|mix]] until smooth.
#Pour small ladle fulls of the mixture into a non-stick pan, one at a time OR dip slices of peeled apples in batter and put them in the pan
#Cook until the edges are dry.  Turn; cook until golden.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
# Serve with sugar, butter, maple syrup, melted chocolate, or jam.
# Racuszki do not store well.
# Use [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] if not have sour milk or optionally [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermik]], but do not replace it with normal milk.

==Serving Tips==

* Traditionally served with sugar, but goes very well with melted chocolate.
* A light maple syrup is also very good. Some prefer these with no topping at all.

===Welcome!===
Hello, if you want to add a page for a particular podcast please let me know and I'll be happy to help you with it. In fact, if necessary I'll do the converting and uploading of the audio file and the Wiki-formatting of your text page. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to discuss them here or write me a message. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:52, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

===Discussions about Parts===
Note that alreading existing parts of this wikibook should be discussed on the respective discussion pages ([[Talk:Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons]] and [[Talk:Spanish by Choice/Novelas Cortas]]). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:11, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

===Blog about this Wikibook===
I started a [http://spanish-by-choice.martin-kraus.org blog about this wikibook]. The idea is to post some more personal thoughts, speculations, and background information about the development of this wikibook. I'm not sure how often I'm going to write something but it's fun anyways. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:41, 24 December 2008 (UTC)

== Growing beyond the book format ==

My name is Ian and I'm from a project called Wikiotics, where we build free software tools for language instruction. We are starting to build collections of interactive language lessons that can serve as textbook replacements for students and this wikibook seems like a great place to start.

If there is anyone here who is interested in expanding this content beyond a traditional text-based book format or who would like to incorporate interactive lessons we build based on the outline of this book, just chime in here or contact us at contact AT wikiotics DOT org or in irc at #wikiotics on freenode. 

As example of the kind of new materials you can make with our tools, here are examples our current lesson types:
* Picture choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/Introduction), 
* Re-mixable Podcast (http://wikiotics.org/user/ian/FSI-Mandarin-Module01-Unit01), 
* Text multiple choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/WANY_Hospital_grammar) 
* new Storybook lesson [''coming soon''](http://laurent.dev.wikiotics.net/en/storybook1).

[[User:Wikiotics|Wikiotics]] ([[User talk:Wikiotics|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikiotics|contribs]]) 15:06, 13 June 2012 (UTC)

:I don't see any technical features that aren't supported by Wikibooks (using image maps, audio files, and quizzes). Thus, I don't know what the point of extending a wikibook at Wikiotics would be. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 11:47, 14 June 2012 (UTC)

There are a few technical features that are relevant here. The big ones that come to mind are:

'''Structured lessons'''
Lessons on Wikiotics are actually structured documents build out of multimedia building blocks. While it might be technically possible to build a picture choice lesson out of dozens of individual pages, each with an image map that either links to the next map or triggers a transition to fade out incorrect answers, doing so would be cumbersome and inflexible. Because our lessons are structured it is simple to create new views of a lesson that support different kinds of practice, for example randomizing the question order, prompting with the pictures and using audio clips as the answers, or viewing the whole lesson as a series of individual flash cards. 

'''Divergent editing'''
It is not obvious at first look but Wikiotics is built on a git-like revision model that supports easy forking of lessons. This makes it possible for teachers and students to build customized lessons and other practice material that work for them without cluttering up a wikibook with hundreds of variants. For example, using pictures I choose when representing different vocabulary in a picture choice lesson or using my language partner's voice for the native speaker lines in a podcast would be really useful for me. I would never make those changes to a series of wikibook pages because they might actually make the community resources less useful to other people. On wikiotics, those community resources become a reusable base for building personalized learning materials.

'''BY-SA Multimedia hosting'''
Trying to build heavily picture or audio based instruction material is somewhat outside the scope of wikimedia commons. If you want to build hours of podcast lessons or a hundred picture choice lessons, getting around the 20mb audio file limit and the selectivity for picture uploading would be difficult. While this may not be a technical limitation, the discussions I've seen in other wikibook discussion pages about external hosting options for podcast lessons lead me to conclude that it has been a structural hurdle for people trying to incorporate these kinds of materials into wikibook curriculum. We actively support building these materials and are designed to freely host as much of it as people want to build. Additionally, since all of the material we host has to be CC-BY-SA, authors know that any lessons built at wikiotics are able to be freely used, modified, or redistributed under the same terms as the wikibook itself.

[[User:Wikiotics|Wikiotics]] ([[User talk:Wikiotics|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikiotics|contribs]]) 15:56, 14 June 2012 (UTC)

:OK, I guess you have some points there. I wish you good luck with your project but don't count on many wikibook authors joining it. (Just consider that the quiz extension and the possibility to integrate podcasts has hardly ever been used in language wikibooks. Apparently, there is not much demand for such features.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 17:57, 14 June 2012 (UTC)

:: Thanks Martin. I know there is a lot of demand for these kinds of materials from the community of teachers and students. Maybe once we have more exemplar materials and people using them to learn we can help expand and reinvigorate some of the language wikibooks. Anyone who is interested in experimenting or helping with that work is welcome to come over and try things out. And keep up the great work building open language wikibooks either way!

If you want to add a page for a podcast please go ahead or let me know if you need any help. In fact, if necessary I'll do the converting and uploading of the audio file and the Wiki-formatting of your text page. If you want to start right away (without bothering about audio files and Wiki-formatting), just fill in one of the yet incomplete transcripts (marked by the little red icon next to the lesson ID). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:35, 19 September 2008 (UTC)
:Right now, there are no such incomplete transcripts because I think 40 lessons make a nice set. However, there are still about a dozen SpanishPod newbie lessons at [http://spanishpod.com spanishpod.com] that could be included in this wikibook. If you want to give it a try, you are more than welcome! You can have as much or little help as you want, just tell me. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:25, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

Note that the [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons/Print version|print version of this part of the wikibook]] has its own [[Talk:Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons/Print version|discussion page]]. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:18, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

=== About the Structure of the Lesson Pages ===
Basically, the structure is:
*some introduction with more or less important information (the information about related lessons is still missing and will be added when there are more lessons included)
*the link to the audio lesson and the dialogue
*the transcript of the dialogue (for a first reading without hints about the translation)
*the transcript of the dialogue with word-by-word translations and translations of sentences
*vocabulary from the dialogue, including dictionary forms (infinitive for verbs and masculine and feminine forms for adjectives)
*vocabulary not included in the dialogue but mentioned in the audio lesson, including phrases and dictionary forms
*additional vocabulary, in particular conjugated forms of verbs for all persons and pronouns for all persons
*exercises:
:all kinds of exercises could be included but I would suggest to first create a basic set, including quite challenging exercises, i.e., translating sentences from English to Spanish. Of course, all exercises should be ordered with increasing difficulty. I think that interactive (&quot;clickable&quot;) exercises are more fun than &quot;static&quot; exercises; however, interactive exercises have to provide a static version for printing. For the basic set of exercises I suggest to have one Spanish to English translation and three English to Spanish translation exercises: 
:* “Dialogue Translation”: just the lesson text from Spanish to English. 
:*“Dialogue Recall”: the lesson text from English to Spanish.
:*“Dialogue Remix”: a (preferable funny) variation of the lesson text with the vocabulary mentioned in the audio lesson
:*“Dialogue Recast”: a variation of the lesson text where the number and gender of persons are changed or the verb is changed from formal to informal or vice versa; this will usually require vocabulary from the section with additional vocabulary

There are a couple of templates (with prefix Sbc) that should be used for the lesson pages in order to allow for quick and consistent design and layout changes. Please consult the source code of one of the existing lesson pages. The print version should consist of a single template in order to simplify changes. In order to present the exercises in different ways for printing and for display on screen, two templates are used (one within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;...&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; the other within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;...&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;). It would be preferable to hide this alternative within a single template, but the wiki syntax does not seem to support this well. (One could use &lt;nowiki&gt;class=&quot;noprint&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;class=&quot;printonly&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; but these affect only the final printout, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the displayed print version, thus it is somewhat less suitable.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:11, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Open Tasks (was: Further Ideas) ===

{{SbcTasks}}

=== Grammar Topics ===
I realized that the &quot;grammar topics&quot; in the table of contents sometimes differ from the actual grammar topic discussed by JP and Liliana in the lesson. This should be fixed for more consistency, i.e., the &quot;grammar topic&quot; should always summarize some grammar discussed by JP and Liliana. (Not necessarily but often the grammar topic discussed right after the final repetition of the dialogue.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:29, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

Done.--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:30, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

=== About Using a Commercially Produced Podcast in a Wikibook ===
The idea of using SpanishPod lessons in a wikibook was born when SpanishPod stopped licensing new audio lessons under a Creative Commons License on September 1, 2008. At that time I realized that the prior audio lessons are under a suitable license to upload them to WikiMedia Commons. Moreover, I also realized that the audio files alone are not sufficient to learn Spanish on an introductory level (at least not for me); thus, my idea was to make the audio lessons publicly available together with dialogue transcripts. I'm convinced that the use of commercially produced audio lessons offers several crucial advantages:
*for readers of WikiBooks: the combination of professional audio materials with extended dialogue transcripts, images from WikiMedia Commons for some words, interactive exercises, and related links to Wikipedia can result in a high-quality wikibook for an introductory language course. 
*for authors of WikiBooks: the use of professional audio materials dramatically reduces the work required to create useful learning materials, in particular for non-native speakers. Moreover, these materials can be used for wikibooks in any language for learning the target language. 
*for the company that provides the audio materials: the use of commercially produced audio materials in a wikibook is likely to motivate some readers to sign up with the commercial podcast for additional materials, further courses, etc. Without this advantage for the company, there would be far less motivation for companies to provide materials under a suitable license.
*for users of the commercial podcast: a wikibook based on introductory materials can engage advanced users of the commercial podcast to apply their knowledge by contributing exercises, transcripts, links, etc., i.e. it offers additional language learning activities. This way, the WikiBooks project might also win new authors.

Given the multitude of benefits, the concept of using commercially produced audio materials in wikibooks is very likely to offer great opportunities, at least for wikibooks on language learning. In order to make sure that this model succeeds, I would like to establish some basic guidelines for the Spanish by Choice wikibook:
*inclusion of the commercially produced material only with the explicit consent of the company that provides this material
::Even if many ways of including materials are covered by the creative commons license, a company is likely not to approve all of them. In these cases, authors of wikibooks should almost always conform with the wishes and suggestions of the company. In the long run, it is far more important to establish a working and cooperative relation with companies that provide materials than to exploit the already available materials to the fullest extend.
*highest quality standards
::It is a lot easier to create useful wikibooks based on existing, professional materials than to create them from scratch. Therefore, it is particularly important that the resulting wikibooks implement the highest quality standards concerning correctness, layout, and technical features (e.g. print versions, audio players embedded in web pages, interactive exercises). Otherwise the benefits of this approach are lost and companies are likely to lose their interest in this kind of collaboration. If a company is concerned that a wikibook threatens the commercial success of the company's products, it is recommendable to limit the scope but not the quality of the wikibook.

In short: Let's work together. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:29, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

===Collections===
I think the &quot;Collections&quot; feature offers nice possibilities, for example to organize sets of lessons. The problem is that printing doesn't work well with the kind of layout that I'm using. I guess I would have to change the code specifically for the current system. And that's a problem because it is still changing. I'd rather wait until the obvious bugs are fixed, i.e., images are always printed, right-aligned images are right-aligned, tables are not spread over the full page width without reason, bold type setting works in all cases, ... --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:25, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

===Related Lessons===
I added links between related lessons. (Sometimes the relation is not easy to see.) Feel free to add additional links (always forth and back!) but please don't remove existing links since they follow a certain scheme to make sure that all lessons are reachable. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 22:09, 9 December 2008 (UTC)


===No PDFs for each Lesson!===
I'm actually generating PDFs for each lesson currently for the podcast I'm working on; thus, I thought about uploading these PDFs here. However, I realized that it is a lot better to print the corresponding pages from the full PDF instead of printing PDFs of specific lessons, in particular because you get consistently numbered pages if you print multiple lessons. Thus, there is no need to have a PDF for each lesson here on Wikibooks. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:59, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:Oops, that changed. Since I had to generate the PDFs for the podcast anyways, I uploaded them. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:58, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

===Changes in lessons===
I changed lessons A0030, A0127, A0130 because they didn't include the tables for imperative conjugation. The PDFs are '''not''' updated yet. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:58, 3 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
How to ask someone to go together to a birthday party—in Spanish? With Liliana's and JP's guidance it's pretty easy. Of course, that doesn't mean that the answer is always “yes”! In any case, the keyword is '''la fiesta de cumpleaños''' – the birthday party.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis developed Usenet as graduate students in 1979.  They thought that the software could be replacement software for Duke University to post announcements.  Steve Bellovin became interested in the software and wrote the first UNIX-based “news” software for the system.  (Interview with Tom Truscott April 18, 2007)

At the time the current announcement software that was used by the university was made obsolete because of a hardware upgrade.  Usenet was a side project of Truscott and Ellis that they worked on in their spare time.  Bellovin wrote the script, and soon after “netnews” was created; linking Duke University and the University of North Carolina.  Soon after the program was made available to the public and “A News” was created which was the first Usenet package.  (Usenet History)

Usenet is bulletin board software where users with the correct software can read and post messages.  It is still running today, URL’s that begin with news refer to Usenet groups.  The NNTP or Network News Transport Protocol is the transportation system that sends out the Usenet messages.  (Siegel 2006)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Ambar, I like the idea that you have about to implement a national curiculum so in that way students might move thoughout the country and wouldn`t ever be behind.
Talking about a teacher´s caring.  In your opinion,  what might teachers do to improve this skill?  with attitudes or efficient work?
Also, you said that peer-reviews help students with their works. In your school life have you had this experience before? and if you do. Has  this helped you?  I am older and is my first time I am involve with this way of grading or assesting. However, I found it very intereting.

Finally, I have two more questions? Do you think is a good idea that schools get students ready for work? or school should be a place where a student might improve their grades or also should it be a place where student learn abilities for living?  
The last is that I think that when a student is in a secondary school, academic subjects are not enough for their needs . Students that age are a raough diamond that needs to be carefully polished. Again, I vote for a more integral education.  I think a teen ager needs to be in contact with any expression of art or  sports too. Beside the academic subject. Because later it would be hard they start being interested on it and also because is an  age of a lot of emotional changes and thoughout music, painting, dance, poetry, performing, they might express themself as well all those emotions. 17:29, 17 September 2008 (UTC)[[User:Mchar009|Mchar009]] ([[User talk:Mchar009|talk]]) 17:42, 17 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many factors that can affect your vehicles fuel economy, many of which are directly related to routine maintenance that you can perform yourself. While there are many products on the market that claim to boost the fuel economy of vehicles few if any of them deliver on their claims. The best ways to get good fuel economy include careful driving and keeping your car properly maintained.
== Tire Pressure ==
One of the simplest ways to maintain good fuel economy is to ensure that your tires are properly inflated. The owners manual for you vehicle will indicate the proper pressure to inflate you tires to. There is often a sticker or other label along the driver’s side door of vehicles that also states the manufacturer recommended pressure. Decreased tire pressure increases the rolling resistance of your tires and decreases fuel economy, and may also increase tire wear and impair performance. 

There are some who believe that over inflating tires will further decrease rolling resistance and increase fuel economy, however over inflated tires often suffer from excessive wear, and impaired grip. Tires that are extremely over inflated can lose enough grip to cause safety problems in the event of an emergency stop, so it is strongly recommended that you never exceed the maximum pressure rated on the sidewall of your tire.
== O2 Sensor &amp; Thermostat ==
Both the thermostat and on modern cars the oxygen or O2 sensor can affect fuel economy and should be replaced either at a manufacturer recommended interval or when a electronic fault code/ low temperature problem is detected. Electronically fuel injected vehicles have an O2 sensor or sensors in their exhaust system which helps the vehicles computer determine how to optimize fuel economy. These O2 sensors may need to be changed periodically for a vehicle to optimize it's air fuel mixture and maximize it's fuel economy. Thermostats optimize the flow of coolant and help a vehicle maintain it's proper operating temperature, which is important in fuel economy. If a vehicle has trouble reaching it's optimum operating temperature the thermostat is usually the main suspect and should be changed.
== Air Filter ==
It is highly recommended that you check your vehicles air filter periodically and insure that it is clean, especially on older vehicles. Black or otherwise dirty air filters make your engine work harder to get enough air for proper combustion and decrease its efficiency; however, electronically fuel injected cars can automatically compensate for the decreased air flow caused by a dirty air filter and experience relatively little decrease in fuel economy. The main problem caused by dirty air filters in modern electronically fuel injected cars is decreased acceleration/performance. Most owners’ manuals will recommend a service interval which you should change your air filter at, but periodic visual inspection is the best way to ensure that your air filter is clean.

== Proper Oil ==
Making sure to use the recommended weight of oil can decrease the burden on your vehicles engine and keep your vehicle under warranty. Heavier oil weights such as 20W-50 are harder to push through you engine than say 10W-30 or 5W-20 oils, which can cause a decrease in fuel economy. Overweight oils have traditionally been used in high mileage engines that had small oil leaks and/or heavily worn components (bearings etc.), both of which could be remedied with heaver oil because it wouldn't seep out as easily and it would properly fill worn engine components, but wear is far less of an issue on modern cars. Modern engine manufacturing and lubricants have decreased engine wear to the point that modern engines should never need an overweight oil even with hundreds of thousands of miles/kilometers on an engine. There are some ultra light weight oils available such as 0W-20 which may be labeled as being for hybrid vehicles; however, using too light of an oil could potentially harm your engine and void any warranty on your vehicle so you should consult your vehicles manufacturer before trying an underweight oil. There are some who under fill their oil in order to further lower internal friction and increase fuel economy; however, if any oil is lost due to leaking or burning the engine is in much greater risk of catastrophic failure and may not be covered under warranty.

== Changing Behavior ==
Although it's not maintenance, altering driving behavior can significantly improve fuel economy.
Increase following distance so you don't need to make constant corrections for the vehicles in front of you. Tailgating might lower your wind resistance, but being forced to stop because the car in front of you is turning can easily undo any gains, not to mention the risk of getting a ticket or having a crash.
Try to avoid sudden stops and hard acceleration. Slow down before arriving at red traffic lights, so they might turn green before you reach them, and you can possibly avoid stopping at all. Also slow down before joining a line of cars at a stop sign, so you don't need to stop and go multiple times. Similarly, when caught in a traffic jam, it is more efficient to creep forward at a constant speed, than to charge forward and stop with every traffic wave.
Avoid excessive speed, as twice the velocity requires eight times the power to overcome drag, or wind resistance.
Backing in to a parking space, while the engine is warm, is more efficient than backing out after it has cooled.

added a few touches, if anyone knows more about underweight oil feel free to contradict what I said earlier, but for safety's sake I won't trust underweight oil unless I hear more about it.</text>

Well, hello everyone who will read my article in the future, oh by the way my name is Paul Jackson. Before you read the article I would like to tell you little about myself, which first I was born on March 10, 1986 and one of the big guy. I have live in Franklin, V.A for over 20 years and still counting. I graduated from Franklin High School in 2004 after that I attended Chowan College for 2 year, which didn’t work out to for the best. So, then I attended a community college for 2 year, which I got my associate degree in education. Now I’m at O.D.U trying to get my B.A in History Education. Well about me personal I enjoy going to the gym about everyday except Sunday, I like also going to the movies, bowling, hiking, fishing, and I will try just about any that sound fun. My mind set in this world is trying to success in life, which means I’m going to keep in real with everyone students and teachers. Because I believe in speaking what on your minds, but I don’t get mad when people do the same. But I believe I’m a nice guy, which if you need help I would do my best to help you and in hope to build friendship.


== '''Philosophy of Education''' ==


I believe that education has no boundary for any student who wants to learn, which makes each educator responsible for hard as they can to teach that information. No student should be left behind, because they are little slow on absorbing the information in class, but just might need little time to catch up after school. Teachers must remember their sole responsibly in teaching to see students grow both inside and outside the classroom into young adults. For students that people believe that they will never amount to anything or end up in jail, but not me I believe they have a choice just like any other students. But they just need guides from stable and positive source, in which they can relate to and depend on for help. I believe teaching isn’t a walk in the park, because we are people to in this world and just like people we are going to have are bad or good day. But we shouldn’t never carry are personal life in the classroom. I believe if I become a teacher at I can make a different in many students live, because I will do my best to my ability as a teacher. Remember there are no bad kids, but they just need positives guides to help them though life.''</text>

Ordering beer, one of the essential surviving techniques in the civilized world. 
At least for some people. 
Probably the keyword '''una cerveza''' – a beer is sufficient to order beer, but in the
civilized world we might want to use a few more words. JP and Liliana tell us all about it.

== Technology Planning: the Educator's Guide Introduction==


During the 1990s several institutions developed thoughtful methods of technology planning for schools. Companies like Apple Computer, educational agencies like NCREL, and non-governmental organizations like the National Center for Technology Planning all made their planning websites freely accessible to educators and technologists. Today these resources only exist in the Internet Archive &lt;ref&gt;http://archive.org The Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;, the current websites of these organizations have either dropped access to the planning materials or the website has disappeared. Well-developed technology planning models are now either very difficult to find or are available only by paid consulting.

The technology planning model used in this wikibook is loosely based on Apple Computer's (now Apple, Inc.) technology planning model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Technology Planning/Contents}}
{{TOCright}}

Prior to the actual writing of a meaningful Technology Plan it is key that an inclusive process begins to gather input from all the members of the relevant technology community.  A strategic planning committee should be formed with representation from all areas that have a stake on what you'll plan and eventually implement.  Be aware as much as possible of  the politics involved and strive to not leave anyone out that can later negate positive efforts.  You might go so far as to &quot;keep your enemies close&quot; in this endeavor.  Better to address a potential show stopping issue in the discussion at committee rather than have it surface at a key junction later when you present the final plan and the issue can do major damage to any success or early adoption of the recommendations.  The committee will form the input and discussion for a needs analysis which aids in forming true data-driven conclusions and minimizes assumptions.  It also helps to prevent limited thinking or worse yet continuing to do things the same old way because it is comfortable to do so.  A needs analysis will drive the decisions for the goals and vision of the technology plan. You can't write an effective technology plan without thoroughly knowing the needs for your school district or institution.

== Section 1 ==
=== The Technology Planning Committee ===

[[Image:Senate_budget_committee.JPG|right|thumb|200px|   Technology Committee]]

The committee should not consist solely of members who know technology. In fact, it would be more useful to have a wide range of representation both from the academic and administration areas, as well as even one or two student representatives. Remember, one of the goals is to minimize false assumptions or rush too quickly to judgement on what should be done, or what can we realistically afford. Try to keep the committee membership to a reasonable number that will work well, rather than a large mob. Also, be sure to select predictable meeting times - same day, same time each month for example - that most can attend. An easy method might be the second Tuesday of every month at 2:00 PM (2,2,2). That consistency makes it easier for all members to chart it and show up. Make the overall process an open one for other members of the school who may not be on the Planning Committee. Publish timely minutes to all members and consider creating an archive on your main website that lists the committee members including their contact information and title. Publish the minutes at this location as well. Stress to members that it is important for them to attend every meeting and if you discover at any point that another individual should have been included, try to add that key person. As Chair of the Planning Committee you will need to keep everyone on task and should prepare in advance for each meeting to ensure effectiveness of the time invested by everyone. Work with the actual facts, do not permit politics or personal grudges to surface during discussions, and traffic-cop any that do quickly. Keep focus within the committee and also write a brief charge that explains what the role and scope of the group will be. Finally, as discussions emerge be sure to drive toward consensus rather than one individual speaking more loudly or passionately than anyone else.

=== Needs Analysis ===

It will be important to interview the actual users of technology, and determine their most pressing shortfalls in existing operations. Have the users describe the problem, the needs, not the specific solution that they think is required. Remember you are in information gathering mode only at this point, not testing solutions. The description of the needs may involve multiple solutions later that need to be examined for feasibility. A user who read about a powerful open source solution that they really, really want in their classroom may not be considering what kind of extra programming support behind the scenes would be required. Those issues come later. Be sure to cover all the relevant participants who can provide input, not just the department head for example who may overlook a unique application that is underway down the hall or in another building. Don't promise any quick fixes or instant vendor purchases but clarify that this is an exploratory effort only and that the committee will review all the data. Be precise with questions and ask one final open-ended question such as &quot;If you could solve one or two technology problems that are holding you back, what would that be?&quot; The needs analysis data should be made available to every member of the committee. Also, let the users who are providing input to this step know that they can speak honestly and that their name will not be attached to a specific comment. You may uncover some critical info that will matter in the final Technology Plan.

[[Image:Second_Severn_Crossing_pano_1.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Needs Analysis]]

Remember, technology is neither good nor bad. It is our &quot;use&quot; of technology tools - within our contexts and toward specifc ends - that can make a difference (Katz, 2008). A thorough Needs Analysis will serve as the bridge to the next step in the planning process, and become the base for key decisions that follow. Make certain that you provide a solid base as the outcome.

The purpose of containing an introduction within a school district technology plan is to give the reader of the plan an overview of the school district that the technology plan is about. An effective introduction will give the reader an idea of how big or small the school district is. It should also possibly contain what kind of technological resources are available currently within the school district. The current reality of the school district should be embedded within a school district's technology plan. Some examples of this would be: The school and community interaction, examples of technology hardware, infrastructure and software that is currently being implemented, and the location and size of the school district.

===Overview to Vision and Mission Development===

Research and practice have demonstrated the important role that vision and mission play in all organizations and associations, or all departments within organizations and associations that are tasked with people development.  Developing the vision and promoting it continuously inside and outside of the organization is the most important strategic activity of any effective educational leader. Superintendants, Principals, and deans in academic settings, and chief learning officers, vice presidents, and directors of training in corporate settings should develop a vision that clearly articulates the values, beliefs, purposes, and goals that guide a unified culture of continuous development. Kathryn Whitaker (1994) has called vision “an inspiring declaration of a compelling dream.” Robert Fritz (1996) suggests that when all individuals collectively understand and believe in the “compelling dream” they are motivated to work together to reduce the gap between todays reality and tomorrow’s possibility. Vision can become a common educational culture in both academic and corporate settings, but selling an intangible dream is hard work. The educational leader must “walk” the vision, not just “talk” the vision. Unfortunately, these kinds of leaders are the exception. Leaders who actually live the stated values, beliefs, purposes, and goals will ultimately break down the individual barriers of teachers and students so they can all chase a common compelling dream. Academic and corporate educational leaders sometimes develop a vision of the organization by collaborating with all of the major stakeholders in the organization's community, whose hopes, dreams, expectations, and values contribute to the organization's goals and aspirations. Sometimes, the educational leader is the transformative individual who envisions a higher calling for the organization. He or she creates the compelling dream and then becomes the consistent and persistent voice who heralds the higher calling. The leader’s vision should promote a comprehansive “new way” that includes a creative and dynamic teacher, the appropriate instructional medium (technology), and the student, who makes sense out of concepts by “doing” via engagement with the technology and the instructor (Wenglinsky, 2005). &lt;ref&gt; http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/educatrs/leadrshp/le1clear.htm &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Education World: The educator”s best friend. Available at, http://www.education-world.com/a_admin/admin/admin044.shtml. Accessed on October 24, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Wenglinsky H. Using Technology Wisely: The Keys to Success in Schools. Teacher College, Columbia University. New York and London. 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;

===The Fundamental Basis of a Vision statement ===
Educational leaders need to have a deep appreciation of cognitive neuroscience and be well read related to the research about how people learn in order to craft their vision and then promote it based on evidence. According to Howard Gardner (2004), each individual learner excels in only two or three “intelligences” or learning styles, that he defines as linguistic, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, body-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist. &lt;ref&gt; Gardner H. Frames of Mind: The theory of multiple intelligences. Twentieth anniversary edition. Perseus Books Group. New York. 2004 &lt;/ref&gt; According to Anders Ericsson (2004), “Deliberate, difficult practice undertaken over a long period of time, while receiving informative feedback, and having opportinities for repitition and correction of errors leads to elite performance.” &lt;ref&gt; Ericsson KA (2004). Deliberate practice and the acquisition and maintenance of expert performance in medicine and related domains. Academic Medicine. Vol. 79, No 10: S70-S81 &lt;/ref&gt; Finally, David Kolb (1984) describes learning as a process in which individual knowledge is created through a four-stage cycle of experience that includes concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. &lt;ref&gt; Kolb DA. Experiential learning: Experience as the source of learning and development. Prentice Hall PTR. New Jersey. 1984 &lt;/ref&gt; To complicate things even further every student learns at a different pace. Given the preponderance of this kind of evidence, educational leaders should create and promote a vision that is student-centric, emphasizes learning by “doing,” and includes very high performance expectations. A vision that promotes student-centricity needs to be an effective “alchemy” that includes the student, peers, teacher (methodology), and applicable technology so that knowledge creation and construction occurs by making relevant connections to prior student experiences – social, educational and psychological in ways that are connected and immediate (Lomas, C. and  Oblinger, D., 2006). &lt;ref&gt; Student practices and their impact on learning spaces. Retrieved on  November 22, 2008 from http://www.educause.edu/Chapter5.StudentPracticesandTheirImpactonLearningSpaces/11903 &lt;/ref&gt; 

An organization’s (e.g. primary, secondary, university, or corporate) vision conveys a compelling, conceptual image of the desired future for the organization. It provides inspiration and challenge to all members of the organization towards an ideal of what the organization can become if its collective members (educational leaders, teachers, and students) become intrinsically motivated life-long learners. It should be purposefully articulated to bridge the present and future and to serve as a critical impetus for change. &lt;ref name=&quot;oiedu&quot;&gt; http://www.oie.eku.edu/SPManual/docs/Vision.pdf. &lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, a vision is a concise statement about where the organization needs to be to succeed at some point in the future. &lt;ref name=&quot;ictpd&quot;&gt; http://ictpd.net/techplan/#Develop &lt;/ref&gt; 

Specifically, the conceptualized vision should contain two major components. First, a guiding philosophy that describes the core beliefs and values of the organization and its purpose. For example, LL Bean’s stated core beliefs is that “the business will take care of itself” if the organization “sells good merchandise at a reasonable price and if their employees treat customers as if they were genuine friends.” Apple computer’s stated purpose is “To make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advances humankind.” Second, the vision should contain a tangible mission statement of a clear, compelling, and acheivable goal that strives to unify the organization’s effort. For example, Merck’s stated tangible mission statement in 1979 was to establish their organization as “The preeminent drug-maker worldwide in the 1980s.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Air&quot;&gt; Air University. The intelectual and leadership center of the Air Force. Available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/strat-ldr-dm/pt4ch18.html. Accessed on October 24, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;

===The properties of a good vision statement===

While developing an educational vision statement for an academic institution or corporation, the following properties should be taken into consideration. &lt;ref name=&quot;oiedu&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Guidebook for developing an effective instructional technology plan version 2.0, prepared by Graduate Students at Missisippi State University participating at TKT 8763- Seminar in Planning for Instructional Technology, Spring-1996 &lt;/ref&gt;

A good vision is: [http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/educatrs/leadrshp/le1clear.htm], &lt;ref name=&quot;Air&quot;/&gt; 

:•	Idealistic, but realistic too, envisioning a future that is beyond the present, which everyone in the organization believes is acheivable.
:•	Appropriate and consistent with the organization’s history and culture. It reflects what already makes the organization unique and recognizes its existing strenghths.
:•	Clarifies an attractive future purpose and mission that creates meaning in teacher’s lives beyond just getting a paycheck. 
:•	Sets extraordinary ambitious high standards of excellence or high ideals that challenge teachers and other key stakeholders to achieve levels of performance that they haven’t achieved with students before.
:•	Inspires enthusiasm and helps teachers and other key stakeholders get excited about what they are doing to improve student outcomes. It encourages increased commitment to the organization.
:•	Is clearly articulated and easily understood by teachers and key stakeholders both inside and outside of the organization. It should capture the essential core beliefs, purpose, and tangible mission of the vision without being too-short or too-long. It needs to be memorable so it can be actionable.

===Developing a vision statement===

A shared vision is an important component of technology planning. It will have implications for how your organization allocates funding and resources and may redefine the roles that are played by students (employees), teachers (trainers), administrators, and parents (significant others). It is important to note that it is absolutely critical that the technology “vision” is not separate from the collective educational vision of the organization. As mentioned earlier, technology should be applied seamlessly to improve student educational outcomes.

It is difficult to develop a powerful vision statement. Additionally, there is no formula to develop the appropriate vision statement. As mentioned earlier, visions can be co-developed by a group of key stakeholders or it can be developed by a single energetic, imaginative, transformative leader. The danger in visions developed by committee is that the end result can become something-for-everyone, the compromises of which lead to a weak, watered-down, inaffective vision. The danger in visions developed by one individual is that key stakeholders in the organization may not embrace the vision because their “voices” were not considered during the vision development. In either situation, the vision will not be realized unless there is a strong educational leader (superintendants, principals, deans, chief learning officers, vice presidents, and directors of training) who actively promotes a new direction. To help future “visionaries,” we will provide some suggestions below that leaders should consider when developing a vision statement. &lt;ref name=&quot;ictpd&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref name=&quot;Air&quot;/&gt; 


:•      Learn everything you can about your organization. That means getting out of the hierarchical ivory tower and getting into the trenches with your teachers and the students who they serve. &lt;ref name=&quot;ictpd&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref name=&quot;Air&quot;/&gt; 

:•	Bring your organization’s key internal and external stakeholders into your visioning development process. This committee needs to be carefully considered and populated with stakeholders who are early adopters with a bias for action. A thoughtful “seeding” of any visioning committee will help limit analysis paralysis and recycling the same old tired discussions. &lt;ref name=&quot;ictpd&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref name=&quot;Air&quot;/&gt; The visioning exercise available from the Department of Education and Training in New South Wales (Austrailia) &lt;ref&gt; http://www.sustainableschools.nsw.edu.au/Default.aspx?tabid=115&amp;PageContentID=18 &lt;/ref&gt; suggests conducting visioning exercises with key stakeholders which helps build a sense of ownership, commitment and sustainability within the educational organization. The purpose of the visionary exercise is to brain storm the possibilities of the future - the main question being where are we going? Some of the questions that are wrestled with during the visionary exercise include those listed below. S.W.OT. analysis can also be conducted after this reflective questioning process by breaking into small groups and, in the light of the gathered data, the group can determine strengths, weaknesses, opportunities to take advantage of a changing environment and possible threats. Look for areas of agreement, as well as different ideas that emerge. The goal is to find language and imagery that your group’s members can relate to as their vision for future. &lt;ref name=&quot;oiedu&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Strong, B. (2007). Strategic Planning for technological Change. Educause Quarterly.&lt;/ref&gt;


::o	What’s our future time frame? Three years? Five years?
::o	What trends in education today can positively or negatively impact our plans?
::o	What are the limits of our existing technology, facilities, resources, funding, and expertise?
::o	Will our vision be obsolete by the time we change direction?
::o	Will our vision be impacted by private competition, government oversight or new regulation?
::o	Is our vision scalable beyond the pilot?
::o	How will the long-term economic climate effect our long-term technology, facilities, resources, and personnel implimentation plan?
::o	Will our student’s (employee’s) needs change? How?


:•	Keep an open mind as you explore options. Don’t be constrainted by the organization’s current direction or be discouraged by the “it’s the way we have always done it” attitude that is sure to surface. &lt;ref name=&quot;ictpd&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref name=&quot;Air&quot;/&gt; 

:•	Understand and appreciate the existing organization vision (particularliy if you are new to the organization). Don’t throw out good ideas that are working just because you didn’t create them. 

:•	Look outside of your own organization to learn, adopt, and then import visionary educational ideas. Visit other academic or corporate learning organizations and study what they are doing differently. Read their research and steal their good ideas. &lt;ref name=&quot;ictpd&quot;/&gt; 


====An examples of a vision statement====

::'''Vision statement for  Sample Organization (school)'''. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.becal.net/lc/vision/statements.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

::To provide a stimulating learning environment with a technological orientation across the whole curriculum, which maximises individual potential and ensures students of all ability levels are well equipped to meet the challenges of education, work and life. 
::Our vision is that children leave school with: 

:::•	A set of spiritual and moral values -- honesty, integrity and good judgement. 
:::•	A complement of basic skills -- linguistic, mathematical, scientific, artistic, physical and social. 
:::•	An enquiring and discriminating mind and a desire for knowledge. 
:::•	Strong self-esteem and high personal expectation. 
:::•	Tolerance and respect for others. 

::We value the partnership which exists between school, parents and community and the part it plays in realising this vision.

== Current State ==

Generally speaking, before planning can begin, it is critical that an assessment take place of the current state of the surrounding environment. This is especially true when planning for the implementation of technology for an educational environment. In this section we will review what information a planner must collect and understand with regards to the current state of their institution's environment.

===Elements to be considered when documenting the current state of technology:===
#Introduction: In this section there should be a description of the district environment, schools, community, size, demographics, and any other special information relevant to education, technology, and or planning.
#History of technology planning or initiative that led to current state:  when was the last plan developed, what were the recent purchases, recent initiative, former committee mmmbers, technology leadership, or any other related information relevant to the history of technology planning at the school or district.
#Mission of educational technology (implied or stated) at the school or district level.
#Infrastructure elements - for each section list the number deployed, version, age, and primary use of each element:
##Internet access - type, bandwidth, provider.
##Servers &amp; services - include e-mail, web, data, streaming, faculty/student storage, and any other servers or services in place.
##Network infrastructure equipment.
##Other infrastructure elements (power, phones, entry control, surveillance cameras, etc.).
#Hardware- for each section list the number deployed, version, age, and primary use of each element:
##Types of hardware currently deployed: computers, projectors, cameras, iPods, etc.
##Location of currently deployed hardware: labs, in classrooms, mobile carts, one-to-one laptops, etc.
#Software- for each section list the number deployed, version, age, and primary use of each element:
##Number and versions of software currently deployed: OS, Basic, productivity
##Uses of current software: Educational, special software
#Administrative Technology- for each section list the number deployed, version, age, and primary use of each element:
##Administrative systems such as grading systems, attendance, records, class plans and other related technology systems. List current systems in place, the related hardware base and software versions and quantity deployed.
#Professional Development: Perhaps the best way to describe the current PD program is to answer a series of questions.  What is the intended purpose of the school's PD?  How is the training conducted?  How often is it being done?  Has it been evaluated?  If so, has it been tweaked over time and proven effective?  If it has not been evaluated, why not?  Does it foster teacher collaboration and reward experimentation?  Has there been a tangible increase in technology use within classroom instruction?  Do the teachers know where they can go to get help?  What do the teachers not know yet that they should?  All of these questions should paint an accurate picture of the program's effectiveness as well as reveal some areas that can be improved upon in the future.  [http://edweb.sdsu.edu/courses/edtec596r/students/Christiansen/TTinT.html][http://books.google.com/books?id=CklqX4zgDtgC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=important+considerations+when+evaluating+professional+development&amp;source=web&amp;ots=gQ2zEH5vey&amp;sig=gH3qkdim5Vuq_Dg8sgj3rgjRLhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA147,M1]
#Nature of Classroom / Teacher / Student use: this section is an overview of how the current technology is being used, how often it is used, and how it's use is aligned with educational strategies and teaching pedagogies.
#Technology Staffing / Support: It is critically important to assess exactly where your institution is in terms of technology staff. If you find your staff/support staff to be less than what you need, it should be a top priority when moving forward. Many experts believe that the very first step in developing a technology plan for a school district is assembling a technology planning committee that should review the school’s big-picture learning goals already in place and identify the district’s needs. [http://www.wested.org/techpolicy/recapproach.html] 
#Relevant Policies: This section details the relevant technology policies such as replacement policy, usage policies, security policies.
#Technology Funding:  Budget, grants, e-rate, etc. - there is a separate section in this book on budgeting - this section is an overview of the current funding amounts and process.
#Summary of the current environment.

=== Additional concerns ===
After the review of the current state of technology at the school or at the district, the planner will become aware of shortcomings and missing elements of the current technology as well as other changes which need to be addressed in a new technology implementation plan.  These items should be addressed in goals section of the technology implementation plan.  For example, is the network infrastructure able to support future upgrades and advanced software applications?  Is the professional development program meeting the needs of teachers and administrators currently?  Will the program be able to meet their needs in the future or will it need to be improved upon?  Some of these issues and problems will also become more clear when future technology tools are suggested/needed.  For example, if a goal of the school technology program is to increase learning via Second Life, this will dictate what sort of upgrade needs to be done in order to bring the school network infrastructure up to the correct specifications for such an undertaking.</text>

== Goals ==
=== Introduction ===

''If you want to get where you want to go, you need to know where you want to be.'' 

A goal is an observable and measurable end result having one or more objectives to be achieved within a more or less fixed timeframe [Goal 2008] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/goal.html accessed on November 20,2008 &lt;/ref&gt;. A clear set of goals is crucial to success for both individuals and organizations. Goals provide direction and focus and help in the process of improvement. Goals help in the development of strategy as well and guide the actions of the individual or of the organization going forward. Goals are also a vital part of technology plans for school districts.

===How do we determine what goals should be included in the technology plan?===

Expanding upon the previous sections of the plan, goals are a clearer statement of the visions, specifying what will be achieved by the vision [Education Leadership Tool Kit]
&lt;ref&gt; http://www.nsba.org/sbot/toolkit/ accessed on November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. The goals should be determined primarily by the needs of the students. The technology involved in implementing the goals should consider the academic and curricular needs of the school [Critical Issue 1996] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/methods/technlgy/te300.htm accessed on November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. There are goals to be found at many levels of a school district, and a good place to start is at the curricular goals.  Technology planners may also want to consider teacher’s more specific learning goals, but always remaining focused on the larger goals within a school. 

Goals can also be determined by considering a school district’s budget [Critical Issue 1996] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/methods/technlgy/te300.htm accessed on November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, you wouldn’t want to have a goal of “all students will use technology to enhance their productivity skills” if not all students will have access to computers on a regular basis.  The budget may prevent this goal from being attainable.  While the goals section of the technology planning process is it’s own section, it is highly dependent upon the other sections.

For a successful plan, the technology goals must support the vision of learning, or the technology has the potential to be used only to reinforce the current teaching practices. Technology planners may consider asking themselves when writing the goals, how will the technology be used to provide a challenging curriculum that is engaging? [Guiding Questions 1996] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncrtec.org/capacity/guidepdf/guide.pdf accessed on November 4, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;  After answering this question, ideas for goals will be presented, and then can be made into measurable goals.

=== What makes a good goal? ===

There are different models that can be followed when setting goals but within the project management arena, one of the better known goal setting formats is known as SMART. This acronym stands for specific, measureable, attainable, results oriented, and timely. Each of these items are explained briefly below:

*Specific: The school/district will enhance and upgrade the communication systems to facilitate exchange between school professionals and parents to address the multiple needs of the learning community [Sample Technology Plan 2000] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~josephmi/850/SampleGoalObj.pdf accessed on November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The goal must be described in precise terms to avoid confusion about what needs to be accomplished. When looking at the sample goal above, the goal describes specifically what will need to occur for the goal to be attained.  We know that the district is looking to target communication systems to better communication amongst school staff and parents.  

*Measurable: All students will know how to access and use print, electronic, three-dimensional, and visual resources for research and learning activities [Sample Technology Plan 2000] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~josephmi/850/SampleGoalObj.pdf accessed on November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. 
What measures do we use to judge our progress towards achieving our goals?  This sample goal is not only measurable, but very easily assessed.  With a simple checklist we could see if the goal was reached by having students demonstrate the above task.  

*Attainable: Technology will allow administrators to gather and share current and timely information for decision-making at the school board, administration, school, and classroom levels [Sample Technology Plan 2000] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~josephmi/850/SampleGoalObj.pdf accessed on November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The goal has to be achievable. The goal should also be realistic, yet challenging.  The above goal seems attainable in that it is broad enough to involve many stakeholders, but still attainable.  

*Results oriented: All educators will identify, prioritize, and incorporate the use of technology to achieve learning objectives in all disciplines within each schools’ curriculum as appropriate [Sample Technology Plan 2000] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~josephmi/850/SampleGoalObj.pdf accessed on November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.
Meaningful goals should relate to attaining something that is necessary, of value and that supports the overall vision. The goal should be consistent with other goals that have been established.  The sample goal provided expands upon the other sample goals, as well as provides a specific result that is to be achieved by the goal. 

*Timely : By 2011, all teachers will have access to technology both in school and at home [Sample Technology Plan 2000] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~josephmi/850/SampleGoalObj.pdf accessed on November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.  
There should be a specific date, timeframe or schedule for goals.  The above goal shares a specific date to which the goal is to be met.  Sometimes goals will list a specific date, or often a broad time frame such as by the end of the 2011 school year.  

These five criteria are useful to anyone who is developing goals that pertain to any purpose and they certainly give the technology planner a good place to start. However the field of education does require some additional considerations that must be addressed when planning for the implementation of technology at the school or district level.

=== Goals in Technology Integration ===

One of the SMART criteria is measurable. In education, this is not always very easy to accomplish as there are often gray areas when it come to learning. There is often much data available that we can use to measure our success. At the classroom level, we can design a rubric system. At a more macro level we can use test scores or some other quantifiable tool or method. Examples include increasing numbers of students who are reading by the end of 3rd grade, reducing failure rate of incoming freshmen, and eliminating violent behavioral incidents [O'Neill 2000] &lt;ref&gt; O'Neill, J. (2000). Smart Schools [Electronic Version] ''Educational Leadership''57&lt;/ref&gt;. It is then up to the planner to determine how technology can contribute to the achievement of the goal. 

Technology implementation goals must be consistent with other mandated goals which originate from government policy makers. Examples of this could be attainment of the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act where average yearly progress is closely monitored. In this case, technology should be explored for the role it could play in improving math and reading skills and in the delivery of benchmark tests to determine base level skills of students. Another example could be participation in a program like Pennsylania's Classrooms for the Future. In this situation, a goal could reflect the need for school districts to develop maintainence programs for the technology that was originally provided by this one-to-one computing program grant.

As goals are developed, there is one thing that the technology planner must keep in mind and that is that the ultimate goal of technology in the classroom must be student achievement.

===Implementation Plan and Timeline===

According to the wiki Directing Technology &quot;Technology implementation starts at the inception of the planning development strategy. There are two distinct types of technology implementation: implementing developed technology and implementing developing technology projects. They are very similar in that the projects need a plan that has a schedule with clear GO/NO-GO decision points and a project team that has well laid out responsibilities. The technology department will be implementing developed technology(2006)&quot;.

Implementation of your technology plan will be the most complicated and time consuming part of the process. It is important to allow yourself at least one year before the actual implementation starting day to make all the necessary arrangements. Your plans will depend on many things including the size of your district, status of your existing technology program, skill set of your teachers and administrators and size of your technology staff. Your plan may need to be implemented all at once or over the course of several years, phasing in different stages.

Your technology plan has been accepted by the district. Its time to plan the implementation. At least six months to a year prior to beginning the implementation, several elements of the plan will be carried out simultaneously by several different groups. 

The progress of the project should be documented in writing and communicated to all persons involved.  A good checklist should be developed to organize the associated details.

A sample checklist:
:*	Describe goals &amp; objectives (as outlined in the Technology Plan)
:*      Identify participant’s roles and responsibilities
:*	Identify impacts
:*	Design methods to deal with impacts
:*	Identify resources needed and available
:*	Identify the completion date desired
:*	Identify the constraints
:*	Break the implementation into steps
:*	Identify milestones / decision points
:*	Design project paths
:*	Design tracking methods
:*	Schedule team meetings
:*	Design communication methods
:*	Design technical support
:*	Design professional development

The technical staff implementing developed technology must not only manage the deployment of the hardware and software, but they must also cope with the daily activities of the school district while they prepare for the transition to the new technology. Project management skills are necessary to provide as smooth a job as possible for all involved. Further information on project management: [[/a sample list of project management organizational tools| Sample list of project management organizational tools]]; 
[[/Project Management Template|Project Management Template]]

At the same time, the administrative team will have researched and decided exactly which laptops will be purchased and from which vendor. They will have determined necessary units and submitted purchase orders. They will include in their orders sufficient quantities of peripheral items like graphic tablets, mouses, headphones with mics, tables, chairs and extension cords.

====Laptops for Students====

The implementation is so important that students will be asked to return to school two days early to be introduced to the laptops. During these two days, students will be involved in induction classes that will take them through the essential concerns of using the new laptops in school. The students will complete two days of formal training with technology specialists and their presence is mandatory. At the end of the induction session, a test will be taken to identify students that can possibly receive further assistance during the start of the year.

The students will be assigned their laptops at before the start of the school year and will be asked to sign an acceptable user policy agreement form and encouraged to personalize their new laptops in case they get assigned laptops for the year. The administrative and professional development teams will assist teachers in introducing the students in understanding how the program will be run and what their responsibilities for using laptops will be.

In addition, parents will also be sent an policy agreement that covers all the necessary information about the consequences of mistreatment of the equipment. This document will also have insurance information. Parents are required to sign this docuemtn and send it back to school.

====Laptop care====

The schools will provide specific features for the school bags that students will use for carrying computer equipment. Those students in the elementary and middle school will be required to use smaller backpacks in comparison to the students in high school. The laptops that students will be using in high school are fully-equipped laptops that need more care that the other robust models used in the lower sections of the school.

In addition, staff and administrators will reinforce the rules of laptop carrying around campus. No computers in high school will be moved without the use of a suitable laptop bag that can safely strap the equipment inside the bag.

====Staff Development====

Teachers and administrators will be the first ones to have a chance to get familiarized with the equipment that will be introduced in their classrooms. It will be necessary to prepare comprehensive tutorials or manuals to allow a quick switch into using the new technology. The professional development group will have finalized their plans for training sessions and will have begun designing the instruction. This instruction will include specific information about the change of school structure as a well as content and grade specific methods for conducting student-centered classes. Teacher responsibilities and technology integration strategies for student-centered project-based units of study will be included.

The administrative team and the professional development team will be carrying out intensive, paid, summer training sessions to prepare teachers for the changes to come in the fall. Teachers will then be given time to restructure their lessons and will have support available when they have problems.

Numerous schools have found ways to adjust schedules and provide one hour of planning and inservice for teachers while maintaining state requirements for students contact time. In some schools teachers have agreed to start earlier and end later each day as well as give up some recess or duty time in order to develop a one-hour block of time per week for inservice and planning. A key is to make sure that at least one early-out per month is devoted to a technology inservice activity.

It is crucial that consideration be given to teacher learning well in advance of the arrival of computers in the classroom. The list that follows is a brief synopsis of beneficial staff development suggestions:

:*	Formulate detailed plans for staff development and implementation.
:*	Decide who will lead staff development programs and evaluate each stage of implementation.
:*	Develop a working schedule for the staff  development program.
:*	Determine appropriate staff development activities for special services and support staff.
:*	Identify who will lead and evaluate staff development for auxiliary staff members.
:*	Identify in-house technical consultants who will help teachers deal quickly with problems that might arise.

====Technical Support====

Maintaining and servicing networked equipment continues to be a challenge for schools' effective use of technology. More states are now requiring that districts and schools have a technology specialist or coordinator who supports teachers in integrating instruction and technology before that district can receive state funding. Schools could also have in-house technical support to deal with all the technical problems that could arise. You should foresee a great number of incident reports that deal with student damaging display screen or damaging equipment because of negligence in carrying them.

The summer before the implementation, the same groups will be working to get things ready for the students in the fall. The goals are to have the technology in place to facilitate as smooth a transition as possible. The technology team will receive the laptops, inventory them and load them with the chosen operating systems and software. They will also check connectivity at each school and important points around the district to ensure that the laptops can work from the first day of school. Finally, they will create a yearly maintenance plan for cleaning and preventative care.

If staff or students need to use equipment like projectors, digital cameras or even cables, they can request the media center to facilitate the equipment and provide operational guidance.

====Flexible Scheduling====

They will also conduct public relations meetings for members of the community to inform them about the specifics of the program, including the change from a seven period isolated subject schedule to a more integrated block schedule that includes math-science-art blocks, history-literature-reading-writing-music blocks, world language-history-art music blocks and physical education-art-music-history blocks. They will explain the benefits of changing the school structure to a more constructivist, student- centered one by explaining the theory of how students learn best and demonstrating some proposed class exercises.

Flexible scheduling provides quality time either in the lounge or in the classroom for specific staff members to get together and share ideas about technology. A bonding often occurs between the mentor-teacher and the staff member needing encouragement. This new-found relationship helps solve technical problems and misunderstandings and opens the way for future inservice opportunities.

====Local Intranet====

Data intranets are becoming commonplace in schools. Intranets give schools an unprecedented ability to manage their budgets, buy supplies, and analyze student data. For example, districts are using the data intranet to provide information on student records, text scores, attendance, and health information, to create student profiles.

===Additional Key Points===

The key to success with technology is allowing teachers to develop a sense of ownership of the school's technology. Once teachers develop a sense of ownership, they will be ready to move on to higher levels of technology use. When all is said and done, it will be teachers who determine the success or failure of a technology plan. They are the people who connect technology with curricular practice in a way that will enhance student achievement. In every class, teachers must contend with a variety of learners, such as the fast-paced learner, the less-motivated learner, students with learning difficulties, and the list could go on. With computers in the classroom, teachers have access to tools that have potential for providing learning experiences relevant to each of these unique learners.

====Infrastructure====

When speaking of infrastructure, one is generally referring to the basic facilities and mechanical and electrical installations found in a school. These facilities and installations form the foundation for proposed technology upgrades. The following points provide a brief outline of things to consider when reviewing infrastructure:

:*	Decide how existing equipment and infrastructure can be integrated into the project.
:*	Visit other schools to evaluate successful programs for structural adaptations that could be copied and, in particular, look for unique ideas to solve local problems.
:*	Make sure that the network wiring satisfies the needs of the teachers.
:*	Make sure to count with the necessary expertise to ready the infrastructure for implementation.
:*	Make sure professionals are brought in order to handle remodeling and other infrastructure needs.
:*	The technology staff will run diagnostics on the district to check for adequate connectivity and electrical resources and take action to fix any inadequacies or to bolster the already existing systems.

====Teaching and Learning====

When considering how technology will be brought into the classroom, both teaching and learning should be considered. Several points to remember when considering the effects of technology on teaching and learning are:

:*	Evaluate hardware purchases and coordinate them to student needs. Consider features like user-friendliness, dependability, and speed.
:*	Evaluate projected software purchases to determine which programs will best complement, support, and expand classroom teaching and learning.
:*	Evaluate planned software purchases for comprehensiveness and user-friendliness. Comprehensiveness is important because ease of use flattens the learning curve and helps ensure that the programs will be used. When checking the software programs, all updates to versions and site licenses will also be completed.
:*	Determine the simplest approach that will effectively bring computers into the teaching and learning environment. Simplicity aids understanding and allows stakeholders to support the process more readily.
:*	Establish dialogues with teachers to evaluate classroom space and decide on computer locations withing each classroom.
:*	Determine the amount of use teachers will make of the new technology.
:*	Regardless of the size of the technology project, standardizing hardware and software are essential to maintaining control of the technology. Having a single configuration for all computers helps simplify maintenance. More time can be spent using the technology.

====Leadership====

Quality leadership must prevail at all stages of the project. Below is a list of important factors to consider when a technology project is being led:

:*	Keep students' and teachers' needs at the forefront during the various stages of the technology planning process.
:*	Consider how students and staff members will be affected by the technology changes and develop appropriate support structures like training, changes in classroom layout, and inclusion into curricula.
:*	Review school programs to determine how course subjects may be adjusted to make use of technologies in the classroom.
:*	Consider the possibility of having to modify school practices or upgrade regulations.
:*	Envision what the completed project will look like and what it will do for teaching and learning.

====Financial Management====

Most determinations about finance, generally dealt with at middle and upper management positions, will have a critical impact to the success of the larger groups. Several points are listed below to provide a general overview of the financial management process:

:*	Itemize equipment resources owned by the school. The goal is to look to reduce unnecessary duplication in new purchases. Create an inventory of all technology related items including desktops, laptops, printers and other peripherals, accessories such as mice, power cords, keyboards, all software programs and furniture used for tech purposes.
:*	Determine if the proposed equipment will be purchased locally or from a national distribution company. Decide who will be responsible for handling the recommended purchases.
:*	Review all costs to make sure the technology project is affordable in all its phases.

====Community Awareness and Support====

Community support is necessary during the planning stages of the technology initiative. It is also true that many parents want to be informed about the development of the project in their children's education. Take into account the following factors in order to provide general information to the parents:

:*	Consider how you will be able to show community members how teachers are adopting this technological direction onto their curriculum.
:*	Address parents' and community members' concerns over how technology in the classroom will enhance student learning and achievement.
:*	Show parents and members of the community how they and their children can benefit from the process of networking technologies in district classrooms.
:*	Develop guidelines for presenting information to the public. Be sure all news releases are verified with the public relations director before they go public.

== Implementation Timeline ==


[[Image:Calendar-Logo-256x256.png‎|thumb|left]]
One of the most important steps in writing a technology plan is to establish a timeline for implementation. Ideally, you'll be working on a plan that can be implemented over a three-year period or more. &lt;br&gt;

Timelines will support your efforts and provide accountability. While each activity may have its own timeline, the goals must be time-specific for effective monitoring. As you develop your preliminary timeline, ask yourself the following questions:

'''• ''What are the first things you will need to do?''''' 

Initially, this will involve creating an implementation team of stakeholders, such as an advisory or steering committee. Stakeholders can include members of the community, parents, school board members, teachers or school administration or anyone else who, because of their involvement and ownership of the issue, will have knowledge and resources that can add significant value to the project, and will be a critical component in planning and implementing changes in order to make the plan a success.

'''• ''How long do you estimate it will take to complete those tasks?''''' 

Because economic and political conditions often dictate how education funds are allocated, how programs are to be implemented and which educational requirements or initiatives are of paramount importance. The timeline must be kept relatively short to take advantage of climates that are favorable to implement changes. The idea is to make the program successful over the short-term in order to affect positive attitudes towards sustainable long-term acceptance. Decide which stakeholders or staff are to be assigned to each task and estimate how long each task will take to complete.  

'''• ''Once those tasks are completed, what are the next steps ?''''' 

Evaluation of the completed tasks will allow the plan to move forward and establish the next set of milestones. Critical to the evaluations is measuring the extent to which the plan has met its objectives. This can be accomplished very simply through surveys that account for observations made by students and teachers. These observations can also be drawn out by interviews or informal meetings. These surveys can be used to measure student performance; measure the level of technology integration into the curriculum; assess the level of technological proficiency gained by students, teachers, and staff; measure how well the plan is able to accommodate technological changes; measure how well the plan reacts to organizational changes.

 
The answer to the above questions will be crucial for organizing your technology plan writing and eventually implementation. Keep in mind that timelines should be flexible enough to accommodate unforeseen events, but rigid enough to maintain momentum. You will most likely want to segment your timeline into phases of academic years with some possible intervention or assessment mid-year. Be sure to include the time you will need to secure funding if you're going to have to apply for grants or undertake other fundraising activities to raise the money you've budgeted to implement your plan.

====Sample Timeline====

This chart should provide a general overview of how, over the course of a year-and-a-half, the project timeline evolves, and each milestone that is critical to that evolution:

== Budgeting ==
Developing a budget for a long range technology plan is not an easy task. The planning committee has no way to know what the technological frontier looks like at the plans end. Items that cost tens of thousands of dollars may be fractions of that cost in three years. For all the difficulties in creating a proposed budget, the inclusion of this budget is critical to the adoption of the plan. The planning committee needs to show that they are being responsible and realistic with the direction of the plan. The plan must not be so over the top that there is no way the projects will get funded. The committee must show that what they are proposing is realistic with the funds that are available to the district over the life of the plan.

This is one area of the long range plan that requires supervision from the Technology Director. The director will work very closely with the rest of the committee to ensure that budget numbers used are accurate and that all areas are accounted for. For a well prepared Technology Director, this will be no problem.

===Building the Budget===

There are ways to help alleviate the stress involved with building a budget. One of the required duties is to provide the committee with the current technology budget along with any known service increases. This will help the committee understand the current budget. Just as important is a replacement schedule that shows the current status of technology in the organization. Finally, any additional funding sources that will impact the final budget, such as the Classrooms for the Future Grant or e-Rate need to be disclosed.

====Replacement Schedule====

A replacement schedule is a wise practice in any industry that relies on technology. In education, it is just as important. A proper replacement schedule will show several key pieces of information to the committee. The schedule shows the equipment in the district arranged by when it was purchased and when it should be retired and replaced. It is important to note that with technological advancements, items on the replacement schedule may be replaced with different equipment. As an example, the 500 desktops purchased 4 years ago may be replaced with 500 laptops this year.

With a valid replacement schedule in place, the planning committee will have a rough idea of the funds required to keep technology in the district current. Only then can the real impact of new initiatives be determined. 

===Example Replacement Schedule===

== Funding ==
While many members of the planning committee may have a good understanding of public education funding, it is not a requirement to get through a technology plan. It isn't as important to know where every dollar is coming from as much as to know what dollars are available to you. Equally important is knowing what initiatives can be or are already tied to outside funding sources. This section takes a brief look at some of the funding options available to the committee. Portions of this section have been taken directly from the wikibook, Directing Technology: ''the Job of the School District Technology Director'', and have been noted.

=== General Fund ===
The majority of most technology dollars will come from the General Fund. This is where school tax dollars are put. Available funds from this source are limited only by the determinations of district administration and the school board.

===E-rate ===
Another available funding source for technology coordinators is the Schools and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund, or the E-rate program. The E-rate program was adopted as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This program was implemented to allow schools and libraries to implement The goal of the program is to ensure schools and libraries have access to modern information and telecommunications services in an affordable manner. Each public school district can apply for a discount based on the number of qualifying students for the National School Lunch Program. Districts can receive discounts from 20% to 90% based on qualifying students. The program has a $2.25 billion dollar annual cap&lt;ref&gt; United States Department of Education. (2007, April) E-rate Program: Discounted telecommunication services. http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/erate.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:E-rate_eligibleservices_connections.gif]]


=== Grants ===
Grants are outside funding sources that schools can apply for. If awarded, the funds may or may not have limitations attached to them. Two types of grants to be aware of are entitlement grants and competitive grants. 

==== Entitlement Grants ====

Entitlement grants are funds the district is entitled to based on a predetermined formula. These funds may be determined by items such as student enrollment or low income student percentages. These funds are often not limited in what can be purchased; however, purchases can be required to benefit certain groups, such as low income students.

==== Competitive Grants ====

&quot;Competitive grants are given by means of a review of the applicant’s project proposals. The grant agency selects proposals and decides grant amounts. The grant proposals designing projects with greater impact and more certain outcomes are given priority over proposals where projects will have less impact and less certain outcomes. Typically, most competitive grant applications will be evaluated based on the applicant’s educational goals such as potential benefit to the students and how well the project deals with an educational need&lt;ref&gt; Directing Technology: ''the Job of the School District Technology Director''. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Directing_Technology/Fund&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;


==Building the Budget==
Once the proposed items are identified, they need to be recorded and a cost analysis needs to be done. This requires the committee to determine the cost of each initiative. It is understood that the costs are estimates only and there is no way the committee can determine actual costs of many of the initiatives. It is important however for the cost analysis to be as close as possible. Almost always, it is better to judge higher than the cost may actually be. Committee members must be wary of assuming costs will come down during the life of the plan.

===Mapping and Documenting the Budget===
Once each cost analysis is complete, it is time map out the plan. This is where much of the preparation work comes into play. Knowing the status of the replacement schedule, the current budget, and the available funding are all required at this time. In addition, the committee should have an estimated number of the total amount of funds available to them each during each year of the plan.

Armed with as much knowledge as possible, it is now time to build the estimated budget. This section is often just a simple chart showing the main segments of the budget and there costs over the life of the plan. The proposed budget does not show each individual initiative. They are buried within each corresponding section. The chart is then inserted into the document with a short narrative documenting any important notes.

= Approval =
[[Image: Symbol_thumbs_up_color.svg |left|125px]]
School districts write technology plans to cover their technological needs. In order to be approved, a technology plan needs to have the endorsement of an approval committee in some form. The people involved in this process may vary depending on the type of institution.  For example, a private school approval committee may include a Board of directors or trustees, the Headmaster, school and department heads, and parents.  A public school turns to their Board of Education for local technology plan approval. &lt;p&gt;

It is imperative for each of these groups to be represented in the approval process in order to have an effective technology plan.  In a private school setting, the institution does not rely on state or government funding so once the plan is approved internally, they may proceed with implementation.  However, public schools count on federal funding such as E-rate so the approval process must move through the local level to the state level before final approval may be met.  It is imperative that a public school tech plan meets all state school standards and requirements in order to be approved. &lt;p&gt;

== Importance and Universal Service ==
[[Image: $!.png |right|150px]]
The E-rate program is an important example of why technology plan approval is so important.  E-rate provides discounts to assist most schools and libraries in the United States (and U.S. territories) to obtain affordable telecommunications and Internet access&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Rate&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

Funding for E-rate comes from a &quot;Universal Service&quot; fee charged to companies that provide interstate and/or international telecommunications services; this is refered to as the universal service fund (USF).  Universal service is the policy of providing access to a baseline level of telecommunications services for all consumers in the United States.  These universal service funds are administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usac.org/sl/applicants/step02/technology-planning&lt;/ref&gt; located in Washington, D.C. and E-rate is essentially the Schools and Libraries program. &lt;p&gt;

State Education Agencies (SEA's) are in charge of approving state public school technology plans in order to receive the E-rate discounts.  Final approval after the SEA blessing comes from the U.S. Department of Education.  Each submitted plan must contain five elements to be considered for approval&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universalservice.org/_res/documents/sl/pdf/sampleletters/sample-technology-plan-approval-letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;p&gt;

#The plan must establish clear goals and a realistic strategy for using telecommunications and information technology to improve education or library services.
#The plan must have a professional development strategy to ensure that staff know how to use these new technologies to improve education or library services.
#The plan must include an assessment of the telecommunication services, hardware, software, and other services that will be needed to improve education or library services.
#The plan must provide a sufficient budget to acquire and support the non-discounted elements of the plan: the hardware, software, professional development and other services that will be needed to implement the strategy.
#The plan must include an evaluation process that enables the school or library to monitor progress toward the specified goals and make mid-course corrections in response to new developments and opportunities and they arise.  &lt;p&gt;

Below are two examples of rubrics that evaluate E-rate compliance for approval.&lt;br&gt;  
- Rubric from Montana: http://www.opi.state.mt.us/pdf/erate/TechPlanDistrict.pdf&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opi.state.mt.us/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
- Rubric from New York: http://docspot.cnyric.org/CNYRIC/PublicDocs/ITD/ERate%20Tech%20Plan%20Rubric.pdf&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opi.state.mt.us/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As you can see, both rubrics focus on the elements that are imperative to technolgy plan approval.  The plan should be designed around these elements to avoid rejection.

== Key Elements for Approval Summary ==
[[Image: Check_sheet.svg‎ |right|120px]]
Most of these are already required to become approved for the E-rate discount, however, these key elements should be included in any complete technology plan to ensure the plan does become approved by the deciding parties.  Leaving these items out may delay or hinder the ultimate approval of the plan.  Elements that will help guarantee tech plan approval include:&lt;p&gt;

- Stating a clear beginning and end date &lt;br&gt;
- Listing clear goals and a realistic strategy to achieve them &lt;br&gt;
- Addressing professional development &lt;br&gt;
- Including a technological needs assessment &lt;br&gt;
- Providing a realistic and thorough budget &lt;br&gt;
- Including an evaluation process &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;

A successful technology plan should be designed while keeping the ultimate approval process in mind to ensure crucial elements are not left out.

==Monitoring &amp; Evaluation==

The monitoring and evaluation of a school technology plan’s implementation are important steps in ensuring its overall success. Monitoring the plan in the form of regular evaluations of goal progress will help to identify and resolve any issues that will prohibit the plan from being carried out. Each step in a goal should be evaluated as it is completed. Evaluating the plan at the end of its implementation reveals whether or not any change occurred as a result of the plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The evaluation process must be considered while creating a technology plan, not afterwards. As a strategy for evaluation is developed, these questions should be answered:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Who will conduct the evaluation?'''&lt;br&gt;
The evaluator(s) could be administrators, teachers, or a technology committee comprised of a mix of the two groups. It could involve both a person/group directly involved with the creation of the technology plan and someone with an outside perspective. It depends on the types of goals that are in the plan – educational, administrative, etc. For example, if there is an educational goal for increased student achievement in science as a result of new technology in the classroom, it might be evaluated by science teachers as well as instructional technology staff members. Students might also be surveyed to get a sense of their perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''When will evaluation occur and how often?'''&lt;br&gt;
The frequency of evaluation depends on the length of the technology plan. Formative evaluations should occur regularly throughout the time span of the plan to determine and resolve any immediate issues that may interfere with the achievement of the goals. There should also be a summative evaluation upon completion of the plan, in order to ascertain overall success and pave the way for the next version of the technology plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''How will evaluation results be determined?'''&lt;br&gt;
The people in charge of evaluating the success of the technology plan need to determine the methods in which they will do so. Some options may include administering a survey to teachers and/or students questioning them about certain goals in the technology plan to determine the goal’s success, or analyzing things that should have been affected by the technology plan, like student achievement levels or student technology projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After each evaluation is conducted, these questions should be considered:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''What is considered a success?'''&lt;br&gt;
The technology committee must determine how they will decide whether a goal in the technology plan is progressing as planned or is completed. They will have to set milestones for each goal as well as the time period of achieving a milestone within each goal.  Then it should be easy to see whether or not the goals are on track.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''How will issues be resolved?'''&lt;br&gt;
The technology plan should include strategies to resolve issues that arise during an evaluation. If it seems that a goal is not on track for completion, it should be resolved as soon as possible so that it does not affect the implementation of the plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''How will evaluations be reported?'''&lt;br&gt;
The evaluators should compile a short report to summarize the findings of each evaluation. The report should then be shared with any stakeholders, or even posted for a public audience to view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These questions are just suggestions to consider when developing evaluation strategies for the implementation of a school technology plan. It is also helpful to see examples from other schools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Examples of Monitoring &amp; Evaluation in US School Districts==

To help you construct your plan for evaluation and monitoring, it can be beneficial to build on successes of other school districts. These strategies combined with your own school district’s ideas can be a great foundation for this last stage of your technology plan.  List below are a few examples of how other school districts have built success:


San Diego Unified School District, San Diego, CA
*Evaluation Subcommittee
**Includes representatives from the school district at every level from administrator to parent to student.
**Its purpose is to review data and determine if the goals and objectives of the technology plan are being met.
**The evaluations are done in concert with the implementation subcommittee.  By sharing data they collaborate to make recommendations and report results to the entire school district
*For more information see their entire evaluation plan here: http://www.edtech.sandi.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=188


Colonial School District, Plymouth Meeting, PA
*The Colonial School District implements monitoring and evaluation at several different levels:
**At the building level, district administrators ensure the implementation by observation and also with evaluation instruments.
**Their Technology Review Committee meets quarterly to make certain the technology implementation is supporting the entire strategic plan.
**Their Professional Development Committee meets annually to monitor how the district is using technology to meet the milestones in the strategic plan.
*Please find their entire strategic plan here: http://hub.colonialsd.org/Documents/Publications/Strategic_Plan_2008-2013.pdf


These samples of evaluating and monitoring techniques should serve as suggestions only which can be pulled in and shaped by your own school district’s needs.  What we would like to stress here is not the individual techniques, but rather the follow-through required to truly evaluate the success of a technology plan.  This we realize in these days of stretched thin resources this may be the most difficult piece of the puzzle to snap into place, but without it the technology plan is not fully complete.

Please feel free to add your school's stories of successful evaluation or comment on any of the examples listed above.

==One Laptop per Child initiative in Peru==

* Miguel Zambrano
* Paige Mattke
* Stacy Getz

===Initiative/Demographics===

One Laptop Per Child is a non- profit program to put small, powerful XO laptops in to the hands of the world’s most disadvantaged children. In 2007, Peru was the second country to agree to participate in the program and agreed to order a total of 270,000 units. They received their initial 40,013 units that year. The following year in October of 2008 they will received their next 100,000 units and these will be distributed to schools in rural highland, rural coastal and remote Amazonian areas in Peru. The Peruvian government has worked tirelessly to improve its educational system and had been working on systemic reform, including the introduction of technology into schools, since the late 1980s. When the One Laptop Per Child program was introduced in early 2007, government officials, on the advice of Chief Educational Technology Officer from the Ministry of Education of Peru, Oscar Becerra Tresierra, quickly signed up to order units for its school children. Mr. Becerra was interview for this case study and was instrumental in understanding the magnitude and importance of this program. He also provided insight and resources related to the program as well.

The first school to receive the laptops was Arahuay, a one-room, multi-grade one-teacher school in the rural highlands of Lima. There are as many as 10,000 such schools in Peru and these schools provide education for as many as 22 children from first to sixth grade with just one teacher and few resources. There is a perception among the parents and students that school education is not instrumental in reaching personal goals for the future so government officials and program facilitators had no idea how the program would be received. When the parents and other townspeople were informed of the program, the coordinators were surprised to see that every parent in town came to register their children to receive a laptop. Carla Gomez Monroy, one of the distribution facilitators commented, “Something the teachers told us afterwards, that also impressed us, was that every single parent came to the meeting, except for two of them, even when parents had to walk incredibly long distances to make it.” Clearly the parents were dedicated to improving their children’s education.

The teachers that participated in the program were given a one-week 40 hour training program on the basic use and repair of the XO laptops. They were shown how to use the Internet and where connectivity did not exist; they were shown how to use the USB memory key, a form of portable Internet. This portable hard drive allows teachers to download information from the Internet when they go to a connected town to get their paychecks. They then take the information back to their schools and share it with their students.

The teachers were not told how they were to actually use the computers and were allowed to use them at their discretion. In many cases, it was the students who learned use the units and shared their discoveries with their teachers, who in turn, integrated the uses into assignments and projects. The goal of the program was to provide the students with tools to allow them to reach personally meaningful objectives. Students made audio recordings of their family members telling stories, video recordings of local festivals and looked up words to find the meanings. The program also responds to the growing demand for equity and quality of education for children living in rural areas.

===Value/Importance===

This program is important to Peru because government leaders realize that their people are their most valuable asset. The service sector accounts for 53% of the gross domestic product and officials see an educated population as the way to success in the future. Participation in the OLPC program allows student and teachers in isolated rural areas to be connected to schools throughout Peru and has been shown to improve and increase literacy rates among participating schools. There is also proof that the XO laptops have motivated students and teachers to learn, to do research and to innovate where they otherwise would not have had the chance.

 

===Greatest Success===

According to Mr. Becerra, the most successful aspects of the program was the planning phase, which included logistics and reliability planning, and the overall success of the program implementation. He explained that “the most beneficial planning processes were those related to tutor (teacher trainers) sections, training and the documentation of material planning (Becerra 2008)”. Early in the project development phase the government realized it would be impossible to closely support teachers in the remote areas chosen and at the massive levels decided. They knew it will be necessary for any project to “grow alone”. They planned a one week (40 hours) workshop that they decided should be all-inclusive and complemented it with a XO user’s guide which they published. It also became evident that Internet connectivity for all schools was out of our reach, both technically and financially, so they also planned for that limitation. The process ended with the development of an application named “portable Internet” residing in an USB key containing a navigable subset of selected educational portals and applications so children and teachers would be able to surf the net asynchronously and update their “reservoir of information” periodically when teachers go to the connected towns to get their paychecks.

The other notable achievement that the OLPC program made was the astounding increase in children’s literacy in Arahuay. When the OLPC was first implemented, the Ministry of Education assessed all second grade children using the national reading comprehension assessment. The results showed that 0% of the children were literate to grade level. After using the XO computer for 5 months, the Ministry reassessed the second grade students using the same test and found that 27% of these students were now literate to grade level compared to the national average of 15%. This is truly an amazing success. In the future, the Ministry hopes to be able to give the teachers worksheets and ideas for specific projects to work on. For now, it is just a pleasure to see the advances already.

 

===Problems===

Mr. Becerra acknowledged that the logistics plan of the program evolved into a bureaucracy nightmare. With thousands of schools nationwide and limited transportation facilities, selecting reliable transporters by the Ministry of Education was not easy. There was no certainty in guaranteeing adequate services, so the Ministry choose vendors according to their legal regulations of choosing the most cost effective offerings. To compensate the lack of reliable service, the Ministry has made arrangements with an international organization, the Organization of Ibero American States, to react more flexibly to this deployment problem.

According to Nicolas Negroponte, technical support was a serious consideration and they were aware that maintenance could become problematic (2007). Even though students would be able to repair most of the basic problems, there are limited extra parts to use for replacements. For every 100 units that have been purchased, Peru has only bought one extra unit for parts. The Ministry is evaluating the opening of regional support centers, established in urban centered community colleges that offer technical careers.

The poorest people live in the most remote areas of the country. Electrical service is difficult to provide, and many times, when available, it is subject to frequent long hours and even days of blackouts. This may require other government efforts to supply reliable sources of energy for communities and schools to charge the XO laptops. The Ministry will also encourage the community to get involved in cabling and connectivity improvement to increase the amount of electrical outlets used to charge a greater number of laptops at one time.

The southern hemisphere is currently suffering from a lack of satellite coverage. There is simply no bandwidth available. Expanding Internet connections will take time to reach the most remote areas benefited by this program. This is detrimental to the original idea that Negroponte initially launched, which was to provide access to the Internet, without which the program is incomplete. The Ministry of Education has devised a temporary solution by providing a “portable Internet” through USB memory keys with a repertoire of resources to be used asynchronously.

People sometimes question the pedagogical validity of the program, stating that there are great challenges still to face in figuring out how to put 21st century technology to use. Children and adults don’t fully understand the computer’s capabilities. Reporter Geri Smith visited Luquia, Peru, and stated that many children may not know much about the Internet and probably think that it is something contained within the machine. For many, Internet access is the most important feature of these laptops and teachers are making the mistake of presenting the virtues of the laptops as such. OLPC designed the machine and its software to enable collaboration, exploration and experimentation. These are the reasons why many children, at present, enjoy using the math games, as well as sharing sound and video recordings. Children are being motivated not just to learn and research, but also to innovate, as stated by the president of the Education Commission, Pedro Santos. According to visiting MIT scientist, Edith Ackermann, some programs are still too complex for many children to use. For this reason, OLPC is currently involving more educational experts in creating and testing relevant applications for children.

A final concern is the ability of teachers to cope with profoundly disruptive technology. The Ministry of Education is unable to be with all 10,000 schools receiving computers. They trust that teachers will use pertinent criteria and leverage their skills to do more with the laptops. Although the government provides an initial 40-hour course, this may prove to be insufficient as educators may experience a need for continuous professional development in the use of technology. Timely access to computing resources is required in order to provide teachers access to the same tools that students are discovering. In order to improve this demand, the government is offering $150 grants to qualifying teachers towards the purchase of conventional laptops. As a consequence, only privileged teachers will gain access to a path of improvement. The great majority, who struggle to meet the demands of the grant, may eventually decide not to support the government efforts. To assist, the Ministry is also providing micro programs on TV, transmitted by the State TV Channel. Additionally, there is a team of support tutors and a Help Desk that can be reached by e-mail.

===Summary===

After talking with Oscar Becerra, Peru really seems to be a truly poor country. There is little to no electricity in many parts to the country, which poses a difficult task of how to get these areas connected to the Internet. It would take a tremendous amount of money and time to correct this problem, although it is something that is being worked on as we speak. As for now, the Ministry of Education is trying to implement the best possible plan. So far, it can be seen that the children have made great gains because of access to the XO computers. These children went from having few school supplies and opportunities, to having the chance to succeed in the future, all because of having a small computer to use at school and home. It is rewarding to learn about how easily children appreciate the chances they have been given and how this has increased their desire to learn. This is a success in itself.
Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.

== Classrooms for the Future - Pennsylvania's One-to-One Computing Initiative ==


*John Loeper
*Robert Seigfried
*Richard Rosenblum

===Introduction===
Several years ago, Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell grew concerned about competing in a global market that revolves increasingly around technology. In response he proposed a program that would immerse Pennsylvania schools in technology. This program is called Classrooms for the Future (CFF). Through CFF grants, schools are provided with laptop computers that would be used to create a one-to-one computing environment, meaning that each student has access to a computer that does not have to be shared with anyone else. Other equipment including LED projectors, interactive whiteboards and digital cameras are also included as part of this grant. Lastly, extensive professional development for all program participants is included in the grant as well.
The number of computers and the money spent by the state on this project is notable. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, CFF funded technology will benefit more than 356,000 students through the use of 100,000 laptop computers by the end of this year. The 2008-09 budget provides $90 million for equipment and $20 million for professional development for teachers who use the equipment in their classrooms (PDE 2008).
In the first two years of the program, 82,000 laptops and over 4000 interactive whiteboards were deployed in 257 schools. For the 2008 to 2009 school year, the program is slated to be expanded to 182 more high schools in 152 districts bringing the total to 543 schools in 453 districts. In addition, ongoing funding for equipment maintenance and professional development is being provided for the schools who received CFF grants during the first two years of the program.

 
===The value and importance of Classrooms for the Future===
Pennsylvania is known as a “rust belt state,” because many of its heavy industries like steel manufacturing have moved overseas leaving the State with diminished economic prospects. Technology firms providing high paying jobs may find Pennsylvania an attractive place to relocate to if the population has better technology skills. The goal of CFF is to reform schools and teaching by both infusing technology into students’ educations and also by providing training and support for teachers. As a result of this technology use in the classroom, students should be better prepared to compete in the high-tech global marketplace. According to Governor Rendell, Classrooms for the Future “ is making our high schools more engaging, vibrant places to learn but, just as importantly, it is helping to ensure that our students are primed for success beyond high school&quot; (Nagel 2008).

===The process or planning responsible for greatest success===
According to Holly Jobe, the project manager for CFF, the program’s success involves two main areas: systemic adaptation and strong teamwork. In order to address systemic adaptation, an institution must identify how new technology implementations will fit into the existing setting and how it will be sustained. One example of this is that many CFF schools are evaluating the bell schedule, or considering a shift to block scheduling to allow for increased class time for more in depth uses of technology. Other schools explore how much time is given to teachers for lesson planning and collaboration with other teachers and administrators. Administrators, technology staff, and coaches need to think about how the system operates currently, and what can or should be adjusted. Teachers need to know what they can expect and they should be helped to understand as much as possible about the technology they will be expected to use.
The second area addressed by Ms. Jobe has to do with team work and how crucial it is to the success of CFF. The team must include all stakeholders including maintenance people, librarians, parents, community members, teachers, administrators, and students. Teamwork is encouraged through the use of ”Flip the Switch” days. These are community celebrations at the school where community members, parents, school board officials, and other stakeholders are invited to come and see exactly what is being implemented in the school. At these events, teachers and administrators are celebrated for their willingness to take risks in adopting new technology. As a result, people who have been out of school for many years come away with a fresh context for classroom instruction with a heightened interest and excitement about the new ways of instruction they observed.
Additional factors in planning that were beneficial to successful CFF implementation include thorough review all the resources available and consulting with individuals involved with other one-to-one programs like those implemented in Maine, North Dakota, South Dakota, Michigan, and Virginia.
A final area addressed by Ms. Jobe that is crucial to program success is professional development which along with equipment, is funded as part of the CFF program. Professional development in the CFF program is addressed through a three-prong approach. The first prong involves funding for a half-time coach who is a certified teacher with classroom teaching experience. The coach supports teachers and students in their use of technology and also provides some technical support. The second prong involves teachers in 30 hours of online professional development, which was created by outside vendors and approved by the state. Finally, technology staff, support staff, and coaches attend “technology boot camp” to prepare them for actual implementation of the program.

===The process or planning responsible for most serious problems===
The CFF program has been remarkably free of serious problems. Ms. Jobe feels that this is due to solid planning and follow through. Adjustments in the program have also contributed to the absence of any serious problems. Some of these adjustments pertained to delivery methods used in the staff workshops for coaches, teachers, and technology staff. The result has been an increase in overall effectiveness of the workshops. Additionally, some teachers resisted the 30 hour training requirement because of contractual issues so a few exceptions were made in this area as well. Ultimately, administrative personnel have responsibility to determine training options.
The only other major adjustment that Ms. Jobe would have made would be to have trained CFF school administrators first. This is key as the administrators are needed to support the program, the teachers, and any changes that may need to be made to make the CFF program a success. 

===Conclusion===
When Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell announced the Classroom for the Future program in September, 2006 he framed it as a revolutionary program for education and economic reform. Pennsylvania would develop their high school students to be technically savvy and knowledgeable so that they could compete in the new century’s high tech economic environment. This is an ambitious program that will transform students and Pennsylvania as a whole.
According to CFF project manager Holly Jobe, the success of the program is based upon two major factors. First, a systemic adaptation, meaning a complete adoption and embrace of the new technology with a willingness to radically change if necessary the way education is conducted. Secondly a concerted team effort is required by school personnel. Additionally, a strong emphasis is placed upon professional development for coaches and other team members.

==Maine, Learning Technology Initiative==

Adriane Barton
Naime Kelekci
Miro Liwosz

''„…Last summer, a truck arrived at Freeport Middle School in Freeport, Maine, and unloaded more than 130 laptops…” (Lunt, 2004)''

===Introduction to Maine, Learning Technology Initiative(MLTI)===

The Maine Learning Technology Initiative began with a vision to prepare students in Maine for a rapidly changing world. Governor Angus King, who was Maine’s governor at the time when this initiative was just beginning, recalled a conversation that he had with Seymour Papert in which they discussed how to transform education. Seymour Papert convinced Governor King that a major education transformation could only happen if students and teachers worked with technology on a one to one basis and that any other kind of ratio would not produce the transformation that everyone wanted.  In early 2000, funding granted by the state enabled administrators to provide laptops to all middle school teachers and students as a personal learning device.

In June of 2000 a joint task force was put together in order to discuss the issues of the Maine Learning Technology Initiative and to figure out how it will progress in years to come. The task force issued the recommendation that Maine will issue all seventh and eighth grade students and teachers their own personal learning device. By the beginning of the 2003-2004 school years, every middle school students and teachers in Maine’s two- hundred and thirty-nine middle schools, about thirty-seven thousand people in all had their own personal laptop. In July of 2007 the Maine, Learning Technology Initiative expanded to high school students and teachers.  Maine has become the first U.S. state to implement one to one computing.  

Despite the excitement of this initiative, there were many challenges that went along with. Many stakeholders in Maine did not support delivering this kind of technology to middle school students. Some stakeholders saw this initiative as useless and claimed that the money could be better used elsewhere. Other stakeholders warned that students might destroy or steal the equipment. The project's growing success has won over many former skeptics; parents and community members have begun to demonstrate a positive change in attitude toward the initiative. Research has shown so far that students receiving laptops through MLTI have a much more positive attitude towards school compared to those individuals who are not provided laptops. According to MLTI mid-year evaluation report (2003), teachers reported following changes in students behaviors.
:•	Increased class participation.
:•	Increased interaction with teacher.
:•	Increased interaction with students.
:•	Increased class participation.
:•	Increased attendance.
:•	Increased motivation.
:•	Increased engagement.
:•	Increased work independently.


===Value and Importance of MLTI===

The value and importance of this initiative is the access to technology. Every student and teacher is provided an Apple iBook with Internet access, email, CD-ROM and a lot of software. During the program's second year, school librarians were also equipped with laptops, and they now provide teachers with literacy staff development. Apple has worked with the Maine Department of Education and MLTI staff to install wireless connectivity. Besides that, Apple created a sophisticated hardware management system to record and track equipment. The hardware management system helped support people for repairing and replacing malfunctioning or damaged hardware. Apple also provided annual workshops for technology coordinators in Maine's middle schools.  

This initiative has had a powerful effect on middle school students and teachers. For example, one academically disengaged student who never completed assignments started actively conducting project research and regularly submitting written work. A student at Charlotte Elementary School, who was nearly illiterate and classified as a special education student who never participated in class, produced an incredible iMovie telling the story of a bomber run in World War II. The value and importance of this initiative is clear. This wonderful initiative reaches all types of learners. Students who may not enjoy school are now excited to learn and are actively engaged to learn. MLTI is providing students with new and innovative techniques for their learning. MLTI’s primary learning goal for students is not to improve students' technology skills but rather to engage students in meaningful work and encourage them to take charge of their own learning. MLTI combines the use of technology with four important instructional practices to enhance student learning—assessment for learning, place-based learning, project-based learning, and online research.

Assessment for learning stresses that in order to succeed; teachers need to learn how to use assessment to guide instruction, not just to measure what students have learned. In addition, students must gain an understanding of the learning goals, be able to evaluate high-quality work, and provide evidence that their own learning meets high standards.  Place-based learning refers to the traditional classroom environment which is depending on place and time strains. However, technology works in junction with place-based learning. Technology removes the classroom walls and opens up possibilities for connecting students to their communities in meaningful and engaging ways. In order to obtain such learning, MLTI has worked with various state and community agencies to develop ways for students to actively engage in real-world problem solving and community-based projects. Project-based learning enables educators to address multiple intelligences and diverse learning styles while giving students more choices and applying their learning. In Maine, students are using multimedia to create presentations, Web pages, and movies to illustrate their knowledge. In online research, MLTI provides access to information databases, such as EBSCO, for all students and educators. One of the program's top priorities is to make students effective and responsible consumers of information. Rather than using the Internet as one big answer key, students learn how to apply information they find to enhance their projects. 

===The process or planning responsible for greatest success===

Planning professional development, having iTeams at schools brought the biggest success to the state of Maine. Betty Manchester is director of MLTI. Her responsibility in MLTI is staff development and content directing. Teacher training through professional development was the key for the successful implementation. There are positions defined by state in order to integrate the laptop technology in curricula successfully (MERI, 2003 and 2004, Silvernail, Lane, 2004). In addition to regular teaching responsibility, some teachers had the following responsibilities.
 
:•	RIM (Regional Integration Mentors, RIM) helped to develop practices and procedure for laptop use within the school.
:•	Teacher Leaders and Technology coordinators serve as contact and support personnel for the classroom teachers in the building where they teach. 
:•	Content mentors are specialists and statewide leaders in specific content areas such as mathematics, science, language arts and social studies. 
:•	Content leaders are content specialists within each of the nine superintendent regions in Maine. They, along with the RIMs and teacher leaders within each region, serve as resources to help organize, establish, and maintain the MLTI professional development network within each region and the state.

Silvernail and Lane (2004) asserted that there is a positive relationship between participation in professional development programs and using laptops in teaching. For instance, teachers attended four or more professional development activities laptop use levels range from 6% to 15%. The teachers who did not attend the professional development activities integrate laptops into their subject area less. A majority of teachers felt that they were supported in acquiring skills in terms of developing technical and pedagogical skill; however, the time needed to acquire these skills is very limited. 

In order to solve the biggest obstacle, “technical support”, administrators created student support groups called iTeam. Student volunteers or student helpers were the first line of support in some classrooms. They had training to deal with use of various applications and basic troubleshooting techniques.  Teacher and other students have relied on them for solving minor technical problems. By doing so, teachers became less frustrated at the classroom level, and iTeams enhanced ability of both teachers and students to continue lessons with minor interruptions when problems occur.   

===The process or planning responsible for most serious problems===

Teachers thought there was potential for using the laptops and technology. However they felt that technical problems and lack of technical support sometimes limits those potentials. In addition, teachers felt they needed more time and professional development for this to occur. This included time to explore and learn how to use the technology, and the professional development activities designed to help them integrate the technology more extensively in their curriculum development and instruction (MERI, 2003).

The lack of technical support on a regular basis hindered the effective use of the laptop technology. Some of the teachers surveyed in 2004 reported that technology coordinators were helpful but not always accessible. According to 2003 data, none of the Maine schools had an in-house professional. Two thirds of the technology coordinators added that there were adequate resources allocated in their district for technology support. In most cases, technology coordinators had other responsibilities in their school district, in addition to being MLTI technology coordinator. All in all, iTeams were the most reliable solution to technical support problem. 

Teachers stated that without projectors, networked printers, software and other supportive technology, they were unable to successfully integrate the laptops into the existing curriculum (MERI, 2003).  Slow internet connections and difficulty charging laptops sometimes had an impact on teachers work. For instance Susan, a seventh grade science teacher from Hillside Middle School, stated that she changed her daily classroom activities according to Internet speed. The Internet was fast in the morning hours (Garthwait, Weller, 2005). 

Most of the teachers got used to PC platform rather than Mac. Existing PC culture didn’t support the Apple laptops in Maine. Entirely, different cultures, routines, and values of computer platforms had an impact on effectiveness of the laptops. Using different platforms also had an effect on the network infrastructure of schools. For instance, Buckfield Senior/Junior High School used PC platform with Novell network which is not so compatible with iBooks. Therefore iBooks and their wireless network and school’s main network worked independently (Trotter, 2004)

One of the biggest problems for MLTI is the take-home policy (MERI, 2003). The laptops were covered on the schools existing insurance as long as they were on school property. However, if students were allowed to take home, they will remain uninsured. According to MERI (2003), The Maine School Management Association (MMSA) contracted with the Fireman’s Fund property and casual trust insurance company to offer insurance on the laptops outside of school.  As of the end of February, 2003 only 23 schools picked up the additional insurance. Another barrier to adopt take home policy is providing filtered Internet access at home. 

Not giving out the laptops hindered most of the teachers’ instructional design. Seventh grade Science teacher Susan limited class assignments and projects for the students that could be finished during the school day (Gartwait and Weller, 2005) On the other hand, teachers and students concur it is unsatisfying and unproductive when “anytime, anywhere” learning ends at 2:20 pm at the schoolhouse door(Trotter, 2005). However, more than half of the school districts have allowed students to take the laptops home.

===Interview with Bette Manchester===

During the interview, Bette Manchester answered the following questions:

1. What were the major challenges you faced when you first assumed leadership of MLTI and how did you address these challenges?

Bette’s answer was that her anticipation was that people will “LISTEN” to her. It was difficult for people to understand some of the complexities of schools. It was a challenge to form groups to form teams.

Bette said: “The piece that was most startling for me was that I had lost my voice at the beginning of the project”.

“I sometimes felt that the train was going and I was still at the station”.

2. How did you address MLTI challenges?

Bette tried to learn as fast as she could from everyone who has been involved in a large scale projects. She had organized a design team to representing the best work in Maine, with all educational roles represented. Bette worked with that team to build more coherent sense of what needed to go on in Maine.

Bette said: “My voice becomes stronger as I help other people find their voice”


===Summary===

All ready all in one laptop initiative has resulted in a significant transformation of teaching and learning in Maine. Students had become more interested in learning. Their attitude had also changed. Reports indicated that students missed less classes and there were less disciplinary problems in classrooms.

==San Diego City Schools (SDCS) Technology Plan 2005-2010==

===Introduction===
Writing and implementing a technology plan for the eighth largest urban school district in the country is at best a daunting task.  The school district serves over 138,000 K-12 students within 187 sites.  Projects are bigger, more expensive, and harder to maintain than what we would find in many school districts. In a district of this size, even a small miscue could easily turn into a disaster. The planning that must go into these projects is crucial to their success. The process of planning, however, is not much different than any district would follow. A structured approach to the development of the plan is of utmost importance. This case study will take a closer look into the plan and the planning process that San Diego City Schools used to ensure their success. 

The city of San Diego is a very diverse location. Located close to the Mexican border, and on the west coast of the country, the district has a large population of both Hispanic and Asian students, with Hispanic being the majority in the district. Over 15 ethnic groups and 60 languages and dialects can be found while walking the halls of the district schools. In a general breakdown, the student population can be classified as follows: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|Hispanic Students || 39.7%
|-
|White Students|| 26.6%
|-
|Asian Students|| 16.4% 
|-
|African-American Students || 15.6%
|}


As with many long range Technology Plans, this plan serves as a guide for from 2005 through 2010. The district included key stakeholders in the planning process to help ensure the plan would meet the needs of all parties involved. In an additional effort to develop a strong plan, it is evident that the district dedicated considerable resources to evaluating the current status of technology in the district. Charts detailing how the technology is used such as percentages for classroom instruction, classroom management, and the use of tools by content area all help the planners get an accurate illustration of how the technology is currently used in the district.

The technology plan began with two major foundation pieces: 
#Recommendations of the educational technology teachers who work directly with site teachers
#Existing research and lessons learns by school districts who previously implemented technology plans

This information would serve as the basis for the plan; however it takes a village as they say.  Research and teacher recommendations were only the beginning.  This information would be thoroughly vetted, expanded upon and built into a living document by a large committee consisting of critical stakeholders including ed. tech., business, maintenance and operations staff.  In addition the planning committee also received input from students, parents, teachers, site representatives, administrative staff and community members.

Goals for the technology plan were established in two aspects: learning goals and professional development goals.

'''Learning Goals:'''

Based on research proving that technology implemented within a curriculum provides the greatest results when implemented at the middle school level, many of the learning goals focused on the those grades levels.  Those goals included: 
#Improve computer skills (grades 5-8) as they relate to research, communication and presentation of projects.
#Provide the technology needed to allow students access to “rich content resources” as need to meet academic standards.
#Improve reading, writing and mathematical skills for those students who have not reached grade-level standards using software and online tools.
#Use software and online learning tools to assist English Language Learner students
#Improve information and technology literacy skills middle school students.
#Use computer hardware and software to meet the needs of Special Education Students based on their individual learning needs.


'''Professional Development Goals:'''

Professional development planning was based on a needs assessment which included surveys given to teachers and administrative staff.  Based on a survey completed by 77% of teachers, less than one third of respondents rated themselves as proficient in general computer skills.  Slightly over half of teachers that completed the survey felt they were “somewhat prepared” to use technology (computers/internet) in the classroom and almost 60% of the respondents indicated a need for training on integrating technology into the curriculum.  At the administrative level 40% of those that completed the survey rated themselves as proficient in general computer skills.   Goals for professional development included:  
 
#Training staff on the usage of new software applications.  Training was accomplished using onsite workshops.  In addition online support materials were provided for many of the software applications.
#Training on general computer skills, word processing, spreadsheet programs and the Internet was provided via online tutorials.
#Integrating technology in the classroom training.
#Integrating technology into the classroom for new teachers by providing trained peer/coach teachers as a resource.
#Training for technology usage in their newly built facilities.
#Continued technology training provided during professional development days.
#Financial incentives for teachers who pursue certifications including technology offerings.
#Partnerships with local colleges.

===Phone interview with [http://www.edtech.sandi.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=355&amp;Itemid=477 Doug McIntosh] from the San Diego SD===

=====What planning process(es) were most beneficial to produce the success that your project is experiencing and why?=====

There are three main plans that have led to the success of the school district. They are known as the three “S”.  Each section correlates and builds upon each other.

*Support- Provide schools with a supply chain (technology personnel, hardware, software). Provide professional development for teachers. The amount spent on professional development is equal to the amount spent on hardware and software.

*Scale- There are over one hundred and thirty five thousand students and eight thousand teachers. For an effective educational technology program, we have to scale projects on a district wide level. Currently there is a laptop for every four students. The goal is to get the ratio under four to one.  The way to scale up is with support from the supply chain. There is an impact on teaching and learning and integration of technology into curriculums. This must be done on a district wide setting.

*Sustaining- This is the “holy grail” for a successful educational technology plan. If there is a lined item in the school district’s budget to incorporate technology initiatives, then technology will be integrated in the schools. In this section, we have to take the program beyond the pilot phase. Along with scaling, the project must work throughout the entire district. An example is having a $1300 laptop. This is difficult to support and scale due to the price of buying in mass and in the event of damages. This will not be sustained in the budget. As a result, we must look for “Linux type” laptops that are considerably cheaper and more effective to support, scale and sustain.

=====What planning process(es) failed to produce the results you had hoped and why?=====

When you don’t get full support from administrators, teachers and the community the results are negative. Furthermore, you do not want pockets of success. You want full scale (district wide) success. Also, when there is a failure on the system to come together, the three “S” do not interconnect, there is no success.

Additional Information- The school district is recognizing that 21st century learners will need new technologies to have effective and engaged learning. One needs to do new things in old ways, integrating technologies that support pedagogical instruction (project-based learning and constructivism). San Diego has an initiative to have a 1 to 1 laptop program. There are an estimate eight thousand classrooms, the goal is to have eight thousand interactive classrooms.

===Summary===
This case study has provided us with insight into how one of the most successful educational technology plans operates. San Diego Unified School District is one of the nation’s largest and diverse school districts. It has created a technology plan that engages students, faculty, and the community. SDUSD can be used as a model school district that provides the building blocks for a thriving educational technology program.

== Partnership for Higher Education in Africa Educational Technology Initiative (PHEA ETI)==

===Initiative===

The Partnership for Higher Education in Africa Educational Technology Initiative (PHEA ETI)&lt;ref&gt;PHEA ETI, [http://www.oerafrica.org/phea/AboutPHEAETI/tabid/325/Default.aspx], accessed September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is an e-Learning program whose purpose is to make effective use of educational technology to explore and demonstrate the ways in which it can contribute to addressing teaching and learning challenges, while also addressing some of the underlying educational challenges that face higher education in Africa. The PHEA initiative is an attempt to build on the numerous past e-learning activities and investigations that have been conducted in Africa and &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;present&lt;/font&gt; it through a rational and coordinated approach.

The program focuses on capacity development to initiate and sustain effective educational technology projects that have an impact on the nature and quality of student learning experiences and outcomes. The initiative also focuses on knowledge creation and dissemination across and between partner universities located in Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda on the use of educational technology.
 
As part of its mandate, the PHEA commissioned a group of individuals, with backgrounds ranging from educational technology to higher education teaching, to develop a conceptual framework that will provide the PHEA with strategies for support as well as grant making for projects and proposals. These specific projects and proposals will &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;utilize&lt;/font&gt; educational technology to address specific challenges and contribute to improving the quality of learning and teaching in higher education institutions, particularly within the partnership countries.

===Value and Importance===

The three primary strategic objectives of the PHEA Educational Technology Initiative are A) to support teaching and learning initiatives that integrate educational technology; B) to enable institutional systems to work at supporting teaching and learning more directly; and C) to research and report on educational technology activity in African universities through a long-term project. Each of these priorities are key components of an integrated strategy to aid in improving the use of educational technology across the partner universities,  representing a long-term program of action for employing technology to support higher education delivery in African institutions.

The project is divided into two Parts. Part A, which formally started on July, 2008 and finalized September, 2009, focused on delivering a model for engaging institutions in the development of effective, integrated Educational Technology Plans. Part B, which was introduced on a limited basis in August, 2009, will entail producing seven comprehensive Educational Technology Plans through partnerships with the following Universities: Catholic University of Mozambique (UCM); Kenyatta University, Kenya (KU); Makerere University, Uganda (MAK); University of Dar es Salaam Tanzania (UDSM); University of Education, Winneba,  Ghana (UEW); University of Ibadan, Nigeria (UI); and University of Jos, Nigeria (UJ).

A key component of the project is the network of researchers that was established across participating institutions in support of a coordinated research program. This program comprises local-level research activities developed within the scope of an overarching set of programmatic questions.

===Challenges===

As per an interview with a member of the PHEA ETI team and through supporting documentation provided by that team member, in this case a detailed interim evaluation (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Interim Progress Report, April, 2009. [http://www.oerafrica.org/ResourceDownload.aspx?id=36313], accessed September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;, the emerging and continuing challenges (and successes) of the project were highlighted. The original line of questioning &quot;From your perspective, what were the educational goals of the project, and how was professional development planned to help address those goals?&quot;, and &quot;From your perspective, to what degree was the professional development successful, and what do you think accounted for the degree of success (and what accounted for unexpected challenges)?&quot; did not neatly apply to this particular project because A) the Part A planning process had just been completed; B) the findings had not yet been made public; C) project recommendations for Part B had not yet been implemented; and D) the team member decided that an explanation of the project was not adequately served through the line of questioning. Instead, these challenges were expressed in the interview through an explanation of the team member's interactions with the seven partner universities and within the context of the seven areas of challenge that were identified, as further outlined in the interim report:

:'''A. Time and Communication''' 

:It was discovered that establishing and maintaining working relationships with universities is time-consuming. This is attributable to many factors, not all of which could possibly be accounted-for at the outset of the project. Although this was not unexpected, the consequence of setting a timeline lies in falsely creating high expectations about the speed with which project objectives can be achieved. Factors that influenced the timeline ranged from perceived priority issues when communicating exclusively via phone and email (these communications tended to ‘fall through the cracks’); communication protocols and identifying proper project contacts at each institution; budgetary issues limiting in-person meetings, which are highly effective in accelerating project progress; and time burdens (conflicting schedules, other work priorities) on key project team members at individual institutions that has significantly slowed project progress.
 
:'''B. Personal and Departmental Agendas'''

:The universities participating in the ETI are complex political entities, driven by often competing priorities and interests at both an individual and departmental level. A careful study and understanding of these priorities was essential to avoid institutional politics from undermining efforts, and it was important to build relationships of trust within the institution that tempered perceptions that the program served the agenda of individuals or departments, particularly within resource-scarce environments.

:'''C. Unpredictable events related to project design and timing'''

:Over the lifetime of Part A, there were unpredictable events that required flexibility in order to adapt. Key to this during the design phase was keeping expectations of what will be delivered realistic and modest, rather than overloading the project designs with highly ambitious objectives. It was better to achieve more than initially planned than to be forced to pull back and thereby create a sense of failure due to project designs that were overly ambitious. Also key to this was ensuring that timeframes were kept tight, but with space to absorb unexpected delays. 

:'''D. Rigid hierarchies and problems in communication and implementation'''

:Rigid hierarchies within the study institutions could often be a serious problem from an implementation standpoint, and when combined with demands on time, led to cumulative delays. Obtaining permissions for communication up the chain of command contributed to the biggest challenges, and because of this any loss of momentum made it difficult to manage budgets within the project timeframes. In-depth knowledge of permissions and procurement procedures is the key to avoiding potential delays by accelerating the securing of necessary permissions for crucial tasks.

:'''E. Educational technology marginalized within institutions'''
 
:Educational technology units are sometimes integrated into higher-order management, but most often are marginalized and isolated within the institutional hierarchy. Additionally, while the commitment of senior-level management exists in principle, it is not necessarily reflected in practice. Because of this, one of the future key objectives of the Part B PHEA ETI will be in strengthening the profile of educational technology within the institutional decision-making structure.

:'''F. Capacity development'''

:There is a strong need within the institutions to develop the capacity to implement and maintain systems, both technically and pedagogically. This may include, but is not limited to, technical staff to maintain the systems as well as staff to develop and effectively deliver the curriculum. Within the context of Part A of the PHEA ETI, the most glaring gap has been the inability of participants to design and deliver projects that have clearly defined deliverables, acknowledge institutional priorities, and are mindful of budgetary issues. Without proper management of these key components, the Part B projects will not be able to function efficiently and effectively.
 
:'''G. Lack of infrastructure''' 

:The target institutions were all identified for their established infrastructure, but they are facing serious gaps and limitations. These problems range from limited student access to computers, to an aging infrastructure with often expensive and unreliable internet connectivity, to limited opportunities for professional development. The initiative focused specifically on investing in educational technology that could have an immediate impact and be scaled up and sustained within existing infrastructure constraints, rather than on unsustainable (although perhaps highly effective) educational technology models that ultimately reinforce deficit thinking among the institutions as ultimately unattainable ideals.

===Summary===

The interviewee expressed that the PHEA ETI team is thus far pleased with the progress that has been made throughout the Part A portion of the project, and is enthusiastic about the project proposals for Part B. In light of this, it is important to note that this enthusiasm is tempered by the knowledge that educational technology, with a few notable exceptions, remains a low-level priority on most campuses, and the capacity to implement these projects is minimal both in terms of technology and personnel. Strong support, management and professional development will be required over the next three years of the project to develop the institutional capacity, raise the profile of educational technology, and sustain momentum towards the defined project goals.

==Duke's Digital Initiative - Using iPods to Improve Freshman Writing Skills==


William A. Brichta


===Project Abstract===

[[Image:DukeChapel_angle.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Duke University,                     Durham, North Carolina]]
In the fall of 2005, all incoming freshmen at Duke University were provided with iPods upon arrival with the intent to facilitate strategic academic gains using the new technology. Students were of course permitted to use the iPods for any other personal entertainment such as iTunes, but the gift of new iPods ensured buy-in from the undergrads for new academic initiatives. One such creative project was co-authored by Dr. Julie Reynolds, Mellon Lecturer in Writing and Biology, who envisioned using the iPods to provide audio feedback from instructors and peer students rather than written feedback in a first year Writing Skills class. Dr. Reynolds wondered if this type of feedback might result in greater efficacy for building higher order writing skills. That is, would the audio feedback stimulate the kind of critical thinking from students that resulted in better writing construction, rather than simple corrections of grammar that typically came about when written feedback alone was provided. Would those students learn faster on multiple levels? Because it was important to measure any gains, three peer groups were established without using the iPod audio feedback (control group) while three different peer groups were created exclusively using the audio feedback files.

===Value and Importance===


Three main educational goals were to be examined.


1.  Did it make a difference?  Simply put, did the audio feedback advance those students further and faster than the control group?

2.  Were higher order writing skills surfacing as a result of the audio feedback?  Were these students resisiting the urge to just want to correct mistakes without thinking beyond that limit, or did the quality of writing improve beyond just grammar edits?

3.  Pedagogically, did the writing move toward ideas? Were the students challenging themselves in an increased way as a result of the audio suggestions from other peer students as well as the instructor?


If these gains could be demonstrated and proven, then the use of the iPod for writing feedback would enhance the learning experience. This type of success could then be replicated by any college or university that taught a first year Writing Skills class, and that includes just about every institution. Additionally, there could be the added outcome that students needed to spend less time to achieve the same or greater quality in writing, which would be significant.

===Planning Process resulting in greatest success===

[[Image:Black_Ipod_5g.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Student iPod]]
Interestingly enough, there was careful planning prior to the formal start of class including training for both instructors and students (no assumptions were made that the iPod use would be intuitive), and handouts with instructions were delivered by Duke's Center for Information Technology (CIT) Help-Desk. Additionally, CIT and the project leaders recognized that the quality of microphones in laptops would not be adequate and suggested to students that they purchase an $11 microphone prior to the start of class. They also proactively modeled the kind of peer feedback that would be constructive and held in-class workshops on how to conduct a peer review. They coached proper tone of voice, providing reaction rather than criticism to what was submitted, and remaining objective in these workshops. As a result, the peer audio feedback was helpful and not hurtful (a potential risk). They also decided upfront that if any student felt negatively about participation in the project group, that they would allow that student to opt out and return to written feedback via the control group. In fact, only one student came forward with that request.

===Planning Process responsible for any problems===

While the iPods themselves performed well, one key unanticipated issue was that the students initially did not like using audio feedback. That was primarily because many felt they needed to first listen to the audio feedback, transcribe the comments, then review the material to make edits. This introduced more work into the process for them, which they noted rather quickly and vocally. It took a while before they gained the knack of listening to the feedback and editing naturally on the fly. The planning had not forseen this due in part because there had been no actual testing of the mechanics of a student reacting to an audio feedback file. This temporary shortfall did however result in a positive outcome as Dr. Reynolds explored other possibilites to enhance the process and eventually migrated to Jing. Jing is similar in some respects to Camtasia and is open source software. Students in the next phase would actually see a page of their submitted assignment via Jing video while the audio feedback played comments and writing occurred on the image page itself.  That was powerful at multiple levels and most importantly did not require the student to first transcribe the comments on a notepad, saving the false extra step that they had unwittingly introduced.

===Summary===

Surveys were conducted to solicit reaction from the students at the conclusion of the writing class. Because the use of iPods in the first year provided mulitple sensory inputs for feedback, the result was definitely positive and the project was a success. The audio feedback was shown to develop greater higher order thinking in the students and propel them toward ideas in their writing, while the written feedback alone (the control group) stayed more concrete in nature. The addition of Jing open source software after the first year aided even more so with providing constructive feedback at mulitple levels. A discussion board in Blackboard helped to track some of these changes as they evolved in the first year course, and also assisted in mechanical details such as what to do if your file sizes are too big. The Duke CIT Help-Desk functioned as another resource for any student questions about files or any other first-time difficulties. The result of the initiative was that all three of the above educational goals were met. The gains were noticeable and the learning skills were attained more rapidly using the audio comments.  

Julie Reynolds and Vicki Russell co-authored a paper describing their results with this project titled &quot;Can you hear us now - Research on students using iPods&quot; at http://cit.duke.edu/ideas/projects/category/tools/digitalmedia/ipod

To further examine the use of Jing software in a Writing Skills class, refer to http://edublog.techsmith.com/2009/07/duke-university-students-use-jing-for-peer-review.html

Perhaps the most impressive outcome from this project was that Dr. Reynolds did not simply repeat the iPod use the same way in the following year, but took the step of improving an already great idea by adding the Jing visual element.  The use of formative evaluation as the project started, along with summative evaluations in the summary feedback data at the end, aided in shaping continual improvements for the next phase of the project.

==Technology Library at the Greater Newark Conservancy==
===Project Summary===
[http://www.citybloom.org/ The Greater Newark Conservancy] is a nonprofit agency centered in downtown Newark, New Jersey. Income levels in this community are very low, and access to technology has been historically limited. In 1995, an ambitious project was begun to provide an &quot;urban environmental education resource center&quot; for the community. Their mission was to create equitable access to green and recreation spaces to promote healthy lifestyles, prevent chronic diseases and increase the well-being of inner city dwellers, especially children. The founder had a vision of creating a center for horticultural knowledge involving: a green building site, a technology library with an exterior hands-on learning area for horticultural projects; and surrounding gardens that would beautify the city. Schools could come to the site for field trips, view demonstrations at the center, university scholars could conduct research, and townspeople could get their hands dirty in an actual garden. The founder firmly believed that if people could begin to take pride in the appearance of their neighborhood, they would be one step closer to uplifting themselves out of inner city existence. She also believed that people benefit from labor when they are building something they care about and take pride in. Her vision was that this center could provide residents with educational and technological services to raise their standard of living and improve the city one acre at a time.

===The Action Plan===
The project plan involved the purchase of a historic building, renovation of that building, and the purchase and installation of a computer library. Once the physical location was completed, the center would be used to conduct environmental classes and demonstrations for students, as well as the rest of the community.The conservancy solicited community support to clear empty lots and install beautiful community gardens.

===Progress===
As of 2010, the center is only partially open to the public. Exterior renovations have been completed and the site is in use for garden demonstrations, but the interior of the main building has yet to be renovated. It may not be appropriate to call this project a failure, but after fifteen years, sufficient funds have still not been raised to open the center as initially planned. A desktop computer library, while cutting edge in 1995, may no longer be appropriate in the face of one to one laptop initiatives and widespread home internet access. However, community members could still benefit from this type of educational resource center in a picturesque setting.

===Limitations and Challenges===
The biggest obstacle to success for this project was funding. As a nonprofit agency, the Greater Newark Conservancy is completely reliant on donations from individuals and organizations, as well as grants from governmental agencies. There is no assigned, departmental budget that can be relied upon, and the effects of recent economic turmoil are readily apparent in the lack of completion of this project. In addition to economic challenges, benefactor confidence may have been undermined by an abrupt change in leadership that occurred in Summer of 2000.

The organization appears to have underestimated the urgency of opening while the project was still innovative. Other projects run by other organizations were competing for the same funds and the conservancy's major competitor, [http://www.usgbc.org/ US Green Building Council] has gone on to build a veritable empire. The conservancy also lacked sufficient technical people on the board of directors. The founder solicited support from people who had the money for this type of venture instead of those who had the skills to make it happen. The board also consisted of too many people from out of town who lacked investment in the project as problems unfolded.

===Successful strategies===
The most impressive aspect of the planning for this project was the ability of the founder to see the connections between the various projects being undertaken by the Conservancy. In addition to synthesizing the programs together to increase relevancy and educational benefit, she was also able to secure additional funding by reaching out to organizations not directly related to the mission of the Conservancy. For example, when she needed a building, she knew she could seek funding educational endowments but to ensure that she had sufficient funding for the project, she deliberately sought a historic renovation site so that she could seek grant money from those endowments as well. In order to gather the man power needed to clear the lots and renovate the exterior of the building, she connected with other local agencies and members of the community. For example, by working with local nonprofit [http://www.iyonewark.org/ International Youth Organization (IYO)], she combined the environmental mission of the Conservancy with the need for IYO to provide job training for the youth in its program. The educational programs provided by the Conservancy, both at the target site and at local schools drew in additional community members, including teachers, parents and students. By integrating programs with schools and other agencies, additional resources became available in the form of funding and volunteer manpower.

===Summary===
The technology library project of the Greater Newark Conservancy is an excellent example for both what can go right and what can go wrong for a technology project at a nonprofit agency. The initial vision was specific, concrete, and realistic. The founder successfully gathered support for her project by thinking outside the box and synthesizing and adapting the project to integrate with other organizations and sources of funding. Lessons learned from the indefinite delays in the completion of the project include getting the involvement of the right kind of people from the beginning, and doing everything that can be done to move the project forward and secure funding before the competition gets it first, the economy turns sour, or both.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation==
Despite being a 20-year old program, albeit enhanced over the years, Microsoft PowerPoint is the ubiquitous presentation software. It provides a wide range of functionality, but most of us use it for simple text slides, perhaps with a bit of animation. 

However Powerpoint does not cleanly separate the content of the presentation from its presentation (as slides, in printed form, as a index) and appearance (styles, colors), is an expensive proprietary product and over-weight for many tasks.  Thus there is value in using simple XML tools to provide similar functionality.
 
== Prior art ==
There are a number of approaches to using XML technologies to provide light-weight, non-proprietorial presentation software. These typically rely on a web browser as the rendering engine (a design choice not open to [http://www.robertgaskins.com/ Richard Gaskins] in 1984).  Core problems are the task of dividing the presentation into separate slides and supporting navigation in the slide sequence. 

*  [http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/#(1) Slidy] by Dave Raggett - SlidyXML, XSLT, Javascript
*  [http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ S5] by Eric Meyer
*  [http://docbook.sourceforge.net/ DocBook] by Norman Walsh - DocBook, XSLT 
*  [http://www.thingbag.net/docbook/sig032503/enus/misc/operashow.html] DocBook, CSS,  Opera presentation mode

This project uses XQuery as the server-side language.

== Presentation format ==
Other approaches use a defined vocabulary but the choice here is to use XHTML with a little additional markup to define slide boundaries and slideshow properties.   This provides a wide range of functionality needed such as formating, linking, images, embedded video.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;ss:slideshow xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;  xmlns:ss=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/slideshow&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ss:css&gt;
        &lt;ss:slide&gt;slide.css&lt;/ss:slide&gt;
        &lt;ss:print/&gt;
    &lt;/ss:css&gt;
    &lt;ss:header&gt;DSA 2008 - Lecture 1 - Chris Wallace&lt;/ss:header&gt;
    &lt;ss:footer/&gt;  
    &lt;ss:slide&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Teaching approach&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;1 lecture a week 
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Interaction using SMS whiteboard and Multi-choice cube&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;1 2-hour workshop every 2 weeks - write down the weeks you have been allocated&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;2 hour Research time every 2 weeks (alternating with the workshops) - independent
                    study with tutor support &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Teaching resources in UWEOnline and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/studentwiki/index.php/UFIEKG-20-2/2008&quot;&gt;studentWiki&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/ss:slide&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Here I have used two namespaces: the default is the XHTML used in the slide body, the ss namespace is used for the slideshow elements which define slideshow properties, master slide, and the slide boundaries.

This is a very minimal format which would be expanded in future.

== The Script ==
The XML document defining the slideshow content needs to be transformed into slides for projection and into a print format. In this implementation, both versions are generated from the same script.

=== Namespaces ===
The two namespaces must be declared - an arbitrary prefix used for the default XHTML namespace.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace ss= &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/slideshow&quot;;
declare namespace h = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; ;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Parameters ===

The slide parameters are the uri of the slideshow document (whether a database document or an external document), the slide number and the mode - slide or print.  The parameters are passed in a semicolon-delimited query string rather than in the more usual key=value form because I was unable to get the &amp; separator to work in Javascript(??) 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $params := tokenize(request:get-query-string(),&quot;;&quot;);
declare variable $uri := $params[1];
declare variable $n := xs:integer(($params[2],1)[1]);
declare variable $mode :=($params[3],&quot;slide&quot;)[1];

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Fetching the XML ===
The slideshow is fetched - this is faster if stored in the database but may also be an external file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $slideshow := doc($uri)/ss:slideshow;
declare variable $slides := $slideshow/ss:slide;
declare variable $count := count($slides);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The Slide Show ===
==== Show a Slide ====
A function generates the div holding a slide. The global variables define the common slideshow properties.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:show-slide($slide as element(ss:slide) ) as element(div) {
&lt;div class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;{$slideshow/ss:master/ss:header/node()}&lt;/span&gt;
              {$slide}
         &lt;span class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;{$n}/{$count} &amp;#160; {$slideshow/ss:footer/node()}  &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Contents Slide ====
The &amp;lt;h1&gt; element in each slide is used to generate a contents slide, numbered 0. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:show-contents() as element(div) {
&lt;div class=&quot;contents&quot;&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;{$slideshow/ss:header/node()}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Contents&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
     {for $slide at $i in $slides
      return 
         &lt;li&gt;{$i} &amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;slide.xql?{$uri};{$i}&quot;&gt;{string($slide/h:h1)}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
     }
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;0/{$count} &amp;#160; {$slideshow/ss:footer/node()}  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Navigation ====
Navigation is handled by a JavaScript function which handles keypress events and is attached to the page body. This code is different for each slide so is generated for each slide. The keypress mapping is based partly on the codes generated by a common wireless presenter, the [http://www.labtec.com/index.cfm/gear/details/EUR/EN,crid=29,contentid=730 Labtec Notebook presenter] which is designed for use with PowerPoint. Documentation on the device was hard to find,  so the key mapping was analysed by capturing the keypresses observed by a simple javascript.

* left and right buttons: PageUp and PageDown to step forwards and backwards 
* bottom key : 'b'  to blank the screen
* top button : toggle between F5 to fullscreen, Esc to edit mode

Other key mappings were added to allow the cursor keys to be used and to go to print mode.

Note that in generating this Javascript code, { } brackets need to be doubled.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:keypress-script()  as element(script) {
let $prev := if ($n &gt; 0) then $n - 1 else 1
let $next := if ($n &lt; $count) then $n + 1 else  $count
return
 &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;                     
        function keypress(e) {{
            var code=e.keyCode
            if (code==34 || code== 39) document.location = &quot;slide.xql?{$uri};{$next}&quot;  //Page UP or forward : next
            if (code==33 || code== 37) document.location = &quot;slide.xql?{$uri};{$prev}&quot;  //Page Down or back  : previous     
            if (code==66 || code==38 ) document.location = &quot;slide.xql?{$uri};0&quot;            //b or up  : index
            if (code==36) document.location =&quot;slide.xql?{$uri};1&quot;               //Home : first
            if (code==35) document.location =&quot;slide.xql?{$uri};{$count}&quot;    //End : last
            if (code==80 || code==40 ) document.location =&quot;slide.xql?{$uri};0;print&quot;    //p :  print
         }}       
    &lt;/script&gt; 
};
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Generate ====

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

if ($mode=&quot;slide&quot;)
then
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{string($slideshow/ss:title)} - Slides&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;  href=&quot;{$slideshow/ss:css/ss:slide}&quot;/&gt;
   {local:keypress-script()}
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body onkeydown=&quot;keypress(event)&quot;&gt;       
    { if ($n=0) 
      then   local:show-contents() 
      else  local:show-slide($slides[$n])       
    }
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
else ...
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Print format ===

Other functions generate a printable version of the slide show.  This comprises :
==== Contents Page ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:print-contents() as element(div) {
&lt;div class=&quot;contents&quot;&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
     {for $slide at $i in $slides
      return 
         &lt;li&gt;{$i} . &lt;a href=&quot;slide.xql?{$uri};{$i}&quot;&gt;{string($slide/h:h1)}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
     }
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;
==== Slides ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:print-slides() as element(div)* {
  for $slide at $i in $slides
  return 
         $slide 
};
&lt;/source&gt;
==== Links ====
The URIs for links is not visible in the printed slides, so it is useful to add a final page with all the links which appear in the slides listed together.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:print-links() as element(div) {
  &lt;div class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    {for $slide at $i in $slides
     for $link in $slide//h:a

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Chazz|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

I note you've been doing some good edits on the Muggles' Guide; thank you for that, it does help. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:10, 18 September 2008 (UTC)

== Questions ==

Just as a reminder - the questions are intended as study questions. We don't answer them ourselves, they are left as exercises for the students. Thank you. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:54, 18 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

Characteristics of ant-inspired traffic flow
Applying the social insect metaphor to traffic models
http://www.springerlink.com/content/1935-3812

Abstract  We investigate the organization of traffic flow on preexisting uni- and bidirectional ant trails. Our investigations comprise a theoretical as well as an empirical part. We propose minimal models of uni- and bi-directional traffic flow implemented as cellular automata. Using these models, the spatio-temporal organization of ants on the trail is studied. Based on this, some unusual flow characteristics which differ from those known from other traffic systems, like vehicular traffic or pedestrians dynamics, are found. The theoretical investigations are supplemented by an empirical study of bidirectional traffic on a trail of Leptogenys processionalis. Finally, we discuss some plausible implications of our observations from the perspective of flow optimization. 

This seems interesting... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:04, 18 September 2008 (UTC)

== Incomplete ==

This is listed as a completed book, but it isn't. For one, it's very highway centric. It needs discussion of other modes, as well as information on the effects of transportation design choices on safety, society and the environment. --[[User:Triskele Jim|Triskele Jim]] ([[User talk:Triskele Jim|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Triskele Jim|contribs]]) 17:21, 1 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the world of cinematography and film, two giants have emerged at the threshold of the industry. Founded in 1987, the nonlinear editing software called AVID, that would soon take hollywood by storm. By the mid 1990's the many films and dozens of TV shows had switched to AVID, marking the end of cutting celluloid. The program allows editors to handle their film with greater ease. With the emergence of Apple, Final Cut Pro (part of Final Cut Studio) has become quite popular with its easier navigation and interface. Most professionals in Hollywood are still doubtful about the upstart Apple software. However, experts agree, that to choose your editing software, depends upon the type of project to be produced. There is no right or wrong.

== Telling the date ==

Telling the date in Tagalog if translated in English will be like this:

Ika Uno ng Disyembre
First of December

Days are said in Ordinal Numbers (and here, for stating the date, you would not use the alternate ordinal prefix &quot;pang-&quot;; only the use of &quot;ika-&quot; is appropriate).


== Telling the time ==

Pedro: Anong oras na Pilar?
Pilar: Alas Diyes Bente y Quatro na ng Umaga
Pedro: Anong petsa ngayon?
Pilar: Ika Labing Walo ng Nobyembre
Pedro: Salamat
Pilar: Walang anuman

=== Salin sa Ingles (English Translation)===

Peter: What time is it Pilar?
Pilar: It's Ten Twenty Four in the morning
Pedro: What's the date today?
Pilar: It's the Eighteenth of November
Pedro: Thank you
Pilar: No Problem


Oras - Time
Minuto - Minutes
Sekundo - Second

Hours (Oras):

Ala Una - One O'clock
Alas Dos - Two O'clock
Alas Tres - Three O'clock
Alas Kwatro - Four O'clock
Alas Singko - Five O'clock
Alas Sais - Six O'clock
Alas Siyete - Seven O'clock
Alas Otso - Eight O'clock
Alas Nuebe - Nine O'clock
Alas Diyes - Ten O'clock
Alas Onse - Eleven O'clock
Alas Dose - Twelve O'clock

Minutes (Minuto)

Onse
Dose
Trese
Katorse
Kinse 
Disisais

==== Numbers over 20 ====

Telling minutes over 20 is similar to spanish just add 'Y' inbetween the numbers for example:

Alas Bente y Kwatro


Numbers:

Trenta - Thirty
Kwarenta - Forty
Singkwenta - Fifty

      <text xml:space="preserve">Be sure to focus on your offscreen window ''after'' all the events have been delivered for the start-up of your application.


== to create an offscreen window ==

(and to remember the original window that your application started with)

  WinHandle  offWin;
  WinHandle  sysWin;

  Coord             width  = 160;
  Coord             height = 160;
  WindowFormatType  format = screenFormat;
  UInt16            error;
  offWin = WinCreateOffscreenWindow( width, height, format, &amp;error);
  sysWin = WinGetDrawWindow();


== to release an offscreen window ==

  Boolean  eraseIt = false;
  if ( offWin != NULL)
  {
    WinDeleteWindow( offWin, eraseIt);
  }


== to focus on an offscreen window ==

  WinSetDrawWindow( offWin);

After this invocation, functions such as &lt;tt&gt;WinEraseRectangle&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;WinDrawLine&lt;/tt&gt; and so on will draw to the offscreen window.


== to blit your offscreen drawing to the original window ==

  WinHandle         srcWin;
  WinHandle         destWin;
  RectangleType     r;
  Coord             destX;
  Coord             destY;
  WinDrawOperation  mode;
  
  srcWin = offWin;
  destWin = sysWin;
  r.topLeft.x = 0;
  r.topLeft.y = 0;
  r.extent.x = 160;
  r.extent.y = 160;
  destX = 0;
  destY = 0;
  mode = winPaint;
  WinCopyRectangle( srcWin, destWin, &amp;r, destX, destY, mode);

      <text xml:space="preserve">Paul,  I really enjoyed to read your philosophy of education.  I see you  are a very young and I loved to find one that believes on himself thinking he  can make a difference. I am sure you will.
The idea of a teacher seeing their students grow up, inside and outside,  is exactly what I think too.  I am excited to find someone as young as you that understands that it is not just about being competitive and succeding in school, but it is to learn how to be happy and strong in our school life because we had a good feed back from when we were children. I invite you to see my coments in my article, and you will see in my personal experience how important this was for me.
About no child left behind, I agree with you. I also think that everybody has different talents. Someone might not be good in Math, English or Science  but good in art, sports and generosity etc.  I am not saying that students do not need to pass Math, English or Science  exams. I am just saying that teachers might need to have this sharpness or finess  to recognize when someone has differents gifts and making them feel proud of them, even though those don`t  embody with the curriculum.[[User:Mchar009|Mchar009]] ([[User talk:Mchar009|talk]]) 12:58, 18 September 2008 (UTC)[[Special:Contributions/68.110.155.87|68.110.155.87]] ([[User talk:68.110.155.87|talk]]) 12:55, 18 September 2008 (UTC)

Paul, your ideas about how parents can take a real active role in the learning process of their child is VERY IMPORTANT.  I sometimes got the impression from our class that too much emphasis was placed on just the teacher and child relationship when really it should involve the parents to some degree as well.  Parents ought to be the primary teachers and the degree to which we cooperate and share with them various things we notice about their child the more they will be able to join in the cooperative effort of directing their child's efforts and motivations.
As far as the NCLB directives and the SOL assessments, I think they are a good start.  I also think that was time goes on there could be a cooperative effort to make them a little more of formative tools rather than summative assessment tools.  What do you think?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sample source code invalid?==

Copying the sample source code into a new XQuery document in the Oxygen XML editor gives me the following error: &quot;F [Saxon-B XQuery 9.0.0.6] XQuery static error in #...dia-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;#: Prefix exist has not been declared&quot;

Is there perhaps something wrong with the sample? [[User:Zazpot|Zazpot]] ([[User talk:Zazpot|talk]]) 11:55, 18 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

* Needs an introductory paragraph about expressing a sum in terms of the angles summed.
* Needs a few exercises on calculating sines and cosines from known angles.

My name is James Wilcox, and I've been using the handle w3asal or some alternate spelling since I first discovered the net in middle school. I'm a university student in mathematics and computer science, so most of my contributions will be made to those areas. In my spare time, I enjoy reading about math, computers, and philosophy, as well as discussing nearly anything with others.</text>

== Talk pages ==
Hi W3asal,

I noticed that you had removed the last two comments placed on your talk page. This is, of course, your talk page and you're (mostly) free to use it as you see best. It is, however, helpful for your fellow Wikibookians if you leave discussions up for a while. For instance, you left a note on [[Talk:Calculus]] to which you got a reply, but by the look of your talk page, no-one got back to you. Not only do more signs of activity lure more contributors, but they help readers determine who's been contributing to what extent without searching through page histories and user contributions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:00, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

== Calculus ==

I was thinking of merging some derivations from WP into Wikibooks leaving links there to promote our books. There are a couple at [[w:Volume]] which I think belong rather here than there. I'm not sure how much I'll be working on this book, but feel free to bounce ideas off me or ask me to join discussions if you like. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:00, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

: If you move examples form this page, the image I uploaded would go well with the cone example from [[w:Volume]].  And the sphere example would round out the second example which is intended to be about a sphere but hasn't really been written yet.

I would love some feedback about the images at [[Calculus/Volume]] if you have some spare time. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:45, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Composing E-mail ==
E-mail (Electronic Mail) is now used by virtually every business and company (in North America, East Asia, Australasia and most of Europe) as a way of communicating both within the business and with other outside businesses. As a fast, reliable way of sending messages and interacting with people in all sectors of the business world, e-mail has emerged as the number one way of communicating.

Historically, E-mail is used as an informal way of communicating to other workers. E-mail straddles the line between informal communication and formal business interaction and while it has become increasingly more formal in manner, e-mail is still hard to pinpoint in a business setting because of the inability to tell emotion or tone of typed text. Caution must be used when writing e-mails in a  professional business setting as to choice of words and selection of organizational elements of the document. As stated below, all e-mails are saved and recorded, as well as potentially read by any number of people. Emails are a great tool in the workplace, but must be used with caution. Keep in mind the following tips when composing an e-mail.
* Limit email use in the workplace to business-specific information and topics.
* Review email for legal implications, because any and all written documents in a business environment can and will be used in court.
* Use professional language and tone.
* Pay attention to your audience and consider their background when writing.

Professional business communication is essential to the success of any corporation. This could include writing memos, reports, or proposals. Any corporation, even small businesses, can benefit from professional and technical communication. There are many different forms and aspects of business communication. Two criteria for solid communication involves the ability to persuade and to be usable in business writing.
 
Business, in the modern day, is extremely intense. When writing business documents such as memos, reports, or workplace e-mails, it is important to consider these points. 
* Efficiency in the business setting is of extreme importance and it all begins with communication. 
* Wasting time in communicating is ultimately wasting money in today's society.

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy of any work is extremely important, especially if it is something that is intended to be truthful or obtain a position of interest; like a resume. If an employer or anyone associated with the employer (audience) finds out that you lied or exaggerated on anything you severely risk not obtaining or even losing your job. It is in everyone's best interest to be completely truthful when compiling any form of business document. Not only can your job be tainted, but the loss of respect from others can be even more damaging.
 
== Audience: Intended vs. Unintended ==
Every document that is created is normally crafted to someone specifically. This someone would be your intended audience, for your writing style, and content will be tailored to their appeal. Emails, unlike some other business documents, are not restricted to just one person, or intended audience.

'''Carbon copies and blind carbon copies'''&lt;br&gt;
When working with emails, it is possible opt to use carbon copies (CC) and blind carbon copies (BCC). Carbon copies are used to send messages and other documents to other recipients. In many situations, however, an unintended audience could come into play. This could be anyone that you never expected to see your document, such as a boss or co-worker. For example, if you send an email to a co-worker talking about the company that you work for, or even your peers, the co-worker is your intended audience. Although, if your boss were to come across this document, he or she would be the unintended audience and there could be severe repercussions if the email was not crafted with other people in mind. Another issue is you may be sharing personal information without permission, since all emails addresses involved sender and receivers will be visible to all. This is where blind carbon copies come in handy. A blind carbon copy is used to send copies of documents and messages to other recipients without the original recipients knowing. For example, you find out that one of your co-workers could be involved in potentially illegal activities, so you send an email to your co-worker confronting them about the activity, and you send a blind carbon copy to your boss, so that he or she becomes aware of the current situation and potential future consequences. 
 
All aspects of your business documents should take into consideration everyone that could potentially read it. By ensuring this, you will save yourself and even possibly save your job. The worst case scenario could be that your document's untended audience is the people in a court of law. Please keep in mind that by protecting your company, your boss, and your job by examining your work for legal liabilities will also be protecting the public. As mentioned above, you never know who will be reading your documentation, so if an unintended reader who is not authorized to read or use your document, decides to use it, they could be putting themselves and others in significant danger. 
 
Overall, one must always consider who will be reading or witnessing their documents. With the business world becoming more and more global, it is increasingly important to understand how to communicate with a foreign audience as well. Something that might not be offensive to you, could easily be offensive to someone from another culture. No one will make decisions in your favor if they feel that you deliberately offended them. This could all be caused because your communication was lacking, and you weren't properly considering your audience.

== Different Types of Business Communication ==
Communication in business varies from task to task. Here is a list of just some of the different documents that can come up in the business setting:
 
*Memorandums (Memos)
*Presentations
*Proposals
*Reports
*Feasibility studies
*E-mails
*Résumés
*Cover letters
*Websites
 
== Ending a Communication ==
After getting your main point across you should properly end communication. Ending a communication is as important as getting your point across. Research has shown that the reader is able to remember things said at the end of communication more than in any other part of communication. The ending is an important place to influence the readers' impressions of the subject you are presenting. In order to properly end communication, it is important to follow the guidelines presented below.

;'''Guideline One''': After you've made your last point, stop. Try to use a pattern of organization that allows you to stop at a                                natural place.
;'''Guideline Two''': Repeat your main point. Make sure to emphasis your main point in your conclusion. It allows the reader to think about the main point one last time.
;'''Guideline Three''': Summarize your key points. Although this guideline is similar to the one above, when you summarize, you are ensuring that your audience understands your entire communication.
;'''Guideline Four''': Refer to a goal stated earlier in your communication. It is common to state a goal in the beginning of communication. Referring to your goal at the end of communication sharpens the focus of your communication.
;'''Guideline Five''': Focus on a key feeling. In some communications, it may be important to encourage your reader. Therefore,  focusing on a feeling will help focus your reader.
;'''Guideline Six''':  Tell your readers how to get more information. Giving future communication assistant will encourage your reader.
;'''Guideline Seven''': Tell your readers what to do next. Giving guidance will help lead your reader in the direction you want.
;'''Guideline Eight''': Identify any further study that is needed.
;'''Guideline Nine''': Follow applicable social conventions. Examples of this are letters ending with an expression of thanks, and a statement that it has been enjoyable working with the reader.

=Front Matter: Contents, Lists and More=

Front matter is an extremely important element to writing any report. Whether its for a specific company research or for other personal reports. Specifics such as the size of the font, font type, formatting, and organization also need to be taken into consideration when creating the front matter of your report.

The first few pages of a report are essential. An abbreviated abstract will assist the reader in finding what the main points of the report will be about. 

These elements are often referred to as &quot;Book Elements&quot;, as they are commonly found in larger works. 

Important considerations should be made on how your publication will be used. To increase usability, you should consider how your readers will be using the report, and what they will be looking for, and focus on making this easy to find. 

==Covers==

A cover page is a very simple, precise, brief way to introduce your report to the reader. This should contain:
 
* A large specific title
* Company name 
* Name of the author(s)
* Date of the report  
* Relevant picture

The use of a relevant picture or two can help reinforce the subject of the report. One goal of the cover page is to be informative and scalable because once it is filed, it will need to be easy to pick out of a stack of other reports. A second goal is to make the report stand out. If the report cover looks bleak and dull, the reader will start reading with a negative outlook. Think of the cover page of a report like what is worn to an interview. The cover page is the first thing that is seen. It will be the foundation for first impressions, for better or worse. One easy way to make the report stand out is to use a theme for the report that your audience can connect to. For example, if a report is written to McDonald's, the cover page will be in yellow and red with the golden arches as a picture. It is important that the reader believes that he or she is the most important aspect of the report.

==Title Page==

A title page will be very similar to your front cover '''and it repeats the information on the cover, but adds more important details. '''--[[User:Nardi82|Nardi82]] ([[User talk:Nardi82|talk]]) 17:12, 23 April 2010 (UTC)
This may include a report number, date, title, the names and addresses of authors, specific contract information, the name and address of the supervisor, and the name and address of the organization who supported the report (Technical Communications, p.312)

The title page is an opportunity to provide specific, detailed information about the document and its authors to its intended audience.

==Executive Summary or Abstract==

Abstracts are an important element in the business world. This will help a manager learn the main points of your document, and help the reader determine if the entire report is relevant to what they are looking for. Charts and graphs that show factual data are helpful visuals that can be implemented into this section of the document.

Major topics should be mentioned, but not the main points of each. This will be where most of the key words of your report are used, and will be a preview of the information to be covered. Often, summaries are used when representing a report in a database, so illustrating the main topics of your report in this segment can be useful.

The abstract should always be a page or less, especially in informative situations. Typically an abstract should not be more than 15 percent of the total report.

According to the Technical Communications text,
* Identify the intended audience
* Describe Contents
* Tell the reader how the information is presented

==Table of Contents==
In any report or analysis, a table of contents is helpful to navigating the report. Some lengthy reports may also include a table of graphs and/or a table of figures. 

In addition to the summary, this will allow the reader to quickly scan the topics you have covered. This will also help if they are looking for something particular. Use of proper headings and sub-headings give readers a good overview of all the information contained in your document.

Table of contents are usually extremely generic and similar to each other. This is for ease of navigation to the user. Table of contents can be formatted from Microsoft Word.

EXAMPLE:[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/ch01/ch01_fig07.html Chicago Manual of Style: Table of Contents: Formatting]

==Lists of Figures and Tables==
This is a useful section to include because your images or tables are referred to repeatedly throughout your text. Include Figures and Tables lists when your article is over about 15 pages. This also allows for easy comparison between images when they are grouped together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}

='''Business Letters'''=

Business letters are written messages to a person or group within a professional setting. Business letters are used when the writer would like to be formal and professional. Letters may vary in length depending on the writer's objective, purpose, and message of the letter. The letter can address anyone including, but not limited to: clients and customers, managers, agencies, suppliers, and other business personnel or organizations. It is important to remember that any business letter is a '''legal''' document between the interested parties. These documents can be held for up to seven years, so it is important that all information is honest and legitimate.

==The Difference Between a Business letter and other letters==

The main thing that differentiates a business letter from other letters is that a business letter is a legal document. The writer can be held liable for anything written in the letter. For example, if it is stated that a project will be completed by a certain date in a business letter, the project legally must be completed by that date. However, if the project can't be completed by that date, another letter can be written stating that the project is behind schedule and why. For this reason, business letters must be written differently than letters used for personal use.

A business letter is used primarily to request or provide information, to relate a deal, to bring or continue conversation, and/or to discuss prior negotiations. A business letter can be classified as private, however, it is typically not circulated to others, but rather meant for the eyes of the participants involved. Therefore, a business letter needs to be clear, focused, and to the point. When writing a business letter, the author should avoid interjecting personal stories.

A business letter needs to be concise and clear. Being too wordy is the biggest downfall in this form of writing. Keep sentences short and precise. Avoid over using adjectives and adverbs that distract from the focus of the message. Organize the letter from most important subjects to least. The content of the letter should be persuasive and usable. The tone of the letter should be formal and professional. 

Also, in a business letter, it is preferable to use personal singular pronouns like &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;. Avoid using plural pronouns like &quot;we&quot; since it can mislead the audience to assume that the company supports the message of the letter. In addition, personal pronouns are easier to understand, because it directly refers to the parties involved.

==What to Include in a Business Letter==

Best Regards,

'''Formatting Your Business Letter'''
*Use single spacing. NEVER use double spaces within the business letter. 
*Use a simple format with font that is easy to read.
*For block, and modified block formats use single spaces.
*Leave a blank line between each paragraph. This makes it easier to follow the changes of topics within the letter. 

'''The Introduction'''
*This paragraph should introduce why you are writing the letter and sum up the key points in the following paragraphs.
*Include a statement that shows you are knowledgeable of the audience to which your letter is directed.

'''The Body'''
*Provide background or history regarding the purpose of the letter.
*Talk about key points you are making.
*Include a justification of the importance of the main points.
*List any important dates, discussions, and conversations that are relevant.
*Ask questions, if necessary.

'''Conclusion'''
*Summarize the main points of the letter.
*Restate the problem and resolution if pertinent.
*Include deadlines.
*Provide contact information (Email, Phone Number, Fax, Etc...).

'''Closing Salutation'''

It is important to take into account your audience when ending any business document. Being both respectful and professional are two important elements of your ending salutation. You must remember that each employer, boss, or co-worker may have different expectations as to what is acceptable as a proper salutation. A few general ending salutations deemed professional include:
*Sincerely,
*Respectfully yours,
*Yours truly,
*Best,
These should be used with individuals whom you do not have a relationship with, new co-workers, potential clients, or a large email to a wide variety of individuals. When you are sending a business document to an individual to whom you are accustomed, your salutation should change. Consider a professional salutation, which is not too formal. Examples include:
*Kind regards,
*Best regards,
*Many thanks,
*With appreciation,
*Best wishes,
When in doubt about which type of salutation should be used, a simple &quot;Thanks&quot; or Thank you&quot; is always appropriate.

Always close a letter. ‘Sincerely’ would be the safest way to close out a business letter. On a typed business letter, following the closing, you should leave a space to sign your name with a pen. This will allow for a more personal touch on an otherwise bland letter. This is the only handwriting on the paper so make sure the signature is clear. Below this personal signature should be your typed first and last name to allow for easy reading. After this you can include anything else that the reader may need to know. This could include anything from job title, identification, a notation that there are copies attached at the bottom of the document, or other contact information, such as e-mail address or business phone number.

==Tips on Writing Business Letters==

*Address the reader formally (Mr., Miss, or Mrs.) unless otherwise directed.
*Address the letter to a specific person whenever possible, and not the company so it does not get discarded.
*Use a colon after the salutation if using the reader's last name and a comma if using their first name.
*Use company letterhead to make the document more professional, if the document is related to company affairs.
*Use a subject line to inform the reader quickly of the documents content.
*Sign your name in ink neatly at the bottom, between the closing and the Electronic Signature of the document.
*If a letter does not fill an entire page, put be sure the content of the letter is in the middle of is the page and the document is balanced.
*Be sure to list the people on the letter that you are sending copies to so a certain individual is not left out.
*It is okay to use specific pronouns, such as &quot;I&quot; and &quot;You&quot;, but be careful when using &quot;We&quot;. This is simply because it can commit your company to what you have written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Counting from one to ten.==

You learn to count from one to ten by repetition.  You also learn to recognize the relationship between numerals and number words.  You learn to count backwards from ten to one.  You learn to identify from one to ten objects.  One to five objects you should identify on sight (without counting).  You should be able to do the same with six to ten objects that are grouped in certain patterns.  

Most people learn this skill when very young, but just as there are adults, some very successful, who cannot read or write, there are adults who have never mastered this number skill.  It is essential to further progress in mathematics.

If an adult does not know how to read at an adult level, I advise them to read aloud to children.  If you are an adult, and are unsure about numbers, teach numbers to a child.

The first skill in this section is to be able to say aloud, as you might say the lyrics of a song you heard often:

one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

Practice this, hundreds of times if necessary, until it haunts you, until if someone says &quot;six&quot; you automatically think &quot;seven eight nine ten&quot;.

Practice writing the numerals, and saying their names aloud.  The first ten numerals are 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

If you are not already perfect at this, write these ten numerals on ten separate sheets of paper, and practice pulling one out at random and saying the name of the number.  If you are teaching this skill to a child, make a set of flash cards with the word on one side and the numeral on the other.

The next skill in this lesson is to count down from ten.  As with counting, just repeat until you know by heart:

ten nine eight seven six five four three two one.

When you have done this, if you are thinking in terms of &quot;counting down&quot; and someone says &quot;seven&quot; you should automatically think &quot;six five four three two one&quot;.

The final skill in this lesson is recognition of &quot;how many objects&quot; there are in a group of one to five objects.  Practice this until it becomes automatic.  As soon as you see a group of one to five objects, you should know, without thinking about it, how many objects are in the group.  If this does not come easy for you, practice with small groups of objects at home until you can do it without counting or even thinking.  Then move on to groups of six to ten objects.  You do not need to automatically recognize how many objects are in these groups unless the groups are arranged in one of the following patterns, but you should recognize, on sight, each of the following patterns:

 @@@
 @@@     six objects

 @@@
 @@@@    seven objects

 @@@@
 @@@@    eight objects

 @@@
 @@@
 @@@     nine objects

 @@@@@
 @@@@@   ten objects

Once you have learnt the numbers one to ten, you can practice identifying a bigger number out of two given numbers. For example:
# (2,3) - 3 is bigger
# (6,4) - 6 is bigger

==Counting from eleven to twenty.==
In some languages, Chinese for example, the number words from eleven to twenty follow the same pattern as the number words from twenty to thirty, but this is not the case in English, and so you need to memorize the number words from eleven to twenty.  Repeat the following until you know it by heart:

eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen twenty

You do not need to learn this list backwards.

The numerals eleven to twenty are

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

You need to associate the numeral with the word so that the sight of either brings to mind the other.  Use flash cards.

You also need to think of 11 as ten plus one, 12 as ten plus two, and so on, so that in mastering these number words, you also begin to master addition facts.

==Counting to twenty by twos.==
The next skill is to count &quot;by twos&quot; from two to twenty.  When you count by twos, each number is two more than the previous number.  This kind of counting is sometimes called &quot;skip counting&quot;  Memorize:

2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20

Say it over and over until you know it by heart.

Note that the word &quot;twos&quot; is plural, not possessive, and does not take an apostrophe.

==Counting to one hundred by tens.==

The next skill is counting by tens from ten to one hundred.  Each number is ten more than the previous number.  Memorize:

ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.

Note in particularly, the spelling of &quot;forty&quot;.  That spelling does not make any sense, considering the way we spell &quot;fourth&quot; and &quot;fourteen&quot;, but we must follow the dictionary when it comes to spelling.

Learn to match the names and the numerals until it becomes second nature:

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100

Notice that while the spelling (in the case of forty) does not follow a pattern, the numerals do follow a pattern.  That is, if you knew ten, twenty, and thirty, that would not help you guess &quot;forty&quot;.  But if you knew 10, 20, and 30, you could easily guess 40.  This is the wonderful thing about mathematics.  It follows patterns, so that after you learn just a few things, you can then guess correctly many more things.  This is why you can learn, in less than a year, what it takes twelve or more years to learn in school.  School usually uses too much memorization.  In this book, you will memorize only what must be memorized, and learn the rest by seeing the pattern.

You need to have an idea of how many one hundred is.  One hundred is ten tens.  Gather one hundred objects on a table, in ten groups of ten.  (Really do this.  Don't just think about doing it, do it.)  One hundred is big, but not too big.  I would never ask you to gather a million objects.  It would take days, and they wouldn't fit on the table.

==Counting to one hundred by twenties.==

Memorize:

20 40 60 80 100

The main reason this is important is that the twenty dollar bill is in common use in the United States.

Remember, memorize means memorize.  Yes, you could figure out how to count by twenties.  That isn't good enough.  This basic stuff you need to be able to do without thinking, while you are thinking about something more important.  Be sure you can count by twenties while you are washing dishes or talking on the telephone.  Be sure you could count out the values of five twenty dollar bills while carrying on a conversation with the bank teller.

==Counting to one hundred by ones and by fives.==

After twenty, all the whole numbers follow a pattern.  After you know that 87 is read &quot;eighty seven&quot; and means eighty plus seven, you know almost all the number words you will ever need to know.  I haven't counted them, but I would guess that in all the rest of this book you will need to learn less than a dozen more number words.  In other words, you've already learned the most important part of mathematics!  Now, if you've never done it before, count out loud to 100.  You don't need me to tell you how.  You can figure it out for yourself.  Now count by fives to 100.  I'm not going to tell you how to do it.  Find the pattern.

==Who's on first?==

When a number word is used as an adjective instead of as a noun, it changes.  If the number word is one, two, or three, or if the number word ends in one, two, or three, as does two hundred fifty-three, then &quot;one&quot; becomes &quot;first&quot;, &quot;two&quot; becomes &quot;second&quot;, &quot;three&quot; becomes &quot;third&quot;.  When the numbers are given using numerals instead of words, we use superscripts: 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, pronounced &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;.  All other number words and numerals add &quot;th&quot; when used as an adjective, thus, &quot;fourth&quot;, &quot;fifth&quot;, &quot;sixth&quot;, &quot;seventh&quot;, &quot;eighth&quot;, &quot;nineth&quot;, &quot;tenth&quot;, &quot;eleventh&quot;, and so on.  Note that &quot;fourth&quot;, the adjective form of &quot;four&quot;, is not the same word as &quot;forth&quot;, meaning &quot;forward&quot;.  Also note the odd spelling and pronunciation of &quot;fifth&quot; (the second &quot;f&quot; is silent), and the fact that &quot;eighth&quot; does not have a double &quot;t&quot;.

When a number word is used as an adjective, it is sometimes called an &quot;ordinal&quot; number, when used as a noun, a &quot;cardinal&quot; number.  Thus 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; is the third ordianal, while 3 is the third cardinal.

==Zero==

The number 0, read &quot;zero&quot;, stands for &quot;none at all&quot;.  In the room where you are reading this, there are zero pink elephants.  Note that the numeral for 0 is slightly narrower than the letter capital O.  Sometime, people draw a slash through their zeroes, so as not to mix them up with O's.  (They can also sometimes draw a slash through capital Z so as not to mix it up with 2.)

==Digits==

In our number system, which originated in India and has now spread everywhere in the world because it is so useful, every whole number, no matter how large, can be written with just ten digits.  The digits are:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

In other countries, people sometimes write the digits differently, but they still use ten digits.  

==Thousand, million, billion, trillion.==

A thousand is ten hundreds.  The number 1572 is &quot;one thousand five hundred seventy-two&quot;.  Notice that numbers between twenty-one and ninety-nine, except for every tenth number (thirty, forty, fifty, and so on) are written with a hyphen.  

Starting with ten thousand, numerals are written with commas, so &quot;ten thousand fifty-six&quot; is written 10,056.  Notice that the 0 in 056 means that there are no hundreds in this numeral.  In this case, the 0 is called a &quot;place holder&quot;.  Every three digits in a large number are set off by a comma, starting from the right.  If a numeral has one comma, it is read &quot;thousand&quot;, if a number has two commas the first comma is read &quot;million&quot;, if three commas, the first is read &quot;billion&quot;, at least in the United States, while in the United States, if a number has four commas, the first is read &quot;trillion&quot;.  Other countries have different number names.  In practice, very large numbers are often read just by reading their digits.  Thus we might read 10,056 as &quot;one zero zero five six&quot;.

A million is a thousand thousands.  It is a very big number, but a billion is much bigger.  The word &quot;billion&quot; is used in two different ways.  In America, &quot;billion&quot; means a thousand million.  In most of the rest of the world, &quot;billion&quot; means a million million.  When communicating large numbers across national borders, it is better to use numerals than words.

In America, a &quot;trillion&quot; means a thousand American billions.  In most of the rest of the world, a &quot;trillion&quot; is not used at all.

There are words for even larger numbers, but they are seldom used, so we won't bother with them.  For large numbers, just read off the digits.  One interesting word for a very large number is the word &quot;google&quot;.  Look it up if you want to know what number it stands for.

It is hard to grasp the size of very large numbers.  Here is one way to put them in perspective.  As I write this, the national debt of the United States is about nine trillion dollars ($9,000,000,000,000), while the population of the United States is about three hundred million (300,000,000).  If the United States spends a million dollars, then each person's share is less than one cent.  If the United States spends a billion dollars, then each person's share is between $3 and $4.  If the United States spends a trillion dollars, then each person's share is more than $3,000.  As you can see, there is quite a difference between a million, a billion, and a trillion.

==The natural numbers==

The whole numbers, starting with 1, 2, 3, ..., are called the &quot;natural numbers&quot;.  The dot dot dot is called an &quot;elipsis&quot; and means &quot;and so on&quot;.  By the way, an elipsis always has three dots, no more, no less.  The natural numbers go on without end.  The word we use for &quot;without end&quot; is &quot;infinity&quot;.  There are infinitely many natural numbers.  We could never write them all.

People do not agree on whether to include 0 in the natural numbers.  Older authors often do include 0, thus: 0, 1, 2, ..., while more modern authors generally put zero in a class by itself, and start the natural numbers with 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What addition does==
Addition is an operation which allows us to find out how many we have when we combine two or more sets of objects.  We can only add like objects, and when we use addition to combine two sets of different types of objects, we need to give them a common name.  For example, if we combine three apples with two oranges we have five pieces of fruit (fruit being a common name for apples and oranges).  If we add three inches and two feet, we first change the two feet to 24 inches, and then extend the 24 inches by three inches to get 27 inches.

The numbers representing the parts in an addition problem are called terms.  (There are older words for these parts, but they are seldom if ever used today.)  The answer is called the sum.  Thus, in

*2 + 3 = 5

the terms are 2 and 3 and the sum is 5.

We use addition when we make a deposit to our bank account, when we find how many comic books we now have when we put ten more comic books into our collection, and when we add the price of a coke and a sandwich plus the tax to see if we can afford to buy lunch.

==Learning to add==

We now come to one of the two hard tasks in elementary mathematics, memorizing addition facts.  The other hard task is memorizing multiplication facts. In both cases, there are 100 facts to memorize, though various short cuts can reduce this by half.

Most of mathematics we can figure out, which reduces the need to memorize. We could figure out the addition and multiplication facts, but it would take too long. Once we have them memorized, we can do quick mental arithmetic while driving a car or standing in the check out line in a store.  

In most schools, addition facts are taught while children are still young enough to memorize easily, and so few students fail to remember their addition facts.  On the other hand, multiplication facts are taught after students are too old to memorize easily, and so many students have trouble memorizing their multiplication facts.  If you are a parent, using this book to teach your children, teach them their addition facts when they are five and their multiplication facts when they are six.  (Do not teach both at the same time -- children will get them confused.)  Always use exactly the same words in teaching rote addition and multiplication.  &quot;Two plus three is five.&quot;  &quot;Two threes are six.&quot;

==Adding one==

In Chapter One, you learned to count to 100.  To add one, just count up.  3 + 1 = 4.  10 + 1 = 11.

Since 3 + 1 is the same as 1 + 3, you now know 19 out of the 100 addition facts.  By the way, the rule that 1 + 3 = 3 + 1 is an example of the commutation law.  Picture the 1 commuting to where the 3 lives, and the 3 commuting to where the 1 lives.

==Adding two==

When you first begin to add, it is tempting to add two by counting up twice.  This works, but is too slow.  Instead of thinking: to add 3 + 2 I start with three and count four five, you need to memorize &quot;three plus two is five&quot;.  After you do that, every time you see 3 + 2, the number 5 will instantly pop into your mind.  We therefore need to bite the bullet and begin to memorize.  You memorize these addition facts by saying them over and over and over until you know them by heart.

&quot;two plus two is four, three plus two is five, four plus two is six, five plus two is seven, six plus two is eight, seven plus two is nine, eight plus two is ten&quot;

Read this twenty times a day until you've got it.  Flash cards are another good way to learn addition facts.  Keep practicing, and at some point the addition facts will move from short term memory (where we keep locker combinations) to long term memory (where we keep the names of our parents).  Then you will have them forever, and the effort will be worth while.

Teachers in every grade should make sure that all of the their students know all of their addition and multiplication facts.

You didn't need to relearn one plus two is three.  And the commutative law almost doubles the new facts you have learned, so you have learned 13 new fact which together with the 19 facts about adding one means you have learned 32 of the 100 addition facts.

==Adding a number to itself==

For the sake of variety, let's next learn how to add a number to itself.  You already know that one plus one is two and that two plus two is four.  Here are the rest of those facts.  Memorize them.

&quot;three plus three is six, four plus four is eight, five plus five is ten, six plus six is twelve, seven plus seven is fourteen, eight plus eight is sixteen, nine plus nine is eighteen.&quot;

You now know 39 of the 100 addition facts.

==Adding three==

Contacting professors is something you should handle carefully and fairly. Use conferences and places like that as tools and places to network with Professors. 
 
While contacting them, do not just write emails to dozens of them all over the place and expect random replies. 
 
Make a list of Professors and labs where you know your skills will be applicable. Make sure you keep this broad. And then contact these people. Be respectful of the fact that thousands of students similar to you will be contacting these professors. So, express patience and leave enough time between follow ups.
 
Make sure your emails stay to the point and do not ramble on for ever. I suggest you build a portfolio of skills on a website. And leave clear contact information. Test your emails before you send them out. Try to use text emails instead of html rich ones, since at least some of them will read them using older unix options.
 
Use a lot of common sense and patience.

----
The following would be a desirable approach when you are contacting a professor after admit and seeking funding under him.

Paragraph 1: Say who you are, where you are from and that you are
admitted to the university, a professor of which you are writing
to. Include evidence to that effect: student ID / registration number
/ application number etc.

Paragraph 2: That you don't have funding, I believe you should make it
clear that you are looking for funding. So you could say, &quot;I am
looking for funding and I would be very happy to work for you.&quot; or
something of that nature. Keep this very short. One, or may be two
sentences.

Paragraph 3: Here's where you tell _why_ you want to work with the
professor you are writing too. Talk about their projects that interest
you, talk about a paper or two that they have published (preferably
where they are the first author) which are of interest to you. Keep
this to at most 5 sentences. Remember that to appreciate a professor's
work is much more effective than flattering her.

Paragraph 4: Talk about yourself. Tell them about any of your skills,
certifications etc. and how they can be of use to them. This should
also be brief and cover only those aspects that you think will be of
use to the professor you are writing to. The rest of it is in your
resume anyway.

Paragraph 5: Close your email politely. Tell them that you have
attached your updated resume and any other files (certificates etc.)
and that you eagerly wait for a reply.

The bottomline: be brief. Tell them concisely, what could be of
interest, and be done.

This page contains my notes on [[w:en:Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] grammar. It is intended to describe and give examples of Hawaiian sentence structures for future use in the writing of the '''[[Hawaiian|Hawaiian textbook]]''' here at Wikibooks. I will add new items to this page and update existing items as I learn them in my Hawaiian language classes.

You may also want to see '''[[w:en:Hawaiian grammar]]''', which has limited information that I may not have here. Feel free to ask questions about Hawaiian on the '''[[User:Kalathalan/Hawaiian|talk page]]''' and I will answer them as well as I can.

If you notice any inaccuracies, feel free to correct them. '''I am not fluent, nor am I a linguistic expert in Hawaiian; I am a student who is still learning the language.'''

*[[:w:haw:Ka papa kinohi|ʻO Wikipikia]], the Hawaiian-language Wikipedia
*[http://wehewehe.org Hawaiian dictionary] for looking up unfamiliar words

==General syntax==
*Hawaiian word order is generally '''Verb-Subject-Object'''. Exceptions include certain negative-verb, ''[[#Hiki|hiki]]'', ''[[#Loaʻa|loaʻa]]'', and ''[[#Maopopo|maopopo]]'' sentences.
*Adjectives follow the nouns they describe. For example, ''ka puke nui'' means &quot;the big book&quot;, where ''ka'' is an [[#Articles|article]], ''puke'' means &quot;book&quot;, and ''nui'' means &quot;big&quot;.
*Demonstratives generally precede the nouns they demonstrate. For example, ''kēia mau puke'' means &quot;these books&quot;, where ''kēia'' is the demonstrative meaning &quot;this&quot; and ''mau'' is a particle marking the [[#Plurals|plural]].

==Spelling==
The Hawaiian ''pīʻāpā'', or alphabet, has thirteen letters: five vowels, '''a e i o u''', and eight consonants, '''h k l m n p w ʻ'''. The last consonant is the '''ʻokina''', which appears similar to the apostrophe, and functions as a [[w:Glottal stop|glottal stop]].

The '''kahakō''' is the Hawaiian term for the [[w:Macron|macron]], a short line that appears over the vowels ('''ā ē ī ō ū''') to lengthen the vowel sound and modify stress. Words spelled with kahakō have different meanings from [[w:Homograph|homographs]] without kahakō. For example, the word ''ʻāina'' means &quot;land&quot;, while the word ''ʻaina'', without the kahakō, means &quot;meal&quot;.

The Hawaiian spelling rules are as follows:
*There may not be any [[w:Consonant cluster|consonant clusters]]. In other words, consonants cannot be adjacent.
*All words must end with a vowel.
*The ʻokina must precede a vowel. It may never occur before a consonant, after a consonant, or at the end of a word. It can, however, occur at the beginning of a word.
**'''Legal''': ʻano, ʻeʻe, Hiʻipoi, Waipiʻo
**'''Illegal''': oʻhana, ʻkaleo (occurs before a consonant); amʻaama, kahakiʻʻi (occurs after a consonant); ikiikiʻ (occurs at the end of the word)

===Introduced letters===
'''Introduced letters''', or '''nā huapalapala paipala''', come from the English alphabet. Each English letter has a corresponding Hawaiian pronunciation, listed below:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahapunanaleo.org/eng/learnhawaiian/learn_overviewofhawaiian.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''a''' ʻā
*'''b''' bē
*'''c''' sē
*'''d''' dē
*'''e''' ʻē
*'''f''' fā
*'''g''' gā
*'''h''' hē
*'''i''' ʻī
*'''j''' [[:w:en:Iota|iota]]
*'''k''' kē
*'''l''' lā
*'''m''' mū
*'''n''' nū
*'''o''' ʻō
*'''p''' pī
*'''q''' kopa
*'''r''' rō
*'''s''' sā
*'''t''' tī
*'''u''' ʻū
*'''v''' wī
*'''w''' wē
*'''x''' kesa
*'''y''' ieta
*'''z''' [[:w:en:Zeta|zeta]]

==Articles==
There are three [[w:Definite article|definite articles]] in Hawaiian.

*'''ka''', a singular article, is the most common. Examples: ''ka puke'' &quot;the book&quot;, ''ka haumana'' &quot;the student&quot;, ''ka lolo uila'' &quot;the computer&quot;
*'''ke''' is a singular article used before words that begin with the letters '''k''', '''e''', '''a''', and '''o'''; this is known as the '''KEAO''' rule. Examples: ''ke ānuenue'' &quot;the rainbow&quot;, ''ke kanaka'' &quot;the person&quot;
**''ke'' sometimes precedes nouns that do not begin with KEAO. These irregular nouns include certain words that begin with '''p''' and '''ʻ''' (ʻokina), such as: ''ke pākaukau'' &quot;the table&quot;
*'''nā''' is the plural noun article and precedes ''all'' plural nouns. Examples: ''nā kumu'' &quot;the teachers&quot;, ''nā hale'' &quot;the houses&quot;

==Prepositions==
:''This list is incomplete.''

According to Emily Hawkins, &quot;there is a general rule that if a noun phrase is not the subject of the clause in which it appears, then it must be preceded by one of the prepositions.&quot; The following sections list common prepositions and their usages.

===i, iā, iō===
The preposition '''i''' has many uses. When used in certain contexts, it becomes '''iā''' or, less commonly, '''iō'''.

;'''marking direct object'''
:''i'' and ''iā'' are used to mark the direct object of a sentence. ''i'' marks common nouns, while ''iā'' marks pronouns and proper nouns (including names and places).

:For example, in the sentence ''Ke hele nei au i ke kula'' &quot;I am going to school&quot;, the direct object is the common noun ''ke kula'', which is marked with the preposition ''i''. In the sentence ''Ua ʻike ʻoe iā Kauaʻi'' &quot;You saw Kauaʻi&quot;, the direct object of the verb ''ʻike'' is the proper noun ''Kauaʻi'', which is marked with ''iā''.
;'''marking indirect objects and destinations'''
:''i'' and ''iā'' are also used to mark indirect objects and destinations. ''i'' again marks common nouns, and it also marks destinations. ''iā'' only marks indirect objects.

:For example, in the sentence ''E hoʻi ana au i Molokaʻi'' &quot;I will return to Molokaʻi&quot;, ''Molokaʻi'' is a destination. Therefore it is marked with ''i'' and not ''iā''.
;'''indicating location'''
:''i'' also denotes location.

===mai, maiā===
The preposition '''mai''' means &quot;from&quot;. It takes the form '''maiā''' under certain conditions. Usage guidelines follow:

;'''common nouns, locations'''
:For common nouns and locations, such as ''ke kula'' and ''Palani'' &quot;France&quot;, the form '''mai''' is used.

:Examples: ''Ua hoʻi lākou mai Palani'' &quot;They returned from France&quot;, ''Ke lawe nei ke keiki kāne i nā pākaukau mai ka lumi'' &quot;The boy is taking the tables from the room&quot;
;'''pronouns, other proper nouns'''
:For pronouns and proper nouns other than locations (such as names), the form '''maiā''' is used.

:Examples: ''Ua [[#Loaʻa|loaʻa]] iaʻu ka peni maiā Kaʻōnohi mai'' &quot;I got the pen from Kaʻōnohi&quot;

==Plurals==
Hawaiian '''plurals''' are usually formed by one of two methods:

*'''nā'''. This is the plural [[#Articles|article]].
*'''mau'''. This is a particle that marks the plural principally with determiners, [[#K-possessives|k-possessives]], and ''[[#He|he]]'' sentences. Some usage examples with the aforementioned use cases:
**determiners: ''kēia mau pōpoki'' &quot;these cats&quot;
**k-possessives: ''kaʻu mau pōpoki'' &quot;my cats&quot;
**''he'' sentences: ''He mau pōpoki kēia'' &quot;I have cats&quot;

==ʻO==
'''ʻO''' identifies the subject of a sentence that is not a verb sentence or a ''[[#He|he]]'' sentence. My teachers have explained ʻo sentences as loosely translating to sentences containing a form of the phrase &quot;is the&quot;; its usage is indeed quite broad.

*ʻO Kalani koʻu inoa.
**Kalani is my name. (''koʻu'' &quot;my&quot;, ''inoa'' &quot;name&quot;)
*ʻO ka lā ʻumi o Mei koʻu lā hānau.
**My birthday is May 10. Literally, &quot;the day 10 of May is my birth&quot;. (''lā'' &quot;day&quot;, ''o'' &quot;of&quot;, ''Mei'' &quot;May&quot;, ''hānau'' &quot;birth&quot;)
*ʻO Honolulu ke kapikala o Hawaiʻi.
**Honolulu is the capital of Hawaiʻi. (''kapikala'' &quot;capital&quot;, an example of [[#Hawaiianization|Hawaiianization]])
*ʻO ka mahina ʻo Pepeluali kēia. (''or'') ʻO kēia ka mahina ʻo Pepeluali.
**This is the month of February. (The determiner ''kēia'' may be in either position.)
*ʻO ka pōpoki ka holoholona punahele o Nanea.
**Nanea's favorite animal is the cat. (''Lit''. The cat is the favorite animal of Nanea.)

==He==
'''He''' sentences describe indefinite objects, roughly corresponding to &quot;a/an&quot; in English.

===Basic===
*He kāne au.
**I am a man. (''kāne'' &quot;man&quot;, ''au'' first-person [[#Pronoun|pronoun]] &quot;I&quot;)
*He pua ʻoe.
**You are a child. (''pua'' is poetic way of saying &quot;child&quot;; it more commonly means &quot;flower&quot;)
*He keiki maikaʻi ʻo ia.
**He/she is a good child.
*He mau haumāna kākou.
**We (3+ inclusive) are students.
*He kanaka ʻo Maile.
**Maile is a person.
*He kaʻa kēia.
**This is a car.
*He mau kumu kēlā.
**Those (far) are teachers.

The syntax is '''he (noun) (subject/determiner)'''. Notice that no article markers are used, as the three article markers described above are definite articles. Here, all nouns are indefinite, so the plural article marker ''nā'' cannot be used to pluralize nouns. As seen in the last example, the pluralizer ''mau'' precedes the noun instead.

===Possessives===
:''See [[#He possessives]].''

==Verb sentences==
'''Verb sentences''' are called ''pepeke painu'' in Hawaiian. There are four basic tenses/aspects in Hawaiian, which roughly correspond with the English tenses ''present simple'', ''present progressive'', ''past'', and ''future''.

===Simple/habitual===
The Hawaiian '''simple/habitual''' tense corresponds with the English ''present simple'' tense and describes habits, routines, or general truths. This is the most basic verb sentence, and the simplest of these sentences consist of only a verb and a subject.

Remember that word order is '''Verb-Subject-Object''', so the verb will always precede the subject.

*Lele au.
**I jump.
*Heʻenalu māua.
**We (2 exclusive) surf.
*Kōkua ʻo Keʻanoʻi i nā keiki.
**Keʻanoʻi helps the children.
*Heluhelu ke kumu.
**The teacher reads.

To negate basic sentences, add ʻaʻole and, if there is a ''papani'' (pronoun), move it so that it follows ʻaʻole. All other subjects do not move. These include common nouns and proper nouns (such as &quot;the dog&quot;, &quot;the children&quot;, &quot;Keala&quot;, &quot;China&quot;).

*ʻAʻole au lele.
**I don't jump. (The subject, ''au'', is a pronoun, so it moves to follow ''ʻaʻole''.)
*ʻAʻole māua heʻenalu.
**We don't surf.
*ʻAʻole kōkua ʻo Keʻanoʻi i nā keiki.
**Keʻanoʻi doesn't help the children. (The subject, ''Keʻanoʻi'', is not a pronoun, so it does not move.)
*ʻAʻole heluhelu ke kumu.
**The teacher doesn't read.

===Present (ke nei)===
The Hawaiian '''present tense''', or ''ka wā ʻānō'', corresponds with the English ''present progressive'' tense and describes events happening now.

*Ke kōkua nei ʻo ia i ka hale kūʻai.
**He/she is helping at the store.
*Ke hoʻopaʻa haʻawina nei ʻolua.
**You (2) are studying.

To negate present-tense sentences, add ʻaʻole, move the papani (if applicable), and change the ''ke'' to ''e''. Again, do not move common or proper nouns, just the pronouns.

*ʻAʻole ʻo ia e kōkua nei i ka hale kūʻai.
**He/she is not helping at the store.
*ʻAʻole ʻolua e hoʻopaʻa haʻawina nei.
**You (2) are not studying.

Here is a step-by-step process using the sentence ''Ke kōkua nei ʻo ia i ka hale kūʻai'':

# Prepend ''ʻaʻole'' to the sentence.
#: '''''ʻAʻole'' ke kōkua nei ʻo ia i ka hale kūʻai'''
# If the subject is a pronoun, move it so that it follows ''ʻaʻole''.
#: move the pronoun... '''ʻAʻole ''ʻo ia'' ke kōkua nei i ka hale kūʻai'''
#: but not the common or proper noun... '''ʻAʻole ke kōkua nei ''ke keiki'' i ka hale kūʻai'''
# Change the ''ke'' in ''ke...nei'' to ''e''.
#: '''ʻAʻole ʻo ia ''e'' kōkua nei i ka hale kūʻai'''

===Past (ua)===
The Hawaiian '''past tense''', or ''ka wā i hala'', describes actions that happened in the past.

*Ua holo ʻoe i ke kula.
**You ran to school.
*Ua hele au ma ke kahakai.
**I went to the beach.

To negate past-tense sentences, add ''ʻAʻole'', move the papani (if applicable), and change the ''ua'' to ''i''.

*ʻAʻole ʻoe i holo i ke kula.
**You didn't run to school.
*ʻAʻole au i hele ma ke kahakai.
**I didn't go to the beach.

===Future (e ana)===
The Hawaiian '''future tense''', or ''ka wā e hiki mai ana'', describes events that have not yet occurred, but are expected to occur.

*E make ana au.
**I will die.
*E mahalo ana kākou i ka pelekikena.
**We (3+ inclusive) will thank the president.

To negate future-tense sentences, add ''ʻAʻole'' and move the papani (if applicable). Do not change the ''e...ana''.

*ʻAʻole au e make ana.
**I will not die.
*ʻAʻole kākou e mahalo ana i ke pelekikena.
**We will not thank the president.

===Imperative (e)===
An '''[[w:Imperative mood|imperative]]''' indicates a direct command or request. Generally, Hawaiian imperatives that are directed at a specific person or group of people is perceived as negative (such as &quot;(You) Go to school!&quot; or &quot;Pick up that trash!&quot;), while imperatives that include the speaker are perceived as positive (such as &quot;Let us pray&quot; or &quot;Let's work&quot;).

In Hawaiian, the particle '''e''' is used to indicate an imperative.

*E hele ʻoe i ke kula!
**Go to school!
*E pule kākou.
**Let us pray.

===Negative imperative (mai)===
The negative imperative is equivalent to a &quot;Don't!&quot; command, such as &quot;Don't drink that soda!&quot;, and is marked by the particle '''mai'''. Do not confuse this particle with the preposition ''mai'', which means &quot;from&quot;.

*Mai hele ʻoe i ke kula!
**Don't you go to school!
*Mai lele ma ka moe.
**Don't jump on the bed.

===Makemake===
'''Makemake''' sentences may be taught as a &quot;special&quot; class of verb sentences in elementary Hawaiian courses, but they are not grammatically different from regular verb sentences. In these sentences, '''makemake''' is the verb. It means &quot;to like/want&quot;.

*Makemake au i ke kolowaka Pepsi.
**I like/want the Pepsi soda.

Infinitives (verbs) are preceded with the infinitive particle '''e'''. Do not confuse this particle with the imperative particle ''e''.

*Makemake au ''e hiamoe''.
**I like/want ''to sleep''.
*Makemake ʻoe e hele i ke kula.
**I like/want to go to school. (is this subject correct? --[[Special:Contributions/131.247.152.4|131.247.152.4]] ([[User talk:131.247.152.4|discuss]]) 22:42, 18 September 2011 (UTC))

Negating a makemake sentence is the same as negating a regular verb sentence.

*ʻAʻole au makemake e hiamoe.
**I don't like/want to sleep.

===Pono===
'''Pono''' sentences, like ''makemake'' sentences, are verb sentences that follow regular verb sentence syntax, but may be taught as a special &quot;class&quot; of verb sentence in Hawaiian courses. When used with a verb, ''pono'' means &quot;should/must/has to&quot;. When used with a noun, it means &quot;needs&quot;.

As with ''makemake'' sentences, infinitives are preceded by the particle '''e'''.

*Pono au e holo i ke kula.
**I should go to school.
*Pono lākou i nā puke lina kolu.
**They (3+) need the binders.

Negating pono sentences is done the same way as a regular verb sentence.

===Lilo===
'''Lilo''' sentences also act as normal verb sentences, with one exception: '''there is no kaʻi (object marker) before the object''' of a lilo sentence. (Possessive object markers such as ''kou'', ''kā lāua'', etc., and determiners such as ''kēia'' are not removed.)

''Lilo'' sentences translate to &quot;become&quot;, as in &quot;he became a firefighter&quot;. With lilo sentences, the subject can only &quot;become&quot; a noun. That is, you cannot say &quot;I became tired&quot;; however, you ''can'' use the alternative &quot;I became a tired person&quot;.

*Lilo au i kumu.
**I became a teacher.

Notice that there is no ''kaʻi'', or object marker, preceding ''kumu''. This is the only difference between ''lilo'' sentences and regular verb sentences.

If a plural object is used, introduce the plural marker ''mau''.

*Lilo māua i '''mau''' kanaka kīnai ahi.
**We became firefighter'''s'''.

Without the ''mau'', the sentence would translate as &quot;We became a firefighter&quot;, which makes no sense.

Lilo sentences may be modified for tense in the normal manner; however, it is important to remember that there is never a kaʻi before the object.

==Locational (aia)==
'''Aia''' sentences, or ''pepeke henua'', describe an object's location. The syntax is '''Aia (subject) (location)'''.

*Aia ka popoki ma ka noho.
**The cat is on the chair.
*Aia ʻoe ma ka lumi kuke.
**You are in the kitchen.
*Aia ʻo Kanani ma luna o ka moe.
**Kanani is on top of the bed.

==Addressing (vocative)==
The '''[[w:Vocative|vocative]]''', or addressing a noun, is done by preceding the noun with the vocative particle '''e''' or '''ē'''.

*E Kauʻi!
**Hey, Kauʻi!
*E Kekoa, e kōkua mai iaʻu, ke ʻoluʻolu.
**Kekoa, help me, please. (The first ''e'' is a vocative particle, while the second ''e'' is an imperative particle).
***''Note'': This example makes use of two distinct meanings of the particle ''e'' - the vocative (''E Kekoa'') and the imperative (''e kōkua mai'').

==Hiki==
'''Hiki''' sentences mean &quot;can&quot; or &quot;able to&quot;. The most common ''hiki'' sentence you will hear in any Hawaiian class is '''Hiki iaʻu ke hele i ka lumi hoʻopau pilikia, ke ʻoluʻolu?''', which asks &quot;Can I go to the bathroom, please?&quot;

Let's break that sentence down:
*''hiki'': &quot;can&quot;
*''iaʻu'': &quot;I&quot;; indicates the subject, but is said/written as an object
*''ke hele'': &quot;go&quot;; this special use of &quot;ke&quot; always precedes the verb
*''i ka lumi hoʻopau pilikia'': &quot;to the bathroom&quot;
*''ke ʻoluʻolu'': &quot;please&quot;

Hiki sentences have special syntax. The verb is always preceded by '''ke'''. Here, ''ke'' is not an article (as in ''ke ānuenue'' &quot;the rainbow&quot;), but instead marks the verb in a hiki sentence.

In regards to the subject of a ''hiki'' sentence:

*Instead of a regular subject pronoun, an object pronoun is used. All pronouns are preceded with '''iā''', except for the first-person singular pronoun &quot;I&quot;, which is not ''iā au'', but the contraction '''''iaʻu'''''. Therefore, we have ''iā ʻoe'' (you), ''iā ia'' (he/she/it), ''iā māua'' (we 2+ exclusive), etc.
*'''iā''' is also used if the subject is a proper noun (a name). For example, ''Hiki iā Kaleo...''.
*If the subject is a common noun with an article, '''i''' is used instead. For example, if the subject is &quot;the child&quot;, the sentence would begin ''Hiki i ke keiki'', not ''Hiki iā ke keiki'' or ''Hiki ke keiki''.

Some examples:

*Hiki iaʻu ke inu wai, ke ʻoluʻolu?
**Can I drink water, please?
*Hiki iā lākou ke kalaiwa i ke kula.
**They (3+) can drive to school.
*Hiki iā Kamele ke lele.
**Kamele can jump.
*Hiki i nā haumāna maikaʻi ke hoʻopaʻa haʻawina me ka maikaʻi.
**The good students can study well.

Negating a hiki sentence is a simple matter of adding ''ʻaʻole'' to the beginning of the sentence.

==Loaʻa==
'''Loaʻa''' sentences translate as &quot;to take, to get, to have&quot;. The syntax is similar to that of [[#Hiki|hiki]] sentences in that the entity that possesses or acquires the object is marked as an object. In loaʻa sentences, the object that is possessed or acquired is not marked with an object marker (i.e., ''i'', ''iā'').

Loaʻa can sometimes be used as an alternative for [[#He possessives|''he'' possessives]].

*Loaʻa iaʻu ka ʻīlio nui.
**I got the big dog. or I have a big dog.
*Loaʻa iā Kalei he mau penikala.
**Kalei got pencils. or Kalei has pencils.
*Loaʻa i ke kumu he mau haumāna.
**The teacher has students. or The teacher got students.

==Maopopo==
'''Maopopo''' sentences translate as &quot;to understand&quot;. The syntax is similar to those of [[#Hiki|hiki]] and [[#Loaʻa|loaʻa]] sentences in that the entity that understands the grammatical object (the &quot;thing being understood&quot;) is marked as an object. In maopopo sentences, the thing that is understood is not marked with an object marker (i.e., ''i'', ''iā'').

*Maopopo iaʻu ka haʻawina.
**I understand the homework.

==Possessives==
===K possessives===
===='s possessives====
These are '''apostrophe-s possessives''', which correspond to the English genitive case. An example of an apostrophe-s possessive in English is &quot;Alice's coat&quot;. In Hawaiian, this type of possessive denoted as '''ko/kā [possessor] [possessed object]'''.

Simple possessives are easy to understand:

*kā Kekoa pepa
**Kekoa's paper
*ko Malia kupunahine
**Malia's grandma
*kā lāua mau ʻīlio
**their dogs

Hawaiian students often have more difficulty grasping double/complex possessives. The general idea is to build the second possessive on the first. For example, take the complex possessive &quot;'''Leilani's aunty's pencil'''&quot;. The first possessive is &quot;Leilani's aunty&quot;, and the second is &quot;aunty's pencil&quot;. To comprehend this concept, it's easier to treat the two possessives separately at first.

#The first possessive, &quot;Leilani's aunty&quot;, is translated as '''ko Leilani ʻanakē'''.
#The second possessive, &quot;aunty's pencil&quot;, is translated as '''kā ke ʻanakē penikala'''.

To form the double possessive, place the first possessive &quot;inside&quot; the second. Combining the two example possessives above, the final result is '''kā ko Leilani ʻanakē penikala'''. The possession may be clearer if the first possessive is surrounded with parentheses: '''kā (ko Leilani ʻanakē) penikala'''. Notice that ''ko Leilani ʻanakē'' is the possessor.

You can identify the first possessive: '''ko Leilani ʻanakē'''. The second possessive &quot;wraps&quot; around the first. Imagine if the word &quot;Leilani's&quot; were not in the original possessive; this would leave &quot;aunty's pencil&quot; as the possessive. This would remove &quot;ko Leilani&quot; from the Hawaiian possessive, leaving us with ''kā ʻanakē penikala''. While the article for ''ʻanakē'' is missing, we clearly see that it means &quot;the aunty's pencil&quot;.

So, re-inserting &quot;Leilani&quot; results in '''kā ko Leilani ʻanakē penikala'''. For further clarification, we can identify with colors: '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;kā&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;ko Leilani ʻanakē&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;penikala&lt;/span&gt;'''.

The red identifies the pencil as the possessed object. The blue identifies &quot;Leilani's aunty&quot; as the possessor.

====He possessives====
'''He''' possessives translate to &quot;[something] has a [something else]&quot;, as in &quot;I have a brother&quot;, &quot;he has a flower&quot;, or &quot;John has pencils&quot;.

*He ʻīlio kaʻu.
**I have a dog. (ʻīlio = dog, kaʻu = a-class &quot;I have&quot;)
*He mau ʻeke kona.
**He/she has bags. (ʻeke = bag, kona = o-class &quot;he/she/it has&quot;)
*He mau kaʻa ko lāua.
**They (2) have cars. (kaʻa = car, ko lāua = o-class &quot;they [2] have&quot;)
*He kumu lāʻau ko Nanea.
**Nanea has a tree.

Therefore the syntax is '''he (noun) (possessor)'''.

===K-less possessives===
Three types of possessive sentences use, as my Hawaiian teachers call them, '''k-less possessives'''. They differ from other possessive sentences in that the ''k'' at the beginning of the possessive pronoun is dropped. For example, the possessive ''kaʻu'' becomes ''aʻu''.

The following is a table of possessives and their k-less counterparts:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Possessive (O-class) !! K-less counterpart (O-class) !! Translation !! Possessive (A-class) !! K-less counterpart (A-class)
|-
| koʻu || oʻu || I have || kaʻu || aʻu
|-
| kou || ou || You have || kāu || āu
|-
| kona || ona || He/she/it has || kāna || āna
|-
| ko kāua || o kāua || We (2 incl.) have || kā kāua || a kāua
|-
| ko ʻoukou || o ʻoukou || You (3+) have || kā ʻoukou || a ʻoukou
|}
For all other plural possessive pronouns, simply replace the pronoun in the last two rows (in this case, kāua or ʻoukou) with the appropriate pronoun (such as mākou, lāua, ʻolua).

====ʻAʻohe====
'''ʻAʻohe''' sentences generally translate to &quot;don't have&quot;, or, to be more precise, a negative possessive.

For example, the sentence &quot;I don't have a dog&quot; would be &quot;'''ʻAʻohe aʻu ʻīlio'''&quot; in Hawaiian. Compare to &quot;'''He ʻīlio kaʻu'''&quot;, which means &quot;I have a dog&quot;. The syntax is as follows:

*'''ʻAʻohe''' begins the sentence
*the '''k-less possessive''' follows
*the '''noun''' ends the sentence, preceded by ''mau'' (pluralizer) if necessary

*ʻAʻohe ou kaʻa
**You don't have a car

If the subject is not a pronoun, use '''o [subject]''' or '''a [subject]'''. For example, &quot;The children don't have dogs&quot; would translate as ''ʻAʻohe ʻīlio a nā keiki''.

All pronoun subjects should precede the object. All common or proper noun subjects should follow the object.

====ʻEhia====
'''ʻEhia''' sentences ask &quot;how many&quot;. The same syntax is followed; simply replace ʻaʻohe with ʻehia.

*ʻEhia āu peni?
**How many pens do you have?
*ʻEhia a Kaleo ʻīlio?
**How many dogs does Kaleo have?

The pluralizer, ''mau'', is not necessary as the question, &quot;how many&quot;, implies a plurality. As with ʻaʻohe, all pronoun subjects should precede the object. All common or proper noun subjects should follow the object.

====Helu====
'''Helu''' sentences ''tell'' &quot;how many&quot;. The same syntax is followed; simply replace ʻaʻohe or ʻehia with a number.

*500 āna kālā.
**He/she/it has 500 dollars.

In the context of an [[:w:|encyclopedia]], one can specify numbers such as populations using ''helu'' sentences. For example:

*5,523 poʻe a Lāʻie.
**Lāʻie has 5,523 people.

Smaller numbers should generally be written out, as they would be in standard written English.

*ʻUmikūmālima oʻu makahiki. (''instead of'') 15 oʻu makahiki.
**I'm 15 years old. (''lit''. I have 15 years)
*ʻEwalu a lākou maiʻa.
**They (3+) have eight bananas.

Again, the pluralizer ''mau'' is not necessary as the number implies a plurality (if plurality exists). Consider the following sentences, which illustrate the non-necessity of ''mau'':

*Hoʻokahi ou kaʻa.
**You have one car.
*ʻElua ou kaʻa.
**You have two cars.

Again, as with ʻaʻohe and ʻehia, all pronoun subjects should precede the object. All common or proper noun subjects should follow the object.

==ʻAna==
===Gerund===
The Hawaiian equivalent of an English '''[[w:Gerund|gerund]]''' is formed using ''ʻana''. Prepending a ''kaʻi'' (an article, determiner, or possessive pronoun) and appending '''ʻana''' to a verb converts the verb into its action noun form.

For example, the English verb ''read'' is ''the reading'' in gerund form. Note that the gerund form is not the same as the present participle, as in &quot;I am reading&quot;, which indicates that the action is being performed. Instead, the gerund is a noun; it describes the reading of another noun, as in &quot;his reading is excellent&quot;.

Notice that, in the previous example, the action ''reading'' is not said to have been performed. The sentence does not say that &quot;he&quot; has read in the past, that he is reading now, or that he will be reading. It merely states that his reading ability is of good quality. ''Reading'', the gerund, is used as a noun.

To form a gerund in Hawaiian, start with a verb. We'll use ''heluhelu'', which appropriately means &quot;to read&quot;.
:'''heluhelu'''
Next, add ʻana after the verb:
:heluhelu '''ʻana'''
Finally, add a ''kaʻi'' (noun marker):
:ka heluhelu ʻana

The end result, ''ka heluhelu ʻana'', means &quot;the reading&quot;. We could replace ''ka'' with any kaʻi and create a different gerund. For example, ''kou heluhelu ʻana'' means &quot;your reading&quot;, ''ko lākou heluhelu ʻana'' means &quot;their reading&quot;, and ''ko Kaʻiulani heluhelu ʻana'' means &quot;Kaʻiulani's reading&quot;.

Describing a gerund is simple; just treat the entire gerund as single noun.

*Wikiwiki koʻu hele wāwae ʻana.
**My walking is fast. (''Lit.'' Fast my walking.)

Adjectives describing the verb itself should be placed within the gerund. For example, &quot;his fast walking&quot; would be ''kona hele wāwae wikiwiki ʻana''. (confirm?)

Directionals (such as ''mai'' and ''aku'') should follow the gerund. For example, instead of ''kona hele wāwae mai ʻana'', you should use ''kona hele wāwae ʻana mai''.

===Using the gerund===
The gerund can be used for many purposes, especially for forming more complex sentences. For example, consider the sentence '''Yesterday, Kalei played on the computer after she finished her homework.''' We can translate this sentence using the gerund.

In order to successfully translate this sentence, we'll need to modify the English sentence so that the literal translation from Hawaiian uses a gerund: '''Yesterday, Kalei played on the computer after [her finishing] of her homework.''' It sounds awkward, but you can tell what the sentence is saying. Making this conversion allows you to clearly see how each part of the sentence will translate.

The translated sentence runs thus: '''I nehinei, ua pāʻani ʻo Kalei ma ka lolo uila ma hope o kona hoʻopau ʻana i kāna haʻawina pili home.'''

*I nehinei - yesterday
*ua pāʻani ʻo Kalei - Kalei played
*ma ka lolo uila - on the computer
*ma hope o - after
*kona hoʻopau ʻana - her finishing
*i kāna haʻawina pili home - her homework (object of ''kona hoʻopau ʻana'')

The following are certain prepositional phrases that can precede gerunds:

*ma mua o ka ''painu'' ʻana: before the ''verb''-ing
*ma hope o ka ''painu'' ʻana: after the ''verb''-ing
*i ka ''painu'' ʻana: when the ''verb''-ing or during the ''verb''-ing
*no ka ''painu'' ʻana: in order to ''verb'' or for the ''verb''-ing
*ma muli o ka ''painu'' ʻana: because of the ''verb''-ing

==Agent emphatic (kālele ʻākena)==
'''Kālele ʻākena''' is the Hawaiian term for &quot;agent emphatic&quot; or &quot;actor emphatic&quot;, a grammatical feature that emphasizes a sentence's [[w:Agent (grammar)|agent]], or participant that carries out an action.

The purpose of kālele ʻākena is to emphasize the entity performing the action in a sentence. This is done by moving the entity to the head of the sentence and altering the entity with a form of ''na''. Let's start with an example:

*Naʻu i hele i ke kahakai.
**I went to the beach.

Notice that the performer of the action (''au'', or I) has moved to the front of the sentence and has become ''naʻu''. '''By moving to the front of the sentence, the role of ''au'' in the Hawaiian sentence is emphasized.'''

*Nāu e holo ana ma ke kula.
**''You'' will run at school. (Or, for more emphasis, &quot;It is she who will run at school.&quot;)
*Nāna e makemake nei i ka haukapila.
**'''She''' is liking the hospital. (&quot;It is she who is liking the hospital.&quot;)
*Na ke kumu i aʻo aku.
**The teacher taught. (&quot;It was the teacher who taught.&quot;)
*Na Kaleo e kahakiʻi ana ma ka pepa.
**Kaleo will draw on the paper. (&quot;It is Kaleo who will draw on the paper.&quot;)

==Passive voice==
The [[w:en:Passive voice|passive voice]] is marked by the particle '''ʻia''', which immediately follows the verb. For example, consider the active-voice sentence ''The boy threw the ball'', where ''The boy'' is the agent or actor of the verb (it performs the action). To convert this into a passive-voice sentence in English, one would write ''The ball was thrown by the boy'', which turns ''the boy'' into the patient or target of the verb; in other words, it &quot;receives&quot; the action.

To convert a Hawaiian sentence from active to passive voice, simply add '''ʻia''' immediately after the verb and move the subject and object appropriately so that the object becomes the subject and vice versa. For example:

'''Ua kiloi ke keiki kāne i ke kinipōpō.''' (The boy threw the ball.)&lt;br&gt;
'''Ua kiloi ʻia ke kinipōpō e ke keiki kāne.''' (The ball was thrown by the boy.)

Conversion from active to passive and vice versa is simple. One problem arises, however, when a passive sentence contains no patient. When one attempts to convert such a sentence to active voice, there is no subject. For example:

'''E ʻai ʻia ana ka haukalima i ka ʻumeke.''' (The ice cream will be eaten in the bowl.)&lt;br&gt;
'''E ʻai ana (?) i ka haukalima i ka ʻumeke.''' (??? will eat the ice cream in the bowl.)

As you can see, because the patient is missing from the passive sentence, the converted active sentence has no subject. In this case, the subject should simply be omitted:

'''E ʻai ana i ka haukalima i ka ʻumeke.'''

This sentence has no direct English translation because there is no subject. Notice that ''haukalima'' is the object, not the subject.

==Wahi a... (according to)==
The simple construct '''wahi a''' means &quot;according to&quot;. Its usage is straightforward:

*Wahi a Kekoa, e hele mākou i kahakai.
**According to Kekoa, we will go to the beach.
*Wahi āna, ua hae ka ʻīlio i ka pōpoki.
**According to him/her, the dog barked at the cat.
*Wahi a ke kumu, e oli ana nā haumāna ma mua o ka hoʻokumu ʻana o ka papa.
**According to the teacher, the students will chant before class begins.

==Foreign borrowings==
Many words in Hawaiian have been borrowed from other languages. The primary source of new Hawaiian words is English, although loanwords from other languages, including [[w:en:Greek language|Greek]], [[w:en:Latin|Latin]], and [[w:en:Hebrew language|Hebrew]], are not uncommon.

===Hawaiianization===
Many foreign words are &quot;Hawaiianized&quot;, or phonetically altered to conform to Hawaiian spelling rules, from other languages.

;Transliterations (incomplete list)
*''t'', ''s'', ''g'', ''c'' usually become ''k''
*''r'' usually becomes ''l''
*''v'' usually becomes ''w''
*''b'', ''f'' usually become ''p''

If the English word ends in a consonant, a vowel must be added to the end of the word so that the word conforms to Hawaiian [[#Spelling|spelling rules]]. Also, all consonant clusters must be split, simplified, or removed, because Hawaiian has no consonant clusters.

====Examples====
Although I do not know the exact process behind all Hawaiianizations, I can make reasonable guesses as to the processes behind some straightforward Hawaiianizations. Here are some of these guesses, presented step-by-step:

*'''kapikala''' means &quot;capital&quot; (of a state or country)
**''capital'' -&gt; ''capitala'' (A vowel is added so that the Hawaiian word conforms to [[#Spelling|spelling rules]].)
**''capitala'' -&gt; ''kapitala'' (''c'' -&gt; ''k'')
**''kapitala'' -&gt; '''''kapikala''''' (''t'' -&gt; ''k'')
*'''pelekikena''' means &quot;president&quot;
**''president'' -&gt; ''presidenta'' (Add a vowel to the end.)
**''presidenta'' -&gt; ''peresidenta'' (No consonant clusters exist in Hawaiian, so the &quot;pr&quot; cluster must be split or simplified.)
**''peresidenta'' -&gt; ''peresidena'' (The &quot;nt&quot; cluster is not split, but is instead simplified to &quot;n&quot;.)
**''peresidenta'' -&gt; ''pelesidena'' (''r'' -&gt; ''l'')
**''pelesidena'' -&gt; ''pelekidena'' (''s'' -&gt; ''k'')
**''pelekidena'' -&gt; '''''pelekikena''''' (''d'' -&gt; ''k'')
*'''Banagaladesa''' means [[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]
**''Bangladesh'' -&gt; ''Banagladesh'' (Split the &quot;ng&quot; cluster.)
**''Banagladesh'' -&gt; ''Banagaladesh'' (Split the &quot;gl&quot; cluster.)
**''Banagaladesh'' -&gt; '''''Banagaladesa''''' (Hawaiian has no &quot;sh&quot; sound, so it was simplified to &quot;sa&quot;.)

Asking strangers for a favor can be pretty difficult for the less extrovert of us—even in our native language. But with a few Spanish words it's actually not that hard as Liliana and JP show us in this lesson. The keyphrase is '''tomar una foto''' – to take a picture.

It's really useful to know how to start a conversation in order to have one! Liliana and JP talk about all we need: greetings, compliments, and how to respond to them. The keyword is '''guapa''' – beautiful (for feminine nouns).

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
Did you ever wonder how to say a particular word in Spanish? In this lesson, JP and Liliana tell us how to ask: “How do you say ... in Spanish?”—in Spanish that is. And that's also one of the keywords: '''el español''' – the Spanish language. The other keyword is: '''el inglés''' – the English language.

Make sure to eat something before you listen to this lesson. Liliana and JP keep talking about
keywords such as '''hambre''' – hunger, '''tengo hambre''' – I'm hungry, and '''restaurante italiano''' – Italian restaurant until they have to stop recording because they are too hungry!

Energy Crisis: can we make difference?
Soaring world population, adoption of energy intensive lifestyle (in developing countries like China, India etc.), increased no of automobiles, aircrafts and industries has increased the demand for energy. 85% of the world's energy supply in 2008 is supplied by Coal and natural gas alone (planetforlife.com) .Since fuel energy is the main resource used to exploit all other resources, its decline will result bottleneck in the supply of energy resources which ultimately leads to energy crisis. If this trend of unabated energy consumption continues it will get exhausted completely in less than 42 years. It is of utmost importance that the public and especially policymakers understand the global energy crisis. If we do nothing, our children will inherit a disabled country where they would starve for nothing but death. 
 It‘s high time for us to innovate new technologies, think globally and act locally. Opting for the alternative source of energy like wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, hydropower nuclear power etc. is the only solution seen till date.  Nuclear fusion and fission can be other sources which are mind-numbing for countries like Nepal. Effective, economic and efficient measures must be adopted to prolong the availability of fuel energy. Use of florescent lamps in place of bulbs can save 60% energy. Cover the water heater by insulation blanket; it saves 1000 pound CO2 per year. Use of pressure cooker saves 70% energy as well as cuts cooking time considerably. Cover the pots by lid while cooking, by doing this the stem generated inside the container helps cook food faster along with preservation of energy. Do not directly heat the cooking items soon after they are taken out of refrigerator. Extra energy of gas is required by burner to bring it in the room temperature. Gas stove should be turned on only when fire producing objects like matchbox, lighter or electronic sparking device are near and handy (dali, 2008). Unnecessarily big utensils should be avoided as they consume more fuel without any attendant benefit. Use washing machine when it is full; apply proper economic settings if it is half filled. Recycle the wastages of home; it can save 2400 pounds of CO2 per year. Preserve greenery, plants absorbs the CO2 and minimizes the flow of sound. Consume locally available food materials. Fuel is consumed while transporting goods from one place to other. Walk more, ride less as far as possible. Drive safe and economic, use engine break instead of pedal brakes. Turn off the engines if the vehicle has to stop for more than 2 minutes. You can make a difference if you follow above recommendations.
Opting for the alternative source of energy (like wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, hydropower nuclear power etc.) is the best solution. It also leads to lower emission of CO2 (Dali, 2008), a gas responsible for green house effect and global warming. Converting the nature endowed ‘white gold’ flowing in the rivers which has the capacity of producing more than 80000MW electricity is the better choice for Nepal. But merely 4% (around615MW) has been produced till date(Chand2003). Emerging concept of clean development mechanism (C.D.M), and payment for environmental services (PES) has been developed which assist in resolving the problem.</text>

This may be described as a decade of wild decadence and rebellion in which public consciousness first burst out of the colonial mindset  underpinning the economic rebuilding after the great depression.  New found wealth made new forms of subsistence possible and this encouraged the formation experimental communities espousing philosophies aligned with deep ecology, humanism and communalism.  Ironically this was occurring at the same time Australia's traditional markets were collapsing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">how all frequency carriers of signals get carried through a coaxial cable?

:Magic! The answer is frequency division multiplexing (FDM) where each carrier is a different frequency, and all the frequencies are added together into the spectrum. At the receiving end, a series of filters can separate each carrier out from the spectrum, frequency shift it back to DC, and reconstructs it into the transmitted signal. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:27, 19 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wireless is a generic term that refers to the transfer of data between sendeer and receiver via radio (or optical) waves of different frequencies.  Wireless is a group of related technologies that are different from each other in their speed, range, power, and compatibility.  Two of the most popular technologies include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.

Wi-Fi is the most popular form of wirless connection.  It belongs to the 802.11 protocol family.  Wi-Fi is a radio-based wireless internet that is high powered.  It can handle large amounts of data of long distances. 
 
Bluetooth is a low-powered alternative that transmits data slowly over short distances.  It uses a very secure digital radio communication that is not tied to any particular radio frequency.  The name Bluetooth comes from a tenth-century Viking king who unified Norway and Denmark.

I'll have more here later, but for now I'd just like to mention that I'm trying to start a project to provide annotated texts in a wikipedia-like style here on wikibooks. I hope people like the idea!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Enumerable ==

Enumerator appears in Ruby as Enumerable::Enumerator in 1.8.x and (just) Enumerator in 1.9.x.

= Forms of Enumerator =

There are several different ways in which an Enumerator can be used:&lt;br /&gt;
* As a proxy for &amp;ldquo;each&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
* As a source of values from a block&lt;br /&gt;
* As an external iterator

== 1. As a proxy for &amp;ldquo;each&amp;rdquo; ==

This is the first way of using Enumerator, introduced in ruby 1.8. It solves the following problem: Enumerable methods like #map and #select call #each on your object, but what if you want to iterate using some other method such as #each_byte or #each_with_index?

An Enumerator is a simple proxy object which takes a call to #each and redirects it to a different method on the underlying object.

&lt;pre&gt;require 'enumerator'   # needed in ruby &amp;lt;= 1.8.6 only

src = &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;
puts src.enum_for(:each_byte).map { |b| &amp;quot;%02x&amp;quot; % b }.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;
The call to &amp;lsquo;enum_for&amp;rsquo; (or equivalently &amp;lsquo;to_enum&amp;rsquo;) creates the Enumerator proxy. It is a shorthand for the following:

&lt;pre&gt;newsrc = Enumerable::Enumerator.new(src, :each_byte)
puts newsrc.map { |b| &amp;quot;%02x&amp;quot; % b }.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;
In ruby 1.9, &lt;tt&gt;Enumerable::Enumerator&lt;/tt&gt; has changed to just &lt;tt&gt;Enumerator&lt;/tt&gt;

== 2. As a source of values from a block ==

In ruby 1.9, Enumerator.new can instead take a block which is executed when #each is called, and directly yields the values.

&lt;pre&gt;block =  Enumerator.new {|g| g.yield 1; g.yield 2; g.yield 3}

block.each do |item|
  puts item
end&lt;/pre&gt;
&amp;ldquo;g &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1&amp;rdquo; is an alternative syntax for &amp;ldquo;g.yield 1&amp;rdquo;

No fancy language features such as Fiber or Continuation are used, and this form of Enumerator is easily [http://github.com/trans/facets/blob/master/lib/more/facets/enumerator.rb retro-fitted to ruby 1.8]

It is quite similar to creating your own object which yields values:

&lt;pre&gt;block = Object.new
def block.each
  yield 1; yield 2; yield 3
end

block.each do |item|
  puts item
end&lt;/pre&gt;
However it also lays the groundwork for &amp;ldquo;lazy&amp;rdquo; evaluation of enumerables, described later.

== 3. As an external iterator ==

ruby 1.9 also allows you turn an Enumerator around so that it becomes a &amp;ldquo;pull&amp;rdquo; source of values, sometimes known as &amp;ldquo;external iteration&amp;rdquo;. Look carefully at the difference between this and the previous example:

&lt;pre&gt;block =  Enumerator.new {|g| g.yield 1; g.yield 2; g.yield 3}

while item = block.next
  puts item
end&lt;/pre&gt;
The flow of control switches back and forth, and the first time you call #next a Fiber is created which holds the state between calls. Therefore it is less efficient that iterating directly using #each.

When you call #next and there are no more values, a &lt;tt&gt;StopIteration&lt;/tt&gt; exception is thrown. This is silently caught by the while loop. &lt;tt&gt;StopIteration&lt;/tt&gt; is a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;IndexError&lt;/tt&gt; which is a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;StandardError&lt;/tt&gt;.

The nearest equivalent feature in ruby 1.8 is Generator, which was implemented using Continuations.

&lt;pre&gt;require 'generator'
block = Generator.new {|g| g.yield 1; g.yield 2; g.yield 3}

while block.next?
  puts block.next
end&lt;/pre&gt;
= Lazy evaluation =

In an Enumerator with a block, the target being yielded to is passed as an explicit parameter. This makes it possible to set up a chain of method calls so that each value is passed left-to-right along the whole chain, rather than building up intermediate arrays of values at each step.

The basic pattern is an Enumerator with a block which processes input values and yields (zero or more) output values for each one.

&lt;pre&gt;  Enumerator.new do |y|
    source.each do |input|     # filter INPUT
      ...
      y.yield output           # filter OUTPUT
    end
  end&lt;/pre&gt;
So let&amp;rsquo;s wrap this in a convenience method:

&lt;pre&gt;class Enumerator
  def defer(&amp;amp;blk)
    self.class.new do |y|
      each do |*input|
        blk.call(y, *input)
      end
    end
  end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
This new method &amp;lsquo;defer&amp;rsquo; can be used as a &amp;lsquo;lazy&amp;rsquo; form of both select and map. Rather than building an array of values and returning that array at the end, it immediately yields each value. This means you start getting the answers sooner, and it will work with huge or even infinite lists. Example:

&lt;pre&gt;res = (1..1_000_000_000).to_enum.
  defer { |out,inp| out.yield inp if inp % 2 == 0 }.   # like select
  defer { |out,inp| out.yield inp+100 }.               # like map
  take(10)
p res&lt;/pre&gt;
Although we start with a list of a billion items, at the end we only use the first 10 values generated, so we stop iterating once this has been done.

You can get the [http://github.com/trans/facets/blob/master/lib/core/facets/enumerable/defer.rb same capability] in ruby 1.8 using the [http://facets.rubyforge.org/ facets library.] For convenience it also provides a [http://github.com/trans/facets/blob/master/lib/core/facets/denumerable.rb Denumberable] module with lazy versions of familiar Enumerable methods such as map, select and reject.

= Methods which return Enumerators =

From 1.8.7 on, many Enumerable methods will return an Enumerator if not given a block.

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;]
=&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = a.each_with_index
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Enumerable::Enumerator:0xb7d7cadc&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.each { |args| p args }
[&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, 0]
[&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, 1]
[&amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;, 2]
=&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/pre&gt;
This means that usually you don&amp;rsquo;t need to call &lt;tt&gt;enum_for&lt;/tt&gt; explicitly. The very first example on this page reduces to just:

&lt;pre&gt;src = &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;
puts src.each_byte.map { |b| &amp;quot;%02x&amp;quot; % b }.join(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;
This can lead to somewhat odd behaviour for non-map like methods - when you call #each on the object later, you have to provide it with the &amp;ldquo;right sort&amp;rdquo; of block.

&lt;pre&gt;=&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = a.select
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Enumerable::Enumerator:0xb7d6cfb0&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.each { |arg| arg &amp;lt; &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; }
=&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;baz&amp;quot;]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/pre&gt;

=== each_with_index ===
each_with_index calls its block with the item and its index.

 array = ['Superman','Batman','The Hulk']
 
 array.each_with_index do |item,index|
   puts &quot;#{index} -&gt; #{item}&quot;
  end
 
 # will print
 # 0 -&gt; Superman
 # 1 -&gt; Batman
 # 2 -&gt; The Hulk

=== find_all ===
find_all returns only those items for which the called block is not false

 range = 1 .. 10
 
 # find the even numbers
 
 array = range.find_all { |item| item % 2 == 0 }
 
 # returns [2,4,6,8,10]

 array = ['Superman','Batman','Catwoman','Wonder Woman']
 
 array = array.find_all { |item| item =~ /woman/ }
 
 # returns ['Catwoman','Wonder Woman']

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over time, e-mail has been one of the most used components to send messages around the world or to people around oneself.  Also, e-mail has alot of harm that can happen while in the process.  There are different types of components that may occur while sending an innocent message to others.  Email threats can be divided into several distinct categories: Viruses, Worms and Trojan Horses, Phishing, and also Spam.  According to &quot;IT Security,&quot;  Viruses, Worms and Trojan Horses are delivered as email attachments, destructive code can devastate a host system's data, turn computers into remote control slaves known as bootnets and cause recipients to lose serious money. Trojan horse keyloggers, for example, can surreptitiously record system activities, giving unauthorized external parties access to corporate bank accounts, internal business Web sites and other private resources.  Phishing attacks utilize social engineering to steal consumers' personal and financial data.  Spam Although not an overt threat like a virus-infected attachment, junk email can quickly overwhelm an inbox, making it difficult or even impossible for its owner to view legitimate messages. The spam problem has gotten so bad that it is commonplace for users to abandon email accounts that are overrun with spam rather than try to fight the problem. Spam is also the delivery medium of choice for both phishers and virus attackers.  As we can see, emails might be one of the top used networks, but many consequences can come from the technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Online shopping''' is just like going to the store and shopping around and looking for things you want except in form of the internet. Tim Berners-Lee started the World Wide Web in 1990. Shortly there after, online shopping started and has expanded exponentially ever since. It provides such a convenience for consumers to keep from having to leave the house or use gas to get to all the different stores, where online shopping you can get anything you want from as many different stores as you want all at one time. Online shopping mainly takes place from people using search engines and typing in exactly what they want. Then the search engine will bring up the most popular sites for the items you look for. Once you find what you are looking for online, most sites will let you put the item in a shopping cart just like a brick and mortar store, so you can keep searching around for anything else that you may need.

Shopping online makes life so much easier because you can just type in a debit card number, wire money, deliver money, electronic money, etc. and be done with it within seconds or minutes. It makes life easy, but you just have to be careful what sites you order from because of all the scams that go on everyday. It is so easy for hackers today to steal people's identity, so being smart is definitely a key when shopping online. 

It makes it easy for companies to use online catalogs or stores to do business not only because people will use it but because there is so much more of a selection that they can put online and not even have in the actual store due to space constraints.

== Online Auctions ==

Online auctions have become increasing popular with the rise of online shopping.  These auctions allow buyers and sellers to obtain and sell products and services quickly and efficiently.  Auctions allow for individuals and businesses to extend their products and services to a much larger customer base.  

In 1995, the current powerhouse, Ebay, was started from founder Pierre Omidyar's house.  While bidding and searching through auctions is free, sellers are charged certain fees:

- A nonrefundable Insertion Fee is charged which can cost a seller anywhere from 30 cents up to $3.30, depending on the seller's starting bid on the item. 
- If a seller wishes to further promote their listings, the seller can highlight a listing for an additional fee.
- A Final Sale fee is charged at the end of the seller's auction. This fee generally ranges from 1.25% to 5% of the final sale price. 

At the end of the auction, both the seller and the buyer are notified by Ebay.  The seller usually has a minimum price they will accept for the bid item.  If the buyer's bid exceeds the seller's lowest price, the transaction is completed between the two parties or independently of eBay.  The above rules apply to Ebay itself, but all auction-based websites charge fees for providing customers with a specific place for e-commerce. 

Although Ebay is a widely recognized name in the Internet world, there are several other popular auctions sites such as Ubid.com, Bidz.com, Webidz.com.  Popularity and use of auction sites has become more common, however, there are some downsides to these websites.  Once an auction has ended, the binding contract of the auction is between the winning bidder and the seller only.  Meaning the actual website has limited to no liability for a bad transaction.  Auction sites do provide their customers with several options to retrieve money from a dishonest buyer or seller.  If these options fail to achieve results, the buyer or seller is essentially on their own.

There are many benefits from online auctions.  Individuals and businesses sell and purchase products that are sometimes hard-to-find and hard to sell.  Usually, these products come at cheaper prices, and can be found right in the comfort of your own home.

Hi Maroquin,

Can you explain what you mean by &quot;trees are more smooth than shrubs?&quot;  I took that out because I don't believe it to be correct.  For instance, Shagbark Hickory (''Carya ovata'') has very rough bark, as do mature cherries and birches.  If you can make a good case for your statement, I will happily put it back.  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:13, 20 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

==1. Explain how Christ encouraged people in conflict in the following Bible stories. Identify the nature of the conflict or human needs in each story that you explain.==

=== a. John 8:1-11 (Mary Magdalene) ===
{{Bible verse
|book = John
|chapter=8
|verse=1-11
|version = NIV
|text=&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;and said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?&quot; &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.

But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, &quot;If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.

&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus straightened up and asked her, &quot;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&quot;

&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;No one, sir,&quot; she said.
:&quot;Then neither do I condemn you,&quot; Jesus declared. &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot;
}}
The woman in this story was Mary Magdalene, and she was certainly experiencing a crisis.  Not only was she publicly shamed, but her very life was threatened.  The trap laid by the Pharisees here was that Mosaic Law called for the execution of an adultress, but under Roman Law, the decision to execute was reserved for the Roman governors.  If Jesus were to agree that she should be executed, they would have turned Him in to the Roman authorities for usurping their authority.  But if He disagreed with the death sentence, they would have &quot;proven&quot; that he did not respect Mosaic Law.

Jesus saw this trap immediately, but His main concern was not for himself but for Mary Magdalene.  Yes, she had sinned, but so have we all, and His mission was to save sinners.  Jesus extricated Himself from the trap while showing her great tenderness and compassion.  His writing in the dirt was a list of &quot;secret&quot; sins committed by her accusers.  He continued outlining these sins until all the accusers drifted away, eager for their own sins to be kept secret.

Finally, He turned to Mary, counseled her to leave her life of sin and granted her forgiveness.  She followed Him devoutly after this incident, washing His feet with perfume at the home of Simon, and standing at the foot of the cross during the crucifixion.  She was the first person to see Him after the resurrection.

=== b. Matthew 18:1-6 (Disciples – Greatest Kingdom in Heaven) ===
{{Bible verse
|book = Matthew
|chapter = 18
|verse = 1-6
|version = NIV
|text = &lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, &quot;Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&quot;

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;He called a little child and had him stand among them. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;And he said: &quot;I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
}}
The people in crisis in this verse are the disciples, only they did not realize that they were in any danger.  They were looking for Jesus to settle their disagreement over which of ''them'' was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Their arrogance and pride were threatening their very salvation!

Jesus clearly pointed their error out to them in a most non-threatening way.  When we see someone we love on a course to destruction, it is our duty to try to set them straight as well.  However, the ''way'' we do this is just as important as the decision to do it.  Jesus did not jump up and down and scream, nor did He insult His disciples and tell them they were ruining their lives (even if they were).  Rather, He gently pointed out the way they ''should'' have been acting and admonished them to follow the example He set before them.
===c. 1 Kings 3:16-28 (Solomon and the Baby)===
{{Bible verse
|book = 1 Kings
|chapter=3
|verse=16-28
|version=NIV
|text=
Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.  One of them said, &quot;My lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was there with me. The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us.

&quot;During the night this woman's son died because she lay on him. So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast. The next morning, I got up to nurse my son—and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't the son I had borne.&quot;

The other woman said, &quot;No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.&quot;
::But the first one insisted, &quot;No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.&quot; And so they argued before the king.

The king said, &quot;This one says, 'My son is alive and your son is dead,' while that one says, 'No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.' &quot;

Then the king said, &quot;Bring me a sword.&quot; So they brought a sword for the king. He then gave an order: &quot;Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.&quot;

The woman whose son was alive was filled with compassion for her son and said to the king, &quot;Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don't kill him!&quot;
::But the other said, &quot;Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!&quot;

Then the king gave his ruling: &quot;Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.&quot;

When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
}}

== 2. Discuss relationship, identity, racial, and cultural conflicts that teenagers in your community face today. (i.e. Relationship with parents, self esteem, friendships).==
Often in any crisis whether it be a wide area disaster or the loss of a close family member the emotional crisis can be devastating to an individual.  Not all people are emotionally equipped to react and continue to even function when facing what many would call an overwhelming situation.  For these people immediate assistance is needed as they may have frozen themselves in a dangerous location, may become depressed even to the point of suicidal or may react in outrage and violent fashion.

To help to bring these reactions to a close or to a point controllable first the person must be helped to a place physically and mentally where they are not in immediate danger and they must be helped to realize this.  In the case of the loss of a parent this may mean that the teen is helped to realize that they have many friends, and family, a community that will help them to go on and provide for their needs.

The human needs of any individual start with the same basics: shelter, water, and food.  As Christians we recognize the need first for God and our relationship with Him and will remind those we help to keep this need first in all things.  Beyond these basic needs there are possibly physical, medical, and emotional support needs that will be considered.  A person injured in the fire that has destroyed his home needs medical attention before he needs emotional support (although the two may come nearly simultaneously at times).  In professional occupations that deal with high stress matters or regular human suffering the emotional support to follow is most often called Critical Incident Stress Debriefing.  This is a form of counseling that is important not only to professionals like firefighters but also to families and communities in need.

The stress of an incident can be overwhelming and may manifest itself some great time later or be a fixture in a person's actions and outlook to life. Although not all people are affected by such stress it is best to see to the potential needs of a person in crisis to avert the possible self destruction that may come.  In this we consider not only what a person says they are feeling and facing, not only what they have gone through, but in the long term what they are like today vs. the person they were before their crisis.

In immediate intervention you will be a shoulder to lean on, someone to offer support, to be yelled at, to be cried to.  You will offer encouragement and help to arrange for those basic needs of shelter, water, and food.  You will report to your &quot;supervisor&quot; in intervention any issue you observe that may need to be referred to professional counseling.  You will be a friend.

Families face a variety of crisis situations and some things that some may not consider to be a crisis can be devastating.  For this purpose we will list common crisis situations:
*House fire
*Death of a loved one
*Loss of income
*Terminal disease
*Birth Defects
*Multiple Births (quintuplets for example, imagine five kids at one time could be stressful)
*Serious Injury
*Natural Disaster
== 3. Describe the types of human needs and give a real-life example of each.==
[[File:Maslow's hierarchy of needs.png|thumb|center|800px|Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]
{{clear}}
Maslow's hierarchy of needs is often depicted as a pyramid consisting of five levels: the four lower levels are grouped together as being associated with Physiological needs, while the top level is termed growth needs associated with psychological needs. Deficiency needs must be met first. Once these are met, seeking to satisfy growth needs drives personal growth. The higher needs in this hierarchy only come into focus when the lower needs in the pyramid are satisfied. Once an individual has moved upwards to the next level, needs in the lower level will no longer be prioritized. If a lower set of needs is no longer being met, the individual will temporarily re-prioritize those needs by focusing attention on the unfulfilled needs, but will not permanently regress to the lower level. For instance, a businessman at the esteem level who is diagnosed with cancer will spend a great deal of time concentrating on his health (physiological needs), but will continue to value his work performance (esteem needs) and will likely return to work during periods of remission.

== 4. What is active listening? Practice active listening by role playing conflicts noted in #2.==
When interacting, people often are not listening attentively to one another. They may be distracted, thinking about other things, or thinking about what they are going to say next, (the latter case is particularly true in conflict situations or disagreements).

Active listening is a structured way of listening and responding to others. It focuses attention on the speaker. Suspending one’s own frame of reference and suspending judgment are important in order to fully attend to the speaker.

It is important to observe the other person's behavior and body language. Having heard, the listener may then paraphrase the speaker’s words. It is important to note that the listener is not necessarily agreeing with the speaker—simply stating what was said. In emotionally charged communications, the listener may listen for feelings. Thus, rather than merely repeating what the speaker has said, the active listener might describe the underlying emotion (“you seem to feel angry” or “you seem to feel frustrated, is that because…?”).

Individuals in conflict often contradict one another. This has the effect of denying the validity of the other person’s position. Either party may react defensively, and they may lash out or withdraw. On the other hand, if one finds that the other partly understands, an atmosphere of cooperation can be created. This increases the possibility of collaborating and resolving the conflict.

== 5. Apply the following method of conflict resolution to an example in #2.==
===a. Set the scene===
When setting the scene the two parties in conflict come together.  It is important to listen to the other side without interjecting defenses of your own position.  Otherwise this will descend into an argument and nothing will be resolved.  Use active listening techniques, meaning you repeat your understanding of what has just been said to you.  If your understanding is incorrect, the person whose views you have misconstrued will let you know.  Be careful that active listening does not become ''arguing''.

Pay special attention to the interests of the other party.  Find out what their concerns are.  Keep in mind that they may have valid objections to the solution you wish to put forward, and that it is very possible that you yourself could be wrong.

When presenting your side of the story emphasize that you are relating your ''perception'' of the problem.  The goal here is to get the other party to recognize your concerns and interests.

===b. Gather information===
Both sides have presented their perception of the problem and have stated their interests and goals.  Now it is time to explore these viewpoints.

===c. Identify the problem===
In this phase you are trying to clarify exactly what the problem is.  It is very possible that up to this point the two parties have been arguing over two different issues.  Try to come up with a mutually agreed statement of the problem.

===d. Brainstorm solutions===
Once the parties have agreed on a definition of the problem, it is time to start putting out possible solutions.  No solution should be judged at this point, as doing so will inhibit the flow of ideas.  Write every idea down, no matter how crazy it seems.  By not judging the solutions at this point, the floor is open to everyone present.  Be sure that everyone there is engaged and is presenting ideas.  The less assertive will resist this, especially if ideas are being shot down as they are presented.

== 6. Negotiate a solution.==
Use the method outlined in the previous requirement.  Once you have come up with several solutions, evaluate them as objectively as possible.  Think about how people will be affected by each approach.  Eliminate the solutions that will likely make the problem worse.  Then examine the remaining solutions.  Which one will benefit the most people?  Will that one hurt someone else?  Do the benefits outweigh the costs?  Lead the person with whom the decision lies through this analysis and let them choose a course of action.  It is possible that the person may tell you that they will solve the problem the way you suggest just to shut you up, so be aware of that.  Try to get the person to buy into the solution.  If no good solution can be found try brainstorming again.  It is possible that there is ''no'' good solution though, and the person may be faced with nothing but bad choices.  The goal here is to find the ''best'' solution, not necessarily a ''good'' solution.

== 7. Explain how to make a referral to a professional counselor or pastor.==
When your friend is facing a crisis that is too big for you to handle, you need to refer him to someone with professional training.  Doing this is ''not'' abandoning your friend, but rather, recognizing that his problems are beyond your ability to help.  There are four steps in making a referral:

;Prepare your friend: Before you can prepare your friend, you are going to need a lot of information about the services professional offers and have a concrete understanding of how it can help.  Then you need to share that information with your friend.  Assure your friend that seeking professional help is not a sign of weakness.  Rather, it is often the most effective and least painful path to recovery.
;Get your friend's participation:  The decision to see a professional belongs to your friend, not to you.  Do not pressure your friend into making this decision.  It may take some getting used to, and the decision might take a long time to make.  
;Prepare the professional: Once your friend has decided to see the professional, you should call and talk to them.  Do not make the appointment for your friend.  Ideally your friend should to that for himself, but if the situation is especially urgent, you might make the appointment for your friend yourself.  When you speak to the professional, tell them as much as you are comfortable about the situation, and why you think the referral is important.  The more the counselor knows about the problem, the better able he will be to help.  Make sure that the things you have told your friend about the professional hold true, and ask if they think they can really help.

;Follow up: After your friend's first appointment, ask how it went.  You do not need to pry into the details of the session, but you should certainly ask if there is anything you can do to help your friend.  Your continued support can help ensure a positive outcome.

== 8. Discuss your own motives for wanting to help your friends when they face conflict. What about strangers?==
The point of this requirement is for the individual to examine his own reasons for wanting to help someone.  Unfortunately, there are many more bad reasons to want to get involved than there are good reasons.  The only valid reason to get involved is out of ''love''.  Invalid reasons include curiosity, the desire to gossip, the desire to feel better about oneself for helping, or out of a sense of wanting to control the other person's life.  Sometimes people think that their friends cannot get themselves out of their mess without their help.  There are almost certainly more invalid reasons for getting involved than those listed here.  But that doesn't mean you should not get involved.  Just be sure you are doing so for the right reason!

It is often the case, when evaluating definite integrals, that an antiderivative for the integrand cannot be found, or is extremely difficult to find. In some instances, a numerical approximation to the value of the definite value will suffice. The following techniques can be used, and are listed in rough order of ascending complexity.

== Riemann Sum ==
This comes from the definition of an integral. If we pick n to be finite, then we have:

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\ dx\approx \sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i^*)\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; is any point in the i-th sub-interval &lt;math&gt;[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt; on [a,b].
=== Right Rectangle ===
A special case of the Riemann sum, where we let &lt;math&gt;x_i^*=x_i&lt;/math&gt;, in other words the point on the far right-side of each sub-interval on, [a,b]. Again if we pick n to be finite, then we have:

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\ dx\approx \sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
=== Left Rectangle ===
Another special case of the Riemann sum, this time we let &lt;math&gt;x_i^*=x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the point on the far left side of each sub-interval on [a,b]. As always, this is an approximation when n is finite. Thus, we have:

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\ dx\approx \sum_{i=1}^nf(x_{i-1})\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
== Trapezoidal Rule ==
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\ dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2n}\left[f(x_0)+2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(f(x_i))+f(x_n)\right]=\frac{b-a}{2n}(f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) +\cdots+ 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n))&lt;/math&gt;

==Simpson's Rule==
Remember, n must be even,

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \approx \frac{b-a}{6n}\left[f(x_0)+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left((3-(-1)^{i})f(x_i)\right)+f(x_n)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{b-a}{6n}\left[f(x_0)+4f(x_1/2)+2f(x_1)+4f(x_3/2)+\cdots+4f(x_{n-1/2})+f(x_n)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The most basic, and arguably the most difficult, type of evaluation is to use the formal definition of a Riemann integral.

== Exact Integrals as Limits of Sums ==
Using the definition of an integral, we can evaluate the limit as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity.  This technique requires a fairly high degree of familiarity with summation [[Wikipedia:Sigma_notation#Identities|identities]]. This technique is often referred to as evaluation &quot;by definition,&quot; and can be used to find definite integrals, as long as the integrands are fairly simple. We start with definition of the integral:
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^bf(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i^*)&lt;/math&gt;
|Then picking &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;x_i=a+i\frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt; we get,
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(a+i\frac{b-a}{n}).&lt;/math&gt;
|}
In some simple cases, this expression can be reduced to a real number, which can be interpreted as the area under the curve if f(x) is positive on [a,b].
=== Example 1 ===
Find &lt;math&gt;\int_0^2x^2\ dx&lt;/math&gt; by writing the integral as a limit of Riemann sums.
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\int_0^2x^2\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{b-a}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i^*)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(\frac{2i}{n})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{2i}{n}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{4i^2}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{8}{n^3}\sum_{i=1}^ni^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{8}{n^3}\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{4}{3}\frac{2n^2+3n+1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{8}{3}+\frac{4}{n}+\frac{4}{3n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{8}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In other cases, it is even possible to evaluate indefinite integrals using the formal definition. We can define the indefinite integral as follows:
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^x f(t)\ dt=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x-0}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i^{*})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f\left(0+\frac{(x-0)\cdot i}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f\left(\frac{x\cdot i}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Example 2 ===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, then we can evaluate the indefinite integral as follows.
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\int_0^xf(t)\ dt=&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f\left(\frac{x\cdot i}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{x\cdot i}{n}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x^2\cdot i^2}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x^3}{n^3}\sum_{i=1}^n i^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x^3}{n^3}\sum_{i=1}^n i^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x^3}{n^3}\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x^3}{n^3}\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x^3}{n^3}\frac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;x^3\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{2n^3}{6n^3}+\frac{3n^2}{6n^3}+\frac{n}{6n^3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;x^3\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{6n^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;x^3\cdot\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

After learning a simple list of antiderivatives, it is time to move on to more complex integrands, which are not at first readily integrable. In these first steps, we notice certain special case integrands which can be easily integrated in a few steps.

== Recognizing Derivatives and Reversing Derivative Rules==
If we recognize a function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; as being the derivative of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then we can easily express the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\int g(x)\, dx = f(x) + C.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, since

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x&lt;/math&gt;

we can conclude that 

&lt;math&gt;\int \cos x\, dx = \sin x + C.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, since we know &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; is its own derivative,

&lt;math&gt;\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C.&lt;/math&gt;


The power rule for derivatives can be reversed to give us a way to handle integrals of powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Since 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, 

we can conclude that 

&lt;math&gt;\int n x^{n-1} \, dx = x^n + C,&lt;/math&gt;

or, a little more usefully, 

&lt;math&gt;\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Integration by Substitution==
[[Image:Wikiversity-logo-Snorky.svg|right|thumb|80px|[[V:Integration by Substitution|Integration by Substitution]]]]
For many integrals, a substitution can be used to transform the integrand and make possible the finding of an antiderivative.  
There are a variety of such substitutions, each depending on the form of the integrand.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The objective of Integration by substitution is to substitute the integrand from an expression with variable x to an expression with variable &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;u \,=\, g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Theory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We want to transform the Integral from a function of x to a function of u&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{x=a}^{x=b}f(x)\, dx\,\rightarrow\,\int_{u=c}^{u=d}h(u)\, du&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Starting with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u\,=\,g(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Steps&lt;/b&gt;
{|
| &lt;math&gt;\int_{x=a}^{x=b}f(x)\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{x=a}^{x=b}f(x)\,{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!u}\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (1) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!u}\,=\,1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|   || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{x=a}^{x=b}(f(x)\,{\operatorname{d}\!x\over\operatorname{d}\!u})({\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!x})\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (2) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}\!x\over\operatorname{d}\!u}{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!x}\,=\,{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!u}\,=\,1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|   || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{x=a}^{x=b}(f(x)\,{\operatorname{d}\!x\over\operatorname{d}\!u})g'(x)\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt;|| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (3) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!x}\,=\,g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|   || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{x=a}^{x=b}h(g(x))g'(x)\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt;|| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (4) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now equate &lt;math&gt;(f(x)\,{\operatorname{d}\!x\over\operatorname{d}\!u})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|   || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{x=a}^{x=b}h(u)g'(x)\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt;|| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (5) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;g(x)\,=\,u&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|   || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{u=g(a)}^{u=g(b)}h(u)\, du\,&lt;/math&gt;|| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (6) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; du\,=\,{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!x} dx\,=\,g'(x)\, dx\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|   || &lt;math&gt;=\int_{u=c}^{u=d}h(u)\, du\,&lt;/math&gt;|| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || (7) || ie &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We have achieved our desired result 
|}

&lt;b&gt;Procedure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;g'(x)\,=\,{\operatorname{d}\!u\over\operatorname{d}\!x}&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;h(u)&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,{\operatorname{d}\!x\over\operatorname{d}\!u}\,=\,\frac{f(x)}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and '''make sure you express the result in terms of the variable u'''
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;c\,=\,g(a)&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;d\,=\,g(b)&lt;/math&gt;

===Integrating with the derivative present===
If a component of the integrand can be viewed as the derivative of another component of the integrand, a
substitution can be made to simplify the integrand.

For example, in the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int 3x^2 (x^3+1)^5 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

we see that &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;x^3+1&lt;/math&gt;.  Letting

:&lt;math&gt;u=x^3+1&lt;/math&gt;

we have 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{dx} = 3x^2&lt;/math&gt;
or, in order to apply it to the integral,
:&lt;math&gt;du = 3x^2 dx&lt;/math&gt;.

With this we may write
&lt;math&gt;\int 3x^2 (x^3+1)^5 \, dx = \int u^5 \, du = \frac{1}{6} u^6 + C = \frac{1}{6} (x^3+1)^6 + C.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that it was not necessary that we had &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the derivative of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in our integrand.  It would have been sufficient to have any constant multiple of the derivative.

For instance, to treat the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int x^4 \sin(x^5) \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

we may let &lt;math&gt;u=x^5&lt;/math&gt;.  Then 
:&lt;math&gt;du = 5x^4 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5} du = x^4 \, dx &lt;/math&gt;
the right-hand side of which is a factor of our integrand.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^4 \sin(x^5) \, dx = \int \frac{1}{5} \sin u \, du = -\frac{1}{5} \cos u + C  = -\frac{1}{5} \cos x^5 + C.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the integral of a power of a function times that function's derivative may be integrated in this way. Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{d[g(x)]}{dx}=g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

we have &lt;math&gt;dx=\frac{d[g(x)]}{g'(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

{|
|-
|Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\int g'(x)[g(x)]^n dx\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int g'(x)[g(x)]^n \frac{d[g(x)]}{g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int [g(x)]^n d[g(x)]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{[g(x)]^{n+1}}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
|}


There is a similar rule for definite integrals, but we have to change the endpoints.
{{Calculus/Def|text='''Substitution rule for definite integrals''' 
Assume  ''u'' is differentiable with continuous derivative and that ''f'' is continuous on the range of ''u''.  Suppose &lt;math&gt;c=u(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=u(b)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(u(x)) \frac{du}{dx} dx = \int_c^d f(u) du.&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Examples ===

Consider the integral
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{0}^2 x \cos(x^2+1) \,dx
&lt;/math&gt;
By using the substitution ''u'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, we obtain ''du'' = 2''x'' ''dx'' and

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^2 x \cos(x^2+1) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^2 \cos(x^2+1) 2x \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{5}\cos(u)\,du &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}(\sin(5)-\sin(1)).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note how the lower limit ''x'' = 0 was transformed into ''u'' = 0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 1 and the upper limit ''x'' = 2 into ''u'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 5.

=== Proof of the substitution rule ===

We will now prove the substitution rule for definite integrals.  Let ''H'' be an anti derivative of ''h'' so 
:&lt;math&gt; H'(u) = h(u)&lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose we have a differentiable function, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u\,=\,g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and numbers &lt;math&gt;c=g(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=g(b)&lt;/math&gt; derived from some given numbers, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have
:&lt;math&gt; \int_c^d h(u) du = H(d) - H(c).&lt;/math&gt;

Next we define a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by the rule
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = H(g(x)) = H(u)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Naturally
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\,=\,F'(x)\,=\,\frac{dF}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Then by the Chain rule ''F'' is differentiable with derivative
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dF}{dx} = \frac{dH}{du}\frac{du}{dx}= h(u) \frac{du}{dx} = h(g(x)) \frac{du}{dx}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating both sides with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we get
:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b h(g(x)) \frac{du}{dx}dx =\int_a^b \frac{dF}{dx} dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;
But by the definition of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; this equals
:&lt;math&gt; F(b) - F(a) =  H(g(b)) - H(g(a)) = H(d) - H(c) = \int_c^d h(u) du.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx\,=\,\int_a^b h(g(x)) \frac{du}{dx}dx = \int_c^d h(u) du.&lt;/math&gt;
which is the substitution rule for definite integrals.

Continuing on the path of reversing derivative rules in order to make them useful for integration, we reverse the product rule.

==Integration by parts==
{{Wikipedia|Integration by parts}}
If {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y = uv&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are functions of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;y'=\left(uv\right)'=u'v+uv'\,&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging,
:&lt;math&gt;uv'=\left(uv\right)'-u'v\,&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\int uv' dx = \int \left(uv\right)' dx - \int u'v dx&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\int uv' dx = uv - \int vu' dx&lt;/math&gt;
, or
:&lt;math&gt;\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du&lt;/math&gt;
This is the integration by parts formula. It is very useful in many integrals involving products of functions, as well as others.

For instance, to treat

:&lt;math&gt;\int x \sin x \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

we choose {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u=x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;dv=\sin x dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}. With these choices, we have {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;du=dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;v=-\cos x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, and we have
:&lt;math&gt;\int x \sin x \, dx = -x \cos x - \int \left(-\cos x\right) \, dx = -x \cos x + \int \cos x \, dx = -x \cos x + \sin x + C&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the choice of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dv&lt;/math&gt; was critical. Had we chosen the reverse, so that {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u=\sin x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;dv=x \, dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, the result would have been
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} x^2 \sin x - \int \frac{1}{2} x^2 \cos x \, dx &lt;/math&gt;
The resulting integral is no easier to work with than the original; we might say that this application of integration by parts took us in the wrong direction.

So the choice is important. One general guideline to help us make that choice is, if possible, to choose &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to be the factor of the integrand which ''becomes simpler'' when we differentiate it. In the last example, we see that {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} does not become simpler when we differentiate it: {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;\cos x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} is no simpler than {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.

An important feature of the integration by parts method is that we often need to apply it more than once. For instance, to integrate
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^2 e^x \, dx&lt;/math&gt;,
we start by choosing {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u=x^2&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;dv = e^x dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to get
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^2 e^x \, dx = x^2 e^x - 2 \int x e^x \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that we still have an integral to take care of, and we do this by applying integration by parts again, with {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u=x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;dv=e^x\, dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, which gives us
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^2 e^x \, dx = x^2 e^x - 2 \int x e^x \, dx = x^2 e^x - 2\left(x e^x -e^x\right) + C = x^2 e^x - 2x e^x + 2e^x + C.&lt;/math&gt;
So, two applications of integration by parts were necessary, owing to the power of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; in the integrand.

Note that ''any power of x'' does become simpler when we differentiate it, so when we see an integral of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^n f\left(x\right) \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
one of our first thoughts ought to be to consider using integration by parts with {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u=x^n&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}. Of course, in order for it to work, we need to be able to write down an antiderivative for &lt;math&gt;dv&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Use integration by parts to evaluate the integral
:&lt;math&gt; \int \sin\left(x\right) e^x\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Solution: If we let {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt; u = \sin\left(x\right) &lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;v'=e^x dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, then we have {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u'=\cos\left(x\right)dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;v=e^x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}. Using our rule for integration by parts gives
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin\left(x\right) e^x\, dx= e^x\sin\left(x\right)- \int \cos\left(x\right)e^x\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
We do not seem to have made much progress. But if we integrate by parts again with 
{{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt; u = \cos\left(x\right) &lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;v'=e^x dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and hence {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;u'=-\sin\left(x\right)dx&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;v=e^x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin\left(x\right) e^x\, dx = e^x\sin\left(x\right) - e^x\cos\left(x\right) - \int e^x \sin\left(x\right)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
We may solve this identity to find the anti-derivative of &lt;math&gt;e^x\sin\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; and obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin\left(x\right) e^x\, dx = \frac 1 2 e^x\left(\sin\left(x\right) - \cos\left(x\right) \right) +C&lt;/math&gt;

===With definite integral===
For definite integrals the rule is essentially the same, as long as we keep the endpoints.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''Integration by parts for definite integrals'''
Suppose ''f'' and ''g'' are differentiable and their derivatives are continuous. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f\left(x\right)g'\left(x\right) dx = \left.\left(f\left(x\right)g\left(x\right)\right)\right|_a^b - \int_a^b f'\left(x\right) g\left(x\right) dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=f\left(b\right)g\left(b\right)-f\left(a\right)g\left(a\right) - \int_a^b f'\left(x\right) g\left(x\right) dx&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This can also be expressed in Leibniz notation.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b udv = \left.\left(uv\right)\right|_a^b - \int_a^b v du.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This technique requires an understanding and recognition of complex numbers. Specifically Euler's formula:

&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + i\cdot \sin \theta = e^{i \cdot \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Recognize, for example, that the real portion:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}\{ e^{i \cdot \theta} \} = \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Given an integral of the general form:

&lt;math&gt;\int e^{x} \cos {2x} \; dx&lt;/math&gt;

We can complexify it:

&lt;math&gt;\int \mathrm{Re}\{ e^{x} (\cos {2x} + i\cdot \sin {2x}) \} \; dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \mathrm{Re}\{ e^{x} (e^{i 2x}) \} \; dx&lt;/math&gt;

With basic rules of exponents:

&lt;math&gt;\int \mathrm{Re}\{ e^{x + i2x} \} \; dx&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proven that the &quot;real portion&quot; operator can be moved outside the integral:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}\{ \int e^{x(1 + 2i)} \; dx \}&lt;/math&gt;

The integral easily evaluates:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}\{ \frac{e^{x(1 + 2i)}}{1 + 2i} \}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying and dividing by (1-2i):

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} \{ \frac{1 - 2i}{5} e^{x(1 + 2i)} \}&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} \{ \frac{1 - 2i}{5} e^{x} e^{i2x} \}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying Euler's forumula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} \{ \frac{1 - 2i}{5} e^{x} (\cos 2x + i\cdot \sin 2x) \}&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} \{ \frac{e^{x}}{5} (\cos 2x +2 \sin 2x) + i\cdot \frac{e^{x}}{5} (\sin 2x -2 \cos 2x) \}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the Real part of this expression:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{e^{x}}{5} (\cos 2x +2 \sin 2x)&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;\int e^{x} \cos {2x} \; dx = \frac{e^{x}}{5} (\cos 2x +2 \sin 2x)+C&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we want to find &lt;math&gt;\int {3x+ 1 \over x^2+x} dx&lt;/math&gt;.  One way to do this is to simplify the integrand by finding constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;{3x+ 1 \over x^2+x}={3x+ 1 \over x(x+1)}= {A \over x}+ {B \over x+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be done by cross multiplying the fraction which gives 
:&lt;math&gt;{3x+1\over x(x+1)} = {{A(x+1) + Bx} \over {x(x+1)}}&lt;/math&gt;
As both sides have the same denominator we must have
:&lt;math&gt;3x+1 = A(x+1)+Bx&lt;/math&gt;
This is an equation for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; so it must hold whatever value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is.   If we put in &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; we get
&lt;math&gt; 1 = A &lt;/math&gt;
and putting &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;-2=-B&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;B=2&lt;/math&gt;.
So we see that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{3x+ 1}{x^2+x} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x+1} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Returning to the original integral
:{|
|&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{3x+1}{x^2+x} dx &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \int \frac{dx}{x} + \int \frac{2}{x+1} dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \ln \left| x \right| + 2 \ln \left| x+1 \right| + C &lt;/math&gt;
|-

Rewriting the integrand as a sum of simpler fractions has allowed us to reduce the initial integral to a sum of simpler integrals.  In fact this method works to integrate any rational function.

==Method of Partial Fractions==

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
To decompose the rational function &lt;math&gt;\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}&lt;/math&gt;:
*&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt; Use long division to ensure that the degree of &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is less than the degree of &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Calculus/Algebra#Application:_Breaking_up_a_rational_function|Breaking up a rational function]] in section {{Calculus/map page|Algebra}}).
*&lt;b&gt;Step 2&lt;/b&gt; Factor Q(x) as far as possible.
*&lt;b&gt;Step 3&lt;/b&gt; Write down the correct form for the partial fraction decomposition (see below) and solve for the constants.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To factor Q(x) we have to write it as a product of linear factors (of the form &lt;math&gt;ax+b&lt;/math&gt;) and irreducible quadratic factors (of the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;).

Some of the factors could be repeated.  For instance if &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = x^3-6x^2+9x&lt;/math&gt; we factor &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt; Q(x) = x(x^2-6x+9) = x(x-3)(x-3)=x(x-3)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

It is important that in each quadratic factor we have &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise it is possible to factor that quadratic piece further.    For example if &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = x^3-3x^2 - 2x&lt;/math&gt; then we can write
:&lt;math&gt; Q(x) = x(x^2-3x+2) = x(x-1)(x+2)&lt;/math&gt;


We will now show how to write &lt;math&gt;P(x)/Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; 
as a sum of terms of the form
:&lt;math&gt; {A \over (ax+b)^k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{Ax+B \over (ax^2+bx+c)^k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Exactly how to do this depends on the factorization of &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; and we now give four cases that can occur.

===Q(x) is a product of linear factors with no repeats===

This means that &lt;math&gt;Q(x) = (a_1x+b_1)(a_2x+b_2)...(a_nx+b_n)&lt;/math&gt; where no factor is repeated and no factor is a multiple of another.

For each linear term we write down something of the form &lt;math&gt;{A \over (ax+b)}&lt;/math&gt;, so in total we write

:&lt;math&gt; {P(x) \over Q(x)} = {A_1 \over (a_1x+b_1)} + {A_2 \over (a_2x+b_2)} + \cdots +  {A_n \over (a_nx+b_n)} &lt;/math&gt;

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 1}}
Find &lt;math&gt; \int {1+x^2 \over (x+3)(x+5)(x+7)}dx&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have &lt;math&gt;P(x)=1+x^2,  Q(x)=(x+3)(x+5)(x+7)&lt;/math&gt; and ''Q(x)'' is a product of linear  factors.  So we write

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1+x^2}{(x+3)(x+5)(x+7)}=\frac{A}{x+3}+\frac{B}{x+5}+\frac{C}{x+7} &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply both sides by the denominator

&lt;math&gt;1+x^2=A(x+5)(x+7)+B(x+3)(x+7)+C(x+3)(x+5)&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute in three values of ''x'' to get three equations for the unknown constants,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x=-3 &amp; 1+3^2=2\cdot 4 A \\  x=-5 &amp; 1+5^2=-2\cdot 2 B \\  
x=-7 &amp; 1+7^2=(-4)\cdot (-2) C \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;A=5/4, B=-13/2, C=25/4&lt;/math&gt;, and

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1+x^2}{(x+3)(x+5)(x+7)}=\frac{5}{4x+12} -\frac{13}{2x+10} +\frac{25}{4x+28}  &lt;/math&gt;

We can now integrate the left hand side.

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1+x^2 \, dx}{(x+3)(x+5)(x+7)}=
\frac{5}{4} \ln|x+3| - \frac{13}{2}\ln|x+5|+ \frac{25}{4}\ln|x+7|+ C &lt;/math&gt;

===Q(x) is a product of linear factors some of which are repeated===

If &lt;math&gt;(ax+b)&lt;/math&gt; appears in the factorisation of &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''k''-times then instead of writing the piece &lt;math&gt; {A \over (ax+b)}&lt;/math&gt;  we use the more complicated expression

&lt;math&gt; {A_1\over ax+b} + {A_2\over (ax+b)^2} +  {A_3\over (ax+b)^3} + \cdots + {A_k\over (ax+b)^k}&lt;/math&gt;

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 2}}
Find &lt;math&gt; \int {1 \over (x+1)(x+2)^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;P(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(x)=(x+1)(x+2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
We write

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)^2}=\frac{A}{x+1}+\frac{B}{x+2}+\frac{C}{(x+2)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply both sides by the denominator
&lt;math&gt; 1= A(x+2)^2+B(x+1)(x+2)+C(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute in three values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to get 3 equations for the unknown constants,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x=0 &amp; 1= 2^2A +2B+C \\  x=-1 &amp; 1=A \\  
x=-2 &amp; 1= -C \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;A=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B=-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C=-1&lt;/math&gt;, and

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)^2}=\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{1}{x+2}-\frac{1}{(x+2)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We can now integrate the left hand side.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)^2} dx= \ln \frac{1}{x+1} - \ln \frac{1}{x+2} + \frac{1}{x+2} +C
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
We now simplify the fuction with the property of Logarithms.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int \ln \frac{1}{x+1} - \ln \frac{1}{x+2} + \frac{1}{x+2} + C = \ln \frac{x+1}{x+2} + \frac{1}{x+2} +C

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus/Top Nav|Integration techniques/Trigonometric Substitution|Integration techniques/Partial Fraction Decomposition}}

When the integrand is primarily or exclusively based on trigonometric functions, the following techniques are useful.

=== Powers of Sine and Cosine ===
We will give a general method to solve generally integrands of the form &lt;math&gt;\cos^m(x)\sin^n(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  First let us work through an example.

:&lt;math&gt;\int\cos^3(x)\sin^2(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the integrand contains an odd power of cos.  So rewrite it as

:&lt;math&gt;\int\cos^2(x)\sin^2(x)\cos(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve this by making the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;du=\cos(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can write the whole integrand in terms of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by using the identity
: &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x)=1-\sin^2(x)=1-u^2&lt;/math&gt;.
So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int\cos^3(x)\sin^2(x)\,dx &amp;=&amp;\int\cos^2(x)\sin^2(x)\cos(x)\,dx\\
&amp;=&amp;\int (1-u^2)u^2\,du\\
&amp;=&amp;\int u^2\,du - \int u^4\,du\\
&amp;=&amp;{1\over 3} u^3+{1\over 5}u^5 + C\\
&amp;=&amp;{1\over 3} \sin^3(x)-{1\over 5}\sin^5(x)+C 
\end{matrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This method works whenever there is an odd power of sine or cosine.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
To evaluate &lt;math&gt;\int\cos^m(x)\sin^n(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; when '''either''' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is '''odd'''.
*If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is odd substitute &lt;math&gt;u=\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; and use the identity &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x)=1-\sin^2(x)=1-u^2&lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd substitute &lt;math&gt;u=\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; and use the identity &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)=1-\cos^2(x)=1-u^2&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Example ====
Find &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^{40}(x)\sin^3(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;.

As there is an odd power of &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; we let &lt;math&gt;u=\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;du=-\sin(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice that when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;u=cos(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and when &lt;math&gt;x=\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;u=\cos(\pi/2) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^{40}(x)\sin^3(x) dx &amp;=&amp;  \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^{40}(x)\sin^2(x) \sin(x) dx \\ 
&amp;=&amp; -\int_{1}^{0} u^{40} (1-u^2) du \\
&amp;=&amp;\int_{0}^{1} u^{40} (1-u^2) du\\
&amp;=&amp; \int_{0}^{1} u^{40} - u^{42} du \\
&amp;=&amp; [\frac{1}{41}u^{41} - \frac{1}{43}u^{43}]_0^1 \\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{41}-\frac{1}{43}.
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

When both &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are even things get a little more complicated.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
To evaluate &lt;math&gt;\int\cos^m(x)\sin^n(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; when both &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are '''even'''.

&lt;br&gt;Use the [[Calculus/Table_of_Trigonometry|identities]] &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)=\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos(2x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x)=\frac{1}{2}(1+\cos(2x))&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Example ====
Find &lt;math&gt; \int\sin^2(x)\cos^4(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)=\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos(2x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x)=\frac{1}{2}(1+\cos(2x))&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\int \sin^2(x)\cos^4(x)\,dx = \int \left( {1 \over 2}(1 - \cos(2x)) \right)
  \left( {1 \over 2}(1 + \cos(2x)) \right)^2 \,dx,
&lt;/math&gt;
and expanding, the integrand becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{8} \int \left( 1 - \cos^2(2x) + \cos(2x)- \cos^3(2x) \right) \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the multiple angle identities
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
I &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{8} \left( \int 1 \, dx  - \int \cos^2(2x)\, dx 
 + \int \cos(2x)\,dx  -\int \cos^3(2x)\,dx \right) \\ 
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{8}  \left( x  - \frac{1}{2} \int (1 + \cos(4x))\,dx 
 + \frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)  -\int \cos^2(2x) \cos(2x) \,dx\right) \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{16}  \left( x + \sin(2x) + \int \cos(4x) \,dx   
-2 \int(1-\sin^2(2x))\cos(2x)\,dx\right) \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
then we obtain on evaluating
:&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{x}{16}-\frac{\sin(4x)}{64} + \frac{\sin^3(2x)}{48}+C &lt;/math&gt;

===Powers of Tan and Secant===

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
To evaluate &lt;math&gt;\int\tan^m(x)\sec^n(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.
#If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even and &lt;math&gt;n\ge 2&lt;/math&gt; then  substitute &lt;math&gt;u=tan(x)&lt;/math&gt; and use the [[Calculus/Table_of_Trigonometry|identity]] &lt;math&gt;\sec^2(x)=1+\tan^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
#If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are both odd then substitute &lt;math&gt;u=\sec(x)&lt;/math&gt; and use the [[Calculus/Table_of_Trigonometry|identity]] &lt;math&gt;\tan^2(x)=\sec^2(x)-1&lt;/math&gt;.
#If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is even then use the [[Calculus/Table_of_Trigonometry|identity]] &lt;math&gt;\tan^2(x)=\sec^2(x)-1&lt;/math&gt; and apply a [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Reduction Formula|reduction formula]] to integrate &lt;math&gt;\sec^j(x)dx\,&lt;/math&gt;, using the examples below to integrate when &lt;math&gt;j=1,2&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Example 1 ====
Find &lt;math&gt;\int \sec^2(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

There is an even power of &lt;math&gt;\sec(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Substituting &lt;math&gt;u=\tan(x)&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;du = \sec^2(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; so

&lt;math&gt; \int \sec^2(x)dx = \int du = u+C = \tan(x)+C.&lt;/math&gt;


==== Example 2 ====
Find &lt;math&gt;\int \tan(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;u=\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;du=-\sin(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Then

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int \tan(x)dx &amp;=&amp; \int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} dx \\
&amp;=&amp; \int \frac{-1}{u} du \\
&amp;=&amp; -\ln |u| + C \\
&amp;=&amp; -\ln |\cos(x) | + C\\
&amp;=&amp; \ln |\sec(x)| +C.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;


==== Example 3 ====
Find &lt;math&gt;\int \sec(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

The trick to do this is to multiply and divide by the same thing like this:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int \sec(x)dx &amp;=&amp; \int \sec(x)\frac{\sec(x) + \tan(x)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)} dx \\
&amp;=&amp; \int \frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x) \tan(x)}{\sec(x)+ \tan(x)}
\end{matrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Making the substitution &lt;math&gt;u= \sec(x) + \tan(x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;du = \sec(x)\tan(x) + \sec^2(x)dx,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int \sec(x) dx &amp;=&amp; \int \frac{1}{u} du\\
&amp;=&amp; \ln |u| + C \\
&amp;=&amp; \ln |\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C
\end{matrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== More trigonometric combinations ===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
For the integrals &lt;math&gt;\int \sin(nx)\cos(mx)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\int \sin(nx)\sin(mx)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\int \cos(nx)\cos(mx)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
use the [[Calculus/Table_of_Trigonometry|identities]]
*&lt;math&gt; \sin(a)\cos(b) = {1\over 2}(\sin{(a+b)}+\sin{(a-b)}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \sin(a)\sin(b) = {1\over 2}(\cos{(a-b)}-\cos{(a+b)}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \cos(a)\cos(b) = {1\over 2}(\cos{(a-b)}+\cos{(a+b)}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Example 1 ====
Find &lt;math&gt; \int \sin(3x)\cos(5x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

We can use the fact that 
&lt;math&gt;\sin(a)\cos(b)=(1/2)(\sin(a+b)+\sin(a-b))&lt;/math&gt;, so 
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(3x)\cos(5x)=(\sin(8x)+\sin{(-2x)})/2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Now use the oddness property of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; to simplify
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(3x)\cos{5x}=(\sin(8x)-\sin(2x))/2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
And now we can integrate
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int \sin(3x)\cos(5x)\,dx &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2} \int \sin(8x)-\sin(2x)dx \\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}(-\frac{1}{8}\cos(8x)+\frac{1}{2}\cos(2x)) +C \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 2 ====
Find:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin(x)\sin(2x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the identities
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x) \sin(2x)= \frac{1}{2} \left( \cos(-x)-\cos(3x) \right)
= \frac{1}{2} (\cos(x) -\cos(3x)).&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
\int \sin(x)\sin(2x)\,dx &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2} \int (\cos(x)-\cos(3x))\,dx  \\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}(\sin(x)-\frac{1}{3}\sin(3x)) + C
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

A ''reduction formula'' is one that enables us to solve an integral problem by ''reducing'' it to a problem of solving an easier integral problem, and then reducing that to the problem of solving an easier problem, and so on.

For example, if we let
:&lt;math&gt;I_n = \int x^n e^x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
Integration by parts allows us to simplify this to
:&lt;math&gt;I_n = x^ne^x - n\int x^{n-1}e^x\,dx=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_n = x^ne^x - nI_{n-1} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
which is our desired reduction formula. Note that we stop at 
:&lt;math&gt;I_0 = e^x \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, if we let

:&lt;math&gt;I_n = \int \sec^n \theta \, d\theta &lt;/math&gt;

then integration by parts lets us simplify this to

:&lt;math&gt;I_n = \sec^{n-2}\theta \tan \theta - 
(n-2)\int \sec^{n-2} \theta \tan^2 \theta \, d\theta  &lt;/math&gt;

Using the trigonometric identity, &lt;math&gt;\tan^2\theta=\sec^2\theta-1&lt;/math&gt;, we can now write

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
I_n &amp; = &amp; \sec^{n-2}\theta \tan \theta &amp; 
+ (n-2) \left( \int \sec^{n-2} \theta \, d\theta
- \int \sec^n \theta \, d\theta \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; \sec^{n-2}\theta \tan \theta &amp; + (n-2) \left( I_{n-2}  - I_n \right) \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, we get

:&lt;math&gt;I_n=\frac{1}{n-1}\sec^{n-2}\theta \tan \theta + \frac{n-2}{n-1} I_{n-2} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that we stop at &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; or 2 if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd or even respectively.

As in these two examples, integrating by parts when the integrand contains a power often results in a reduction formula.

Another useful change of variables is the Weierstrass substitution, named after Karl Weierstrass:

:&lt;math&gt;t=\tan (x/2) \,&lt;/math&gt;

With this transformation, using the double-angle trigonometric identities,

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x =\frac{2t}{1+t^2} \quad \cos x = \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} \quad
\tan x = \frac{2t}{1-t^2} \quad dx=\frac{2 \, dt}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This transforms a trigonometric integral into a algebraic integral, which may be easier to integrate.

For example, if the integrand is 1/(1 + sin ''x'') then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; {}\quad \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{dx}{1 + \sin x} = \int_0^1 \frac{\left(\frac{2\,dt}{1+t^2}\right)}{1 + \left(\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\right)} \\[8pt]
&amp; = \int_0^1 \frac{2\,dt}{(t+1)^2}\\[8pt]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This method can be used to further simplify trigonometric integrals produced by the changes of variables described earlier.

For example, if we are considering the integral

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1+x^2} \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

we can first use the substitution ''x'' = sin &amp;theta;, which gives

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{ \cos^2 \theta}{1+ \sin^2 \theta} \, d\theta &lt;/math&gt;

then use the tan-half-angle substition to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{(1-t^2)^2}{1+6t^2+t^4}\frac{2 \, dt}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In effect, we've removed the square root from the original integrand. We could do this with a single change of variables, but doing it in two steps gives us the opportunity of doing the trigonometric integral another way.

Having done this, we can split the new integrand into partial fractions, and integrate.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I &amp; = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{2-\sqrt{2}}{t^2+3-\sqrt{8}} \, dt 
+ \int_{-1}^1 \frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{t^2+3+\sqrt{8}} \, dt 
- \int_{-1}^1 \frac{2}{1+t^2} \, dt \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{4-\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{3-\sqrt{8}}} \tan^{-1} \left(\sqrt{3+\sqrt{8}}\,\right)
+ \frac{4+\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{3+\sqrt{8}}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{3-\sqrt{8}}\,\right)
- \pi \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

This result can be further simplified by use of the identities

:&lt;math&gt; 3 \pm \sqrt{8}= \left( \sqrt{2} \pm 1 \right)^2 \quad 
\tan^{-1}  \left( \sqrt{2} \pm 1 \right) = 
\left( \frac{1}{4} \pm \frac{1}{8} \right)\pi &lt;/math&gt;

ultimately leading to 

:&lt;math&gt;I=(\sqrt{2}-1)\pi \, &lt;/math&gt;

In principle, this approach will work with any integrand which is the square root of a quadratic multiplied by the ratio of two polynomials. However, it should not be applied automatically. 

E.g., in this last example, once we deduced

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{ \cos^2 \theta}{1+ \sin^2 \theta} \, d\theta &lt;/math&gt;

we could have used the double angle formula, since this contains only even powers of cos and sin. Doing that gives

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{1+\cos 2\theta}{3 - \cos 2\theta} d\theta
= \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi}^\pi  \frac{1+\cos \phi}{3 - \cos \phi} \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

Using tan-half-angle on this new, simpler, integrand gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I &amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{1+2t^2} \frac{dt}{1+t^2} \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{2 \, dt}{1+2t^2} 
- \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dt}{1+t^2} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be integrated on sight to give

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\pi}{2}-2\frac{\pi}{2} = (\sqrt{2}-1) \pi &lt;/math&gt;

This is the same result as before, but obtained with less algebra, which shows why it is best to look for the most straightforward methods at every stage.

A more direct way of evaluating the integral ''I'' is to substitute ''t'' = tan ''&amp;theta;'' right from the start, which will directly bring us to the line

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{1+2t^2} \frac{dt}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

above. More generally, the substitution ''t'' = tan ''x'' gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x =\frac{t}{\sqrt{1+t^2}} \quad \cos x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}} \quad
dx=\frac{dt}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

so this substitution is the preferable one to use if the integrand is such that all the square roots would disappear after substitution, as is the case in the above integral.

'''Example'''

Using the trigonometric substitution &lt;math&gt;t=a\tan x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;dt=a\sec^2 x\, dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{t^2+a^2} = a\sec x&lt;/math&gt; (when &lt;math&gt;-\pi/2 &lt; x &lt; \pi/2&lt;/math&gt;). So, 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int \frac{1}{\left(t^2+a^2\right)^\frac{3}{2}}\,dt &amp; = \int \frac{1}{a^3 \sec^3 x}\, a\sec^2 x\,dx \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{1}{a^2} \int \cos x\,dx \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{1}{a^2} \sin x + C \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{1}{a^2} \frac{a\tan x}{a\sec x} + C \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{t}{a^2 \sqrt{t^2+a^2}} + C
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Alternate Method===

In general, to evaluate integrals of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{A + B \cos x + C \sin x}{a + b \cos x + c \sin x} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

it is extremely tedious to use the aforementioned &quot;tan half angle&quot; substitution directly, as one easily ends up with a rational function with a 4th degree denominator. Instead, we may first write the numerator as

:&lt;math&gt;A + B \cos x + C \sin x \equiv p (a + b \cos x + c \sin x) + q \frac{d}{dx} (a + b \cos x + c \sin x) + r.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the integral can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left(p+\frac{q \frac{d}{dx} (a + b \cos x + c \sin x)}{a + b \cos x + c \sin x} + \frac{r}{a + b \cos x + c \sin x} \right) \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

which can be evaluated much more easily.

==== Example ====
Evaluate &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\cos x + 2}{\cos x + \sin x} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x + 2 \equiv p (\cos x + \sin x) + q \frac{d}{dx} (\cos x + \sin x) + r.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x + 2 \equiv p (\cos x + \sin x) + q (-\sin x + \cos x) + r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos x + 2 \equiv (p+q) \cos x + (p-q) \sin x + r.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing coefficients of cos ''x'', sin ''x'' and the constants on both sides, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases} p+q &amp; = 1 \\ p-q &amp; = 0 \\ r &amp; = 2 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

yielding ''p'' = ''q'' = 1/2, ''r'' = 2. Substituting back into the integrand,

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\cos x + 2}{\cos x + \sin x} \, dx = \int \frac{1}{2} \, dx + \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{d(\cos x + \sin x)}{\cos x + \sin x} + \int \frac{2}{\cos x + \sin x} \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The last integral can now be evaluated using the &quot;tan half angle&quot; substitution described above, and we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{2}{\cos x + \sin x} \, dx = \sqrt{2} \ln \left| \frac{\tan \frac{x}{2} - 1 + \sqrt{2}}{\tan \frac{x}{2} - 1 - \sqrt{2}} \right| + C.&lt;/math&gt;

The original integral is thus

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\cos x + 2}{\cos x + \sin x} \, dx = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \ln |\cos x + \sin x| + \sqrt{2} \ln \left| \frac{\tan \frac{x}{2} - 1 + \sqrt{2}}{\tan \frac{x}{2} - 1 - \sqrt{2}} \right| + C.&lt;/math&gt;

Integration of irrational functions is more difficult than rational functions, and many cannot be done. However, there are some particular types that can be reduced to rational forms by suitable substitutions.

===Type 1===
'''Integrand contains''' &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}}&lt;/math&gt;

Use the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=\sqrt[n]{\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example'''

Find &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x} \sqrt{\frac{1-x}{x}} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; \int \frac {x}{\sqrt[3]{ax+b}}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

===Type 2===
'''Integral is of the form''' &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{Px+Q}{\sqrt{ax^2+bx+c}} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

Write &lt;math&gt;Px+Q&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Px+Q = p \frac{d}{dx} (ax^2+bx+c) + q&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example'''

Find &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{4x-1}{\sqrt{5-4x-x^2}} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;.

===Type 3===
'''Integrand contains''' &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This was discussed in &quot;trigonometric substitutions above&quot;. Here is a summary:

# For &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, use &lt;math&gt;x = a \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, use &lt;math&gt;x = a \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;, use &lt;math&gt;x = a \sec \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Type 4===
'''Integral is of the form''' &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{(px+q) \sqrt{ax^2+bx+c}} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

Use the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=\frac{1}{px+q}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example'''

Find &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{(1+x)\sqrt{3+6x+x^2}} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;.

===Type 5===
'''Other rational expressions with the irrational function''' &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ax^2+bx+c}&lt;/math&gt;

# If &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we can use &lt;math&gt;u=\sqrt{ax^2+bx+c} \pm \sqrt{a}x&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we can use &lt;math&gt;u=\frac{\sqrt{ax^2+bx+c} \pm \sqrt{c}}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;a(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, we can use &lt;math&gt;u=\sqrt{\frac{a(x-\alpha)}{x-\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;-a(\alpha-x)(x-\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, we can use &lt;math&gt;x=\alpha\cos^2\theta+\beta\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome at me........ 

I am limited known as Ameer, though my official wikiname would mention Irsjad (Dutch spelling, English would be Irshad), which both are my Muslim names, who fully sounds Ameer Irshad Ali..... Read more about this in my intro and so on!

Feel free to comment on the [[User_talk:Irsjad | comments page]] and please, not here, this is my realm ;-)

==Introduction | Who am I?==
I'm a Dutchman, born 1976 (so calculate my age yourself). I have studied Human Geography, specialised in political &amp; cultural geography in which geopolitics, environmental conflict studies and cultural studies are my main interest. I'm very spiritual, studied Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism (tibetan &amp; zen), Taoism and Islam. In 2002 I reverted to Islam, for me a natural step in my development, which you can read on one of my blogs.

==My favorite quote==
As for now I use this quote mostly on the net as a signature. However, I might post some other quotes I lik overhere!

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''There is no wealth like knowledge, no poverty like ignorance - Hazrat Ali ibn Abi-Talib (as)''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Objectives==
As you could read in my intro, my background, education, religion and work bring me in a diverse field of interest and knowledge. As such, I hope to learn more here, find valuable information and share my own information and modest knowledge with you! May we learn from eachother and understand eachother. My specific interests are:

International Relations; UN, NATO, Middle East, South Asia Developing Countries; social, economic &amp; political change &amp; struggle Environmental Issues Islam; Islamologist/Fundamentalists, Modern Moderates, changes in the Islamic worlds, and unfortunately: terrorism, the political Islam.

==Other Information==
If you really would like to know more about me. I can tell you, I use [[linux]] especially the [[Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]] distro, and furthermore I use the [[Opera_(web_browser)|Opera]] webbrowser. On which [http://my.opera.com/ameerirshad/about/ My Opera] page you can find more about me. I also can be found here on [http://ameer.multiply.com/ my multiply] page! Besides these two pages I try to [[blog]] now and then on my own [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] pages at [http://muminalbayda.blogspot.com/ Mumin al Bayda] and [http://www.luxzenburg.org/ luxzenburg.org] pages. So that's all there is to tell I guess....... take care!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic facts about congruences can be found in any [[Number Theory]] book. We will merely review them here. For details please consult any standard text on number theory.

For any integer &lt;math&gt;n\ge 2&lt;/math&gt; we say that two integers a and b are congruent modulo n or &lt;math&gt;a\equiv b\pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; if n divides the difference a-b.

For example, 5 and 11 are congruent modulo 3:

11≡5(mod 3) 
because 11 − 5 gives 6, which is divisible by 3. Or, equally, both numbers give the same remainder when divided by 3:

11 = 3×3 + 2 
5 = 1×3 + 2 

If a1 ≡ b1 (mod n) and a2 ≡ b2 (mod n) then a1 + a2 ≡ b1 + b2 (mod n) and a1a2 ≡ b1b2 (mod n) This turns the congruence (mod n) into an equivalence on the ring of all integers. The equivalence class of the integer ''a'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n&lt;/math&gt;, is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{\ldots, a - 2n, a - n, a, a + n, a + 2n, \ldots \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set, consisting of the integers congruent to ''a'' modulo ''n'', is called the '''congruence class''' or '''residue class''' of ''a'' modulo ''n''. Another notation for this congruence class, which requires that in the context the modulus is known, is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle [a]&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of congruence classes modulo ''n'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (or, alternatively, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;) and defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \left\{ \overline{a}_n | a \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has ''n'' elements, and can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \left\{ \overline{0}_n, \overline{1}_n, \overline{2}_n,\ldots, \overline{n-1}_n \right\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

We can define addition, subtraction, and multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; by the following rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n + \overline{b}_n = \overline{a + b}_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n - \overline{b}_n = \overline{a - b}_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_n \overline{b}_n = \overline{ab}_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The verification that this is a proper definition uses the properties given before.
 
In this way, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a commutative ring. In fact, it turns out that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a field (which is a special kind of a commutative ring) if and only if n is a prime number. 

'''Fermat's little theorem''' (not to be confused with [[Fermat's last theorem]]) states that if ''p'' is a prime number, then for any integer ''a'', &lt;math&gt;a^p - a&lt;/math&gt; will be evenly divisible by ''p''. This can be expressed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The totient function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; of a positive integer ''n'' is defined to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to ''n'' that are coprime to ''n''.
For example, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(9)=6&lt;/math&gt; since the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 are coprime to 9.

'''Euler's theorem''' (also known as the '''Fermat-Euler theorem''' or '''Euler's totient theorem''') states that if ''n'' is a positive integer and ''a'' is coprime to ''n'', then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\varphi (n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where φ(''n'') is Euler's totient function and &quot;... &amp;equiv; ... (mod ''n'')&quot; denotes congruence modulo n.

The theorem is a generalization of Fermat's little theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Physics is an essential subject for many professions like Astronomy, Engineering, Rocket science, Architecture and so on. A good free text book is absolutely essential. A book called &lt;b&gt;Fundamentals of Physics (ISBN 978-0-471-32000-5)&lt;/b&gt; by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi to all!  My name is Robin and this is my first course with ODU!

'''ABOUT ME''':

The first thing I always say about myself is that I am the mother of three: a daughter who is a Speech Therapist and now lives in San Francisco; a son who is a U.S. Marine and currently in Jacksonville, N.C.; and my youngest son, a senior in high school, here with me in Danville, Virginia. Having spent most of my life taking care of my children and doing all that I could to enable them to each strive to be the very best they could be, it seemed only logical for me to pursue a degree in Education in order to continue with my personal interests in today's youth. After children, my second passion is my beloved personality-plus Maltese pup, Brady--a real ball of energy and a true source of delight for me!

'''PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION''':

I believe that young students should be empowered with an enthusiastic and genuinely concerned classroom leader. As a teacher, my intentions of creating the welcoming and accepting environment that I feel is necessary for learning to occur will be reinforced with an insistence upon mutual respect among and between the students, a zero toleration for bullying, and instructional strategies that incorporate the necessary social skills in building this foundation. I think the use of cooperative learning and the availability of student choice in assignment or project tasks for purposes of evaluating comprehension of material presented (wherever and whenever possible) will open doors of opportunity for students to realize and appreciate individual differences as well as shared similarities. I want each child to feel respected, wanted, and valued as they together learn not only the grade requirements, but also their unique and indispensable positions of importance in thier classroom, school, and community.</text>

The gambit actually is offered by the next move [[/3. c3|3. c3]]. Taking back with [[/3. Qxd4|3. Qxd4]] really isn't an option, since the queen will be pushed around, while black makes developing moves.

Now white offers a pawn for quicker development and open c- and d-files. Black can accept the gambit with [[/3...dxc3|3...dxc3]], or decline it, most commonly with [[/3...d3|3...d3]].  The natural square for the knight (c3) is still occupied by the white pawn, so white will lose a tempo.

Black accepted the gambit by taking the pawn on c3. Offering another pawn, by playing anything other than [[/4. Nxc3|4. Nxc3]], will be too much and black will get an advantage.

Taking back with [[/4. bxc3|4. bxc3]] is inferior, since it blocks the natural developing square of the knight on b1.

=Smith-Morra Gambit=
White captured the pawn on c3 and got ahead in the development, since his piece can already move along the open lines. He will develop his pieces like this: Nf3, Bc4, Qe2, 0-0, Rd1, Bf4 (g5), Rc1 - depending on the moves of black, of course.

Sometimes white can attack with the pawn push to e5 and open the lines in front of the uncastled black king. Another typical attack moves the knight to b5 and puts pressure on the d6 and c7 square (i.e. in combination with Bf4 this is a real threat).

Black has various options, but some of them are just changes in move order.
The most flexible move seems to be [[/4...Nc6|4...Nc6]], since it is a good developing move and prevents the pawn e4 from advancing. This pawn push is one of the attacking motives that white has, i.e. after [[/4...Nf6|4...Nf6]] [[/4...Nf6/5. e5|5. e5]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Minix 3 on VirtualBox 2.0.2 ==
=== Preparation ===
After you successfully installed VirtualBox on a Linux Host system make sure the VirtualBox kernel modules are properly loaded:

&lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup&lt;/code&gt;

If you intend to install a minix3 system from a cdrom then make sure the user belongs to the right groups:

&lt;code&gt;ls -l /dev/hdc&lt;/code&gt;

brw-r------ root disk 22, 0 22. Sep 21:50 /dev/hdc

If not add your VirtualBox user to the appropriate group: (e.g. disk)

&lt;code&gt; usermod -a -G disk user &lt;/code&gt;

The VirtualBox should be able to mount /cdroms

either edit /etc/fstab or type as root visudo and give the privileges:

&lt;code&gt; sudo mount /dev/hdc /cdrom&lt;/code&gt;

[[Category:Minix 3|VirtualBox]]

The word Physics originates from the Greek word Physis, which means nature. Physics in raw terms is the study of everything around us. Physics is one of the oldest subjects (unknowing) invented by humanity. Possibly the oldest discipline in Physics could be astronomy.

The goals of Physics or Physicist is to express everyday happenings in a concise mathematical formula. These formulas are then used by other Physicist and engineers to predict results of their experiments. For example Isaac Newton (1642 – 1727) found the laws behind the motion of bodies, we now use these laws to design rockets that travel to moon and other planets.

Another major thing that Physicists do is to revise the laws from time to time depending on experimental results. Isaac Newton found laws of motion in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, these laws worked at normal speeds, but when a object's speed is comparable to that of speed of light, these laws fails. Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955), put forward the theory of relativity which gives the same result of Newton's laws of motion at slow speeds and far accurate results to speeds that go up to the speed of light.

Definition: &quot;MEASUREMENT&quot;is the determination of the size or magnitude of something &quot;Or&quot; The comparison of unknown quantity with some standard quantity of the same rates is known as measurement    

==Measurement==
Measurement is integral part of Physics like any other scientific subject. Measurement is a integral part of human race, without it there will be no trade, no statistics. You can see the philosophy of measurement in little kids who don't even know what math is. Kids try to compare their height, size of candy, size of dolls and amount of toys they have. All these happen even before they know math. Math is built into our brains even before we start to learn it.Math provides a great way to study about anything, that's why we see computers involved in almost anything because they are good at math.

===Scale===
Scales are used to measure. One would know a simple ruler or tape could be used to measure small distances, your height and possibly much more in Physics we do have certain scales for certain quantities which we would see very shortly.

== Length, Mass and Time==
The current system of units has three standard units: The meter, kilogram, and second.  These three units form the '''mks-system''' or the '''metric system'''.

A meter is a unit of length, currently defined as the distance light travels within 1/299782458th of a second.  

A kilogram is a unit of mass.  While it was previously defined as a specific volume of water (e.g. 1 Liter or a 10cm^3 cube), it's current definition is based on a prototype platinum-iridium cylinder.

A second is a unit of time. Originally defined as the amount of time the earth needs to make 1/86400 of a rotation, it is now defined as 9192631770 oscillations of a Cesium-133 atom.

==Dimensional and Unit Analysis==

Dimensional analysis to determine if an equation is dimensionally correct.  When you are presented with an equation, dimensional analysis is performed by stripping the numerical components and leaving only the unit types (such as Length, Mass, or Time).  It may also be used to determine the type of unit used for an unknown variable.  For example, the force of gravity may appear as the following:

&lt;math&gt; weight  force  (weight) = 9.8 m/s^2 * mass&lt;/math&gt;

It gets converted to the following:

&lt;math&gt; unbalanced force = {length}/{time} * {mass}&lt;/math&gt;

and as such, the unit of force involves multiplying length and mass, and dividing by the square of the time. 

Unit analysis is similar to dimensional analysis, except that it uses units instead of the basic dimensions.  The same principle applies; the numbers are removed, and the units are verified to be equal on both sides of the equation.

==Density==

Density is the amount of mass per volume. 

==Conversion of Units==

How many kilometers are in 20 miles?  To find out, you will have to convert the miles into kilometers.  

A conversion factor is a ratio between two compatible units.  

&lt;math&gt;20 miles = 20 miles * (1 km / 0.621 miles) = 32.2 km&lt;/math&gt;

You may also see conversion factors between weight (e.g. pounds) and mass (e.g. kilograms).  These factors rely on equivalence (e.g. 1 kilogram is &quot;close enough&quot; to 2.2 pounds) based on external factors.  While that cannot apply in all situations, these factors may be used in some limited scopes.  

==Estimates and Order-of-Magnitude calculation==
The order of magnitude gives the approximate idea of the powers of 10 .Any number  in the form a*10b [ here a multiplied by 10.. And 10raised to the power b]if a &gt;or = 5 the a become 1 and b is  not changed but when a&gt;5 then a is taken as 10 so power of b increeses by 1.

==Significant Figures==

A significant figure is a digit within a number that is expected to be accurate.  In contrast, a doubtful figure is a digit that might not be correct.  Significant figures are relevant in measured numbers, general estimates or rounded numbers. 

As a general rule, any non-zero digit shown is a significant figure.  Zeros that appear after the decimal point and are at the end of the number are also significant.  Zeros at the end of the number but before the decimal point are not included as significant figures (although exceptions may occur.)

In general, an operation performed on two numbers will result in a new number. This new number should have the same number of significant digits as the least accurate number. If an exact number is used, it should have the same number of digits as the estimated number.  If both numbers are exact, the new number should be calculated fully (within reason). 

When doing calculations, you should only keep at most 1 doubtful digit; while it is acceptable to keep them when using a handheld calculator or computer, the final answer should be adjusted to reflect the correct number of significant digits.

== Other units ==

The current metric system also includes the following units: 
* An ampere (A) measures electric current.
* A kelvin (K) measures temperature.
* A mole (mol) is the amount of substance (based on number of atoms rather than mass.) 
* A candela (cd) measures luminous intensity.

'''What is more acidic, cyclopentadiene or penta-1,4-diene? What is the application of Huckel's rule here?'''
===Discussion===
In this context acidity is the ability to lose a proton.We will decide the acidity on the basis of the stability of the resulting carbanion
[Why did we emphasize the word &quot;context&quot; here? How else can a molecule behave as an acid?][Why is it that a carbanion is formed?]
[How did we relate stability of carbanion with acidity here?]

Also, the number of carbons in both the compounds are same and are of a similar structure.It is only now that we can compare the stability of their conjugate bases [What are they?] [carbanions we were talking about in this case...]

So, first we decide what is the most acidic hydrogen in both the molecules. In the straight chain carbon molecule, the two hydrogens attached to the central carbon are more acidic than the rest of the hydrogens. This is for a specific reason.Once any of the hydrogen is extracted by a base, the central carbon should acquire a negative charge.Instead,the molecule is represented by a resonance hybrid of two degenerate [equivalent] resonance structures with a negative charge on the terminal carbons and a third one with the negative charge on the central carbon. This is a stabilizing factor of the carbanion. The presence of this stabilizing factor makes the two hydrogens in the original molecule acidic.

[What exactly are we talking about here? What is the conjugate base whose stability we discussed?]

In the cyclic molecule, the same thing applies. We again have a molecule which is represented by resonating structures.But the speciality is that it has six pi electrons and is cyclic.In other words, by Huckel's rule we find that the cyclopentadiene anion is aromatic. Aromaticity is a better stabilizing factor than simple resonance. Hence the cyclopentadiene molecule is the more acidic than the straight chain molecule. Remember that the comparison could be made only because they are similar molecules.

What is the smallest aromatic species? 
Is penta-1,4-diene hydrolyzed by water? Is cyclopentadiene hydrolyzed by water? How do you relate these observations to what we just discussed above?

===Additional Questions===
====Nucleophillicity and basicity====
Proton is a lewis acid.It's also an electrophile. Consider hydroxide ions- OH-(- indicates negative charge) They are nucleophiles. They are Lewis bases as well.What property makes them nucleophiles and what property makes them bases? Still another question: Give an example of a strong base but a weak nucleophile. What gives the molecule these characteristics?

====A corrosive phenol====
Which phenol has a boiling point of 132 to 134 degree Celsius and is corrosive in nature? Dark orange in colour?

====Answers====
====A little variation====
What if the linear chain is hex-1,5-diene? Does aromaticity still dominate?
====Answers====

{{BookCat}}
If it's linear it cannot be aromatic, although it can still contain a delocalised p-system.</text>

      <comment>/* Quadrupole */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Tensors are useful in all physical situations that involve complicated dependence on directions. Here, we consider one such example, the multipole expansion of the potential of a charge distribution.

==Introduction==
Consider an arbitrary charge distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r}')&lt;/math&gt;. We wish to find the electrostatic potential due to this charge distribution at a given point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;. We assume that this point is at a large distance from the charge distribution, that is if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt; varies over the charge distribution, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&gt;&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the coulomb potential for a charge distribution is given by &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{V'}\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|}dV'&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|=|r^2-2\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{r}'+r'^2|^{\frac{1}{2}}=r\left|1-2\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}{r}+\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^2\right|^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}} \triangleq  \mathbf{r}/r &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt;, we can write &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|}=\frac{1}{r}\frac{1}{\left|1-2\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}{r}+\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^2\right|^{\frac{1}{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;, and using the binomial expansion,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\left|1-2\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}{r}+\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^2\right|^{\frac{1}{2}}}=1-\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}{r}+\frac{1}{2r^2}\left(3(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'\right)^2-r'^2)+O\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt; (we neglect the third and higher order terms).

==The multipole expansion==
Thus, the potential can be written as &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\left(1-\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}{r}+\frac{1}{2r^2}\left(3(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'\right)^2-r'^2)+O\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^3\right)dV'&lt;/math&gt;

We write this as &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=V_{\text{mon}}(\mathbf{r})+V_{\text{dip}}(\mathbf{r})+V_{\text{quad}}(\mathbf{r})+\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, where,

&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{mon}}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')dV'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{dip}}(\mathbf{r})=-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\left(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'\right)dV'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{quad}}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0r^3}\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\left(3\left(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'\right)^2-r'^2\right)dV'&lt;/math&gt;

and so on.

===Monopole===
Observe that &lt;math&gt;Q=\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')dV'&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, (actually the total charge in the distribution) and is called the electric monopole

===Dipole===
We can write &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{dip}}(\mathbf{r})=-\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\cdot\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\mathbf{r}'dV'&lt;/math&gt;

The vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\mathbf{r}'dV'&lt;/math&gt; is called the electric dipole. And its magnitude is called the dipole moment of the charge distribution. 

===Quadrupole===
Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt; be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as &lt;math&gt;(r_1,r_2,r_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,x_3)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}')^2=(r_ix_i)^2=r_ir_jx_ix_j&lt;/math&gt;

We define a '''dyad''' to be the tensor &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\left(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}\right)_{ij}=r_ir_j&lt;/math&gt;

Define the Quadrupole tensor as &lt;math&gt;T=\int_{V'}\rho(\mathbf{r}')\left(3(\mathbf{r}'\mathbf{r}')-\mathbf{I}r'^2\right)dV'&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we can write &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{qua}}&lt;/math&gt; as the tensor contraction &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{qua}}(\mathbf{r})=-\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^3}::T&lt;/math&gt;

== &quot;Inventing&quot; the op-amp inverting integrator ==

=== Current-to-voltage C integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step1_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A humble capacitor can act as an ideal current-to-voltage integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What is the most elementary electrical integrator? Of course, this is the humble capacitor. So, if we drive a capacitor C by a constant current source I, it acts as an ideal current-to-voltage integrator with a current input I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and a voltage output V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that the output voltage changes linearly through the time.

[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step1 Keeping a constant current by using an ideal current source]


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Voltage-to-voltage RC integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step2_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;V-to-I converter + I-to-V integrator = V-to-V integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, we need usually an integrator with voltage input and voltage output (voltage-to-voltage integrator). For this purpose, we can build a compound voltage integrator just connecting a voltage-to-current converter (a resistor) before the integrator:

''V-to-I converter + I-to-V integrator = V-to-V integrator''


Only, a problem arises here - the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; across the capacitor C &quot;enervates&quot; the input voltage thus decreasing the input current. As a result, the output voltage changes exponentially through the time.

[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step3 Keeping a constant current by depreciating the load]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Integrator_step2_microlab_1000.jpg|left|thumb|370px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the passive RC integrator by ''Microlab''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Integrator_step2_screen_1000.jpg|right|thumb|390px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the passive RC integrator by ''Microlab'' (a waveform).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Active RC integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step3_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A remedy: connect an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage source that adds as much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the capacitor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Remember what we do in real life when an obstacle stands in our way - we remove it by an equivalent useful &quot;antidisturbance&quot;. Following this recipe, we may remove the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; by an &quot;antivoltage&quot; -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. That means to connect an additional varying voltage source and to make its voltage equal to -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; disappears and the upper point becomes a virtual ground! The compound current source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;,R is &quot;fooled&quot;: it doesn't &quot;understand&quot; that there is a capacitor connected; it &quot;thinks&quot; that its output is shorted.

[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step6 Keeping a constant current by adding an additional voltage]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Integrator_step3a_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Only, where to take an output from?&lt;/center&gt;]]

But where to take an output from? We have three possibilities.

First, we might use the old output; but we have already destroyed this voltage!

Second, we may use the &quot;original&quot; voltage as an output. It is possible but bad solution to connect the load across the capacitor for two reasons: the load has to have a differential output; the load will shunt the capacitor thus affecting the current.

Finally, we can use the &quot;copy&quot; voltage as an output! What a great idea! First, the load will be connected to the common ground; second, it will consume energy from the supplementary source instead from the input one!

[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/build_integrator.html Building an op-amp inverting integrator] - go to step 3

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Op-amp inverting RC integrator ===

Finally, we have only to replace the varying voltage source with a real one. Now the op-amp doses the voltage of the power supply thus producing a compensating voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, the combination of an op-amp and a steady battery acts as a varying voltage source.

[[Image:Integrator_step4_whiteboard_1000.jpg|center|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;In the circuit of an op-amp inverting integrator the op-amp adds compensating voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; to the input voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The op-amp &quot;observes&quot; the potential of the virtual ground (the difference between the two voltages) and changes instantly its output voltage so that this point to stay always at zero volts. Doing that, the op-amp compensates the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage drop across the capacitor by copying and adding it to the voltage of the input source; doing that, the op-amp &quot;helps&quot; the input source.

[[Image:Ideal_capacitor_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The &quot;imperfect&quot; capacitor has become an ideal infinite one.&lt;/center&gt;]]

It's time to make conclusions. What have we actually done here? How does it operate? What is the final result?

The answer is amazing: we have made a &quot;botomless&quot; capacitor having infinite capacitance. Looking from the side of the input source this &quot;ideal&quot; capacitor acts just... as a piece of wire...?!? What do you think about this speculation? Is it always right?

We are already true magicians as we can transform any imperfect component into an almost ideal one! In this lab, we have transmuted the &quot;imperfect&quot; capacitor into a perfect infinite one  having no any voltage drop across it although a current flows continuously through it! But with the same success we can make an ideal diode, zero resistance, etc... For this purpose, we just incorporate a varying battery to the imperfect component that compensate the losses inside the component. Remember: all the op-amp inverting circuits exploit this clever trick. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:50, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

For this purpose, the op-amp adds so much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the capacitor. The properly supplied op-amp acts as a compensating voltage source connected in series to the capacitor and the input voltage source.'''

This idea may be generalized for all the op-amp inverting circuits with parallel negative feedback (e.g., Inverting amplifier, Summing amplifier, Differentiator, Logarithmic output, Exponential output from this page). In all these circuits the op-amp compensates the voltage drop across the element connected between the output and the inverting input by adding the same voltage to the input voltage as it loses across this element. See also [[Circuit Idea/Voltage Compensation|Voltage Compensation]] module.

:Two reasons why this has been removed:
:# This is a non-standard explanation (whilst it's true, I've never seen it described like this).
:# Even if it were true, it applies to all negative-feedback topologies, so it's unnecessary to add this detail to purely the integrator and differentiator.

::'''The page.''' Let's first see what happens if someone curious web reader wants to understand what an op-amp integrator is. Of course, he/she will write [http://www.google.bg/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22op-amp+integrator%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g2&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai= &quot;op-amp integrator&quot;] in the Google window and will see [[Wikipedia:Operational amplifier applications|this Wikipedia page]] at the first place from all these 100000 pages. The visitor trusts to Wikipedia, chooses [[Wikipedia:Operational amplifier applications#Integrator|Integrator]] from the contents and begins reading. Now answer me frankly: Will the visitor understand what this circuit does, what is the great basic idea behind it, how it operates, if there is some connection with the passive RC version, with what purpose an op-amp is added to the passive version, what the op-amp actually does in this active version, why the circuit is inverting...? Unfortunately, the visitor will not get answers to these questions from this page... For now, he/she will learn that &quot;the integrator integrates the (inverted) signal over time&quot;, will learn the expression and will come to know that the circuit has a lot of problems... The situation with the rest of the sections is similar. In this state, the page looks like a chapter of a cookbook. But, if you please, Wikipedia is not a cookbook...

::'''The sections.''' It is obvious that every section of this page dedicated to one of these legendary op-amp applications, has to say some words about the ''purpose'' (what it does), the ''basic idea'' behind circuit (how it is implemented), the ''expression'', the ''operation'' (how it does what it does), the ''imperfections'' (problems) and the ''applications''. Of course, some of these parts may be omited, depending on the specific circuits but the basic idea has to be shown in the beginning.

::'''The [[Circuit Idea/Voltage Compensation|voltage compensation]] idea.''' This idea is extremely simple and I vonder why &quot;you've never seen it described like this&quot;. I met this powerful idea in the end of 70s (see the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/Voltage Compensation|talk page]]) but I realized it only in the early 1990s. Thereafter I make my students realize and use it to build &quot;ideal&quot; devices (circuits): [[Talk:Circuit_Idea/How_to_Make_Perfect_Components#Lab_4:_How_to_make_perfect_components_by_parallel_NFB|diodes]], [[Circuit_Idea/Group_67a#Lab_5A:_Building_the_op-amp_inverting_integrator_.28student.27s_version:.29|capacitors]], etc. But it is not only an &quot;electrical&quot; idea; you may see the ''compensation idea'' everywhere around you in this world. During our life, we, human beings, continously compensate harmful quantities by useful ones; as a result we obtain zero result (virtual ground). You may see this phenomenon even here, in Wikipedia: when some vandal removes valuable text (a harmful action), we return the same text (an equivalent useful action) and the result is zero (a virtual ground). 

::'''The integrator.''' Well, let's see this idea in the op-amp integrator (see also [[Circuit Idea/How to Make a Perfect RC-integrator|How to Make a Perfect RC-integrator]], [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/integrator/op-amp_rc_integrator.htm How do we build an op-amp RC integrator?] and [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/build_integrator.html Building an op-amp inverting integrator]). What is the problem of the simple passive RC integrator? The voltage across the capacitor is the problem as it is subtracted from the input voltage; it &quot;enervates&quot; the input voltage source. So, this voltage is harmful and we have to compensate it. For this purpose, we connect an additional voltage source (the output of a properly supplied op-amp) in series to the capacitor and make the op-amp adjust its output voltage so that it is always equal to the voltage across the capacitor. Actually, this voltage adds to the input voltage and thus compensates the voltage across the capacitor. Let's consider the signs traveling along the circuit of four elements and beginning from the ground. If the input voltage is positive and constant, the output voltage is negative; the two voltage sources are connected in series in the same direction (-Uin+, -Uout+). You may think of this combination as of a compound voltage source (Vin + Vout) that passes a constant current through the resistor that does not depend on the voltage across the capacitor...

::''(to be continued)'' [[Wikipedia:User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[Wikipedia:User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 20:54, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

::: The properties of all of the negative-feedback examples can be trivially derived by standard circuit analysis and the added constraint that V- = V+.  At most, we should present the standard analysis, not this non-standard explanation that &quot;the op-amp compensates for the voltage drop&quot;.  [[Wikipedia:User:Oli Filth|Oli Filth]]&lt;sup&gt;([[Wikipedia:User talk:Oli Filth|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Wikipedia:Special:Contributions/Oli_Filth|contribs]])&lt;/sup&gt; 21:30, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

::::Well, let's now move in electronics area. I know that most people (including circuit designers as well) use ready-made circuit solutions from op-amp applications handbooks. But they frequently do not find human-friendly explanations there as producers are not interested to reveal circuit ideas; instead, they are interested to advertise their wares. Then, the reader is most likely to visit this Wikipedia page in the hope of understanding the circuit idea and he/she will be thankful to get answers to all the questions above.

The '''kilogram''' or '''kilogramme''' (old BE), or '''kilo''', abbreviated '''kg''', is a unit of weight. It is equal to 1000 [[Cookbook:g|g]] or 2⅕ (2.2) [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]s. One [[Cookbook:L|liter]] of pure water weighs one kilogram. As many recipes have been approximately converted from one system to another, a similarly approximate conversion back may yield the original recipe.

==Note==
*Although sometimes disregarded, especially by Anglophones, the rules of the Société Internationale (SI), state that metric abbreviations, except M for Mega or Million to distinguish from m for mili or thousandth, should never be capitalized. It should always be written &quot;kg&quot;, never &quot;Kg&quot;, since writing Kg literally means 1,024 grams, just as kb and Kb mean 1,000 bits and 1,024 bits, respectfully. Grams and should always be written g, never G. The only exception is 'Litre' which may be abbreviated as L instead of l in the US, Canada and Australia.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GRE}}
We all know that some questions arise in our mind, just the way they arise in everyone. I thought if we made a collection of some general questions and the answers, it would give you all a head start. I will keep updating the questions. Kindly email me at the group, or personally at yamanoor@yahoo.com for clarifications. 


== I would like to know about the GRE Test pattern. Where do I get the info? ==

We suggest you not to go to any arbitrary sites for information. The ETS in the USA administers the GRE, and their official site is http://www.gre.org/ is the place to go for all information which is official. So we suggest that as a start you can go to their website and gather information, maybe download the free bulletin, or order a copy, and so on and so forth. If you have any doubts, you can either email them or contact us. ETS takes time to reply, so maybe Gresuccess is a good place to start.


== I have been hearing from people that the GRE Pattern is changing. Is it? ==
 

The only people who can confirm this for you, as usual, are ETS who run the test. So, please refer to the previous website and find out. A word of caution, before you verify the information, please do not tell others that a change in the pattern is a possibility. The same goes for everything, do not spread any news without confirmation. That way, the rumor stops with you. 


== How does the GRE CAT work? What's the deal with hard and easy questions? Is there a way to find out which question is hard and which one is easy? ==


Some of the CDs or books might indicate certain questions to be hard/easy, however, only ETS knows how they judge this. In theory yes, you will get a moderate question, and then easy/hard questions scaled accordingly. However, there have been instances where it has been the other extremes as well - easy/hard questions in the beginning, and the test then scales up or down later. The process is supposed to be random, so be prepared for randomness.
 
The best advice is, do not read too much into the rules of play, because you could be taking an experimental section, where ETS would be following, new, unannounced guidelines, and a lack of preparedness for this might put off your mood.
 
Take each question as it comes and answer it to the best of your abilities. 


== Should I go to classes for GRE Preparation? ==


It is the belief at gresuccess that your success in GRE is based mostly on your innate abilities, superimposed with training and acquiring test - taking skills, none of which need any classes. This is a validated belief. We do think that you will not gain much through sitting in a class, and also that, you will only lose money in the process. Even in the case of serious learning disabilities, we are quite confident that spending money on commercial agencies can be avoided. So, if you write to us and ask the question, you will always get the same answer! Make your own plan and prepare for yourself. We can help you make a plan, point you to materials etc. So don't worry help, free and trustable help is available, just to save you from wasting your (and your parents') valuable money and time. 


== I want to book my GRE date. How do I know if a particular date is available? Is there a website I can use? ==


Don't depend on any other resource than ETS for this. Assuming you are applying from India, call ETS New Delhi.

== If I present the group with my scores and grades, can you come up with that one magical list of schools where I will surely get an admit? ==
 

There are hundreds of US Universities. Also, their requirements, the programs they present, your requirements, your qualifications, your financial situation, the financial outlook of studying in such schools and several other such factors need to be looked up to decide on what schools to apply. It is not an easy job, and there is no magic formula. Maybe there are other groups, and some &quot;agents&quot; who present you with an instant list, but you may rest assured that these formulas don't work. Usually such schools are &quot;too safe&quot; meaning, they are below your standards, and so there is some guarantee for admissions.
 
Anyway the long and short of the story is that no one can present you with an instantaneous list. So what we do in this group is to encourage you to take a look at the schools yourself. Yes, we agree, it is tiresome, but wouldn't it be the same for us, if we tried it for you? No pain, means no gain. And then, you will miss out on actually looking at what different schools have to offer you, and why some schools are not appropriate for you and vice versa. You might also find some surprising matches. So please go ahead, look at the schools, then come to us with a short list of probables. We have years of experience pooled in amongst us, with which we can comment on what schools would be appropriate to apply to. That's why I have even tried to initiate a mentorship program. Maybe, on the surface this might look a bit complicated. But let me tell you, it is not. And, you can write to us when you get at specific problems when you are searching and looking up schools and we will try to help you.

#AGRE. How important is it?

Few universities specifically preferred students who score really well in it. AGRE definitely increases you chances and if your field of interest matches with the university, then you are all set. (Sri Harsha)

Some Visa Questions Answered.

1. Q: Regarding the photos on the visa application form,  should it be  50mm x 50mm or 37mmx37mm? As, in the application I downloaded from consulate website it is given as 50mm x 50mm but earlier when I applied I took 37mm x37mm. Which one is the correct one and how many would I need?
 
A: Follow the one stated in the web site. As they change regulations every now and then and hence you don't know how the forms might look this time around, carry a small pair of scissors to make any alterations at the consulate if necessary. Also I don't think that they are way to particular bout the dimensions of the photo as I used a photo with a dark background instead of the normal light background but again you never can predict these folks. The best thing wud be for u to carry copies in both sizes...just to be extra sure. Good Luck! 
Bipin

2. I have an issue with filling the DS 156 form. I am asked to provide the address of the place where I will stay. What do I do? Do I mention the address of someone known to me? Mention the address of the Department? 

A: If you have already taken care of your housing in the University area (on/off campus), just get the address details and mention the same. If not, then you may want to give the address of somebody where you would stay in the future. If neither of the above is possible, just give the address of your department. It doesn't hurt. 

I think I gave my department address as I didn't know where I would be staying. All my other friends did the same. And it is more official to give your dept. address. Goodluck. Sri Harsha

Add: You may also provide the address (with or without Care Of) of the International Center/Office of your University. 

3. I am arranging my FD in my name worth 1.5 times 1 year expenses only in June Ist week. I have some questions:

3.1) Will the VO be worried that the FD was created in my name very recently?
3.2) Should I show the FD receipt at all? Or just a bank certificate saying that I have FD's worth so much?

Replies:

SriHarsha: This is something tricky about the visa...

Few VO's prefer bank statements than FDs. That too of your parents. FDs are the second priority. FD on student's name gives the VO a chance to ask more questions or many inquiries about the money matters which we are, in general, not aware of. In my case, I by hearted well before. But sometimes it doesn't matter at all. He may never ask you. Whatever you do, make sure everything is legal. 

Deepak: I hate to gate-crash your party. But I got rejected for providing 1.5 times the cash of what was mentioned in the I-20. The officer wanted for 2 years.
 
Of course these things are very time dependent and vary from person to person. But, I still thought it is better to let you know. 
 
Safe bet, since you are doing it, might as well try 2X instead if 1.5X (X = amount of money mentioned for one annual year in the I-20). 
 
All this goes for only a Masters program.

Srihari: 1. You are running a small risk there. It is a common practice for people to have money transferred to their names in a short while when preparing for visa, so the VOs are used to it, but you should not be judgemental of their reaction, and caution is better.
 
2. That is a pretty good idea. Have the bank statement, and in case they ask, carry the FD deposits. Make it as less shady a deal as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GRE}}
You need to have concise goals in terms of attending a particular school. Many people assume admissions to be a lottery - a game of chance, where you apply to 6 or 8 schools and wish to gain the admission (the lottery). 
 
Once you obtain the admission, you have to deal with the problem of : why go to this school, is this school good, is it worth the expense and so on...
 
I am not saying this to offend you. Remember, application is a process of setting the path to achieve the goals in the next stage of your life. Doing things blindly, without objective thought will affect you gravely later, at a date, when you introspect and retrospect.
 
Please assume the following questions:
 
1. Why exactly did I join UG? Mostly because of your parents or peer pressure, but at least then, you would have formed a goal for yourself.
 
2. Why exactly do I want to go for graduate studies? Sometimes, the answer is as simple as &quot;My girl friend is there&quot;. There is absolutely nothing wrong. But be honest. Have an answer. It doesn't have to be ideal. It almost never is!
 
3. What kind of program do I want to be in?
 
4. What do I wish to do after I complete the program?
 
5. What type of schools do I aspire to study in?
 
6. What will I do if I had to go for low - ball schools? Nothing wrong here. But since a lot of people ask this of themselves after admission, it is worth asking, before application.
 
7. What will I do if I get a 100% rejection rate? Life is real. Life is hard. Deal with it.
 
8. Why am I here? -- Okay, I made that up, but ask all the important questions you would ask, as early as possible. Sometimes you may find a MS in a branch of engineering or science itself was not for you!

1. Is there any advantage of having 1.5 yrs of exp ? or should i have more? (Somebody told me that if anyone has more than 2yrs of exp he'll get some additional scores).
 
That is not true. There are no such standard criteria. Moreover, if you apply now, you will be working for over 2.5 years by the time you  get an admit. These are the kinds of myths that you don't want to entertain. So, any work experience for any length of time will add to your strengths. 

2. How difficult is the process from- getting the GRE score to- start going to college. Is it possible for a person who's employed to handle the situations without help of any external agencies, like coaching center's ? 
 
YES! It most definitely is possible. However, you will need to approach the application process in a timely, professional manner and work out a detailed plan of action. Do be prepared to take a total of 1 - 2 weeks off over the course of a few months to take care of GRE preparation, the actual tests, obtaining reference letters, transcripts etc. Moreover, there are no high quality coaching centers and training programs that can actually do this for you in a professional way.



1. If I am working, or about to start work before applying, what is an ideal time to take the TOEFL exam?

A gre score is valid for 5 years and toefl score for 2 years. I
suppose most people take up gre/toefl in the final year. If some of
you are planning to work for more than a year, you should retake
toefl.

Its better to take toefl as close as possible to the admission year.

1. Can anyone please tell me what is a &quot;security code &quot; of a credit card ?

Flip your card to the back side, the side that contains the magnetic strip. You will see a bunch of numbers therein. The last three numbers are usually your security code. 

In case your service regards a different set of numbers as the security code, they will say so on the website. Watch out clearly for instructions. Usually, there will be a small hyperlink underlined by blue next to the question on security code that says &quot;What's this?&quot; Click on it to find out what exactly the particular website assumes to be the security code. 

If in confusion, contact the webmaster, or us, or someone else who knows and uses credit cards regularly.

A '''deciliter''', abbreviated '''dl''' (or sometimes 'dL' only in the US, Canada and Australia), is one tenth of a [[Cookbook:Liter|liter]], or 100 [[Cookbook:mL|mililiters]]. One deciliter is equal to a little more than 0.4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]; a rough conversion of 1/2 cup per deciliter will work in many cases.</text>

== Appropriate/legal use? ... ==

I have several binders full of professors notes and explanations on such engineering/physics/mathematics topics as Continuum Mechanics or Intermediate Fluid Mechanics. These notes are likely complete enough to make the core of a wikibook. They are hand written notes for each class's lecture. As far as I can tell they were never copyrighted or published. On the other hand, they are not my works...

Is transcribing this material to wiki appropriate, ethical, and legal use of the unpublished works my professors handed out?

Drew
:Unfortunately class notes are a tricky subject. My current understanding is that a transcript of the class is copyrighted to the professor if there was prior fixation (which is almost always the case); class notes (though not necessarily exact transcripts) would fall under the same umbrella. Even though the student took notes, they do not own the copyright on them, since they are a derivative work of the original work of the professor. That said, notes ''can'' (and should) serve as an excellent resource for deciding upon the structure, scope etc of a textbook, so they are of course not useless. I would invite you to contribute in that way instead. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 10 September 2008 (UTC)


::Hmmm... by your reply I don't think I explained my material clearly. The notes were written by the prof. These hand written explanations were photo copied by the prof and distributed in class. They were never formed into a &quot;published&quot; work (in the sense of a textbook sold for a often hefty profit). But even with this clarification, my guess is your reply will be nearly the same, since they would then be an original work of the professor. That is unfortunate since it precludes a quick win for wikibooks. Thanks for the quick reply! 
::Drew
:::Unfortunately, that doesn't change anything. The prof has ''clearly'' fixated the work then, and owns the copyright. If they choose to give it out that doesn't mean they have relinquished the copyright. Barring a statement that the work is GFDL-licensed (or otherwise GFDL-compatible), it would violate [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] to include it here. Again, the work can guide you in creating original work though. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:57, 10 September 2008 (UTC)
== Poem Tags for Code Listings ==

I expect that I am the very ''last'' person to realise this, but the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags aren't too bad for code listings, even with long code lines; i.e. Wikitext.

On the three browsers that I have quickly tried, IE6. Firefox 2.? and Opera 9 the tags preserve newline preformats but the extra space between words, ect, is still Wiki parsed.   However, long lines are automatically wrapped, and that is good for coding.   The poem tags can be styled and because of their cross browser functioning might be a good basis for a code-listing template.   Or is that something else in the best kept secret department?   Does one already exist?

For better punctuation spacing however, I might still have to wait until there is browser compatibility for 'pre-wrap'.  (See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Prewrap '''Template:Prewrap'''] of the same name, where such a template's use with the white-space's pre-wrap value would come close to word-processor behaviour).   

The poem tags produce left-aligned page-default listings. Does anybody know where the style details can be found for these tags?    Regards to all, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 11:01, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

: You might find the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag useful. As for the poem tag [[mw:Extension:Poem|Extension:Poem]] might help. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:26, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

::Hello, thanks for the input, the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags do wrap long lines though its preformatting is a bit basic.

== Page Hit Data ==

I've just been alerted to a project that compiles page hit statistics based on the squid log data for the Wikimedia server farm. Here is a link that should refresh daily/monthly:

http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikibooks/en/

The previous page hit counter data that we were using was statistical in nature and was activated with javascript. These statistics come directly from the raw server logs, so they should be more accurate in some respects (but there are still a few problems worth being aware of). Check this link to see how en.wikibooks compares to other wikis:

http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/

According to this, we get about 430,000 page hits ''per day'' on average, which makes us the 28th most viewed wiki in the WMF. In June we were actually higher with 451,000 hits per day average, and 27th overall. See also the main page for more information, more months worth of records, and FAQs:

http://wikistics.falsikon.de

== Wikibooks Blog ==

For anybody who doesn't know, I operate a blog dedicated to news about Wikibooks:

http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/

In addition to &quot;big&quot; news stories, I've been trying to post lots of small vignettes highlighting some of our active books and editors. I tend to compile these from observations I made on our RC feed. Unfortunately, this means if people edit books when I'm not looking, they won't get featured.

I'm looking for a two things:
# People to tell me about cool projects or active editors that I miss
# Volunteers who would be interested in writing news and updates for the blog (either by submission to me, or by becoming an editor to the blog itself)

This blog is aggregated in a few places, notably planet Wikimedia and a few other open-education aggregators that I've seen. Comment volume is relatively low (read: zero) right now, but I hope we will be able to attract more interest from readers in the future. Let me know if anybody is interested in helping out. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:47, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

== Fundamentals of Physics ==

Hello Wikians,

I have started a book called Fundamentals of Physics, which is based on a book with a same title ( http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&amp;itemId=0471320005&amp;bcsId=1074 ). It will have same chapters like the original but with text written by wikians and image created by fellow wikian as well.

Can this book be deleted because it uses a borrowed tile and chapter headings? I am willing to spend lot of work to bring content of a excellent book to the open world ( the content will not be a exact copy). Could some one sue me of following the original books structure?

Regards

[[User:A.K.Karthikeyan | A.K.Karthikeyan]]

:As you say, the current book should be deleted. The book would need to be non-copyright work or work that the original authors have released fully.  

:A study guide is very suitable for Wikibooks and already exists as [[Physics Study Guide]].  There are also [[Introduction to Physical Science]], [[FHSST_Physics]] and the [[Modern Physics]] set of books.  There is always room for another physics book but it is possible that someone will merge it with another book if this seems like an objective decision and is supported by other Wikibookians. 

:If you can see how your book would fit in to the current range it would be much less likely to suffer the charge of plagiarism because it would be defensible as an inevitable completion of the jigsaw of Wikibooks' coverage of physics.

== Spanish - English Dictionary for Beginners ==

Hello. At [[s:Wikisource:Proposed deletions/Archives/2008-09#Spanish - English Dictionary for Beginners]], something potentially useful for this project (which I've not familiar with) was deleted. A blurb of it is quoted below;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Much work has gone into this dictionary and hopefully the reader will find it useful. The dictionary is mainly intended for English speakers needing an online dictionary for Spanish, but will hardly be fit to use as a definitive source on the Spanish Language. The dictionary is lacking many important words. Right now it contains 19,500 entries, less than 14,000 words, and many duplicates and unnecessary technical terms. There are almost no reflexive verbs, nor are local variations included. The listings are alphabetized according to the English alphabet. Readers looking for los calzones will find that calzones cannot be found before hitting la calle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== How to link to audio files? ==

Now that is an easy question, right? OK, I've used this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Listen|filename=Air (Bach).ogg|title=Y|description=Z|format=[[Ogg]]}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Listen|filename=Air (Bach).ogg|title=Y|description=Z|format=[[Ogg]]}}
and was quite happy with it, ''except'' that you cannot play audio files right from the page with this, instead your browser has to know what to do with .ogg files. Thus, on WikiMedia Commons you often see these grey bars with the blue play button to play audio files. To get this grey bars I'm now using:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Listen|filename=Air (Bach).ogg|title=Y|description=Z [[Image:Air (Bach).ogg|180px|noicon]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Listen|filename=Air (Bach).ogg|title=Y|description=Z [[Image:Air (Bach).ogg|180px|noicon]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Is this OK? Is there any template that already includes this grey button?
--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:23, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

:No template, that grey button is the default behavior when you type &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Air (Bach).ogg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;:
:[[Image:Air (Bach).ogg]]
:With that tag, you can create your own template to do what you want. Let us know if you need any more help then that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:14, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">* An error was discovered in this Wikibook. A previous entry stated that 'mg' is the abbreviation for 'microgram'.  Although the risk of a microgram ever occurring in a recipe is almost non-existent, the seriousness of this error cannot be overstated. If it were to be made in a pharmaceutical or medical setting, it could result in serious injury or death.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: christian → Christian using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Visual Story Network had a conference September 16 through September 18.  The gathering was made up of influential Christian media creators and missionaries who came for encouragement and inspiration for the soul purpose of uniting together. 

The Visual Story Network is a coalition of missional and creative Christians working together to fuel a global movement of visual story for the kingdom of God. We live in a transitional time in the history of the Church. We believe a great opportunity exists to move beyond preach and print to portray. When God’s people consistently create and share visual stories in culturally compelling ways with every person on the earth so people can experience life-change through Jesus a movement will have occurred. We define visual story as combining narrative and visual media in communicating the message of Christ and His kingdom.

=== Intent ===
* To treat an integral constant as a type at compile-time.
* To achieve static call dispatch based on constant integral values.

=== Also Known As ===
Integral constant wrappers

=== Motivation ===
Function overloading in C++ is based on different types, which prevents compile-time integral constants taking part into function overload resolution. There are at least two different mechanisms to perform static dispatching based on integral constants. First is [[More C++ Idioms/enable-if|enable-if]] idiom and the other one is the int-to-type idiom described below.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
A simple template, initially described in [http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403750 Dr. Dobb's Journal] by Andrei Alexandrescu provides a solution to this idiom.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;int I&gt;
struct Int2Type
{
  enum { value = I };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The above template creates different types for different integer values used to instantiate the template. For example, ''Int2Type&lt;5&gt;'' is a different type from ''Int2Type&lt;10&gt;''. Moreover, the integral parameter is saved in the associated constant ''value''. As each integral constant results in a different type, this simple template can be used for static dispatching based on integral constants as shown below.

Consider an ''Array'' class that encapsulates a fixed size array very similar to that of the standard array class from TR1. In fact, our Array class is implemented as a derived class of the standard TR1 array class with the only difference of a ''sort'' function. 

We intend to dispatch sort function at compile-time based on the size of the array to achieve some performance optimizations. For example, sorting an array of size zero or one should be a no-op. Similarly, arrays smaller than size 50 should be sorted using the insertion-sort algorithm whereas as larger arrays should be sorted using the quick-sort algorithm because insertion-sort algorithm is often more efficient than quick-sort algorithm for small data size. Note that, this selection of the sorting algorithm can be trivially done using run-time ''if'' condition. However, int-to-type idiom is used to achieve the same effect at compile-time as shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;tr1/array&gt;

template &lt;int I&gt;
struct Int2Type
{
  enum { value = I };
};

template &lt;class T, unsigned int N&gt;
class Array : public std::tr1::array &lt;T, N&gt;
{
   enum AlgoType { NOOP, INSERTION_SORT, QUICK_SORT };
   static const int algo = (N==0) ? NOOP : 
                           (N==1) ? NOOP :
			   (N&lt;50) ? INSERTION_SORT : QUICK_SORT;
   void sort (Int2Type&lt;NOOP&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;NOOP\n&quot;; }
   void sort (Int2Type&lt;INSERTION_SORT&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;INSERTION_SORT\n&quot;; }
   void sort (Int2Type&lt;QUICK_SORT&gt;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;QUICK_SORT\n&quot;; }
 public:
   void sort()
   {
     sort (Int2Type&lt;algo&gt;());
   }
};
int main(void)
{
  Array&lt;int, 1&gt; a;
  a.sort(); // No-op!
  Array&lt;int, 400&gt; b;
  b.sort(); // Quick sort  
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Few more associated types and constants can be defined with ''Int2Type'' template to increase its usability. For example, enumeration ''value'' is used to retrieve the integer constant associated with the type. Finally, other typedefs such as, ''next'' and ''previous'' are used to find other types ''in order'' such that ''Int2Type&lt;7&gt;::next'' is the same type as ''Int2Type&lt;9&gt;::previous''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;int I&gt;
struct Int2Type
{
  enum { value = I };
  typedef int value_type;
  typedef Int2Type&lt;I&gt; type;
  typedef Int2Type&lt;I+1&gt; next;
  typedef Int2Type&lt;I-1&gt; previous;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Any substance that flows is called a fluid. In other words fluids cannot undergo sheering or tensile stress. This chapter is dedicated to studying about the behavior (mechanism) of fluids. Fluid mechanism is a vital science and is used in hydraulic engineering, aviation etc. There are two major branches in fluid mechanics, namely, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;fluid statics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which is the study of fluid in a stationary state and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;fluid dynamics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which is the study of fluid when its flowing, like what happens when water flows? So lets dive into fluid mechanics.

Fluids are readily able to flow because their intermolecular forces are comparatively week at room temperatures. Fluids do not have any specific shape and take the shape of the container into which they are filled. Fluids like air has no definite shape and are extreamely turbulent.

==Pressure==
[[Image:Fop15-2.svg|400px|thumb|right|Fig 15-1 Schematic of device used to measure pressure under fluid]]
All fluids exert a force on any substance that's immersed in them. This is called pressure. Pressure compresses any object that is immeresed in a fluid. Pressure in a fluid can be measured using a device as shown in figure 15-1. This device consists of a evacuated cylinder witha tight fitting piston. The piston's inward movement into the cylinder is resisted by the spring.

When the cylinder is immersed in the water, force acts upon the piston and pushes it inside the cylinder. If we had calibrated the spring properly, we could tell how much pressure is exerted on the piston by measuring its position in the cylinder.

Lets see how to calculate pressure. Mathematically pressure is equal to the force exerted on a object  per unit area. That is

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac {F}{A}  N/m^2&lt;/math&gt;

So lets say that radius od the piston is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; meters, then pressure is

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac {F}{\pi r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Let say the piston has moved inward about a distance of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; meters from its normal position. Then the force on piston is equal to

&lt;math&gt; F = K x &lt;/math&gt;

Where K is a constant. Hence pressure is

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac {Kx}{\pi r^2}   N/m^2&lt;/math&gt;

The unit of force is Newtons (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) and unit for area is meter-square (&lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;). Pressure is force per unit area and hence has the unit Newton per meter-square (&lt;math&gt;N/m^2&lt;/math&gt;). In honor of the great mathematician Blaise Pascal, pressure is called Pascal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using Wikibooks.com and Facebook.com as tools in an interactive society is a great way of connecting people with similar interests, not only all over the country, but all over the world. Using them in the classroom creates a new availability for student and teacher communication. Assignments that are online bring a convenience to the student because of the accessibility of being able to study or contribute at home or wherever they may choose. These networks creates a new way of communicating, far different from cell phones, business meetings, or even email. With tools such as these you can search people, things, subjects, and groups that you want or are interested in. You can become members of different networks that are interested in the same things as you such as an art group or a Christian Music group. You can also connect with old classmates, or friends from a long time ago. It is a great way to emerge yourself in the ever growing Interactive Media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Australia’s Social and Cultural History in the Post-War Period==

==1960s Decade Study==
===Introduction===
The 1960s were a time of great social change in Australian Society. New ideas of the way modern families should live, as well as an influx of culture from other countries helped shape the way Australians lived. The major cultural changes can be seen across the fields of fashion, entertainment, sport and technology. This section will explain and analyse what effect these changes had on Australian society.

===Fashion===
The 1960s are known to be the decade in which fashion changed from being simple and conservative to carefree and relaxed. This reflected a change in social and political ideology, as the role of women in society slowly began to be challenged. London was one of the major influences on the changing fashions in the early 1960s, and Carnaby Street, … is popularly referenced as being the beating heart of the “Swinging Sixties”.
‘Mod’ fashions reached the height of their popularity in the 1960s. ‘Mods’ were young men who rode on mopeds, wore tailored clothing, and played Jazz music. The ‘Mod’ movement died out after a riot on Brighton beach between the ‘Mods’ and ‘Rockers’. After the riots had long ended, fashion designers in London gave the word a whole new meaning. By 1965, ‘Mod’ fashions, which included miniskirts and hotpants, were being worn across the entire world.
The miniskirt rapidly gained popularity in Australia after the British Supermodel Jean Shrimpton wore one to the Melbourne Cup Carnival in 1965. Many people were shocked by the dress that ended well above her knees and in editorials all around Australia people were writing in to express their disgust. By the end of the 1960s however, people all over Australia were wearing miniskirts and shift dresses. 
The Hippie Movement also began just as miniskirts were becoming more widely accepted. The movement tried to shift from the current western fashion ideas, to try and embrace clothing made from natural fabrics dyed with bright colours. Clothing from India and Africa were also popular among the Hippies. Hippies also enjoyed listening to a variety of different music.

===Music and Entertainment===
In the 1960s the major forms of entertainment were television, movies and listening to the radio. 
The introduction of television in the late 1950s and 1960s greatly decreased the audience of radio programs, and radio was forced to pursue new angles to try and keep listeners. The invention of smaller transistors and car radios is one of the major reasons radio did not die out completely. Younger people began using the radio to listen to the hits of their favourite artists, and it wasn’t until the 1980s, when music videos started appearing on television, that the younger generations began turning away from the radio.
The Rock and Roll phenomenon hit Australia in the 1950’s and 1960s. Dance parties were extremely popular where dances like the twist, the stomp and the boogaloo were often performed. This was greatly helped along by some of the major rock bands from Britain and America touring Australia. Although tickets were not often cheap, teenagers and adults alike would queue for hours to see the likes of The Beach boys, The Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. 

In the early 1960s, Folk music artists like Bob Dylan were pushing the message of social change through their music. Unlike pop music, people listened to the lyrics of folk rather than just dancing along. Bob Dylan, however, did not stay in the folk genre for long, and by 1964 was singing more rock-orientated songs. Although this greatly increased his popularity, his social messages were often lost.
In 1963, a man from the slums in Detroit, Berry Gordon quit his job on the assembly line, to become one of the biggest players in the music industry. With a meagre loan of $800, he started up his own record company in Detroit. His success came from signing African American artists who were not only popular with the black population, but were also rapidly gaining respect with white audiences. This new genre of music was named after Berry’s record company ‘Motown’.

===Sport===
Australia enjoyed much international sporting success in the 1960s. Although our population is tiny compared to countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, Australia dominated in tennis, swimming and boxing.

Margaret Court, arguably Australia’s best tennis player ever, is a great example of this domination. She won 72 major titles, including 12 Australian Opens, and is one of only three women to complete the famous Grand Slam. It was her prowess, that later inspired other Australians like Evonne Goolagong and Pat Cash to become world-beaters in tennis.

Australia is known for being a top performer in the Olympics, particularly swimming, and athletes like Dawn Fraser have helped secure this title. Over three Olympic games, she won eight medals, which included four gold. Other great Olympians during the 1960s include Murray Rose and Betty Cuthbert.

The football codes also took some major steps in the 1960s. At the beginning of the decade, there were very few professional players. Television allowed the broadcast of games, and this increased fan awareness about their teams’ performance. This in turn increased gate attendance and soon advertising and sponsorship deals were on the horizon.

Australia’s sporting success was driving the image of a fit and healthy country. This however was not the case, as many critics like to point out. The opening of the first fast food franchises in 1968 and the sale of increasingly fattier and oilier foods greatly increased the rates of obesity.   The popularity of cigarettes was also rapidly on the rise throughout the decade, and with it came an increase in smoking-related diseases.

===Technology===
There were many technological advance in the 1960s. New ways of living saw the invention of countless gizmos and appliances to help people with their modern lifestyles. Some of these inventions also improved already existing inventions like television and radio.
With the expansion to the suburbs, people needed fast and reliable ways to travel into the city. Two car families were becoming exceedingly common, and motoring car companies like ford and Chrysler also had factories in Australia. This provided many Australians with jobs, as well as reducing the price of cars as they no longer needed to be shipped from around the world.
In 1959, the jet-powered engine was invented.  Jet power greatly increased the speed of aircraft, as well as allowing them to stay in the air for prolonged periods of time. By the 1960s, fewer people were travelling overseas by ship, instead opting to fly in airplanes. This was understandable, as it took 6 weeks to travel to England by ship, whereas by plane it took 25 hours.
Household appliances were also greatly improved in the 1960s. At the end of World War II, there was a manufacturing boom, which made products more affordable and accessible.     The idea of a housewife was also beginning to catch on, and women were encouraged to stay home and use all the new appliances that were meant to make their day easier.

===British Influence on Popular Culture===
The British rock sensation ‘The Beatles’ left a lasting impression on all countries they toured. When they toured Australia in 1964, what could only be described as “Beatlemania” occurred. Australian Teenagers from across the entire country wanting to imitate their idols, mimicked their dress and hairstyles, and the latest Beatle hits could always be heard on the radio or gramophone.
The Rolling Stones had a similar affect on the Australian population as The Beatles, although widely different in not only their style of dress. Their lyrics were often thought to be too suggestive and were censored, yet Australia still loved them.

===American Influence on Popular Culture===
During the 1960s, American culture could easily be found in music, cinema and radio. It was the globalisation of the world that greatly increased the availability of these forms of media to the general population of Australia.
Although Australia has always had a small but well respected film industry, from the 1960s onwards, it has struggled to compete against the American Film Industry. Not only did Hollywood have superior equipment and resources, but the high budgets could always pay for the best actors and directors.
The first twenty years of Australian television consisted almost completely of American and British TV shows. The commercial stations tended to use American comedies and dramas, while the ABC tried to model itself on its big brother the BBC, and a large percentage of its broadcasts was made up of British programs. To try and stop this from completely destroying the Australian television industry, the Australian Government imposed restrictions on how much American and British content commercial stations could broadcast.
In the 1960s, new American style supermarkets and fast food joints began taking shape all over Australia. At first, they were mainly located in the major built up centres, but soon they began spreading into the suburbs. This would have also had a major effect on the shopping and eating habits of many Australians.

===Conclusion===
In Conclusion, as you can see, Australian Society changed dramatically in the 1960s. American culture had a massive impact on Australians and the way the lived their daily lives. It would have been an interesting period to grow up in due to the changes in values and ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My question is in regards to the &quot;octet rule&quot;. I understand the part about taking and giving electrons in order to satisfy the 8 required electrons on the outer shell. My question is, will the inner shell always contain 2 electrons?
:Each orbital completes in turn. So you will not start having electrons in the p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; orbital until the s orbital is complete with two electrons. Hydrogen is the only atom with 1 electron in its inner shell, and it will form molecules to complete its s shell quite vigorously. So yes, the inmost shell will, in every molecule, contain 2 electrons. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:50, 16 May 2011 (UTC)

== What level is this article aimed at? ==

Clearly a relatively hgih level since it talks about s and p orbitals. However, statements such as &quot;Hydrogen and helium have only one electron shell&quot; are somewhat jejune -- it's only correct in the sense that hydrogen and helium commonly only fill the 1s shell. It's perfectly possible that an electron will sit in a 2s, 2p, 3d, 20g.... level in a hydrogen atom; these are just high energy states. Atoms simply do not possess shells in the sense suggested.

The article has a rather nebulous sense of stability. The Na7-/Cl7+ vs Na+ and Cl- in particular. There's no inherent stabilisation energy associated with an atom obtaining a full shell (or subshell), only that certain processes occur spontaneously giving out energy (ΔG&lt;0). In the example one should compare the electron affinities and ionisation energies of Na and Cl.

The octet rule is clearly a useful rule of thumb but not an explanation.</text>

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_2_450.jpg|right|thumb|230px|&lt;center&gt;The idea behind Wilson current mirror&lt;/center&gt;]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;


== The two aspects of the Wilson current mirror ==

We may consider the behavior of Wilson current mirror from two aspects. From one hand, when we vary the input quantities (the input voltage, the resistance R or actually, the input current), a current mirror behaves as a ''current follower''. In this case we have considered in the [[Circuit Idea/How the Wilson current mirror equalizes the currents|previous story]], it is important the output current to follow exactly the input current. From the other hand, if we vary the output quantities (the supply voltage, the load resistance or voltage), the current mirror behaves as a ''constant current source''. In this case, it is important the circuit to keep up a steady current. Well, let's discuss the second aspect here.

== The second problem of the simple current mirror ==

[[Image:Bjt_current_mirror_out_iv_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. Superimposed IV curves of the output part of the simple current mirror.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The [[Circuit Idea/How to Reverse Current Direction#An output part|output part]] of the simple BJT current mirror exploits the basic property of the bipolar transistor to behave as a ''current-stable resistor'' if we keep up steady its base voltage or current. Actually, in combination with the power supply, the transistor constitutes a current source or sink. How does the transistor do this magic? If, for example, the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; varies, the transistor changes its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; between the collector and the emitter so that to keep up a constant total resistance R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = const (Fig. 1).

Only, due to Earley effect, the output part does not behave as a perfect current source; this is the second imperfection of the simple current mirror that we have to improve now.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Making the transistor keep a constant current by negative feedback: ==

[[Image:How_to_introduce_ser_nfb_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. How to make a transistor keep a constant current.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We can make the output transistor keep up a constant current by applying various clever &quot;tricks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm Reinventing constant current source] reveals the philosophy behind constant current sources.&lt;/ref&gt; but [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step8 negative feedback] is the more reliable of them. Then, how do we introduce such a &quot;current-keeping&quot; negative feedback in the simple transistor stage? Let's begin thinking...

We have a transistor that controls the current through the load by changing its present resistance between the collector and the emitter... What does it mean to introduce a &quot;current-keeping&quot; negative feedback? What does have to happen if the current tries to change because of R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; variations? Obviously, if the load current tries to increase, the transistor has to close more (to increase its present collector-emitter resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) so that to restore the previous magnitude of the current. And v.v., if the load current tries to decrease, the transistor has to open more (to decrease its present collector-emitter resistance) - Fig. 2. For simplicity, let's consider only the first case (the load current increases) from now on.

In order to make the transistor do this magic, we have to close the negative feedback loop from the output circuit where the load current flows to the transistor input. What is the transistor input? The base-emitter junction (gate-drain part) serves as a differential voltage input; but, regarding to the ground, the transistor has two single-ended voltage inputs - the emitter and the base. So, we might introduce two kinds of negative feedbacks by applying a voltage that is proportional to the load current to the emitter and to the base.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== ...driving the transistor from the emitter... ===

[[Image:Trans_ser_nfb_idea_450.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3 Introducing a series negative feedback by an I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_ser_nfb_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. A resistor acting as an I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

First, we may fix the base voltage and to drive the transistor from the emitter. For this purpose, we connect a reference voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; to the base and a current-to-voltage converter in the emitter producing a voltage proportional to the load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 3).

A bare resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; can serve as a simple current-to-voltage converter  (Fig. 4). Since the output quantity (the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Re&lt;/sub&gt;) is applied in series to the input quantity (the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;) this popular technique for keeping up a constant current is named ''series negative feedback'' or &quot;emitter degeneration&quot;.

Only, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Re&lt;/sub&gt; limits the maximum voltage drop across the load (the so called ''voltage appliance''). What do we do then?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== ...driving the transistor from the base ===

==== General idea ====

But don't you think that, with the same success, we may fix the emitter voltage and drive the transistor from the base? Let's try it! Maybe, it will lead us to the desired Wilson current mirror... In order to impelement this idea, we need again an element that produces a voltage proportional to the load current, i.e. ''current-to-voltage converter''. But now the current flows in one place (the emitter) while the voltage has to be applied to other place (the base)! So, we need not a bare &quot;resistance&quot; ''I-to-V converter''; we need a kind of &quot;transresistance&quot; ''I-to-V converter''. How do we make it? How have Wilson solved this problem?

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_1_450.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Keeping up a constant current by driving the transistor from the base.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_2_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Copying the load current by a current mirror to the desired place...&lt;/center&gt;]]

Eureka! We may &quot;copy&quot; the load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to the desired place where to pass it through a resistor, in order to create a voltage drop proportional to I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 5). Then let's do it! For this purpose, we connect an I-to-V converter in the emitter that drives a reverse V-to-I converter. As you can see, the direct and the reversed converter constitute actually the well-known simple current mirror. It produces a &quot;copy&quot; of I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; that flows through a conventional resistive I-to-V converter connected to the base (Fig. 6). In this way, by means of a current mirror and a current-to-voltage converter we apply again a current-keeping negative feedback.

'''''The Wilson current mirror consists of a simple current mirror and a current-to-voltage converter connected in the feedback loop.'''''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Implementation ====

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. Building a genuine Wilson current source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

As [[#...driving the transistor from the emitter...|above]], a bare resistor R can act as a simplest current-to-voltage converter (Fig. 7). Actually, it serves as the emitter &quot;degeneration&quot; resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; from Fig. 4. Only, here not the &quot;original&quot; load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; flows through the resistor R but a &quot;copy&quot;  I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of this current. The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R or, more strictly speaking, its ''supplemental to V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; voltage'' is the input voltage for the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Operation ====

In order to ascertain if this odd circuit behaves as a constant current source, we have somehow to &quot;provoke&quot; it and to see its reaction to our &quot;intervention&quot;. Well, how may we &quot;provoke&quot; it?  Let's for instance, investigate how the circuit will react if we change the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In the beginning, suppose equal currents I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; flow through the two circuit legs what is normal circuit condition.

If we increase R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tries to decrease. This current is the input quantity of the simple current mirror T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so, its output quantity I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; decreases also. As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; decreases and its supplement V&lt;sub&gt;CE2&lt;/sub&gt; increases. The input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt; of the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases; it begins opening more until the load current restores its previous magnitude.

What does the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; actually keep? It keeps up a constant base-emitter voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;. If we look at this circuit as a negative feedback stabilizer, V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; is its input reference quantity and the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; keeps constant this quantity. Doing that, it keeps actually a constant voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the steady resistor R; so, the current I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are constant too.

==== How many feedbacks are there? ====

The most [[#Resources|resources]] about Wilson current mirror do not notice any feedback in the circuit. Some of them&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~mleach/ece3050/su06/notes/bjtmirrsu06.pdf Current mirrors] shows how Wilson current mirror keeps up an almost constant output current. It is interesting the author prefers to say &quot;positive&quot; instead &quot;negative&quot; feedback.&lt;/ref&gt; have noticed two positive feedbacks, other&lt;ref&gt;[http://richpc1.ba.infn.it/~atauro/politecnico/ICSE2004/articoli/studio_wilson_feedback.pdf Understanding Wilson current mirror via the negative feedback approach] shows the presence of two negative feedbacks.&lt;/ref&gt;  - two negative ones. But actually there are as many as three negative feedbacks in this sophisticated circuit! Let's try to see them.

'''1. A local feedback''' - the wire between the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector and its base. It reverses T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; making it act as a ''logarithmic current-to-voltage converter'' instead as an ''antilogarithmic voltage-to-current converter'' what is inherent for BJT&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/How to Reverse Current Direction|How to Reverse Current Direction]] is our story about the simple BJT current mirror.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a ''parallel constant-voltage keeping negative feedback''.

'''2. A more global feedback''' - the whole active diode (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + the wire between its collector and the base) that is connected in the T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'s emitter. This is a ''series constant-current keeping feedback'' (an emitter degeneration). Only, it is negligible for keeping the constant current because the active diode behaves as a voltage-stable element (significant current variations cause insignificant voltage changes).

'''3. A global negative feedback''' - it is constituted by the simple current mirror (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the resistor R acting as a simple current-to-voltage converter. It is the important negative feedback that keeps the current constant; we have already discussed it above.

Then, how do we introduce such a &quot;current-keeping&quot; negative feedback in the simple transistor stage? Let's begin thinking...

We have a transistor that controls the current through the load by changing its present resistance between the collector and the emitter... What does it mean to introduce a &quot;current-keeping&quot; negative feedback? What does have to happen if the current tries to change because of R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; variations? Obviously, if the load current tries to increase, the transistor has to close more (to increase its present collector-emitter resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) so that to restore the previous magnitude of the current. And v.v., if the load current tries to decrease, the transistor has to open more (to decrease its present collector-emitter resistance) - Fig. 2. For simplicity, let's consider only the first case (the load current increases) from now on.

In order to make the transistor do this magic, we have to close the negative feedback loop from the output circuit where the load current flows to the transistor input. The base-emitter junction (gate-drain part) serves as a differential voltage input; but, regarding to the ground, the transistor has two single-ended voltage inputs - the emitter and the base. So, we might introduce two kinds of negative feedbacks by applying a voltage that is proportional to the load current to the emitter and to the base.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...driving the transistor from the emitter... ====

[[Image:Trans_ser_nfb_idea_450.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3 Introducing a series negative feedback by an I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_ser_nfb_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. A resistor acting as an I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

First, we may fix the base voltage and to drive the transistor from the emitter. For this purpose, we connect a reference voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt; to the base and a current-to-voltage converter in the emitter producing a voltage proportional to the load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 3).

A bare resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; can serve as a simple current-to-voltage converter  (Fig. 4). Since the output quantity (the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Re&lt;/sub&gt;) is applied in series to the input quantity (the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;) this popular technique for keeping up a constant current is named ''series negative feedback'' or &quot;emitter degeneration&quot;.

Only, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Re&lt;/sub&gt; limits the maximum voltage drop across the load (the so called ''voltage appliance''). What do we do then?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...driving the transistor from the base ====

==== General idea ====

But don't you think that, with the same success, we may fix the emitter voltage and drive the transistor from the base? Let's try it! Maybe, it will lead us to the desired Wilson current mirror... In order to impelement this idea, we need again an element that produces a voltage proportional to the load current, i.e. ''current-to-voltage converter''. But now the current flows in one place (the emitter) while the voltage has to be applied to other place (the base)! So, we need not a bare &quot;resistance&quot; ''I-to-V converter''; we need a kind of &quot;transresistance&quot; ''I-to-V converter''. How do we make it? How have Wilson solved this problem?

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_1_450.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Keeping up a constant current by driving the transistor from the base.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_2_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Copying the load current by a current mirror to the desired place...&lt;/center&gt;]]

Eureka! We may &quot;copy&quot; the load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to the desired place where to pass it through a resistor, in order to create a voltage drop proportional to I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 5). Then let's do it! For this purpose, we connect an I-to-V converter in the emitter that drives a reverse V-to-I converter. As you can see, the direct and the reversed converter constitute actually the well-known simple current mirror. It produces a &quot;copy&quot; of I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; that flows through a conventional resistive I-to-V converter connected to the base (Fig. 6). In this way, by means of a current mirror and a current-to-voltage converter we apply again a current-keeping negative feedback.

'''''The Wilson current mirror consists of a simple current mirror and a current-to-voltage converter connected in the feedback loop.'''''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

===== Implementation =====

[[Image:Wilson_current_source_3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. Building a genuine Wilson current source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

As [[#...driving the transistor from the emitter...|above]], a bare resistor R can act as a simplest current-to-voltage converter (Fig. 7). Actually, it serves as the emitter &quot;degeneration&quot; resistor R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; from Fig. 4. Only, here not the &quot;original&quot; load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; flows through the resistor R but a &quot;copy&quot;  I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of this current. The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R or, more strictly speaking, its ''supplemental to V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; voltage'' is the input voltage for the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

===== Operation =====

Let's investigate how the circuit will react if we change the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In the beginning, suppose equal currents I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; flow through the two circuit legs.

If we increase R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tries to decrease. This current is the input quantity of the simple current mirror T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so, its output quantity I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; decreases also. As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; decreases and its supplement V&lt;sub&gt;CE2&lt;/sub&gt; increases. The input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE3&lt;/sub&gt; of the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases; it begins opening more until the load current restores its previous magnitude.

What does the transistopr T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; actually keep? It keeps up a constant base-emitter voltage V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;. If we look at this circuit as a negative feedback stabilizer, V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; is its input reference quantity and the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; keeps constant this quantity. Doing that, it keeps actually a constant voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the steady resistor R; so, the current I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are constant too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often, we want to measure the well being of a group of economic agents, who engage with each other. Often, such engagements occur within the bounds of a country or nation. Therefore, macroeconomics is usually concerned with economies of countries as a whole. How do we measure well being? Economists have tried to relate wealth to well being. Some correlation between wealth and well being does seem to exist, the relationship is not clear and not definite. However, macroeconomics is concerned with the measurement of wealth because it is easier to measure. It is assumed, that well being will be related to wealth. 

Macroeconomics also deals with aggregates, and not individuals. Therefore, in order to understand the economy, we need to define the quantities we will be interested in. To begin with, let us look at the markets that are studied in macroeconomics. 

* Market of current goods and services
* Market for future goods and services
* Market for factor inputs
* Market for finance

Each of these markets is an aggregate of smaller markets. For example, under the market of goods and services, there will be smaller markets for various industries. 

After defining the markets, we move to measuring the aggregate income. Aggregate income is related (in fact is equal to) the aggregate goods and services produced. This measure is the GDP. More about this in the next chapter which deals specifically about measuring aggregate output.

You have been the victim of empty rumors. You can take the GRE as many times as you want. ETS will report your 3 latest scores and it is up to the school to decide which GRE score to take. 

Many schools in the US will have their own algorithms and methods. The only way to find out is by asking graduate admissions of specific schools directly. They may or may not tell you of their policies. 

If they do not tell you about their policy - which is what they should do - you have no way of knowing which score is taken. 

Why? 

In the US, people like to take the tests one - two times or more. For example, kids routinely take the SATs multiple times.  

In any case, if you are able to tell us the names of the forums where you heard this shocking nonsense about second attempts, it would be very helpful to warn future aspirants of such forums. 

Coming back to you in specific, if you feel the GRE score you received does not reflect your expectations based on your innate intelligence and test-taking skills (watch the careful wording there, its not your fault, its the test's! - that's how you believe in yourself and sell yourself), you are welcome to take it again and we would like to help you as much as we can.

Question: I have a scheduled exam on 1st September. I want it to be rescheduled to  late October or early November this year? possible?(dates)
How? (need exact steps and links as i didnt find the exact page in the prometric site to do the same)

Answer: 

go to ets.org
&gt;gre
&gt;register for a gre test
&gt;gre general test
&gt;online registeration( credit card only)
&gt;select gre general test from the pull down menu
&gt;select the country and location from the other pull down menus
&gt; reschudule or cancel an exam
&gt;it asks for the conformation/ tracking number (which you can find it from the conformation mail that you must have received earlier) and the first four letters of your last name after entering you will be directed to the calender page displaying available dates and sessions from which you can choose.after this the credit card formalities follow....hope this is useful
{{subject|GRE/Rescheduling_your_GRE_Exam}}

The above process may cause problems to a few. So you can directly follow the link below:
https://securereg3.prometric.com/RescheduleOrCancel.aspx?resch=

It will say session expired. But will show you a link which you can directly click and proceed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==To Do==
*Fill in missing letters/Change foods
*Make a navigation system
*Make the front page more decorative
*choose new pics for front page.

== Choices ==

You might want to choose some different foods.  'Eggplant' could be replaced with something that is understood by ALL English speakers (the international English word for 'eggplant' is aubergine) - for example 'egg'?  Similarly zucchini isn't readily understoof outside of the USA or Italy and I have no idea what a popsicle or Quesadilla is!!  The word 'jelly' is very misleading, Oreos (I believe) is a trademark.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:32, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

:Isn't Xató a rather a récherché choice – and doesn't the picture illustrate the salad that often accompanies the xató (which is a sauce), rather than the xató itself? (Umeboshi and Varenikia are a bit obscure, too, and the jam picture is rather misleading as it appears to show a jar of strawberries.) I also agree with the comment above about zucchini: in the UK they are more usually known as courgettes. [[User:SiGarb|SiGarb]] ([[User talk:SiGarb|talk]]) 18:33, 15 January 2010 (UTC)

:Aubergine is listed by Wikipedia as the British English version, unless you consider British English to be the &quot;proper&quot; version of English.  Seriously, if someone is from the US and writes a book, it's likely going to be from a US perspective.  Americans aren't going to be aware of these problems you mention.  Take &quot;chips&quot;, I know that has a different definition in Britain than in the US; at least we're not using that here.  Same as Flower Alphabet, this book was originally made by [[User:Xxagile|Xxagile]] who undoubtedly is from the US.  I'm sure &quot;hot dog&quot; for H will be unfamiliar to someone as well.  Quesadilla is Mexican cuisine that has become popular in the US as well.  May as well move this to American Food Alphabet or make changes yourself because Xxagile is no longer active here. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:43, 15 January 2010 (UTC)

::And what about my examples: Xató, Umeboshi, Varenika? Are they common items on US dinner tables? [[User:SiGarb|SiGarb]] ([[User talk:SiGarb|talk]]) 22:30, 16 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

''These problems are on the difficult or, to put it differently if not mildly, non-standard type. Try to work the problems without the hints because most times, you might have a different approach or way of thinking about a problem. Use the hints only if you are truly stuck! Without further ado, here are the problems:''

# Prove that the function, f(x) = 1/x is not uniformly continuous on the interval (0,&amp;infin;).
# Prove that a convex function is continuous &lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;Recall that a function &lt;math&gt;f: (a,b) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''convex function'' if for all &lt;math&gt;x,y \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;s,t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s+t = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(sx+ty) \leq sf(x)+tf(y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;
# Prove that every continuous function ''f'' which maps [0,1] into itself has at least one fixed point, that is &lt;math&gt;\exists p \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(p) = p&lt;/math&gt;
# Prove that the space of continuous functions on an interval has the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a monotone function, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y \in [a,b]; x \leq y \Rightarrow f(x) \leq f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Prove that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has countably many points of discontinuity.
# Let &lt;math&gt;f:(a,b) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable function, and suppose there is some positive constant &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f'(x)|\le K&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.  (a) Prove that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Lipschitz continuous on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; (Hint: Use the mean value theorem).  (b) Show that every function which is Lipschitz continuous is also uniformly continuous (and therefore the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; you are working with is uniformly continuous).

#No Hint.
# You may want to prove first that the region above a convex function is convex (i.e. any straight line joining two points in the region, lies wholly in the region) and then using this fact argue by way of contradiction to show that convex functions are indeed continuous (i.e. no jump or removable discontinuity)
# Consider the function &lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(x) - x&lt;/math&gt;. Using the Intermediate Value Property, show that &lt;math&gt;\exists p&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h(p) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# First show that the set of all infinite sequences of real numbers has the same cardinality as &lt;math&gt;

{{User:PoizonMyst/Template:ChapterStub}}&lt;br /&gt;

{{drop|A}}derivative of ''neo-'' (from the Ancient Greek prefix ''νεο-'', meaning &quot;new&quot;) and ''pagan'' (from the Latin ''pāgānus'', meaning &quot;country dweller, rustic&quot;), '''Neopaganism''' is a broad term used to describe several modern spiritual movements that are influenced by ancient philosophies and cultures, in particular traditional nature-based customs and polytheistic or pantheistic beliefs of pre-Christian Europe. Neopaganism is distinguished as the modern revival or reconstruction of classical Paganism, although both terms are often used interchangeably.

While early Christian missionaries first focused their efforts on establishing the Christian Church in major urban centres of the Roman Empire, people of the outlying rural regions continued to revere the cycles of nature and their associated spiritual deities.  As such, &quot;country dweller&quot;, or &quot;pagan&quot;, soon pertained to someone who was simply &quot;not a Christian.&quot; Ultimately, Christian political propaganda presented &quot;paganism&quot; as a derogatory expression pertaining to sinful hedonistic practises (from the Ancient Greek ''hēdonē'', meaning &quot;pleasure&quot;). Similarly, the Old Norse and Germanic Pagans, known as ''heathens'' (Old English translation of the Old High German ''heide'', meaning &quot;heath, heathland&quot;), became yet another term eventually distorted to be regarded as unfavourable. 

Today Neopagans worldwide are proudly reclaiming the original definitions of &quot;Pagan&quot; and &quot;Heathen&quot; to identify their nature-based spiritual practises and beliefs.

      <comment>/* There are TWO &quot;thirs law&quot;s of thermodynamics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== There are '''TWO''' &quot;thirs law&quot;s of thermodynamics ==
before 2006 all refrences stated that:
::&quot;The second law suggests the existence of an absolute temperature scale that includes an absolute zero of temperature. The third law of thermodynamics states that absolute zero cannot be attained by any procedure in a finite number of steps. Absolute zero can be approached arbitrarily closely, but it can never be reached.&quot; (Source: Microsoft Encarta 2006, The multimedia Encyclopedia)
but then suddenly it changed to:
::&quot;In a perfect crystal at tempreture of absolute zero, Enthropy is zero&quot; (Source:Thermodynamics by Yunus A. Cenjel)

first one is sayd to be wrong, because in absolute zero the movement of molecules reaches to zero

The second one is not a rule. it is a definition. a rule is a positive/negative statement that untill now experiments have always happened according to it/have not happend otherwise. the second one can't be proved. but it's validation can be limited with a single experiment happening otherwise

:::I'm not sure how, but I'm sure there's some way that those two statements of the third law are equivalent (possibly because an implication of the second law is that it's impossible to reach a state where the entropy is zero, though this is merely guesswork). The second statement is more like a definition, you're correct; since we never know the absolute amount of entropy (or enthalpy or internal energy for that matter) something has, but if we define a standard state we can measure the quantities relative to the standard (and since they're state variables, it doesn't matter how we get from one state to the other).

This was tagged for speedy deletion by [[User talk:83.9.10.24|83.9.10.24]] but I don't think it fits that category so I listed it here. The reason for deletion was ''A made-up language without singificance comparable to Quenya or Esperanto.'' [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 20:52, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' Based on the edit history and sharing the same opinion of [[User:Mike.lifeguard]], that goes even further than OR. It's original creation, that is itself the subject of the book. We shouldn't mind self created content as a way to explain a subject but we shouldn't tolerate people making those creations the subject of the work, since there would be no way to categorize the quality, validity of such works. This puts it outside of '''Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works''' as it is defined on the actual police (the wording is bad but seems to have the intention to curb such projects). This would make a  good addition to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] proposal. On the other hand deletion as a primary outcome can be detrimental to gathering contributors, for instance a consensual, or time restricted move of the work to the user space would address any issues with the community (the other alternatives exist response has a weaker stand here).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:06, 23 July 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. This module has POV issues. I raise issue with the sentence &quot;In contrast to English, the words for socialist/anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations.&quot; As a socialist and a native English-speaker, I find no negative connotations in the English language's words for such left-wing politics. In fact, using language in such a way as to further one's political goals seems startlingly similar to the undeniably non-socialistic Newspeak of &quot;The Party&quot; (which, interestingly enough, also described itself as socialist) in Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. &lt;/rant&gt;

::I think that it is only badly stated by the author, I agree with the view that socialist anarchist and even communist aren't seen in the same context across the world, it depends on history (author), time frame (reader), location and level of education (both being able to see beyond the political propaganda).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:51, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Classification of living things=

In order to get a handle of the diversity of all living things, we give organisms names.
Names like cat, squirrel, tree, mushroom  and jellyfish.

These names used in everyday speech to describe an organism are called COMMON NAMES .

We also group different kinds of living organisms into groups:

*Domains
*Kingdoms
*Phylum (Division)
**	Subphylum
*Class
*Order
*Family
*Genus
*Species
**	subspecies

When we refer to  individual organisms, we use only the last two terms GENUS and SPECIES

This way of referring to organisms using two names is called BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE
and it was proposed by the Swedish Biologist Carolus Linnaeus in the mid 1700s

In Science, we prefer to use SCIENTIFIC NAMES (those using binomial nomenclature) to COMMON NAMES because common names change from place to place, but Scientific names are the same all over the world.

SCIENTIFIC NAMES are written in Latin
Since Latin is no longer spoken as a living language, it does not change.

For example you and I call ourselves HUMANS

Human is the common name for the organisms that we are.
Our scientific name is HOMO SAPIENS  

Our entire classification is 

*Domain 	EUKARYA
*Kingdom	ANIMALIA
*Superphylum 	DEUTEROSTOMIA
*Phylum	        CORDATA
*subphylum	VERTEBRATA
*Class		MAMMALIA
*subclass	PLACENTALIA
*Order		PRIMATES
*suborder	HAPLORRHINI    (dry nosed or simple nosed as opposed to wet/curved nose)
*Family		HOMINIDAE
*subfamily	HOMININAE	
*Genus		HOMO
*Species	SAPIENS
*Subspecies 	SAPIENS
*Classification changes as new discoveries are made , just as theories change.



When Linnaeus wrote down the first widely accepted system, there were two kingdoms
Animalia and plantae

Due to advances in genomics, we have been able to compare the genetic sequences of organisms  and have come up with new classifications largely due to the work of  Carl Woese
whose RNA comparison studies suggested that a new group ARCHAEA be separated from both Eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

The current preferred system is the 6 kingdom system.


'''ARCHAEA'''
	Single celled, non nucleated organisms with radically different genetic sequences. Most are extremophiles that grow in harsh places. An example are Halophites. Single celled organisms that grow in salty areas like the great salt lake where salt content is 15 - 20%.

'''BACTERIA'''
	Single celled, non nucleated organisms. They are common all throughout the Earth. An example is Escherichia coli an intestinal bacteria.

'''PROTISTA'''
	Single celled organisms that may be found in organized groups. These organism have a nucleus and internal organelles. An example of a protist is an Amoeba.

'''FUNGI'''
	Single or multicellular organism that eat by secreting digestive chemicals and absorbing nutrients. An example of a Fungus is a shitake mushroom.

'''PLANTAE'''
	Multicellular organisms that use light to create energy and sugar by a process called photosynthesis. An example of a plant is a dandilion.

'''ANIMALIA'''
	Multicelluar organisms that eat food internally. An example of an animal is a grasshopper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many who think of Quintia in terms of beauty,
but to me she is merely tall and golden white, erect,
and I admit each of these separate distinctions in her favour,
yet I object, deny, 
that the word &quot;beauty&quot; describes her person;
for she has no charm, not even a grain of salt in her whole body
to give you appetite --
now Lesbia has beauty, she is everything
that's handsome, glorious, 
and she has captured all that Venus has to offer
in ways of love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Renewal==
&quot; A trade-mark registration is valid for a period of 15 years and may be renewed indefinitely for subsequent 15-year periods unless it is voluntarily cancelled at the request of the registered owner expunged from the Trade-marks Register by the Trade-marks Opposition Board, a delegated body of the Registrar under s. 45 of the Trade-Marks Act, or the Federal Court.&quot; (Page 15-1, Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)

&quot;In order to maintain a trade-mark registration on the Trade-marks Register, the registration must be renewed within a period of 15 years from the day of registration or last renewal.  Pursuant to subs. 46(2) of the Trade-marks Act, the Registrar will issue a renewal notice to the registered owner and, where applicable, its representative for service.  Therefore, it is possible to renew a trade-mark registration upon the payment of the prescribed fee at any time prior to the expiry of a 15-year period.&quot; (Page 15-1, Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)

==Failure to renew==
&quot;The Registrar will expunge the registration of a trade-mark if it is not renewed as specified in the renewal notice within a six-month delay period after the end of the 15-year period and approximately a six-month grace period.  The deadline for the period of renewal cannot be extended and the Registrar, subject to a clerical error, has no statutory authority to do so.&quot; (Page 15-3 Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)

I assume that the presence of section numbers within the section headings is an artifact of the conversion and isn't wanted in the Wikibook version, and I'll go ahead and manually remove them, since they look ugly in the table of contents on each page - the auto-numbering combines with the manual numbering to leave it double-numbered. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 20:04, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

Allen Downey indicates that this book is a substantially modified (one would assume, improved) version of the original [[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2nd Edition|How to think like a computer scientist]], which is also in Wikibooks. I don't know if the second edition of the latter added any material that isn't included in ''Think Python'', but either way I don't think they should be two separate books in Wikibooks. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 07:44, 27 September 2010 (UTC)
:It would be shame to lose the stuff on linked lists and trees from the end of How to Think Like a Computer Scientist which have not made it across to Think Python. [[User:Liberacy|Liberacy]] ([[User talk:Liberacy|talk]]) 14:56, 15 November 2010 (UTC)
::It wouldn't need to be lost. I would suggest merging the books would be the best course of action. We don't have enough maintainers as it is, without having two largely duplicate works to maintain. I see Adrignola deleted the merge marker, but without (AFAICT) giving a clear reason why the two books should continue to coexist.--[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 11:57, 19 November 2010 (UTC)
::FWIW, I'm about the only person to have put any effort into this book in the last year or so. I can't be bothered to spend time maintaining a duplicate book. We have enough books that are in dire need of input without wasting time maintaining parallel copies. If someone else wants to do the work, good luck to them. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 18:44, 24 February 2011 (UTC)

I agree that [[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2nd Edition]] (originally based on [http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/index.html &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python: 2nd Edition&quot;]) should be merged into [[Think Python]] (originally based on [http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ &quot;Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot;]).

As far as I can tell, the original book by Allen B. Downey et. al. had somehow already [[WB:FORK]]ed elsewhere before each of those two forks were independently copied into Wikibooks.

I think there is easily room for 3 books on any particular programming language at Wikibooks, aimed at 3 different target audiences.
However, I am skeptical that there really is over a dozen distinct target audiences that need a over a dozen different books on [[Python]] at Wikibooks --
and as far as I can tell, [[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2nd Edition]] and [[Think Python]] have practically the same audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Expungement/non-use proceedings are considered to be a quick and expeditious method of clearing from the Register trade-marks that are no longer in use.  Unlike applications by a registered owner to amend, expungement/non-use proceedings are requests made by any &quot;person who pays the prescribed fee&quot; that the Registrar give notice to the registered owner of the trade-mark to furnish evidence of use of the trade-mark in Canada in association with each of the wares/services set out in the registration. Failure of the registered owner to file sufficient evidence may result in either the partial or complete expungement of the registration from the Register.  

Section 57 of the ''Trade-marks Act'' gives the Federal Court the exclusive jurisdiction to amend an entry in the Register when it &quot;does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of the mark&quot;.  Under s. 45 of the Trade-marks Act, the jurisdiction of the Registrar is limited to determining whether a registered owner's mark is being used in association with the wares or services in a general class.&quot; (Page 15-11 Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)

For 4/6 people

== Ingredients ==

'''Vegetables''', cleaned and cut into medium chunks:

'''Essential''':
*Cabbage - a whole medium sized cabbage
*Potatoes - 2 large
*Onions -  2 large
*Kohlrabi - 1 or 2 
*Chopped green Celery Leaves (Maltese ''krafes'')

'''Optional''':
*Pumpkin (ideally both red and yellow flesh kinds: ''qargħa hamra'' and ''qargħa Torka'') -  a large slice of each
*Cauliflower - half a medium cauliflower 
*Carrots - 3 or 4

'''Meats''':

Choose 1 or 2 of the following items:

*4  fresh Maltese Sausages left whole (Maltese sausages are made of ground lean and fat pork with garlic, parsley, salt, black peppercorns, coriander seeds)
*4 shoulder cut pork chops (ideally left attached in one piece and separated only after cooking)
*A 300 g piece of fresh belly pork OR the same of salt cured gammon or smoked bacon

'''Plus'''

*A pig's hock OR a pig trotter (not boned)
*1 or 2 tbsp. tomato paste
*Salt and Pepper
*A few sprigs of chopped flat leaf parsley
*Oil for frying the onion

== Procedure ==

Note: If using salt cured gammon, soak in cold water over night to remove the saltiness

# Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and in it scald the hock or trotter for 10 minutes
# Remove the hock or trotter, discard the water, refill with fresh water and bring to the boil again. 
#Place the hock or trotter in the boiling water with the other meats you are using, turn heat down and cook a few minutes skimming scum from the surface. 
#When there is no more scum forming remove the meats from the water, which you reserve, and add the meats to the pot with the vegetables prepared as below: 
# Soften and wilt the onion in the olive oil without letting it brown
# Add the diced vegetables and the celery leaves, season with salt and pepper, cover and sweat together on low heat for 5/6 minutes
# Add the tomato paste previously diluted with a little water
# Add the meats along with the bone-in hock or trotter
# Add some of the water in which you boiled the meats (the quantity depends on whether you want a one-dish stew or a two course meal, see below) and simmer over moderate low heat till the meats are tender
# Five minutes from the end of cooking time taste and adjust for seasoning, and add the chopped flat leaf parsley


== To Serve Kawlata ==

*As a one course meal - in this case you are aiming for a chunky stew, so you don't want to add too much liquid and you serve with crusty bread

*As a two course meal, in which case you will want enough liquid to serve a soupy first course. The meats you remove, slice if necessary and keep warm to serve alone or maybe with a little light tomato sauce. You can cook a small amount of rice in the vegetable soup if you wish though it is hardly necessary. 

It is not traditional to cook pasta in the soup, neither is it customary to grate cheese on top.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The AT91SAM7S64 is a noteworthy instance of the ARM processor architecture because of the availability of affordable prototyping hardware ([http://www.olimex.com/dev/sam7-h64.html 1], [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=475 2], [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=614 3], [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3784 4]) and of on-line tutorial information ([http://www.doctort.org/adam/nerd-notes/getting-started-with-the-olimex-sam7-p256.html 1], [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc6293.pdf 2]). There is an open-source [http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/%7Esteriana/Software/Sam_I_Am/index.html bootloader] for it as well.

Image of Olimex board at http://www.olimex.com/dev/images/ARM/ATMEL/SAM7-Hxxx-1.jpg

There are a number of interesting projects documented for this controller ([http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/arm_projects/index_at91.html 1], 2).

This page is intended to be a getting-started guide for experimenting with an affordable SAM7 board. The cheapest I can find is the [http://www.olimex.com/dev/sam7-h64.html Olimex header board], but it lacks debugging conveniences found on the [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=475 development board]. Some other SAM7 experimentation pages on the web include:
* [http://embdev.net/articles/ARM_MP3/AAC_Player Andreas Schwarz's ARM-based MP3/AAC Player]
* http://www.triplespark.net/elec/pdev/arm/at91sam7.html
* [http://www.at91.com/forum/viewforum.php/f,15/ A discussion forum] with several threads about SAM7-based projects
* [https://github.com/wware/stuff/tree/master/sam7 My own humble efforts]

The chip has a lot of really interesting features. Atmel's web page describing the AT91SAM7S256 is quoted below.
:The AT91SAM7S256 is a low pincount Flash microcontroller based on the 32-bit ARM7TDMI RISC processor. It features 256K bytes of embedded high-speed Flash with sector lock capabilities and a security bit, and 64K bytes of SRAM. The integrated proprietary SAM-BA Boot Assistant enables in-system programming of the embedded Flash. 
:Its extensive peripheral set includes a USB 2.0 Full Speed Device Port, USARTs, SPI, SSC, TWI and an 8-channel 10-bit ADC. Its Peripheral DMA Controller channels eliminate processor bottlenecks during peripheral-to-memory transfers. Its System Controller manages interrupts, clocks, power, time, debug and reset, significantly reducing the external chip count and minimizing power consumption. 
:In industrial temperature, worse case conditions the maximum clock frequency is 55MHz. Typical core supply is 1.8V, I/Os are supplied at 1.8V or 3.3V and are 5V tolerant. An integrated Voltage Regulator permits single supply at 3.3V. The AT91SAM7S256 is supplied in a 64-lead LQFP or QFN Green package. It is supported by an Evaluation Board and extensive application development tools. 
:The AT91SAM7S256 is a general-purpose microcontroller, providing an ideal migration path for 8-bit applications requiring additional performance, USB connectivity and extended memory.
And it even runs [http://armpit.sourceforge.net/ Scheme].

== Categories for Computers &amp; Society ==

Hi!
Thanx for query/comment.
I figured out eventually the purpose of categorization for the Wikibooks.
It seems to me to be the way to find the subject on the page in the book.
Perhaps I have misunderstood and overdone it?
As your note implies?
--[[User:Mihal Orela|Михал Орела]] ([[User talk:Mihal Orela|talk]]) 06:15, 12 September 2008 (UTC)
:I think most of those categories will not be useful for finding books. We primarily use the [[WB:AS|Subject:]] pages for browsing now. Current practice is that all pages of a book should go in a single category which normally has the same name as the book itself; this is to help keep all the pages of the book together (like the binding of a book). The main page of the book is categorized by subject (like putting the book on a shelf in the library, this allows readers to find the book by it's content), and also by other methods, like the first letter of it's title (these methods are becoming increasingly superseded by the subject pages). So the categories you have created are not very helpful for anyone to find books on a certain topic, and are mostly creating unnecessary clutter. If you don't mind, I'd like to delete most of them, and re-categorize their contents to fit into the pre-existing system of organization. I should say that the confusion here is not your fault; we have very poor resources explaining how this sort of thing works at Wikibooks (which should not be the case, as it is very different from how Wikipedia is organized). Thanks for your quick response. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

==Capitalisation==
Tx for your message. Quick question when u get a chance - I read over [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy]] and the talk page, but still wasn't quite clear about capitalisation of Chapter Names. It seems perhaps it's user discretion, but that mostly Chapter Names are like Book/Chapter Name rather than Book/Chapter name. In which case, my inclination would be to make this change for the [[Outdoor Education]] chapters. -- [[User:Jtneill|Jtneill]] - &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Jtneill|Talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Jtneill|c]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:00, 16 September 2008 (UTC)
:Yeah, this falls to the discretion of whoever is working on the book. I normally prefer to have the title capitalized, and the rest only the first letter capitalized. This is probably because the papers I write follow this convention. But as I say, it is up to whoever is writing the book. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 16 September 2008 (UTC)

== Just a request ==

Hey Mike,
I'd like to request that my patroller and rollbacker flags be revoked; I don't feel right retaining them due to my inactivity. While I think this wiki is great, and I ''do'' have plans to become active once again in future, I think I should let these two not-used tools go for the time being. Since I believe we don't need Stewards to fill this request, i thought I'd just ask you if you could get around to it at some point. Cheers, and thanks for your assistance, - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:35, 19 September 2008 (UTC)

== Replacement of IP address in module history ==

Hi Mike, On 21st Sept I edited the page [[French_For_Football/Phrase_Book]] while accidentally logged out, leaving behind my IP address in the module history. Is it possible for someone to replace that with my Wikibooks login ID? I assume you can match them up easily enough. As you are active on the user renaming page, I came to you as this looks like a similar operation. I see you are away for a while, but I don't mind waiting.

Reading the transcript, I see that you went to the OKFN meeting yesterday. Too bad neither of us could participate in the whole thing! I'm keeping a list of resources at [[User:Whiteknight/Friends]] including some resources that were mentioned in the meeting.

I've already been through this before. This is a curriculum. It is for education use.  Read the beginning and that will be abundantly clear.  Please put it back. It is NOT a GAME STRATEGY guide. It IS a TEACHING TOOL for disadvantaged kids.

Hiya Mike,

I tried to do this with the &quot;move all subpages&quot; option, but way too many pages :-).

:Shouldn't be a problem to move subpages, as sysops have ''noratelimit''.

== About my tracker (music) contribution ==

Hello Mike.lifeguard,

Few days ago, I put a new link of my website on your tracker (music) webpage and you deleted it. (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:COIBot/XWiki/jikoo.free.fr). Ok, I understood my mistake. I can't put it on many wikipedia websites. Now, I have no link on wikipedia. I am not a spammer at all or other things. I made my webpage to help everybody about audio tracking. There are lot of updated links and no advertising, and few community (United-trackers, modplug forum, Amiga impact forum...) helped me to do it. So now, is it possible to put two links : one on your Wikipedia website and an other one on wikipedia FR (because I am french) ?

Note, I was only on wikipedia FR before I made a contribution for Wikipedia EN. I wrote the Modplug Tracker article in french on Wikipedia FR (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModPlug_Tracker)

Thank you very much.

      <comment>/* Eutectic solder */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Eutectic solder ==
The section on [[Practical_Electronics/Soldering#63.2F37|Eutectic Solder]], as currently written, is NOT nonsense.  ''Eutectic,'' in materials science terms, means that the combination of constituents in an alloy results in the lowest possible melting point, lower even than the melting points of the constituents in isolation.  Like any other alloy, eutectic solder can have a plastic, pasty state and can produce cold and fractured joints. [[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:03, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
:I've had a quick look around and there's several sources that agree with the page as it stands:
:*[http://www.toolingu.com/definition-660210-28760-eutectic-solder.html], [http://technologyinterface.nmsu.edu/spring97/electronics/solder/solder.html]
:*[[w:Solder|Wikipedia article]], which states that eutectic solder has a very well defined melting point rather than a range. This would imply to me (although I'm no materials scientist) that it should solidify instantly on falling below the melting point. The other sources explicitly state this.
:If the page is wrong, then this is a common misconception, but I've seen no sign of anyone refuting it. [[User:Inductiveload|Inductiveload]] ([[User talk:Inductiveload|talk]]) 06:52, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

::''I'm'' refuting it, as one who has studied materials science, among other subjects, in achieving a degree in electrical engineering. [[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:09, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

== Troubleshooting section needed ==
The usefulness of the module would be greatly improved by adding a section, with photos, covering cold joints, fractured joints, dry joints, excessive solder, insufficient solder, and the various other problems that novices are likely to encounter. [[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:12, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

== Incomprehensible external links ==
The following was added to ''External links'' by user DavidCary on 2010 August 27, 14:48 UTC:
* Have [http://www.pcbstandards.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-1967.html all MIL Standards been  replaced](Mil-Std-100, Mil-Std-275, [http://elsmar.com/Forums/archive/index.php/t-8902.html MIL-STD-2000], etc.) by [http://www.ipc.org/ IPC standards] such as [http://www.circuitrework.com/guides/7-1-3.shtml IPC 610 Class 3] ? 

It's an incomprehensible mish-mash, couched as a question, with bad typography.  Maybe DavidCary could take some time to sort it out before attempting to re-add it to the article. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;[[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:41, 26 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Special Treatment Situations in NSCLC'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Superior Sulcus Tumors==
*Arise in apex of lung and invade apical chest wall structures
*Classic description of Pancoast syndrome: &quot;pain in the eighth cervical and first and second thoracic trunk distribution, wasting of the muscles of the hand, and Horner's syndrome (Pancoast KH, JAMA 99:1391, 1932)
*Modern description: 1) shoulder pain, 2) sensory/motor deficits and wasting of muscles of the hand due to brachial plexus involvement, 3) Horner's syndrome due to [[w:Stellate_ganglion|stellate ganglion]] involvement, and 4) arm edema due to compression of blood vessels
*With improved radiographic imaging, any invasion of apical structures can be classified as Pancoast tumor, including ribs/periosteum, lower nerve roots of brachial plexus, sympathetic chain, or subclavian vessels. Pain radiating down the arm no longer required
*Work-up should be treated like for any other potentially resectable lung tumor, including surgical staging of the mediastinum
*Treatment with RT alone results in ~5% long-term survivors, although in series with potentially curable tumors, long-term survival is ~20%
*Pre-op RT followed by resection results in 5-year survival ~30%, but R0 resection can be typically achieved in only 2/3 of patients. Majority of recurrences were in tumor bed. This was the standard of care from 1950's to 1990's
*Induction chemoradiation based on SWOG 9416 allows R0 resection in 75%, good local control, and 5-year survival 44%

'''''Guidelines:'''''
*ACCP 2nd edition guideline (PMID 17873175):
#Tissue diagnosis should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy
#If considered for curative resection, MRI should be performed to further evaluate resectability
#If considered for curative resection, invasive mediastinal staging and extra-thoracic staging are recommended. Involvement of mediastinal nodes is a contra-indication to resection
#If subclavian vessels or vertebral column involved, resection should be performed only at a specialized center
#If potentially resectable, pre-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended
#If surgery performed, every effort should be made for complete resection
#If surgery performed, recommend a lobectomy over wedge resection, and resection of involved chest wall structures
#Regardles of resection status (R0 vs R1-2), post-operative RT not recommended because of lack of survival benefit
#If unresectable but non-metastatic tumor, definitive concurrent chemoradiation is recommended
#If not candidate for curative intention, palliative radiotherapy is recommended

**Prospective. 110 patients, solitary T3-T4 N0-N1 superior sulcus NSCLC. Induction chemo-RT (cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and etoposide 50 mg/m2 + RT 45/25 to primary tumor and ipsilateral SCV but not mediastinum/hilum.) Restaging 2-4 weeks later for surgery (lobectomy or pneumonectomy, with en-block resection of tumor, and mediastinal dissection). Thereafter adjuvant cisplatin/etoposide x2 cycles. No adjuvant RT
**'''4-years; 2007''' PMID 17235046 -- &quot;Induction chemoradiation and surgical resection for superior sulcus non-small-cell lung carcinomas: long-term results of Southwest Oncology Group Trial 9416 (Intergroup Trial 0160).&quot; (Rusch VW, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 20;25(3):313-8.) Median F/U 3.7 years
***Compliance: induction completed by 95%, thoracotomy in 80%, R0 resection in 76% (94% of those going to surgery), pCR in 29% (36% of those going to surgery). PCR or microscopic residual disease was seen in 56% of the patients. Postop mortality 2%
***Outcome: median OS 2.7 years, if R0 resection 7.8 years. 5-year OS 44%, if R0 resection 54%. No difference between T3 and T4. LR 17%, LR+DM 12%, DM 67% (~50% brain only)
***Conclusion: Combined modality approach feasible, LC and OS seem improved relative to prior studies. Complete resection necessary for good outcome

*'''University of Maryland; 2005''' (1993-2003) PMID 15942564 -- &quot;High-dose radiotherapy in trimodality treatment of Pancoast tumors results in high pathologic complete response rates and excellent long-term survival.&quot; (Kwong KF, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2005 Jun;129(6):1250-7.)
**Retrospective. 36 patients with Pancoast tumors (Stage IIB 50%, IIIA 22%, IIIB 17%, IV with solitary brain mets 14%). Induction chemo-RT followed by surgery. RT mean dose 56.9 Gy
**Outcome: pCR 40%. Median OS 2.6 years; if pCR 7.8 years. For failures, 50% in brain.
**Conclusion: Surgical resection after high-dose RT and chemotherapy is feasible

==Practice Guidelines==
*'''ACCP 2nd edition; 2007''' PMID 17873175 -- &quot;Special treatment issues in lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition).&quot; (Shen KR, Chest. 2007 Sep;132(3 Suppl):290S-305S.)
**Guideline: Pancoast tumors, T4N0-1, satellite nodules, synchronous/metachronous multiple primaries, solitary brain/adrenal metastases, chest wall involvement</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''motherboard''' is the central or primary printed circuit board (PCB) making up a complex electronic system, such as a modern computer or laptop. It is also known as a mainboard, baseboard, system board, planar board, or, on Apple computers, a logic board, and is sometimes abbreviated casually as mobo.[1]

Most motherboards produced today are designed for so-called IBM-compatible computers, which held over 96% of the global personal computer market in 2005.[2] Motherboards for IBM-compatible computers are specifically covered in the PC motherboard article.

A motherboard, like a backplane, provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate, but unlike a backplane also contains the central processing unit and other subsystems such as real time clock, and some peripheral interfaces.

A typical desktop computer is built with the microprocessor, main memory, and other essential components on the motherboard. Other components such as external storage, controllers for video display and sound, and peripheral devices are typically attached to the motherboard via edge connectors and cables, although in modern computers it is increasingly common to integrate these &quot;peripherals&quot; into the motherboard.

All of the basic circuitry and components required for a computer to function are onboard the motherboard or are connected with a cable. The most important component on a motherboard is the chipset. It often consists of two components or chips known as the Northbridge and Southbridge, though they may also be integrated into a single component. These chips determine, to an extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard.

{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==

A kilo of round marrows, quite large ones

'''Meat Filling'''

*500g minced lean pork
*2 rashers rind-less smoked back bacon, finely chopped
*2 heaped tbsp. grated salt cured cheese (sheep or goat's milk, or Parmigiano-Reggiano)
*a slice of day old bread soaked in milk and wrung out
* half a small onion finely chopped and sweated until soft in a mixture of oil and butter 
*1 tbsp. chopped flat leaf parsley leaves
*2 beaten eggs
*salt and pepper 
*dry breadcrumbs or medium coarse semolina mixed with grated cheese for topping

'''Ricotta Filling'''

*450 g well drained fresh sheep's milk ricotta
*100 g grated Pecorino cheese (Romano type or with peppercorns)
*2 tbsp. chopped flat leaf parsley or fresh marjoram leaves
*2 beaten eggs
*salt and pepper
*dry breadcrumbs or medium coarse semolina for topping
*1 cup fresh tomato sauce for serving

'''Meat and Rice Filling'''

*2 cloves garlic
*1 cup uncooked round or long grain rice
*1 cup Bolognese type meat sauce diluted with half a cup of water
*1/2 tsp mixed spice
*1 large beaten egg
*salt and pepper
*extra grated cheese for topping

== Method for Filling==

#Depending on the size of the marrows, either cut off a lid and use whole or else cut in half.
#Carefully scoop out marrow flesh leaving enough a 1cm thick shell or boat to fill. The removed flesh can be diced and added to the filling ingredients
#Mix together all the filling ingredients and fill the scooped out marrows with the mixture, remembering not to fill to the top as the eggs (and rice if using) will expand
#Dip the top of each filled marrow in the topping ingredients (or sprinkle evenly on top) to help seal the filling in

== Methods for Cooking ==

'''Baking'''
*You can bake in a greased baking dish alone or on a bed of medium thick sliced potatoes and onions seasoned with salt, pepper and optional caraway seed, moistened with stock or water. Temperature 180 ° C; Time about 35/ 40 minutes. Cook covered with foil for 30 minutes then uncover so the top crisp up. Suitable for all 3 fillings.

'''Pot Roasting'''
*You can place them closely packed into a pot that you fill with water to just over half way up the marrows. If you like you may set on a bed of chopped onion and some of the marrow pulp drizzled with a 1 tbsp. of olive oil and optional tomato paste. Cook on medium heat and covered with a lid till the marrows are tender and the rice or meat filling cooked through, about 35 minutes.

'''Cooking in Broth'''
*Place well filled and carefully sealed marrows in a simmering meat broth (made with root vegetables and meat bones)and simmer on low heat for about 40 minutes. You can serve the strained broth as a first course and the vegetables and stuffed marrow as a second course.

''Note Not suitable for the ricotta filling''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Dial-up==
There are two types of dial-up modems, software (extremely common) and hardware.
Most software modems (winmodems) have poor support under Linux so consider buying an external (hardware) serial modem.
Puppy Linux supports software modems with chipsets of either Lucent Linmodem or Smart-Link.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]
===To USB flash drive===

If you have a running Puppy installation, or don't mind burning a CD-ROM to make one, it's probably easiest to just use its installer app to create a bootable USB flash drive. But if you don't have a running Puppy, and you can't or don't want to go through the intermediate step of burning a CD, read on. It's super easy.

Rather than an in-depth howto with a million options, this is a record of &quot;how it worked for me&quot; with an occasional aside of &quot;how it might be different for you&quot;. Do expand it with more data if you try something out and know if it works or doesn't.

I used Windows XP as the host OS during installation. A very similar process should work with Linux (I'll note the difference). I don't know about OS X.

I used a 2 GB flash disk with the FAT16 file system. It should work (not tested!) just as well with a FAT32-formatted one, but not all BIOSes are smart enough to boot from a FAT32 USB device. This exact process won't work for other filesystems (but if you're curious, read up on [http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/EXTLINUX Extlinux]). Almost all flash drives you can buy today come pre-formatted as FAT16 if they 2 gigs or less, or FAT32 if they're bigger than 2 gigs.

You'll need a program that can extract files out of ISO disk images. I recommend 7zip because it's free and easy and it handles a lot more other stuff besides ISO images. You can get 7zip at [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html] or pick your own poison, for example at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_image_software].

This process is dependent on Puppy live CD images using Isolinux for bootup. If they ever stop doing that, the process won't work anymore. (Though it will probably become just a matter of writing a small config file.) The version that worked for me was puppy-4.2.1-k2.6.25.16-seamonkey.

====Make the USB flash drive bootable using Syslinux====

=====If you're using Windows=====

Get the Syslinux in ZIP format (or any other format if you prefer) from [http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/]. The version that worked for me was 3.80, but you're probably best off just getting the latest one. If you open that link, you will normally see a list of files and directories. If, for example, the current version of Syslinux is 3.81, there will be a file called ''syslinux-3.81.zip''. Clicking or right-clicking on the file's name should cause your browser to offer you options to download and save the file.

Syslinux doesn't &quot;install&quot;, you just need to unpack the ZIP archive to a folder of its own. In modern Windows versions, you can normally do this by just double-clicking the file's icon where ever you saved it on your computer, selecting all the contents and &quot;copying&quot; them to a newly-created folder.

After that, make sure your USB drive is plugged in and accessible, open the command prompt and run:

''(folder where you unpacked Syslinux)'''''\win32\syslinux.exe -m -a''' ''(drive letter of the USB drive)''''':'''

So if you extracted Syslinux to the folder ''c:\syslinux'' and your USB drive letter is ''E:'', you would run ''c:\syslinux\win32\syslinux.exe -m -a E:''

=====If you're using Linux=====
Also get and unpack Syslinux, unless it is already present in your distribution like in my Linux Mint 10 Julia. As far as I can tell from the [http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/SYSLINUX#Linux Syslinux manual] you'd then need to run:

'''syslinux''' ''(your USB flash drive's partition)''

So if your USB drive is ''/dev/sda'' and you want to install Syslinux to partition 4, you'd run ''syslinux /dev/sda4''. Note that ''/dev/sda'' might be your hard drive so make sure you specify the right device. It is also common to have only one partition on a USB flash drive.

I don't know if this is the standard behavior but on my system the '''syslinux''' command itself did not modify the device's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Boot_Record Master Boot Record] (first sector or 512 bytes), which tells BIOS how to boot from the device, so I also had to do this from within Syslinux's folder (''/usr/lib/syslinux/'' in my case):

'''cat mbr.bin &gt;''' ''(your USB flash device)''

This prints out the contents of the mbr.bin file while the output is redirected to your USB flash drive so it rewrites the first 440 bytes of the device while leaving the rest of the device, including the remaining 72 bytes of MBR where partition information is stored, the same.

Not sure if this matters but if it still does not work for you, you can try marking the partition with the bootable/active flag with '''fdisk''':

'''fdisk''' ''(your USB flash device)''

Just follow the internal help or use '''p''' to show device information and list its partitions or '''a''' to mark one of them bootable/active.

I tested this on Linux Mint (Ubuntu-based) and it works.

====Download and extract the Puppy live cd image file====
Get it from [http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/puppylinux/]. Use 7zip or whatever other program to extract all files from the image into a directory of their own. You can also use the following command to mount the image file in Linux:

'''mount -o loop''' ''(path to .iso file)'' ''(where to mount)''

You might need superuser permissions for this so just precede with '''sudo''' or switch to a superuser session by '''su''':

'''sudo mount -o loop''' ''(path to .iso file)'' ''(where to mount)''

====Tweak and copy files====
Among the files extracted from the ISO image, rename the file ''isolinux.cfg'' to ''syslinux.cfg''. It's no surprise that Isolinux and Syslinux have almost the same config language. You can delete ''isolinux.bin'', you won't need it. (Maybe some other files too - who knows?)

Modify the newly-renamed file ''syslinux.cfg'' in a text editor by changing the line ''append initrd=initrd.gz pmedia=cd'' so that instead of ''pmedia=cd'' it reads ''pmedia=usbflash''. (If in some future installation the ''pmedia'' option is given in the ''kernel'' line instead of ''append'', change it to ''usbflash'' there.)

Copy the files as they are now onto the USB drive. If you're doing it right, the drive's root directory should hold the files ''vmlinuz'' and ''pup_XYZ.sfs''.

====You're done====
That's all. Set your BIOS to boot from USB and enjoy. If you are not sure how to do this, try pressing one of the Function keys (F1-F12), Delete or Escape right after powering on your PC to enter the BIOS configuration menu or boot device selection menu. This is not the same for all systems, for example on my Asus laptop F2 gets you the configuration interface and Escape the boot device selection menu while on another Hewlett-Packard laptop it takes F9 and F10 to do the same things.

You can delete the directories where you unpacked Syslinux and the image file on your hard disk if you want.</text>

Structural biochemistry is a branch of the life sciences that combines biology, physics, and chemistry to study living organisms and to summarize some mutual principles that all forms of life share. It is also referred to more generally as biochemistry. Biochemists aim to describe in molecular terms the structures, mechanisms, and chemical processes shared by all organisms, providing organizing principles that underlie life in all its diverse forms.

==Who is this?==
George Mason 

==What did he do that made him important?==
George Mason was a United States patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. He is called the &quot;Father of the Bill of Rights&quot;. For all of these reasons he is considered to be one of the &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; of the United States.  However, he refused to sign the Constitution.

==What did he do when he was young?==
George Mason was born on December 11, 1725 to George and Ann Thomson Mason at the Mason family plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia. On April 4, 1750, he married sixteen-year-old Ann Eilbeck, from a plantation in Charles County, Maryland. They lived in a house on his property in Dogue's Neck, Virginia. He and his wife had twelve children, nine of whom survived to adulthood.

==What did he do afterward?==
George Mason died in his home, Gunston Hall, on October 7, 1792.

==How do we remember him today?==
George Mason's home has been turned into a museum in his honor. There are also countless things named after him including:
*George Mason University, located in Virginia
*Mason County, Kentucky 
*Mason County, West Virginia 
*Mason County, Illinois

==Introduction==

Physics is the scientific study of physical phenomena and the interaction between matter and energy. Generally speaking, it is the examination and inquiry of the behavior of nature. As one of the oldest branches of academia, physics is intertwined with and helps explain the fundamental nature of the living and nonliving universe.

== Thermodynamics ==
=== First law ===

The [[Structural Biochemistry/First law|&quot;first law&quot;]] of [[Structural Biochemistry/Thermodynamics|thermodynamics]] is simply that energy is a conserved quantity. Although there are many different, but equivalent statements of the first law, the most basic is:


&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle dU = dQ + dW&lt;/math&gt;


dU = infinitesimal change in internal energy, 

dQ = infinitesimal heat flow and 

dW = infinitesimal work.

In words, the first law states that 

The heat supplied is equal to the increase in internal energy of the system plus the work done by the system. Energy is conserved if heat is taken into account.

=== Second Law ===
=== Entropy ===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Thermodynamics|Thermodynamics]] allows us to predict the initial and final states of a system. In other words, it’s an extremely useful tool in predicting the equilibrium position in chemical systems.  The [[Structural Biochemistry/First law|first law of thermodynamics]] states that [[w:energy|energy]] is always conserved between the initial and final states. However, the first law does not provide information about the extent of a chemical reaction, or the equilibrium concentrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Ira N. | year = 2002 | title = Physical Chemistry | edition = 5th Ed. | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 0-07-231808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Structural Biochemistry/Second law|second law of thermodynamics]] introduces the concept of [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]] S, a value that is a function of a system’s state. Entropy helps predict the equilibrium because the equilibrium concentrations of a system correspond to the maximum entropy of a system;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;/&gt; entropy can act as a driving force of a reaction. Therefore, the second law of thermodynamics states that:


'''&quot;Thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system is reached when the system's entropy is maximized&quot;'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;/&gt;


Mathematically, entropy is expressed as

&lt;math&gt;dS \equiv \frac{dq}{ T}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;/&gt;                                                   

for a reversible process in a closed system, where dq is heat energy and T is temperature.  A reversible process is where the system is always very close to the equilibrium. Perturbations to the system must be small enough that the system and the surroundings can return to the initial state. The change in entropy, a more useful value, is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = \int_{1}^{2} \frac{ \mathrm{d}q_{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;/&gt;


An example of increasing entropy can be seen by watching ice melt in a closed container held at 25&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. Since the temperature is constant, it can be seen that the total thermal energy of molecules in liquid water is greater than the thermal energy of molecules in ice. Therefore, ΔS is positive, which implies that [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]] has increased in order to obtain equilibrium.


[[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|Entropy]] is conceptually more difficult to understand than other state functions such as temperature or energy. Furthermore, entropy is a macroscopic property; one molecule does not exhibit entropy. Consider a closed container with a partition down the center of the container where one side of the partition is composed of gas A and the other side of the partition is empty. If the partition is removed, there is a very small probability that gas A will stay on one side of the container. The most probable distribution of the A molecules is that gas A will be evenly distributed throughout the container. This distribution can be viewed as the equilibrium thermodynamic state, which happens to be the most probable state and the state with the most disorder.

=== Enthalpy ===

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|Enthalpy]] is a measurement of heat transfer done at a constant pressure and is often denoted as &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.  Mathematically, enthalpy is expressed as 


&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H = E + PV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Oxtoby | first = David W. | year = 2002 | title = Principles of Modern Chemistry | edition = 5th Ed. | publisher = Thomson | isbn = 0-03-035373-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;


where E is the internal energy of the system, P is internal pressure, and V is the volume.  PV accounts for the energy used in expansion work.  


The change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]] is then expressed as 


&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta H = \Delta E + P \Delta V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby&quot;/&gt;


where pressure remains constant.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is then, essentially, the internal energy corrected for work.


Reaction enthalpies are assigned to chemical reactions to denote the amount of energy that is transferred into or out of the system in exchange with the surroundings.  A reaction that releases heat is defined as exothermic, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is negative.  A reaction that requires an input of heat is defined as endothermic, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby&quot;/&gt;

=== Gibbs Free Energy ===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Free energy]] is a measurement of the tendency of processes to occur spontaneously. It depends upon 3 different quantities: change in entropy, change in enthalpy, and temperature. The Gibbs Free Energy is the enthalpy of the system subtracted by the temperature and the entropy of the system, G = H - TS. A positive change in free energy (such as an [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|endergonic reaction]]) is thermodynamically unfavorable, whereas a negative change in free energy (such as an exergonic reaction) is thermodynamically favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = David L. | year = 2002 | title = Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 4th Ed. | publisher = Sara| isbn = 0-7167-4339-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological systems, many reactions that have positive free energy are coupled simultaneously to reactions that reactions that have negative free energy. Example is the synthesis of glutamine from the expense of hydrolysis of ATP.

=== Endergonic Reactions ===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|Endergonic reactions]] are reactions that have a positive free Gibbs energy. These reactions are not thermodynamically favored and the substrates are not readily going to form products. Energy must be out into the system to drive these reactions.

=== Exergonic Reactions ===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|Exergonic reactions]] are thermodynamically favored. These types of reactions have a negative free Gibbs energy an are readily able to form products. However, although these reactions are energetically favorable, it does not mean the reaction will occur at a reasonable rate. This is due to high activation energy barriers. To reduce these barriers, the introduction of a catalysis is needed.

==Charges: The Stern-Gerlach Experiment==

This iconic experiment in the realm of quantum mechanics describes the nature of the charge an atom can have. This idea is pertinent to biochemistry because of the nature of how monomers, dimers, etc. bind to metal centers (for examples, iron is the metal center that hemoglobin uses as its coordination center). These protein structures bind to metal centers by coordination complexes that are in correspondence with the oxidation state of the metal ion. The oxidation state of the metal ion is influenced by the spin charge of the metal ion and it because of the Stern-Gerlach experiment that explains the nature of charge in an atom. The Stern-Gerlach experiment is an iconic quantum mechanical experiment that physically showed the spin charges of a silver atom. The electrons of the silver atoms was emitted between two vertically oriented magnets. These magnets provided the magnetic field to separate the electrons based on their apparent spin. The result of this experiment were two spins, one going up and one going down, dictated as + 1/2 and -1/2. The two beams of directionally spun electrons were then put through a second set of horizontally oriented magnets. The result of this addition were again two beams of directionaly different spun electrons except in the horizontal orientation. The last part of this experiment was sending one of the beams from the horizontally oriented spun electrons through another set of magnetic oriented in the same way as the first set. The resulting beams from this last set of magnetics is the most important realization. The main idea of the implementation with the third magnet is that two beams emerge, just as experienced with the first set of magnetics. Because of the beams of electrons shown are of the same spin nature, this in turns shows that the two beams of electrons from both magnetics after being oriented differently, are eigenvalues of each other, meaning they are of the same operator. This whole experiment displays the importance of charge and how it can be used to describe the nature of quantum behavior and the nature of coordination ligand binding.

== Foundation of Biochemistry ==
Physics is one of the foundations of biochemistry; it deals with different types of energy and forces. 
Types of forces:
# Ionic force — charge-charge interaction
# Dipole interactions — deals with electronegativity (trend from increasing order: P, H, S, C, Br, Cl, N, O, F) and consists of hydrophobic interactions.
# Van der Waals — molecular repulsion
# Hydrogen bonds

====I====
&lt;p&gt; No sé qué día de Agosto del año 1816 llegó a las puertas de
     la Capitanía general[[#p1n1|&lt;sup&gt;[1-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de Granada[[#p1n2|&lt;sup&gt;[1-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cierto haraposo y grotesco

     gitano, de sesenta años de edad, de oficio esquilador y de
     apellido o sobrenombre &lt;i&gt;Heredia&lt;/i&gt;, caballero en flaquísimo y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;destartalado burro mohino, cuyos arneses se reducían a una
     soga atada al pescuezo; y, echado que hubo[[#p1n3|&lt;sup&gt;[1-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pie a tierra, dijo

     con la mayor frescura «&lt;i&gt;que quería ver al Capitán general&lt;/i&gt;.»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Excuso añadir que semejante pretensión excitó sucesivamente
     la resistencia del centinela, las risas de los ordenanzas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt;y las dudas y vacilaciones de los &lt;i&gt;edecanes&lt;/i&gt;[[#p1n4|&lt;sup&gt;[1-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] antes de[[#i1|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii1&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;]] llegar a

     conocimiento del Excelentísimo Sr. D.[[#p1n5|&lt;sup&gt;[1-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Eugenio Portocarrero,
     conde del Montijo, a la sazón Capitán general del antiguo
     reino de Granada.... Pero como aquel prócer era hombre de
     muy buen humor y tenía muchas noticias de Heredia, célebre
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt;por sus chistes, por sus cambalaches y por su amor a lo ajeno[[#i2|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii2&quot;&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;]]...,

     con permiso del engañado dueño, dió orden de que dejasen
     pasar al gitano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Penetró éste en el despacho de Su Excelencia, dando dos
     pasos adelante y uno atrás, que era como andaba en las circunstancias
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt;graves, y poniéndose de rodillas[[#i3|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii3&quot;&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;]] exclamó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Viva María Santísima y viva su merced, que es el amo
     de toitico[[#p1n6|&lt;sup&gt;[1-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el mundo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Levántate; déjate de zalamerías, y dime qué se te ofrece[[#i4|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii4&quot;&gt;(4)&lt;/sup&gt;]]...&amp;mdash;respondió 
     el Conde con aparente sequedad.&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p2&quot; id=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p2)&lt;/span --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Heredia se puso[[#i5|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii5&quot;&gt;(5)&lt;/sup&gt;]] también serio, y dijo con mucho
     desparpajo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues, señor, vengo a que[[#p2n1|&lt;sup&gt;[2-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se me den los mil reales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué mil reales?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   &amp;mdash;Los ofrecidos hace[[#i6|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii6&quot;&gt;(6)&lt;/sup&gt;]] días, en un bando, al que[[#i7|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii7&quot;&gt;(7)&lt;/sup&gt;]] presente las
     señas de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues ¡qué! ¿tú lo &lt;i&gt;conocías&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, señor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Entonces....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero ya lo conozco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cómo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Es muy sencillo. Lo he buscado; lo he visto; traigo las
     señas, y pido mi ganancia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Estás seguro de que lo has visto?&amp;mdash;exclamó el Capitán
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; general con un interés que se sobrepuso a sus dudas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El gitano se echó[[#i8|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii8&quot;&gt;(8)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a reír, y respondió:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es claro! Su merced dirá: este gitano es como todos,
     y quiere engañarme.&amp;mdash;¡No me perdone Dios si miento!&amp;mdash;Ayer
     ví a &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero ¿sabes tú la importancia de lo que dices? ¿Sabes

     que hace tres años que se[[#i9|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii9&quot;&gt;(9)&lt;/sup&gt;]] persigue[[#p2n2|&lt;sup&gt;[2-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a ese monstruo, a ese
     bandido sanguinario, &lt;i&gt;que nadie conoce ni ha podido nunca ver&lt;/i&gt;?
     ¿Sabes que todos los días roba, en distintos puntos de estas
     sierras, a[[#i10|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii10&quot;&gt;(10)&lt;/sup&gt;]] algunos pasajeros; y después los asesina, pues dice

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; que los muertos no hablan, y que ése es el único medio de que
     nunca dé con[[#i11|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii11&quot;&gt;(11)&lt;/sup&gt;]] él la Justicia? ¿Sabes, en fin, que ver a &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;
     es encontrarse con la muerte?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El gitano se volvió a[[#i12|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii12&quot;&gt;(12)&lt;/sup&gt;]] reír,[[#p2n3|&lt;sup&gt;[2-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y ¿no sabe su merced que lo que no puede hacer un
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; gitano no hay quien lo haga[[#p2n4|&lt;sup&gt;[2-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sobre la tierra? ¿Conoce nadie[[#p2n5|&lt;sup&gt;[2-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     cuándo es verdad nuestra risa o nuestro llanto? ¿Tiene su
     merced noticia de alguna zorra que sepa tantas picardías como

     nosotros?&amp;mdash;Repito, mi General, que, no sólo he visto a &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;,
     sino que he hablado con él.&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p3&quot; id=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p3)&lt;/span --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Dónde?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;En el camino de Tózar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dame pruebas de ello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Escuche su merced. Ayer mañana hizo ocho[[#i13|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii13&quot;&gt;(13)&lt;/sup&gt;]] días que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   caímos mi borrico y yo en poder de unos ladrones. Me maniataron
     muy bien, y me llevaron por unos barrancos endemoniados
     hasta dar con una plazoleta donde acampaban los bandidos.

     Una cruel sospecha me tenía desazonado.&amp;mdash;«¿Será[[#i15|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii15&quot;&gt;(15)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     esta gente de[[#i14|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii14&quot;&gt;(14)&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;? (me decía a cada instante.) ¡Entonces
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; no hay remedio, me matan[[#p3n1|&lt;sup&gt;[3-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!..., pues ese maldito se ha empeñado
     en que ningunos ojos que vean su fisonomía vuelvan a

     ver cosa ninguna.»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Estaba[[#i16|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii16&quot;&gt;(16)&lt;/sup&gt;]] yo haciendo estas reflexiones, cuando se me presentó
     un hombre vestido de macareno[[#p3n2|&lt;sup&gt;[3-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con mucho lujo, y dándome
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; un golpecito en el hombro y sonriéndose[[#i17|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii17&quot;&gt;(17)&lt;/sup&gt;]] con suma gracia, me

     dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Compadre, ¡yo soy &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oír esto y caerme de espaldas,[[#p3n3|&lt;sup&gt;[3-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] todo fué una misma cosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El bandido se echó a reír.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Yo me levanté desencajado, me puse de rodillas, y exclamé
     en todos los tonos de voz que pude inventar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bendita sea tu alma, rey de los hombres!... ¿Quién
     no había de conocerte[[#p3n4|&lt;sup&gt;[3-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por ese porte de príncipe real que

     Dios te ha dado? ¡Y que haya madre[[#p3n5|&lt;sup&gt;[3-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que para tales hijos!
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Jesús![[#p3n6|&lt;sup&gt;[3-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Deja que te dé un abrazo, hijo mío![[#i18|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii18&quot;&gt;(18)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Que en
     mal hora muera[[#p3n7|&lt;sup&gt;[3-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] si no tenía gana[[#i19|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii19&quot;&gt;(19)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de encontrarte el gitanico

     para decirte la buenaventura[[#p3n8|&lt;sup&gt;[3-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y darte un beso en esa mano
     de emperador!&amp;mdash;¡También yo soy de los tuyos![[#i20|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii20&quot;&gt;(20)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¿Quieres
     que te enseñe a cambiar burros muertos por burros vivos?&amp;mdash;¿Quieres
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; vender como potros tus caballos viejos? ¿Quieres

     que le enseñe el francés a una mula?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El Conde del Montijo no pudo contener la risa....&amp;mdash;Luego
     preguntó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y ¿qué respondió &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; a todo eso? ¿Qué hizo?

                           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p4&quot; id=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p4)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Lo mismo que su merced; reírse[[#i21|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii21&quot;&gt;(21)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a todo trapo.[[#p4n1|&lt;sup&gt;[4-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y tú?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo, señorico, me reía también; pero me corrían por las
     patillas lagrimones como naranjas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   &amp;mdash;Continúa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En seguida[[#i22|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii22&quot;&gt;(22)&lt;/sup&gt;]] me alargó la mano y me dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Compadre, es V. el único hombre de talento que ha caído
     en mi poder. Todos los demás[[#i23|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii23&quot;&gt;(23)&lt;/sup&gt;]] tienen la maldita costumbre de
     procurar entristecerme, de llorar, de quejarse y de hacer otras

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; tonterías que me ponen de mal humor[[#i24|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii24&quot;&gt;(24)&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Sólo V. me ha hecho
     reír: y si no fuera por esas lágrimas....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Qué, ¡señor, si son[[#p4n2|&lt;sup&gt;[4-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de alegría!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Lo creo. ¡Bien sabe el demonio que es la primera vez

     que me he reído desde hace seis u[[#i25|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii25&quot;&gt;(25)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ocho años!&amp;mdash;Verdad es que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; tampoco he llorado....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero despachemos.&amp;mdash;¡Eh, muchachos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Decir &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; estas palabras y rodearme una nube de trabucos,

     todo fué un abrir y cerrar de ojos.[[#i26|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii26&quot;&gt;(26)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Jesús me ampare!&amp;mdash;empecé a gritar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Deteneos![[#i27|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii27&quot;&gt;(27)&lt;/sup&gt;]] (exclamó &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.) No se trata de[[#i28|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii28&quot;&gt;(28)&lt;/sup&gt;]] eso
     &lt;i&gt;todavía&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;mdash;Os llamo para preguntaros qué le habéis &lt;i&gt;tomado&lt;/i&gt; a

     este hombre.[[#p4n3|&lt;sup&gt;[4-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Un burro en pelo.[[#p4n4|&lt;sup&gt;[4-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y dinero?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Tres duros y siete reales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues dejadnos solos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todos se alejaron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Ahora dime la buenaventura&amp;mdash;exclamó el ladrón, tendiéndome
     la[[#i29|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii29&quot;&gt;(29)&lt;/sup&gt;]] mano.[[#p4n5|&lt;sup&gt;[4-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Yo se[[#i30|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii30&quot;&gt;(30)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la[[#p4n6|&lt;sup&gt;[4-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cogí; medité un momento; conocí que estaba en el
     caso de hablar formalmente, y le dije con todas las veras[[#p4n7|&lt;sup&gt;[4-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de mi
     alma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, tarde que temprano,[[#p4n8|&lt;sup&gt;[4-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya me[[#p4n9|&lt;sup&gt;[4-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] quites la vida, ya
     me la dejes..., ¡morirás ahorcado!
                     &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p5&quot; id=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p5)&lt;/span --&gt;

     &amp;mdash;Eso ya lo sabía yo.... (respondió el bandido con entera
     tranquilidad.)&amp;mdash;Dime &lt;i&gt;cuándo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Me puse[[#i31|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii31&quot;&gt;(31)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a cavilar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Este hombre (pensé) me va a[[#i32|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii32&quot;&gt;(32)&lt;/sup&gt;]] perdonar la vida; mañana

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   llego a Granada y doy el &lt;i&gt;cante&lt;/i&gt;;[[#p5n1|&lt;sup&gt;[5-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pasado mañana[[#i33|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii33&quot;&gt;(33)&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo cogen....
     Después empezará la sumaria....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Dices que &lt;i&gt;cuándo?&lt;/i&gt;[[#p5n2|&lt;sup&gt;[5-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (le respondí en alta voz.)&amp;mdash;Pues

     ¡mira! va a ser el mes que entra.[[#p5n3|&lt;sup&gt;[5-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; se estremeció, y yo también, conociendo que el amor
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; propio de adivino me podía salir por la tapa de los sesos.[[#p5n4|&lt;sup&gt;[5-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues mira tú, gitano.... (contestó &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; muy lentamente.)

     Vas a quedarte en mi poder....&amp;mdash;¡Si en todo el
     mes que entra no me ahorcan, te ahorco[[#p5n6|&lt;sup&gt;[5-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] yo a ti, tan cierto
     como ahorcaron a mi padre!&amp;mdash;Si muero para esa fecha,[[#p5n7|&lt;sup&gt;[5-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; quedarás libre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Muchas gracias! (dije yo en mi interior.) ¡Me perdona... 
     después de muerto![[#p5n8|&lt;sup&gt;[5-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y me arrepentí de haber echado tan corto el plazo.[[#p5n9|&lt;sup&gt;[5-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Quedamos en lo dicho:[[#i34|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii34&quot;&gt;(34)&lt;/sup&gt;]] fuí conducido a la cueva, donde

     me encerraron, y &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; montó en su yegua y tomó el tole[[#p5n10|&lt;sup&gt;[5-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     por aquellos breñales....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Vamos,[[#p5n11|&lt;sup&gt;[5-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya comprendo... (exclamó el Conde del Montijo.)

     &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; ha muerto; tú has quedado libre, y por eso sabes
     sus señas....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Todo lo contrario, mi General!  &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; vive, y aquí
     entra lo más negro de la presente historia.&lt;/p&gt;


===Notes===
(The first figures refer to the original pages of text, and second figures to the reference figures in text).

&lt;span name=&quot;p1n1&quot; id=&quot;p1n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-1: &lt;b&gt;Capitanía general&lt;/b&gt;: headquarters of the Captain general, who
has supreme military authority in his district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p1n2&quot; id=&quot;p1n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-2: &lt;b&gt;Granada&lt;/b&gt;: a province (and its principal city), the former
bordering on the Mediterranean. It is full of Moorish remains, including
the Alhambra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p1n3&quot; id=&quot;p1n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-3: &lt;b&gt;echado que hubo&lt;/b&gt;: a very common construction = &lt;i&gt;asi que hubo
echado&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p1n4&quot; id=&quot;p1n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-4: &lt;b&gt;edecán&lt;/b&gt;: a corruption of the French &lt;i&gt;aide-de-camp&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p1n5&quot; id=&quot;p1n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-5: &lt;b&gt;Sr. D.&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Señor Don&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p1n6&quot; id=&quot;p1n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-6: &lt;b&gt;toitico&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;todito&lt;/i&gt;, diminutive of &lt;i&gt;todo&lt;/i&gt;. This diminutive
ending often adds emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p2n1&quot; id=&quot;p2n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-1: &lt;b&gt;a que&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;para que&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p2n2&quot; id=&quot;p2n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-2: &lt;b&gt;se persigue&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;they have pursued&lt;/i&gt;. The perfect tense value is
often represented by the present (and the pluperfect by the imperfect)
after &lt;i&gt;después&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;hace&lt;/i&gt; (ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p2n3&quot; id=&quot;p2n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3: &lt;b&gt;se volvió a reír&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;volvió a reírse&lt;/i&gt;, laughed again. &lt;i&gt;Volver
a&lt;/i&gt;, followed by an infinitive, is to be rendered as a formula of
repetition, as, &lt;i&gt;again, once more&lt;/i&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p2n4&quot; id=&quot;p2n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-4: &lt;b&gt;no hay quien lo haga&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;there is no one who can do it&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p2n5&quot; id=&quot;p2n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-5: &lt;b&gt;conoce nadie&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;does anybody know&lt;/i&gt;? Observe that &lt;i&gt;nadie&lt;/i&gt; is not
necessarily negative. Cf. use of &lt;i&gt;jamás&lt;/i&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n1&quot; id=&quot;p3n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-1: &lt;b&gt;me matan&lt;/b&gt;: a vivid use of the present for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n2&quot; id=&quot;p3n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-2: &lt;b&gt;vestido de macareno&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;dressed in a loud or striking fashion&lt;/i&gt;.
The &lt;i&gt;macareno&lt;/i&gt; is a native of one of the districts of Seville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n3&quot; id=&quot;p3n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-3: &lt;b&gt;caerme de espaldas&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;to fall on my back&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n4&quot; id=&quot;p3n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-4: &lt;b&gt;había de conocer&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;conocería&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Haber de&lt;/i&gt; followed by the
infinitive denotes (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) obligation: as: &lt;i&gt;ha de ser&lt;/i&gt;, it must be; &lt;i&gt;habrá
de hacerlo&lt;/i&gt;, he will have to do it; (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) futurity (present tense of

&lt;i&gt;haber de&lt;/i&gt; + infinitive), as: &lt;i&gt;he de hablar&lt;/i&gt;, I will speak: (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;)
conditioned action (imperfect of &lt;i&gt;haber de&lt;/i&gt; + infinitive), as: &lt;i&gt;quién
había de creer&lt;/i&gt;? who would believe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n5&quot; id=&quot;p3n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-5: &lt;b&gt;que haya madre&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; (to think) &lt;i&gt;that there should be a
mother&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n6&quot; id=&quot;p3n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-6: &lt;b&gt;Jesús&lt;/b&gt;: the Spaniard, the most Catholic of men, is in the habit
of interlarding his speech with copious expletives derived from his
religion, such as &lt;i&gt;Jesús, Ave María purísima&lt;/i&gt;, etc., which may often be
rendered by the mildest of English substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n7&quot; id=&quot;p3n7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-7: &lt;b&gt;¡Que... muera!&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;may I die! let me die&lt;/i&gt;! As the subjunctive
used with imperative value, depends on some desiderative verb
understood, the &lt;i&gt;que&lt;/i&gt; which would follow that verb is usually retained
in Spanish (as in French), though not when &lt;i&gt;V.&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;VV.&lt;/i&gt; is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p3n8&quot; id=&quot;p3n8&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-8: &lt;b&gt;para decirte la buenaventura&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;to tell your fortune&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p4n1&quot; id=&quot;p4n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-1: &lt;b&gt;a todo trapo&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;under full sail&lt;/i&gt; (lit. &lt;i&gt;rag&lt;/i&gt;), i.e.
&lt;i&gt;unrestrainedly&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p4n2&quot; id=&quot;p4n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-2: &lt;b&gt;si son de alegría&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;why! they are tears of joy&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Si&lt;/i&gt; is often
used to introduce an emphatic assertion. It may be translated by an
expletive or omitted entirely. Cf. p. 45, line 31 and note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p4n3&quot; id=&quot;p4n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-3: &lt;b&gt;tomado a este hombre&lt;/b&gt;: (&lt;i&gt;a = from&lt;/i&gt;). The preposition &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is
regularly used with the value of the English &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt;, after verbs like

====II====
&lt;p&gt; Pasaron ocho días sin que el capitán volviese a verme. Según[[#i35|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii35&quot;&gt;(35)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     pude entender, no había parecido por allí[[#i36|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii36&quot;&gt;(36)&lt;/sup&gt;]] desde la tarde que le
     hice la buenaventura; cosa que nada tenía de raro, a lo que me

&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30--&gt; contó[[#p5n12|&lt;sup&gt;[5-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] uno de mis guardianes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sepa V. (me dijo) que el Jefe se va al infierno[[#p5n13|&lt;sup&gt;[5-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de vez en &lt;!-- class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;p6&quot; id=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(p6)--&gt;
     cuando,[[#i37|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii37&quot;&gt;(37)&lt;/sup&gt;]] y no vuelve hasta que se le antoja.&amp;mdash;Ello es[[#p6n1|&lt;sup&gt;[6-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que nosotros

     no sabemos nada de lo que hace durante sus largas
     ausencias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A todo esto, a fuerza de[[#i38|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii38&quot;&gt;(38)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ruegos, y como pago de haber dicho
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05--&gt;   serían ahorcados y que llevarían[[#p6n2|&lt;sup&gt;[6-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] una vejez muy tranquila, había

     yo conseguido que por las tardes me sacasen de la cueva y me
     atasen a un árbol, pues en mi encierro me ahogaba de calor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero excuso decir que nunca faltaban a mi lado un par de
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10--&gt; centinelas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una tarde, a eso[[#i39|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii39&quot;&gt;(39)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de las seis, los ladrones que habían salido

     de &lt;i&gt;servicio&lt;/i&gt;[[#p6n3|&lt;sup&gt;[6-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] aquel día a las órdenes del &lt;i&gt;segundo de parrón&lt;/i&gt;,
     regresaron al campamento, llevando consigo, maniatado como
     pintan a nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno, a un pobre segador de
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15--&gt; cuarenta a cincuenta años, cuyas lamentaciones partían el alma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Dadme mis veinte duros! (decía.) ¡Ah! ¡Si supierais
     con qué afanes los he ganado! ¡Todo un verano segando bajo
     el fuego del sol!... ¡Todo un verano lejos de mi pueblo, de
     mi mujer y de mis hijos![[#p6n4|&lt;sup&gt;[6-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Así he reunido, con mil sudores y
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20--&gt; privaciones, esa suma, con que podríamos vivir este invierno!...

     ¡Y cuando ya voy de vuelta,[[#p6n5|&lt;sup&gt;[6-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] deseando abrazarlos y pagar
     las deudas que para comer hayan hecho aquellos infelices,
     ¿cómo he de perder[[#p6n6|&lt;sup&gt;[6-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ese dinero, que es para mí un tesoro?&amp;mdash;¡Piedad,
     señores! ¡Dadme mis veinte duros! ¡Dádmelos, por

&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25--&gt; los dolores de María Santísima!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una carcajada de burla contestó a las quejas del pobre padre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo temblaba de horror en el árbol a que estaba atado; porque
     los gitanos también tenemos familia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No seas[[#p6n7|&lt;sup&gt;[6-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] loco.... (exclamó al fin un bandido, dirigiéndose

&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30--&gt; al segador.)&amp;mdash;Haces mal en pensar en[[#i41|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii41&quot;&gt;(41)&lt;/sup&gt;]] tu dinero, cuando tienes
     cuidados mayores en que ocuparte....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cómo!&amp;mdash;dijo el segador, sin comprender que hubiese
     desgracia más grande que dejar sin pan a sus hijos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Estás en poder de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;!
               &lt;!-- class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;p7&quot; id=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(p7)--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.... ¡No le conozco!... Nunca lo he oído
     nombrar.... ¡Vengo de muy lejos! Yo soy de Alicante,[[#p7n1|&lt;sup&gt;[7-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y

     he estado segando en Sevilla.[[#p7n2|&lt;sup&gt;[7-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues, amigo mío, &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; quiere decir[[#i42|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii42&quot;&gt;(42)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la &lt;i&gt;muerte&lt;/i&gt;. Todo
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05--&gt;   el que[[#i43|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii43&quot;&gt;(43)&lt;/sup&gt;]] cae en nuestro poder es preciso que muera.  Así,

     pues, haz testamento en dos minutos y encomienda el alma
     en otros dos.&amp;mdash;¡Preparen![[#p7n3|&lt;sup&gt;[7-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Apunten!&amp;mdash;Tienes cuatro
     minutos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Voy a aprovecharlos.... ¡Oídme, por compasión!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10--&gt; &amp;mdash;Habla.[[#i40|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii40&quot;&gt;(40)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Tengo seis hijos[[#p7n4|&lt;sup&gt;[7-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]... y una infeliz...&amp;mdash;diré &lt;i&gt;viuda&lt;/i&gt;...,
     pues veo que voy a morir....&amp;mdash;Leo en vuestros ojos que sois

     peores que fieras.... ¡Sí, peores! Porque las fieras de una
     misma especie no se devoran unas a otras.[[#i44|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii44&quot;&gt;(44)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Ah! ¡Perdón!...
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15--&gt; No sé lo que me digo.[[#p7n5|&lt;sup&gt;[7-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Caballeros, alguno de ustedes[[#p7n6|&lt;sup&gt;[7-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] será
     padre!... ¿No hay un padre entre vosotros? ¿Sabéis lo

     que son seis niños pasando un invierno sin pan? ¿Sabéis lo
     que es una madre que ve morir a los hijos de sus entrañas,
     diciendo: «Tengo hambre..., tengo frío[[#i45|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii45&quot;&gt;(45)&lt;/sup&gt;]]»?&amp;mdash;Señores, ¡yo no
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20--&gt; quiero mi vida sino por ellos! ¿Qué es para mí la vida? ¡Una
     cadena de trabajos y privaciones!&amp;mdash;¡Pero debo vivir para mis

     hijos!... ¡Hijos míos![[#p7n7|&lt;sup&gt;[7-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Hijos de mi alma!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y el padre se arrastraba por el suelo, y levantaba hacia los
     ladrones una cara.... ¡Qué cara!... ¡Se parecía a[[#i46|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii46&quot;&gt;(46)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la[[#i47|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii47&quot;&gt;(47)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25--&gt; los santos que el rey Nerón[[#p7n8|&lt;sup&gt;[7-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] echaba a los tigres, según dicen

     los padres predicadores....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los bandidos sintieron moverse algo dentro de[[#i48|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii48&quot;&gt;(48)&lt;/sup&gt;]] su pecho,
     pues se miraron unos a otros...; y viendo que todos estaban
     pensando la misma cosa, uno de ellos se atrevió a decirla....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30--&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué dijo?&amp;mdash;preguntó el Capitán general, profundamente

     afectado por aquel relato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dijo: «Caballeros, lo que vamos a hacer no lo sabrá nunca
     &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;....»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Nunca..., nunca...&amp;mdash;tartamudearon los bandidos.
             &lt;!-- class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;p8&quot; id=&quot;p8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(p8)--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Márchese V., buen hombre....&amp;mdash;exclamó entonces uno
     que hasta lloraba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo hice también señas al segador de que se fuese al instante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El infeliz se levantó lentamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05--&gt;   &amp;mdash;Pronto.... ¡Márchese V.!&amp;mdash;repitieron todos volviéndole
     la espalda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El segador alargó la mano maquinalmente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Te parece poco? (gritó uno.)&amp;mdash;¡Pues no quiere su

&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10--&gt; dinero![[#p8n1|&lt;sup&gt;[8-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;Vaya..., vaya.... ¡No nos tiente V. la paciencia!
     El pobre padre se alejó llorando, y a poco[[#i49|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii49&quot;&gt;(49)&lt;/sup&gt;]] desapareció.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Media hora había transcurrido, empleada por los ladrones
     en jurarse unos a otros no decir nunca a su capitán que habían
     perdonado la vida a un hombre, cuando de pronto[[#i50|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii50&quot;&gt;(50)&lt;/sup&gt;]] apareció

     &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, trayendo al segador en la grupa de su yegua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15--&gt; Los bandidos retrocedieron espantados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; se apeó muy despacio, descolgó su escopeta de dos
     cañones, y, apuntando a sus camaradas, dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Imbéciles! ¡Infames! ¡No sé cómo[[#p8n2|&lt;sup&gt;[8-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no os mato a
     todos!&amp;mdash;¡Pronto! ¡Entregad a este hombre los duros que
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20--&gt; le habéis robado![[#p8n3|&lt;sup&gt;[8-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los ladrones sacaron los veinte duros y se los[[#p8n4|&lt;sup&gt;[8-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] dieron al
     segador, el cual se arrojó a los pies de aquel personaje que
     dominaba a los bandoleros y que tan buen corazón tenía....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; le dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25--&gt; &amp;mdash;¡A la paz de Dios![[#p8n5|&lt;sup&gt;[8-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Sin las indicaciones de V., nunca
     hubiera dado con ellos.&lt;/i&gt; ¡Ya ve V. que desconfiaba de mí sin
     motivo!... He cumplido mi promesa.... Ahí tiene V.
     sus veinte duros....&amp;mdash;Conque... ¡en marcha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El segador lo abrazó repetidas veces[[#i51|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii51&quot;&gt;(51)&lt;/sup&gt;]] y se alejó lleno de júbilo.
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30--&gt; Pero no habría andado[[#p8n6|&lt;sup&gt;[8-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cincuenta pasos, cuando su bienhechor
     lo llamó de nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El pobre hombre se apresuró a volver pies atrás.[[#p8n7|&lt;sup&gt;[8-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué manda V.?&amp;mdash;le preguntó, deseando ser útil al que
     había devuelto la felicidad a su familia.
                &lt;!-- class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;p9&quot; id=&quot;p9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(p9)--&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¿Conoce V. a &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;mdash;le preguntó él mismo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No lo conozco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Te equivocas![[#i52|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii52&quot;&gt;(52)&lt;/sup&gt;]] (replicó el bandolero.) Yo soy &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El segador se quedó estupefacto.[[#p9n1|&lt;sup&gt;[9-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05--&gt;   &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; se echó la escopeta a la cara[[#p9n2|&lt;sup&gt;[9-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y descargó los dos

     tiros contra el segador, que cayó redondo[[#p9n3|&lt;sup&gt;[9-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] al suelo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Maldito seas![[#p9n4|&lt;sup&gt;[9-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;fué lo único que pronunció.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En medio del terror que me quitó la vista, observé que el
     árbol en que yo estaba atado se estremecía ligeramente y que

&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10--&gt; mis ligaduras se aflojaban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una de las balas, después de herir[[#i53|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii53&quot;&gt;(53)&lt;/sup&gt;]] al segador, había dado en
     la cuerda que me ligaba al tronco y la había roto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo disimulé que estaba libre, y esperé una ocasión para
     escaparme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15--&gt; Entretanto decía &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; a los suyos, señalando al segador:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Ahora podéis robarlo.&amp;mdash;Sois unos[[#i54|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii54&quot;&gt;(54)&lt;/sup&gt;]] imbéciles..., ¡unos
     canallas![[#p9n5|&lt;sup&gt;[9-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Dejar a ese hombre, para que se fuera, como se

     fué, dando gritos por los caminos reales!... Si conforme
     soy yo[[#p9n6|&lt;sup&gt;[9-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] quien se[[#p9n7|&lt;sup&gt;[9-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo encuentra y se entera de lo que pasaba,
&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20--&gt; hubieran sido los &lt;i&gt;migueletes&lt;/i&gt;[[#p9n8|&lt;sup&gt;[9-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] habría dado vuestras señas y las

     de nuestra guarida, como me las ha dado a mí, y estaríamos ya
     todos en la cárcel!&amp;mdash;¡Ved las consecuencias de robar sin
     matar!&amp;mdash;Conque basta ya de sermón y enterrad ese cadáver
     para que no apeste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25--&gt; Mientras los ladrones hacían el hoyo y &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; se sentaba a

     merendar dándome la espalda,[[#p9n9|&lt;sup&gt;[9-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] me alejé poco a poco[[#i55|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii55&quot;&gt;(55)&lt;/sup&gt;]] del árbol
     y me descolgué al barranco próximo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ya era de[[#i56|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii56&quot;&gt;(56)&lt;/sup&gt;]] noche. Protegido por sus sombras salí a todo
     escape,[[#p9n10|&lt;sup&gt;[9-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y, a la luz de las estrellas, divisé mi borrico, que comía

&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30--&gt; allí tranquilamente, atado a una encina. Montéme en él, y
     no he parado hasta llegar aquí....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Por consiguiente, señor, déme V. los mil reales, y yo daré las
     señas de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, el cual se ha quedado con[[#p9n11|&lt;sup&gt;[9-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mis tres duros y
     medio....
         &lt;!-- class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;p10&quot; id=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(p10)--&gt;

     Dictó el gitano la filiación del bandido; cobró desde luego[[#i57|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii57&quot;&gt;(57)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     la suma ofrecida, y salió de la Capitanía general, dejando asombrados
     al Conde del Montijo y al sujeto, allí presente, que nos
     ha contado todos estos pormenores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05--&gt;   Réstanos ahora saber si acertó o no acertó &lt;i&gt;Heredia&lt;/i&gt; al decir

     la buenaventura a &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(The first figures refer to the original pages of text, and second figures to the reference figures in text).

&lt;span name=&quot;p5n12&quot; id=&quot;p5n12&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;5-12: &lt;b&gt;a lo que me contó&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;in view of what... told me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p5n13&quot; id=&quot;p5n13&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;5-13: &lt;b&gt;se va al infierno&lt;/b&gt;: translate &lt;i&gt;disappears&lt;/i&gt;. (&lt;i&gt;Infierno&lt;/i&gt; =
infernal regions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n1&quot; id=&quot;p6n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-1: &lt;b&gt;ello es&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;the fact is&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n2&quot; id=&quot;p6n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-2: &lt;b&gt;llevarían&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;would live&lt;/i&gt;. Cf. &lt;i&gt;lleva diez años de casado&lt;/i&gt;, he
has been married ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n3&quot; id=&quot;p6n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-3: &lt;b&gt;de servicio&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;on service, on duty&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n4&quot; id=&quot;p6n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-4: &lt;b&gt;hijos&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n5&quot; id=&quot;p6n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-5: &lt;b&gt;voy de vuelta&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;I am returning&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n6&quot; id=&quot;p6n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-6: &lt;b&gt;cómo he de perder&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;how am I to suffer the loss&lt;/i&gt;? Cf. note
&lt;i&gt;había de conocer&lt;/i&gt;, p. 3, 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p6n7&quot; id=&quot;p6n7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-7: &lt;b&gt;no seas&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;don't be&lt;/i&gt;. Observe that the imperative is never used
negatively, being then replaced by the subjunctive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n1&quot; id=&quot;p7n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-1: &lt;b&gt;Alicante&lt;/b&gt;: a port on the eastern coast of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n2&quot; id=&quot;p7n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-2: &lt;b&gt;Sevilla&lt;/b&gt;: a city of southern Spain (Andalusia) on the
Guadalquivir River. Also (as here) the province in which this city is
situated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n3&quot; id=&quot;p7n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-3: &lt;b&gt;Preparen&lt;/b&gt;: (sc. &lt;i&gt;ustedes&lt;/i&gt;). This is an order addressed to the
bandit's comrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n4&quot; id=&quot;p7n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-4: &lt;b&gt;Tengo seis hijos&lt;/b&gt;: observe that &lt;i&gt;tener&lt;/i&gt; (to have) does not take
the preposition &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; before its personal direct object, which likewise
omits &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; when preceded by a numeral, unless certain specific persons
are referred to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n5&quot; id=&quot;p7n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-5: &lt;b&gt;lo que me digo&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; is an ethical dative (indicating the
person interested). Omit in translating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n6&quot; id=&quot;p7n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-6: &lt;b&gt;ustedes&lt;/b&gt;: the polite form &lt;i&gt;ustedes&lt;/i&gt; is in this single instance
substituted in the peasant's speech for &lt;i&gt;vosotros&lt;/i&gt;, by attraction after
the ceremonious word &lt;i&gt;Caballeros&lt;/i&gt;. Observe that the bandits end by
addressing the peasant as &lt;i&gt;usted&lt;/i&gt; likewise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n7&quot; id=&quot;p7n7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-7: &lt;b&gt;mis hijos... ¡Hijos míos!&lt;/b&gt;: observe the variant forms &lt;i&gt;mis&lt;/i&gt; and

&lt;i&gt;míos&lt;/i&gt;. For explanation see any grammar (possessive adjectives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p7n8&quot; id=&quot;p7n8&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-8: &lt;b&gt;el rey Nerón&lt;/b&gt;: (i.e. &lt;i&gt;el emperador&lt;/i&gt;). The Roman emperor Nero
(reigned A.D. 54-68) persecuted the Christians, burning them as torches
before his palace and making them fight with wild beasts in the arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n1&quot; id=&quot;p8n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-1: &lt;b&gt;¡Pues no quiere su dinero!&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;well! if he doesn't actually want
his money too&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n2&quot; id=&quot;p8n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-2: &lt;b&gt;No sé cómo&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;I don't know why&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n3&quot; id=&quot;p8n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-3: &lt;b&gt;le habéis robado&lt;/b&gt;: for dative &lt;i&gt;le&lt;/i&gt; cf. note &lt;i&gt;tomado a este
hombre&lt;/i&gt;, p. 4, 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n4&quot; id=&quot;p8n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-4: &lt;b&gt;se los&lt;/b&gt;: cf. note &lt;i&gt;se la&lt;/i&gt;, p. 4, 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n5&quot; id=&quot;p8n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-5: &lt;b&gt;¡A la paz de Dios!&lt;/b&gt;: (a familiar formula of leavetaking) &lt;i&gt;God
be with you, good-by&lt;/i&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n6&quot; id=&quot;p8n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-6: &lt;b&gt;No habría andado&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;he could not have gone&lt;/i&gt;. The conditional
mood is often employed to express conjecture as to a (usually) past
event, just as the future indicative is used to express conjecture about
a (usually) present event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p8n7&quot; id=&quot;p8n7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-7: &lt;b&gt;volver pies atrás&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;retrace his steps&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n1&quot; id=&quot;p9n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-1: &lt;b&gt;estupefacto&lt;/b&gt;: words having originally an initial &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; followed
by a consonant prefix an &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; on becoming Spanish, as: &lt;i&gt;estupor&lt;/i&gt;, stupor;

&lt;i&gt;escuela&lt;/i&gt;, school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n2&quot; id=&quot;p9n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-2: &lt;b&gt;se echó... a la cara&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;brought up to a level with his face&lt;/i&gt;.
Cf. also note &lt;i&gt;la mano&lt;/i&gt;, p. 4, 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n3&quot; id=&quot;p9n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-3: &lt;b&gt;cayó redondo&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;fell suddenly&lt;/i&gt; (collapsed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n4&quot; id=&quot;p9n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-4: &lt;b&gt;maldito seas&lt;/b&gt;: a rather exceptional use of the subjunctive for
the imperative, though common with the verb &lt;i&gt;ser&lt;/i&gt;. Cf. last line, page
124.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n5&quot; id=&quot;p9n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-5: &lt;b&gt;unos canallas&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;canalla&lt;/i&gt; is feminine in its usual collective
meaning: &lt;i&gt;rabble&lt;/i&gt;. Applied to an individual, however, it agrees in
gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n6&quot; id=&quot;p9n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-6: &lt;b&gt;Si conforme soy yo&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;if, just as it was&lt;/i&gt; (lit. &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n7&quot; id=&quot;p9n7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-7: &lt;b&gt;se&lt;/b&gt;: (ethical dative). Cf. note &lt;i&gt;lo que me digo&lt;/i&gt;, p. 7, 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n8&quot; id=&quot;p9n8&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-8: &lt;b&gt;migueletes&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;militiamen&lt;/i&gt;, serving as police for the
suppression of brigandage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n9&quot; id=&quot;p9n9&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-9: &lt;b&gt;dándome la espalda&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;turning his back on me&lt;/i&gt;. Cf. note &lt;i&gt;la
mano&lt;/i&gt;, p. 4, 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n10&quot; id=&quot;p9n10&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-10: &lt;b&gt;a todo escape&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;with the utmost velocity&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p9n11&quot; id=&quot;p9n11&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;9-11: &lt;b&gt;se ha quedado con&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;has kept&lt;/i&gt; (lit. &lt;i&gt;has remained with&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt; Quince días después de la escena que acabamos de[[#i58|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii58&quot;&gt;(58)&lt;/sup&gt;]] referir,
     y a eso de las nueve de la mañana, muchísima gente ociosa

     presenciaba, en la calle de San Juan de Dios y parte de la de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; San Felipe de aquella misma capital, la reunión de dos compañías
     de migueletes que debían[[#i59|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii59&quot;&gt;(59)&lt;/sup&gt;]] salir a las nueve y media en
     busca de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, cuyo paradero, así como sus señas personales
     y las de todos sus compañeros de fechorías, había al fin averiguado

     el Conde del Montijo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; El interés y emoción del público eran extraordinarios, y no
     menos la solemnidad con que los migueletes se despedían[[#i60|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii60&quot;&gt;(60)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de
     sus familias y amigos para marchar a tan importante empresa.
     ¡Tal espanto había llegado a infundir &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; a todo el antiguo

     reino granadino!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Parece que ya vamos a &lt;i&gt;formar&lt;/i&gt;... (dijo un miguelete a
     otro[[#p10n1|&lt;sup&gt;[10-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[#i61|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii61&quot;&gt;(61)&lt;/sup&gt;]]), y no veo al cabo López....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Extraño es, a fe mía,[[#p10n2|&lt;sup&gt;[10-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pues él llega siempre antes que
     nadie[[#p10n3|&lt;sup&gt;[10-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cuando se trata de salir en busca de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, a quien
     odia con sus cinco sentidos![[#p10n4|&lt;sup&gt;[10-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues ¿no sabéis lo que pasa?&amp;mdash;dijo un tercer miguelete,
     tomando parte en la conversación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hola! Es nuestro nuevo camarada....&amp;mdash;¿Cómo te
     va en nuestro Cuerpo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Perfectamente!&amp;mdash;respondió el interrogado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Era éste un hombre pálido y de porte distinguido, del cual
     se despegaba mucho el traje de soldado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Conque ¿decías....&amp;mdash;replicó el primero.

           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p11&quot; id=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p11)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡Ah! ¡Sí! Que el cabo López ha fallecido....&amp;mdash;respondió
     el miguelete pálido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt;.... ¿Qué dices?&amp;mdash;¡Eso no puede ser!...&amp;mdash;Yo

     mismo he visto a López esta mañana, como te veo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   a ti....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El llamado &lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt;[[#p11n1|&lt;sup&gt;[11-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] contestó fríamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues hace media hora que lo ha matado &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¿Parrón?&lt;/i&gt; ¿Dónde?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Aquí mismo! ¡En Granada! En la Cuesta del Perro[[#p11n2|&lt;sup&gt;[11-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; se ha encontrado el cadáver de López.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todos quedaron silenciosos y &lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt; empezó a silbar una

     canción patriótica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Van once[[#p11n3|&lt;sup&gt;[11-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] migueletes en seis días! (exclamó un sargento.)
     ¡&lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; se ha propuesto exterminarnos!&amp;mdash;Pero ¿cómo

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; es que está en Granada? ¿No íbamos á buscarlo a la Sierra de
     Loja?[[#p11n4|&lt;sup&gt;[11-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt; dejó de silbar, y dijo con su acostumbrada
     indiferencia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Una vieja que presenció el delito dice que, luego que[[#i62|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii62&quot;&gt;(62)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; mató a López, ofreció que, si íbamos á buscarlo, tendríamos el
     gusto de verlo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Camarada! ¡Disfrutas de una calma asombrosa!
     ¡Hablas de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; con un desprecio!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues ¿qué es &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; más que un hombre?&amp;mdash;repuso
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt; con altanería.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡A la formación!&amp;mdash;gritaron en este acto varias voces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Formaron las dos compañías, y comenzó la lista nominal.[[#p11n5|&lt;sup&gt;[11-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En tal momento acertó a pasar por allí el gitano &lt;i&gt;Heredia&lt;/i&gt;,
     el cual se paró, como todos, a ver aquella lucidísima
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; tropa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Notóse entonces que &lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt;, el nuevo miguelete, dió un retemblido
     y retrocedió un poco, como para ocultarse detrás de[[#i63|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii63&quot;&gt;(63)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     sus compañeros....
             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p12&quot; id=&quot;p12&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p12)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Al propio tiempo &lt;i&gt;Heredia&lt;/i&gt; fijó en él sus ojos; y dando un

     grito y un salto como si le hubiese picado una víbora, arrancó
     a correr[[#p12n1|&lt;sup&gt;[12-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] hacia la calle de San Jerónimo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt; se echó la carabina a la cara y apuntó al gitano....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero otro miguelete tuvo tiempo de mudar la dirección del

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   arma,[[#p12n2|&lt;sup&gt;[12-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y el tiro se perdió en el aire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Está loco! ¡&lt;i&gt;Manuel&lt;/i&gt; se ha vuelto[[#i64|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii64&quot;&gt;(64)&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;loco&lt;/i&gt;! ¡Un miguelete
     ha perdido el juicio!&amp;mdash;exclamaron sucesivamente los mil espectadores

     de aquella escena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y oficiales, y sargentos, y paisanos rodeaban a aquel hombre,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; que pugnaba por escapar, y al que por lo mismo sujetaban con
     mayor fuerza, abrumándolo a[[#i65|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii65&quot;&gt;(65)&lt;/sup&gt;]] preguntas, reconvenciones y dicterios
     que no le arrancaron contestación alguna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entretanto &lt;i&gt;Heredia&lt;/i&gt; había sido preso en la plaza de la
     Universidad por algunos transeuntes, que, viéndole correr
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; después de haber sonado aquel tiro, lo tomaron por un
     malhechor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Llevadme a la Capitanía general! (decía el gitano.)
     ¡Tengo que[[#i66|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii66&quot;&gt;(66)&lt;/sup&gt;]] hablar con el Conde del Montijo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Qué Conde del Montijo ni qué niño muerto![[#p12n3|&lt;sup&gt;[12-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (le respondieron
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; sus aprehensores.)&amp;mdash;¡Ahí están los migueletes, y ellos

     verán lo que hay que hacer[[#p12n4|&lt;sup&gt;[12-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con tu persona!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues lo mismo me da[[#p12n5|&lt;sup&gt;[12-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... (respondió Heredia.)&amp;mdash;Pero
     tengan Vds. cuidado[[#i67|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii67&quot;&gt;(67)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de que no me mate &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Cómo Parrón?...¿Qué dice este hombre?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Venid y veréis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así diciendo, el gitano se hizo conducir delante del[[#i68|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii68&quot;&gt;(68)&lt;/sup&gt;]] jefe de
     los migueletes, y señalando a Manuel, dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Mi Comandante, ¡ése es &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, y yo soy el gitano que
     dió hace quince días sus señas al Conde del Montijo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡&lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;! ¡&lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt; está preso! ¡Un miguelete era

     &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;!...&amp;mdash;gritaron muchas voces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No me cabe duda[[#i69|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii69&quot;&gt;(69)&lt;/sup&gt;]].... (decía entretanto el Comandante,
     leyendo las señas que le había dado el Capitán general.)&amp;mdash;¡A
     fe que[[#p12n6|&lt;sup&gt;[12-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] hemos estado torpes!&amp;mdash;Pero ¿a quién se le hubiera &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p13&quot; id=&quot;p13&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p13)&lt;/span --&gt;

     ocurrido buscar al capitán de ladrones entre los migueletes que
     iban a prenderlo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Necio de mí![[#p13n1|&lt;sup&gt;[13-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (exclamaba al mismo tiempo &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, mirando
     al gitano con ojos de león herido): ¡es el único hombre

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   a quien he perdonado la vida! ¡Merezco lo que me pasa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A la semana siguiente[[#i70|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii70&quot;&gt;(70)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ahorcaron a &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cumplióse, pues, literalmente la &lt;i&gt;buenaventura&lt;/i&gt; del gitano....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lo cual (dicho sea para concluir dignamente) no significa
     que debáis creer en la infalibilidad de tales vaticinios, ni menos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; que fuera acertada regla de conducta la de &lt;i&gt;Parrón&lt;/i&gt;, de matar a
     todos los que llegaban a conocerle....&amp;mdash;Significa tan sólo[[#p13n2|&lt;sup&gt;[13-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     que los caminos de la Providencia son inescrutables[[#p13n3|&lt;sup&gt;[13-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para la
     razón humana;&amp;mdash;doctrina que, a mi juicio, no puede ser más
     ortodoxa.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Guadix, 1853.&lt;/p&gt;

ALL ABOUT EDUCATION IN THE US OF A

Why Study in the U.S? 
  
  
Of the 1.2 million students pursuing postsecondary education outside their home countries, more than one-third choose to study in the United States. Why do so many students from all over the world choose U.S. colleges and universities? What does the United States have to offer you.

Academic Excellence 

The United States has one of the world`s finest university systems, with outstanding programs in virtually all fields. At the undergraduate level, excellent programs exist in traditional disciplines as well as in professional fields. At the graduate level, students often have the opportunity to work directly with some of the finest minds in the world. U.S. degrees are recognized throughout the world for the excellence. 

Variety of Educational Opportunities 

The higher education system in the United States has something for everyone. Some U.S. colleges and universities stress abroad educational principles: others stress practical, employment-related skills; and still others specialize in technical fields, the arts, or social sciences. As a result, if you are looking for an institution where you can study a particular field - no matter how unusual or specific - you can usually find several from which to choose in the United States. 

Cutting-Edge Technology 

U.S. universities pride themselves on being at the forefront of technology and educational techniques, and in making available to their students the best possible equipment and resources. Even if your field does not directly involve science or engineering, you will become skilled in using the latest technology to obtain and process information. You will find ways to stay connected with people in your field all over the world. 

Opportunity for Research, Teaching and Training 

If you are a graduate student, you may be able to gain valuable experience in research or teaching while you help to finance your education. This practical component of your education will prove useful in your future career and may give you insights into your field that would not be possible through course study alone. International students are some of the most valued researchers and teachers in U.S. universities because they bring new skills and ideas to the classroom and laboratory. Many graduate programs in the United States offer training that enables students to become teaching of research assistants. 

Flexibility 

Although many programs are highly structured, you will generally find many course choices. At the advanced stages of a degree you will be able to tailor y our course work to fit your specific needs. When you choose topics for independent study for a graduate thesis or dissertation, you can emphasize ideas that are important to you, your field, and your country. 

Support Services for International Students 

At most institutions, services from the international student office help students from abroad to live and learn in their new environment. From orientation programs at the beginning of your degree program to assistance with resumes as your get ready to graduate, you will find people at the university and in the community who are interested in your success. 

Campus Life 

U.S. universities provide a rich variety of academic, cultural and athletic activities that add new dimensions to your educational experience and also help you make new friends. 

Global Education 

Experience in an international setting is a marketable commodity. Your long-term career prospects can be enhanced by and experience that develops self-confidence, independence, and cross-cultural skills - attributes that are in high demand with employers worldwide. 
 
Education System in the US 
  
 In the United States, students begin higher education after completing 12 years of primary and secondary school. Institutions of higher education include two-year colleges (known as community or junior colleges), four-year colleges, universities, institutes of technology, vocational and technical schools, and professional schools such as law and medical schools. Higher educations is available in public (government support) and private (no government support) institutions, institutions affiliated with religious groups, and profit-making institutions - a wide variety. Size varies too. Some excellent colleges enroll fewer than a thousand students; some large universities enroll 50,000 or more students. 

The underlying purpose of institutions varies: some provide a basic ‘liberal arts’ education; others concentrate on technical education; still others focus on music or art or the professions. Experts at U.S. educational advising centers around the world can help you sort through these categories. 

The United States government does not recognize or approve colleges and universities as does the ministry of education in many countries. Instead the U.S. Department of Education reviews and recognizes ‘accrediting agencies’ that in turn assure the quality of educational institutions and programs. Be sure that the universities in which you are interested are accredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education. Most colleges and universities have what is called ‘regional accreditation’ from an agency that has jurisdiction over the region of the country in which they are located. Accreditation assures you that the institution has met certain academic, administrative, and fiscal standards. Accreditation also assures you that your degree will be recognized by other educational institutions and by employers. 

Certain fields of study will also have ‘program accreditation’ in addition to regional accreditation. For example, the Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology accredits engineering programs. Your overseas educational adviser can help you find out if program accreditation exists for your field of study. 

U.S. Students 

Nearly 15 million U.S. students are enrolled in higher education in the United States. They come from all economic brackets and from all social backgrounds. Education is mandatory in the United States to age 16 and the majority of students do finish high school. More than half of the students who complete high school in the United States enter higher education in one from or another. About 37 percent of young people between the ages of 19 and 24 in the United States are enrolled in higher education, but not all U.S. students enter college or university immediately after high school; some delay their entrance in order to earn money to pay for their education. Once enrolled, many American students work full or part time to finance their university studies. 

International Students 

During 1996-1997, 458,000 international students were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities, making up 3.2 percent of the total enrollment in U.S. higher education. The most popular fields of study among international students are business and management (20 percent) and engineering(16 percent). Large research universities enrolled 42 percent of all international students. International students are enrolled 42 percent of all international students. International students are enrolled in greater proportions at the higher academic levels; thus they comprise only 2.5 percent of all bachelor`s degree students, about 10 percent of graduate students, and 33 percent of all doctoral students. Approximately one-half of the doctoral degrees awarded by U.S. institutions in engineering, mathematics, and the physical and biological sciences are earned by international students. More than 81 percent of undergraduate international students finance their education primarily from personal and family resources; the same is true for 48 percent of international graduate students. 

Undergraduate Education 

The undergraduate bachelor`s degree typically takes four years to complete. At most institutions those years are known as the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years of undergraduate study. Many students compete their first two years at a junior or community college, earning an associate degree, and then transfer to a four year college or university to complete two more years for a bachelor`s degree. The curriculum of many undergraduate program is based on ‘liberal arts philosophy’ that requires students to take courses from a range of subjects to form a broad educational foundation. During the first two years, students have the opportunity to explore various fields of study such as social sciences, humanities, and natural or physical sciences. These courses are often called a ‘core curriculum’ or ‘distributions requirements.’ By the end of the second year, students at many institutions are asked to choose a specific field of study, known as the major, on which they will focus for the remainder of the undergraduate program. Students then spend the next two years taking more courses directly related to their major. Students who major in certain fields such as business, engineering, or science find that the curriculum is more tightly structured than it is in the humanities or social sciences. Business, science, and engineering majors may have to take more courses related to their major field of study and have fewer ‘elective,’ or optional, courses. 

Graduate Education 

Graduate education can result in a variety of degrees. The most common include the master`s of arts(MA), sciences(MS), business administration(MBA), fine arts(MFA), law(LLM), social work(MSW), and specialist in education(EdS). The most common final, or ‘terminal,’ degrees are doctorates in a variety of fields(PhD), education(EdD), law(JD), science(DSc), medicine(MD), and religion or divinity(DD). 

Master`s degrees are the most frequently awarded graduate degrees. Nearly 400, 000 master`s degrees were awarded by U.S. institutions in 1995. It is possible to earn a master`s degree in one year, but more often it will take two to three years. In general, master`s degrees require that you complete six to eight courses, in addition to a project or thesis (a long research paper). 

A doctorate usually requires five to seven years of study following receipt of the bachelor`s degree. It may take less time to obtain a doctorate if you enter the doctoral program with a competed master`s degree. Unlike undergraduates, graduate students begin specialized study on the first day of classes. You will probably be required to take certain courses and may be allowed as few as two or three electives. A doctoral program includes the writing of a dissertation involving original research. The dissertation may involve a year or more of research and at least a year or writing. U.S. institutions awarded more than 44,000 doctorates in 1995. 

Research is a central feature of most graduate programs at U.S. colleges and universities. U.S. faculty are expected to engage in original research in their academic field, in addition to teaching and helping to run the university. Most of the research in the United States is supported by various agencies of the U.S. federal government. Faculty members apply to those agencies for funding to support their research. Part of the research money is used to pay salaries of researchers, some of whom are graduate students. 

Other Options 

Other types of programs are offered in many settings, some outside the traditional university setting. Possibilities include short-term technical training opportunities, certificate programs, and other vocational opportunities. For example, a two-month museum studies program would not result in a degree but would offer the student valuable practical experience and a certificate or completion. 
 
Is US the Right Choice for You? 
  
 Studying in the United States is a serious and expensive undertaking. To decide if it is the best option for you, consider carefully how it will fit into your long-term educational and professional plans. Key questions to answer include: 

· What are your goals? 
· Do you have the academic preparation necessary to achieve those goals? 
· Do you have adequate proficiency in English? 
· Do you have enough money? · Are you prepared to live in another country and culture for the time it takes to earn a degree? 


What are you goals? 

Studying in the United States is not an end unto itself. Students pursue higher education, in their home country or abroad, because the experience will help them achieve their professional and personal goals. Those goals may include professional advancements, a higher-paying job, or a greater appreciation and knowledge of the world. 

As you define your educational and professional goals, here are some questions to ask yourself: 

· Am I willing to spend this much time in higher education? 
· Is there a need for my chosen profession in my home country? 
· Will earn enough in this profession to justify the investment? 
· Will my U.S. educational credentials be recognized at home by institutions of higher education, professional licensing boards, and potential employers when I return? 
· Will spending time abroad cause me to miss important opportunities at home? 
· Is the knowledge I will gain during my study in the United States readily transferable to situations in my home country? 
· Will the technological expertise I acquire in the United States be of use at home? 
· Is the training or education I need available at home 

Are you academically prepared? 

If you are applying for undergraduate study at a two- or four-year U.S. university, you must have completed at least 12 years of school and obtained the equivalent of a U.S. high school diploma. If you are considering graduate study at the master`s or doctoral level, you will need an academic credential equivalent to a U.S. bachelor`s degree. 

Some U.S. universities are very competitive, selecting only students with excellent grades and test scores as well as leadership skills. Many U.S. universities are less selective, but almost all require some demonstration that you have succeeded in y our previous schooling and that you have the potential to succeed at a more advanced level. Most graduate schools also require a minimum grade point average of 3.0 from previous study. 

Be realistic about your academic record and test scores. Apply to universities whose requirements match your academic background and interests Be aware that graduate work in the United States involve a great deal of independent work and classroom discussion, forms of learning that may be different from what you have experienced. 

U.S. colleges and universities place a great deal of emphasis on neat, organized, and clearly written presentation. Almost nothing is accepted in handwriting; projects and term papers should be typed or produced on a computer. More and more research at campus libraries is conducted using computers to access on-line resources instead of books. Most universities will issue students a personal electronic mail account upon enrollment and expect them to use it for homework assignments. 

Do you have adequate English? 

Most universities will require undergraduate and graduate students to probe their English language ability as part of the admissions process by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The level of proficiency required varies from school to school and from department to department, but it is important to remember that the more prepared you are before you begin study, the more confident you will feel as a student in the United States. 

It is an advantage to have a good command of written and spoken English from the very beginning of the application profess. Some universities will require applicants to submit at least one essay as part of their application; others may request an interview or teleconference with you to hear how you express yourself in English. 

Do you have enough money? 

When considering the cost of a U.S. education, include the costs of tuition, living expenses, books, and other items. Tuitions varies widely from university to university, but it is usually always the largest single cost and international student faces. A community college may have a yearly tuition of $2,000; a highly selective private university may have yearly costs for tuition, room and board of $28,000. Sources of financial aid available to international students at the undergraduate level are limited and highly competitive. 

Your financial plans should cover your entire program. An undergraduate degree in the United States takes an average of four to five years to complete. Master`s programs may last one to three years. Doctoral programs may take anywhere from five to seven years, depending on your field of study and previous education. Non-degree or vocational programs last anywhere from several months to two years. 

Be realistic if you plan to bring your family with your during your time in the United States. You will probably need an additional $5,000 per year to bring your spouse with you and an extra $4,000 per year for each child. Health insurance is a necessity for living in the United States; budget for these costs as well. The cost of health insurance varies but generally ranges from $3,500 to $4,000 per year for a family. 

Are you prepared to live in another country and culture? 

Living in the United States for an extended period of time while pursuing your educational goals is much different from visiting the country for few weeks or months as a tourist. Give some thought to how living in a new environment and a new culture might change you, and the additional changes you may need to make upon your return home. Consider whether you have the skills to live independently in a new culture. You will likely be separated from family and friends for a long period. If you do bring your family, consider their adjustments as well. 

Resourcefulness, creativity, and realistic planning are all key factors in determining whether you will succeed in your plan to study in the United States. 
 
  
 
The Right Program 
  
 Be sure that the U.S. institutions that interest you are accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Accreditation assures you that the university has met certain standards. A degree from a non accredited institution may not be recognized by other educational institutions or by employers.

Quality 

Because of Size and variety of higher education in the United States, the quality of any given institution and its programs, even when accredited, is hard to determine. The most expensive institution is not necessarily the best, Nor is every program at a highly regarded institution necessarily of the same high quality. 

For graduate students, the research and publication records of the faculty in your chosen department are probably the best measures of quality, although even a ‘good’ department might not have a top processor in the specialization that you are looking for. Ask your current professors for advice and guidance. They are usually the best sources of information on the quality of a graduate program. 

Factors that can affect the quality of the education available to undergraduates include: 

· Class size: are all classes taught in a lecture format, or are smaller seminars and discussion sessions available for undergraduates? 
· Opportunities for independent research and direct work with faculty: are there service learning opportunities, undergraduate research programs, and an honors program? 
· Educational background of the student body: is the institution nonselective (‘open enrollment’), selective, competitive, or highly competitive? 


Other Educational Factors 

Graduate students will want to consider the type and number of research or study facilities available. For example, you may want to know how many libraries the school has, how many volumes those libraries contain, and whether students can borrow books from libraries at other institutions using inter-library loan. 

In addition to finding out about the library, look for information about special research collections, laboratories, and other facilities that can affect your education opportunities. The more information about the university you can obtain ahead of time, the easier it will be for you to decide where you want to study. 

For undergraduates, if you think you know what discipline you want to pursue, look at the size of the department, the breadth of its offerings, and related departments. If you are less certain of your choice or major, you might want to consider a larger institution where you would have more options. For undergraduates, the ambiance or mood of a campus can be an important factor. Some universities may stress friendliness, community involvement, and personal attention. Others may stress independence and offer less personal advising and supervision. It is important to read an institution`s promotional material to determine whether a campus is going to suit y our and your needs. 

Cost 

Tuition costs vary enormously from one institution to the next, ranging from $2,000 to $28,000 per year. In some cases scholarships or other types of financial assistance may be available through the institution; in other cases the source may be a private foundation, a private company, or your home government. Financial assistance may come in the form of scholarships, grants, loans, teaching assistantships, research assistantships, or tuition reductions. It is important in your selection process to keep tuition rates and the availability or unavailability of financial assistance in mind. 

When choosing an institution, you will also want to consider the cost of living in the surrounding area. You will find that cost of living varies greatly in different parts of the country and even between different cities in the same state. visit: www.InternationalStudentLoan.com

If your English skills are very limited, you may need to attend an English language institute before beginning your degree program. you may wish to select a university that offers an English-as-a-second-language (ESL) program preceding academic enrollment. 

Conditional or provisional admission may be offered to you if your academic or professional qualifications are very good but your English needs additional improvement. If you are given conditional or provisional admission, you may be required to complete English language courses or retake standardized language proficiency tests before being allowed to enroll in certain courses. You may have to satisfy this condition during your first or second term. 

It is very important to know the university`s policies on English-language testing and classes. When you are admitted to an institution, you should carefully examine the documents in your admission packet to determine whether you will be required to enroll in ESL courses. 

If you are an international graduate student and are interested in applying for a graduate teaching or laboratory assistantship, you will need to pay particular attention to any special English-language or other preparation programs that may be required for such assistantships - visit: www.ESLdirectory.com 

Access to Health Care 

Many universities have student health centers that offer basic medical care at little or no cost to students. If you know that you have a specific medical condition or will require regular medical care, you will want to locate a university that has adequate student health services and is located near a comprehensive medical center. Remember that health care for major illnesses or accidents can be extremely expensive in the United States, so health insurance is essential. 

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 protects the rights of all students, both U.S. and international, to have the opportunity to participate fully in the programs and services of a college or university. Many campuses have offices with specially trained staff to provide support services for students with disabilities. If you have a disability, you will want to find out about the special facilities or resources available to you. If a university has other students with the same or a related disability, this may indicate that the university can accommodate your special need. visit: www.InternationalStudentInsurance.com 

Housing 

Housing is an important consideration, especially if you are married and want your family to accompany you to the United States while you are studying. Some universities offer married-students housing on campus. In many locations you can find reasonably priced apartments or houses for rent. If you are single, you may want to live in a campus residence hall with an American roommate. Be aware that some urban universities have little or no student housing. 

Safety 

Personal safety is important to people everywhere. It is customary for public institution in the United States to make available statistics about the types and numbers of crimes that occur on their campuses. Even though it is unlikely that you would be a victim, crime can happen anywhere. So regardless of where you choose to study, you should learn about common safety and crime prevention strategies. 

Social Activities 

Most universities offer a wide array of clubs and organizations representing student interests. You will find cultural and religious associations, sports teams and sports clubs, volunteer service organizations, academic societies, music and theater groups, international student organizations, and many other opportunities for social activiety. All of these activities are good opportunities to meet others and develop friendships. Certain types of institutions will offer fewer social activities. ‘Commuter campuses’ in urban areas, for example, cater to part-time American students and do not concentrate on student social activities. 

Excellent Colleges and universities are found all around the United States, in cities large and small, as well as in small towns and rural areas. Do not think that all of the best universities are located in large cities; it simply is not so. Consider whether you might prefer living near the ocean, near the mountains, or in the plains. 

Location and Climate 

Climate may be important to you. Student from hot, dry climates may be uncomfortable studying in humid climates or in areas that have a full range of seasons including very cold weather. You should be able to find detailed information about the weather conditions and average seasonal temperatures through the resources at your educational advising center or on the World Wide Web. 

Practicing Your Religion 

It may be very important to you to be a part of a religious community while you are studying in the United States. Muslim students, for example, might want to be sure there is a mosque in their campus community. 


Financing Your Education 
  
 Careful planning is both necessary and wise. You will required to prove to the university, to the consular officer (the person at the U.S. Consulate who issues visa stamps), and perhaps to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service that you have sufficient funds to cover your living expenses (housing, food, clothing, etc.) and health insurance, as well as university`s tuition and fees. 

So how much money will you need? You can get a general idea about expenses by looking at catalogs or application information provided by the university. Remember, however, that tuition rates vary tremendously. State (public) universities are generally, but not always, less expensive than private institutions. Some private institutions may be able to offer scholarships that state schools can not. Two-year or community colleges are usually less expensive than colleges and universities offering bachelor`s and graduate degrees. 

The cost of living in different parts of the United States also varies. In general, living in urban areas (in or near a big city) is more expensive than living in smaller towns or rural areas. Renting an apartment in a big city can cost twice as much as it does in a smaller town because there is such high demand for housing in large U.S. cities. Likewise, food, clothing, entertainment, and other living expenses may be more expensive in a city. 

Budgeting is a continuous process. At this stage, work on a ‘big picture’ budge that will include tuition, room and board, transportation, and living expenses, Later you can be more specific, taking into consideration all the additional expenses of moving and settling in. One very important factor in the ‘big picture’ budget is health insurance, which can be as little as $1,000 annually for an individual or as much as $5,000 for a family.

Funding Packages 

Many international students put together a funding ‘package’ from a variety of sources. You should explore the options your government or home university has available for students studying overseas. Many governments offer scholarships and low-interest or no-interest loans for academically promising students. Some international organizations offer scholarships and grants to students pursuing degree program in specific fields. Some private companies in your country may offer scholarships to bright students who wish to study abroad. The best source of information an such scholarships is the educational advising center. 

Even if you are lucky enough to receive funding from sources such as the ones mentioned above, nearly all international students have to rely on personal and family funds as well. It is not uncommon for a family to use a substantial portion of their savings to pay for an education abroad. Your savings (or you family`s) may be the only reliable source of funding you have as you begin your program of studies in the United States. In any case, the burden will be on you to explore funding options and secure the resources necessary for your studies. It can be challenging, and sometimes frustrating, particularly if your family funds are limited. 

Undergraduate Assistance from U.S. Source 

Many U.S. colleges and universities offer limited financial aid for international students through their financial aid offices. In general, however, there is much less money available for undergraduate study in the United States than there is for graduate study. Private institutions can sometimes discount or reduce the costs of tuition; public institutions seldom have this option. You should request information about financial aid when you request an application form from the institution`s admissions office. In some instances, it may be possible for you to participate in a formal exchange between your home institution and the institution you wish to attend in the United States. You can get more information on such exchanges by contacting the international student offices at the U.S. institution or by contacting the corresponding office at your institution. This kind of person-for-person exchange can reduce expenses in some instances. 

Graduate Assistance from U.S. Sources 

Many graduate departments at U.S. universities offer teaching assistantships or research assistantships to their graduate students (students pursuing a master`s or doctoral degree). Assistantships usually involve a tuition award and some sort of salary in return for teaching or research duties. Such funds are generally controlled by individual departments at the university. It is often the case that a department will want to see how good a student you are and what kind of adjustment you make to university life before t will be willing to invest money in your education. In some cases, a department will accept only as many students as it can support with teaching or research assistantships. Although you will find some information about assistantships in a catalog or on university Websites, you may have to write directly to the department to inquire about this kind of funding. This exchange of information may occur after you have been accepted into the program. It is also important to inquire and apply early if you hope to receive financial assistance from the U.S. institution. Often deadlines for scholarships and assistantships are months before the normal application deadline. 

Even if you are lucky enough to receive aid, you will still have to have sufficient funds to travel to the United States, and at least enough money to cover your first month`s expenses. 

Financial Documentation for Admission and Visa Purposes 

Once you have selected the university you wish to attend, you will need to provide documentation to prove that you have at least the minimum amount of money the university estimates you will need. Providing that documentation is part of the admission process. Schools require a newly admitted student to submit proof of one year of funding (less if your program is under one year in duration). Acceptable forms of proof of funding are scholarship and award letters from your university, government, or sponsoring agency; sponsorship letters from private companies; personal bank statements; and affidavits of support for rela6tives or friends. Affidavits of support are formal, often notarized (formally witnessed), statements of financial support and should be accompanied by the bank statement of the individual who promises the funds. All financial documents should be in English or translated into English by a certified translator. They should specify precise amounts in U.S. dollars. Ask your bank to calculate and specify the U.S. dollar equivalency on your bank statement. Your name should be clearly indicated on each document of support. Generic or vague letters of support are not acceptable under any circumstances. 

Your school, college, or university must evaluate your financial documentation before a certificate of eligibility for a student visa can be issued. The Form I-20 is the certificate of eligibility for the F-1 student visa. This document, which generally comes to you along with the letter of acceptance to the university, is used to secure a visa and to enter the United States. Students who plan to pursue a full-time program of study and are supported by personal or family funds, private sponsors, or funds from the school usually apply for an F-1 visa. The I-20 is an indication to the consular officer that the university has found you to be academically admissible, financial capable, and liguistically prepared for your studies in the United States. 

Students whose studies are primarily funded by their government, international agencies, private company sponsors, or the school may request in IAP-66, which is the certificate of eligibility for the J-1 exchange visitor visa. If you are awarded a scholarship or grant from a government or sponsoring agency, you may be required by the sponsor to apply for a J-1 rather than an F-1 visa. J-1 students cannot be supported solely with personal or family funds. 

Once you receive your I-20 or IAP-66 from your school, take the form, along with original documents of financial support, to the U.S. embassy or consulate in your country to apply for your student visa. 

Employment Restrictions 

As you begin to think about funding sources for your educational and living expenses in the United States, remember that you cannot count on working in the United States unless you have been granted a teaching or research assistantship. When you submit evidence of your financial resources, you cannot reply on potential income. The income on which you base your application must be assured and must be equal to or exceed the costs of the first year of your studies. 

Immigration regulations are very strict with respect to working while carrying a student visa. F-1 status, which is the most common status for full-time international students, allows for part time, on-campus employment (fewer than 20 hours per week.) J-1 student status allows for similar employment, with similar restrictions, as long as permission is given by the exchange visitor program sponsor. M-1 visa holders for technical and vocational programs are not permitted to work during the course of their studies. 

Jobs available on campus typically do not pay much, certainly not enough to finance a university education. Do not count on this kind of a job for anything more than a supplement to other funds. 

Careful long- and short-term planning are necessary to ensure that you will have a rewarding educational experience in the United States. If you are realistic about your financial needs, you will be better able to enjoy the exciting academic and cultural experience of living and learning in the United States. 
 
  
 
Applying for Visa 
  
 Even after the most careful investigation of your study options, you probably have many questions about living and learning in the United States. The nearest U.S. educational advising center should be able to provide you with pre-departure materials and may organize pre-departure orientation programs for students from your country or region. Such orientations often include practical information on visas, passports, travel , and cultural and academic life. Some offer participants the chance to meet fellow students who have recently spent time in the United States. 

Applying for your visa 

Once you are admitted to a college or university in the United States, you will need to obtain a student visa to enter the United States. Apply for your visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate using the I-20 or IAP-66 that your U.S. college, university, or sponsoring agency sent you for this purpose. If you are accepted by several institutions, do not apply for a visa until you decide which you will attend, and then use that institution`s form. 

You will need various documents to support your visa application. Prepare carefully for your visit to the U.S. embassy or consulate. Read all documents thoroughly, so that you know exactly what you are agreeing to when you enter the United States on a student visa. Visa procedures vary slightly from one consulate or embassy to another. Check with the office where you will apply to determine exactly what supporting documentation will be required of you. Several items are generally required: 

· A current, valid passport (not required of Canadians) 
· An I-20 form for the F-1 visa or an IAP-66 form for the J-1 visa 
· Evidence of financial support for the period of time and amount indicated on the I-20 or IAP-66 form 
· Proof that you have a permanent residence outside the United States 
· One or more passport-type photographs 
· A nonimmigrant visa application 


Additional application materials may be requested by the visa officer to prove your eligibility. 

These may include: 

· evidence of English proficiency 
· school records to verify academic preparation 
· additional evidence of strong ties to your home country or 
· of your ability to support yourself while in the United States. 


An application fee or a short interview may be required. The consular officer will place a visa in your passport. If you receive a multiple-entry visa, you may use it to re-enter the United States up to the date of its expiration as long as you have a valid I-20 or IAP-66 form. If you encounter any problems obtaining your visa, contact the institution or agency that issued the I-20 or IAP-66 form. 
 
  
 
Living in the US 
  
 If you are planning to study and live and grow in the United States, you already possess a well-known American characteristic -- the sense of adventure! 

As an international student, you will experience many new and exciting things. In this section, we hope to prepare you for some of the adventures involved in living in the United States. 

It is difficult, if not impossible, to discuss exactly what ‘Living in the U.S.’ means to everyone. This country`s culture has been enriched by the values and belief systems of virtually every part of the world. From an international student`s perspective, that diversity is very valuable: If you choose to live in a completely different environment, you may be challenged with new situations every day; but if you decide to live in a part of the U.S. that resembles your home country in some ways, you may find comfort in those similarities. 

Learning more about yourself is perhaps the most important part of your decision to travel to the U.S. Once you know what you want to achieve, then you can identify the right place to study and live and grow in the States. 
 
  
 Social Life in the US 
  
 Your interaction with other people -- your social life -- is an integral part of your stay in the United States. To make the most of it, get ready to introduce yourself in a positive way to fellow students, professors, and other people both on- and off-campus. 

One of your first introductions to social life on a U.S. campus will most likely be ‘The International Student Orientation Program,’ traditionally coordinated by the Admissions Office or the Office of International Programs. Orientation varies greatly from school to school, though the objectives are similar: to introduce the new non-U.S. students to each other, and to prepare you for campus life. Many times, topics include immigration, academic advisors, computer and library resources, telephone services, public safety, medical services, banking options and department store shuttles so students can purchase items they need. (Be sure to see Living in the U.S.: Money Matters for more details about shopping.) During orientation, students often learn of upcoming activities such as trips to local points of attraction. 

U.S. college and university campuses abound with activities designed to foster friendships. Many schools designate a ‘Student Activities Center’ where you may learn of different options, such as student government, the newspaper staff, outdoors club, chorus, dance, and a number of athletic teams. Explore which ones may suit you best! 

‘Know Thyself’ 

‘Know yourself and your home country,’ Cameron Diaz Jones advised prospective international students in the U.S. A native of Jamaica, Cameron is studying economics and international relations at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. He is in his third year of a four-year undergraduate program, and intends to pursue a Masters of Business Administration before working in urban economic development in the Caribbean or South America. 

‘I`ve made some great American friends on and off-campus, as well as friends from all over the world; they have taught me a lot. For example, last December, some American friends invited me out into the woods to help cut down their Christmas tree -- I had never done anything like that before!’ 

‘When I meet new people, they`re always interested to know what it`s really like in Jamaica. That has made me think about my own country, so I could share more information with them. If I never left home, I would not need to consider these things. So in many ways, a U.S. education means much more than sitting in a classroom and studying for a degree.’ 

Developing Deeper Friendships 

After your initial interaction with new people in the States, you may want to get to know a few of them better. Ironically, many international students have found that they -- not their hosts, the Americans -- must be more assertive if a friendship is to develop. Here is some more advice about the American social life, written by non-U.S. students just like you! 

When you first arrive on campus, you may notice how friendly everyone is. People you don`t know will smile and say ‘Hi’ and ‘How are you’ and ‘How`s it going.’ But it’s more of a statement than a question; they keep on walking and don`t seem to wait for your answer. You may get the idea they are superficial or perhaps even rude. 

However, to Americans, this kind of greeting and behavior is considered very friendly; they feel they are being outgoing and welcoming. This kind of greeting is a social custom which has little to do with friendship. The person may become your friend eventually, but it is important not to misunderstand their way. 

Along the same lines, people may ask your name and country where you were born; they may seem interested for a few minutes, but then go and speak to someone else. This may seem to contradict their initial friendliness, although it is not meant to. 

You may find it easy to have many ‘acquaintances’ on campus: We all live together, eat together, study together. However, true friendship will take time to build. You will realize, maybe for the first time, how much time it took to develop the friendships you have at home. Then you`ll appreciate the time and energy it takes to establish close friendships, both at home and abroad. 

Different Ways of Communicating 

One of the newest forms of communication is also one of the most popular on many U.S. campuses. Through your interaction with admissions offices in the States, you may already understand that practically everyone uses e-mail frequently. 

E-mail and the Internet have made it much easier (and sometimes less expensive) to exchange all types of information. Once you arrive in the States, you will find that computers and Internet connections are very accessible on most campuses. As a matter of fact, e-mail plays an important role in the social lives of many Americans -- as they send and receive messages regularly with friends and family. 

However, try to resist the urge to spend too many hours in front of the computer; keep in mind that your visit to the U.S. may not last forever, so go out and socialize with people nearby, to get a full American experience. Make sure you are open to new experiences! 

Socialization is one of the most important aspects of your international experience. According to the Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, socialization is most strongly enforced by the school, the family, and peer groups. It is essential for the development of individuals who can participate and function within their societies, as well as for ensuring that a society’s cultural features will be carried on through new generations. 

Socialization continues throughout an individual’s lifetime -- and your experience in studying abroad will challenge you to develop your ‘people skills’ even further. 
 
  
 
Accommodations in the US 
  
 Finding a place to live will be one of the first important tasks you’ll face in the States. You can research a number of options before you arrive via e-mail communication with the International Student Office, or by browsing the Internet for local on-line newspapers in the region of the school you choose. You may get a ‘flavor’ of the community by reading the local news, and you may even be able to search the classified advertising section for accommodations options. Most students, however, prefer to SEE the particular style of living quarters -- in person, especially if it is off-campus -- before they commit to a rental agreement with a monetary deposit. 

Temporary Accommodations 

During your planning process, you may choose to explore parts of the United States either before or after the academic semester begins. There are a number of options for inexpensive places to stay for a short period of time. Visit our HomeStay(live with families or at a Bed and Breakfast) or Travel Advice pages for more information. 

On-Campus Accommodations 

Once you are enrolled in a U.S. school, their Admissions Department or International Student Office will most likely send you a ‘pre-departure orientation’ packet. Options for where to live are generally included in this information. 

Some schools in the States offer accommodations for international students on-campus, or near the school`s classrooms, libraries and other facilities. ‘Dormitories’ are buildings with many rooms for sleeping and living, often with two or three people (of the same gender) per room. Dormitory residents typically share large bathrooms which include showers and toilets. Many first-year students prefer to live in on-campus dormitories because they are convenient to both academic and social activities. Another advantage is that you will not need a car to commute to campus, in most instances. 

On-campus accommodations also offer close proximity to the cafeteria and other eating establishments. U.S. colleges and universities offer very flexible meal-plan programs, where you can choose to pay in advance for breakfast, lunch and dinner. On most campuses, you may also deposit a certain amount of money at the beginning of the semester for food that you may buy from designated places; each item’s cost is deducted from the balance in your account throughout the semester. Again, your pre-departure orientation packet will probably detail your eating options. 

Off-Campus Accommodations 

Some U.S. schools do not provide on-campus accommodations for international students. However, an off-campus housing office will assist you in finding an appropriate place to live. Often, the office coordinates activities to help students find a compatible roommate to share expenses; they also provide information about the local neighborhoods, including popular restaurants, shopping areas, parks and recreation, and public transportation. 

Ask new friends and other students if they have any suggestions for a good apartment. Check classified advertisements in the local newspaper (Sundays usually have more apartment listings than other days of the week). If all else fails, contact a real estate agent for assistance -- though beware of unspecified fees for the service. 

Before committing to a lease, or an agreement to rent an apartment, spend some time in the area to decide if it feels safe and convenient to places like grocery stores. Read the lease carefully before signing. You will learn, for example, that the landlord is not responsible for your possessions if they are stolen or destroyed, so you may consider purchasing ‘renter’s insurance.’ If you do not understand any part of the lease agreement, ask the landlord or a friend to explain it to you. 

Settling In 

Moving into a dormitory setting is relatively simple: utilities such as electricity and telephone connections will most likely be ready to use. Each U.S. college or university has its individual policy on paying for long-distance telephone charges; learn those policies soon after you arrive on campus. 

Arranging the details of off-campus accommodations is a bit more complicated. If your rent does not include utilities, you will need to request that the companies turn on the electricity and telephone service when you arrive. The landlord can provide you with the appropriate contact information. 

You have a choice of long-distance carriers for your telephone service. Be sure to ask the customer service representatives about special discount calling plans, particularly for international connections. The representative is usually eager to offer you a variety of extra services, most of which are not necessary. Soon after you register for telephone service, you should receive a free telephone directory. Within the directory, you will find the white pages (listing local residents alphabetically by name), the blue pages (government listings), and the yellow pages (business listings and advertisements). 

Many U.S. households have telephone answering machines, which record messages from callers when no one answers the phone. You may purchase an answering machine for about $25. Another option is to request that the telephone company provide an electronic answering service, for which they charge a small monthly fee. 

In most cases, the least expensive way to keep in touch with far-away friends and family is via e-mail. Again, each U.S. school has its own policies and procedures for accessing the Internet. If you choose to access your own e-mail off-campus, you can expect to pay about $20 per month to an Internet Service Provider. 

‘What to study?’ and ‘Where to study?’ 

These are perhaps the two most important questions you will soon have to answer. Visit our Studying in the U.S. pages for more advice on the first question. Once you decide on an appropriate academic path for yourself, make sure the school’s physical location fits your goals as well. Geography may play a significant role in deciding where to study in the United States. As always, you will need to decide on specific objectives for yourself. 

The answer to ‘where to study?’ involves not only the particular style of living quarters, but also geography. Many international students don`t realize just how big the United States actually is. The continental U.S. (all the states except for Alaska and Hawaii) is so large that the country is divided into four time zones: Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific. Keep in mind that a typical airplane flight from Los Angeles to New York City is about six hours, non-stop; that`s about the same time it takes to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, from New York to London! 

As you might expect, the climate varies across the great expanse of the United States. The southern section of the country features mild temperatures throughout the year, with plenty of sunshine. The northern half of the U.S. often experiences snowfall in the winter months, primarily from November through February. 

Aside from climate concerns, there is also the issue of ‘city life versus country life.’ You may want to live in an urban area, with access via public transportation to the cultural opportunities of a major metropolitan region. Most people around the world are familiar with the United States’ big cities, such as Los Angeles and New York. As a matter of fact, California and New York led the nation in numbers of foreign students in 1997-98. 

If you want to experience something ‘different,’ you may consider any number of other large cities across the country. These include Charlotte, North Carolina in the Southeast; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Northeast; St. Louis, Missouri in the center of the country; Phoenix, Arizona in the Southwest; or Portland, Oregon in the Northwest. 

You may choose to live and study in a relatively rural area -- one that gets less media attention than San Francisco or Philadelphia, for example. There are fine ‘pockets’ of America all across the country, which may seem perfect for you at this point in your life. 

There are many high-quality schools in remote regions of the country. Above all, learn about the academic options first, then learn about the community in which the school is nestled. It is your responsibility to find the right match! 

As you can see, there are a lot of details to consider to make sure that your answer to ‘where to study’ fits well with your response to ‘what to study.’

{{fsharpTitle|Declaring Values and Functions}}

Compared to other .NET languages such as C# and VB.Net, F# has a somewhat terse and minimalistic syntax. To follow along in this tutorial, open F# Interactive (fsi) or Visual Studio and run the examples.

== Declaring Variables ==
The most ubiquitous, familiar keyword in F# is the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which allows programmers to declare functions and variables in their applications.

For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let x = 5&lt;/source&gt;

This declares a variable called &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and assigns it the value &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. Naturally, we can write the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let x = 5
let y = 10
let z = x + y&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; now holds the value 15.

A complete program looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let x = 5
let y = 10
let z = x + y

printfn &quot;x: %i&quot; x
printfn &quot;y: %i&quot; y
printfn &quot;z: %i&quot; z&lt;/source&gt;

The statement &lt;code&gt;printfn&lt;/code&gt; prints text out to the console window. As you might have guessed, the code above prints out the values of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;. This program results in the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;x: 5
y: 10
z: 15&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Note to F# Interactive users: all statements in F# Interactive are terminated by &lt;code&gt;;;&lt;/code&gt; (two semicolons). To run the program above in fsi, copy and paste the text above into the fsi window, type &lt;code&gt;;;&lt;/code&gt;, then hit enter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Values, Not Variables ===
In F#, &quot;variable&quot; is a misnomer. In reality, all &quot;variables&quot; in F# are immutable; in other words, once you bind a &quot;variable&quot; to a value, it's stuck with that value forever. For that reason, most F# programmers prefer to use &quot;value&quot; rather than &quot;variable&quot; to describe &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; above. Behind the scenes, F# actually compiles the &quot;variables&quot; above as static read-only properties.

== Declaring Functions ==

There is little distinction between functions and values in F#. You use the same syntax to write a function as you use to declare a value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let add x y = x + y&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the function, and it takes two parameters, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that each distinct argument in the functional declaration is separated by a space. Similarly, when you execute this function, successive arguments are separated by a space:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let z = add 5 10&lt;/source&gt;

This assigns &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; the return value of this function, which in this case happens to be &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt;.

Naturally, we can pass the return value of functions directly into other functions, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let add x y = x + y

let sub x y = x - y

let printThreeNumbers num1 num2 num3 =
    printfn &quot;num1: %i&quot; num1
    printfn &quot;num2: %i&quot; num2
    printfn &quot;num3: %i&quot; num3

printThreeNumbers 5 (add 10 7) (sub 20 8)&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;num1: 5
num2: 17
num3: 12&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that I have to surround the calls to &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; functions with parentheses; this tells F# to treat the value in parentheses as a single argument.

Otherwise, if we wrote &lt;code&gt;printThreeNumbers 5 add 10 7 sub 20 8&lt;/code&gt;, its not only incredibly difficult to read, but it actually passes 7 parameters to the function, which is obviously incorrect.

=== Function Return Values ===

Unlike many other languages, F# functions do not have an explicit keyword to return a value. Instead, the return value of a function is simply the value of the last statement executed in the function. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;let sign num =
    if num &gt; 0 then &quot;positive&quot;
    elif num &lt; 0 then &quot;negative&quot;
    else &quot;zero&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

This function takes an integer parameter and returns a string. As you can imagine, the F# function above is equivalent to the following C# code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;string Sign(int num)
{
    if (num &gt; 0) return &quot;positive&quot;;
    else if (num &lt; 0) return &quot;negative&quot;;
    else return &quot;zero&quot;;
}&lt;/source&gt;

Just like C#, F# is a strongly typed language. A function can only return one datatype; for example, the following F# code will not compile:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;let sign num =
    if num &gt; 0 then &quot;positive&quot;
    elif num &lt; 0 then &quot;negative&quot;
    else 0&lt;/source&gt;

If you run this code in fsi, you get the following error message:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;&gt; let sign num =
    if num &gt; 0 then &quot;positive&quot;
    elif num &lt; 0 then &quot;negative&quot;
    else 0;;

      else 0;;
  ---------^
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;stdin(7,10): error FS0001: This expression was expected to have type    string    but here has type    int   &lt;/pre&gt;

The error message is quite explicit: F# has determined that this function returns a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, but the last line of the function returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, which is an error.

Interestingly, ''every'' function in F# has a return value; of course, programmers don't always write functions that return useful values. F# has a special datatype called &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt;, which has just one possible value: &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. Functions return &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; when they don't need to return any value to the programmer. For example, a function that prints a string to the console obviously doesn't have a return value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let helloWorld = printfn &quot;hello world&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

This function takes no parameters and returns &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. You can think of &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; as the equivalent to &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; in C-style languages.

=== How To Read Arrow Notation ===
All functions and values in F# have a data type. Open F# Interactive and type the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let addAndMakeString x y = (x + y).ToString();;&lt;/source&gt;

F# reports the data type using chained arrow notation as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val addAndMakeString : x:int -&gt; y:int -&gt; string&lt;/source&gt;

Data types are read from left to right. Before muddying the waters with a more accurate description of how F# functions are built, consider the basic concept of Arrow Notation: starting from the left, our function takes two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; inputs and returns a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. A function only has one return type, which is represented by the rightmost data type in chained arrow notation.

We can read the following data types as follows:

&lt;code&gt;'''int -&gt; string'''&lt;/code&gt;
: takes one &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; input, returns a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;'''float -&gt; float -&gt; float'''&lt;/code&gt;
: takes two &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; inputs, returns another &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;'''int -&gt; string -&gt; float'''&lt;/code&gt;
: takes an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; input, returns a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;

This description is a good introductory way to understand Arrow Notation for a beginner--and if you are new to F# feel free to stop here until you get your feet wet. For those who feel comfortable with this concept as described, the actual way in which F# is implementing these calls is via &lt;b&gt;currying&lt;/b&gt; the function.

=== Partial Function Application===

While the above description of Arrow Notation is intuitive, it is not entirely accurate due to the fact that &lt;b&gt;F# implicitly [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying curries] functions&lt;/b&gt;. This means that a function only ever has a single argument and a single return type, quite at odds with the previous description of Arrow Notation above where in the second and third example two arguments are passed to a function. In reality, a function in F# &lt;B&gt;only ever&lt;/b&gt; has a single argument and a single return type. How can this be? Consider this type:


&lt;code&gt;'''float -&gt; float -&gt; float'''&lt;/code&gt;

since a function of this type is implicitly curried by F#, there is a two step process to resolve the function when called with two arguments

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a function is called with the first argument that &lt;b&gt;returns a function&lt;/b&gt; that takes a float and returns a float. To help clarify currying, lets call this function &lt;b&gt;funX&lt;/b&gt; (note that this naming is just for illustration purposes--the function that gets created by the runtime is anonymous).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
the second function ('&lt;b&gt;funX&lt;/b&gt;' from step 1 above) is called with the second argument, returning a float
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So, if you provide two floats, the result appears as if the function takes two arguments, though this is not actually how the runtime behaves. The concept of currying will probably strike a developer not steeped in functional concepts as very strange and non-intuitive--even needlessly redundant and inefficient, so before attempting a further explanation, consider &lt;i&gt;the benefits of curried functions&lt;/i&gt; via an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let addTwoNumbers x y = x + y
&lt;/source&gt;

this type has the signature of

&lt;code&gt;'''int -&gt; int -&gt; int'''&lt;/code&gt;

then this function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let add5ToNumber = addTwoNumbers 5&lt;/source&gt;

with the type signature of &lt;code&gt;'''(int -&gt; int)'''&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the body of &lt;code&gt;add5ToNumber&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/code&gt; with only one argument--not two. It &lt;b&gt;returns a function&lt;/b&gt; that takes an int and returns an int. In other words, &lt;code&gt;add5toNumber&lt;/code&gt; &lt;b&gt;partially applies&lt;/b&gt; the  &lt;code&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/code&gt; function. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let z = add5ToNumber 6;;

val z : int = 11
&lt;/source&gt;

This partial application of a function with multiple argument exemplifies the power of curried functions. It allows &lt;b&gt;deferred application&lt;/b&gt; of the function, allowing for more modular development and code re-use--we can re-use the &lt;code&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/code&gt; function to create a new function via partial application. From this, you can glean the power of function currying: it is always breaking down function application to the smallest possible elements, facilitating greater chances for code-reuse and modularity.



Take another example, illustrating the use of partially applied functions as a bookkeeping technique. Note the type signature of &lt;code&gt;holdOn&lt;/code&gt; is a function (int -&gt; int) since it is the partial application of &lt;code&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let holdOn = addTwoNumbers 7;;

val holdOn : (int -&gt; int)

&gt; let okDone = holdOn 8;;

val okDone : int = 15

&lt;/source&gt;


Here we define a new function &lt;code&gt;holdOn&lt;/code&gt; on the fly just to keep track of the first value to add. Then later we apply this new 'temp' function &lt;code&gt;holdOn&lt;/code&gt; with another value which returns an int. Partially applied functions--enabled by currying--is a very powerful means of controlling complexity in F#. In short, the reason for the indirection resulting from currying function calls affords partial function application and all the benefits it supplies. In other words, the goal of partial function application is enabled by implicit currying.


So while the Arrow Notation is a good shorthand for understanding the type signature of a function, it does so at the price of oversimplification, for a function with the type signature of 

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
f : int -&gt; int -&gt; int
&lt;/source&gt;

is actually (when taking into consideration the implicit currying):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
// curried version pseudo-code
f: int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)
&lt;/source&gt;


In other words, f is a function that takes an int and returns a function that takes an int and returns an int. Moreover,

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
f: int -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; int
&lt;/source&gt;

is a simplified shorthand for

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
// curried version pseudo-code
f: int -&gt; (int -&gt; (int -&gt; int))
&lt;/source&gt;

or, in very difficult to decode English: f is a function that takes an int and returns a function that takes an int that returns a function that takes an int and returns an int. Yikes!

=== Nested Functions ===

F# allows programmers to nest functions inside other functions. Nested functions have a number of applications, such as hiding the complexity of inner loops:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let sumOfDivisors n =
    let rec loop current max acc =
        if current &gt; max then
            acc
        else
            if n % current = 0 then
                loop (current + 1) max (acc + current)
            else
                loop (current + 1) max acc
    let start = 2
    let max = n / 2     (* largest factor, apart from n, cannot be &gt; n / 2 *)
    let minSum = 1 + n  (* 1 and n are already factors of n *)
    loop start max minSum

printfn &quot;%d&quot; (sumOfDivisors 10)
(* prints 18, because the sum of 10's divisors is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 *)&lt;/source&gt;
The outer function &lt;code&gt;sumOfDivisors&lt;/code&gt; makes a call to the inner function &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;. Programmers can have an arbitrary level of nested functions as need requires.

=== Generic Functions ===
In programming, a generic function is a function that returns an indeterminate type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; without sacrificing type safety. A generic type is different from a concrete type such as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;; a generic type represents a ''type to be specified later''. Generic functions are useful because they can be generalized over many different types.

Let's examine the following function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let giveMeAThree x = 3&lt;/source&gt;

F# derives type information of variables from the way variables are used in an application, but F# can't constrain the value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to any particular concrete type, so F# generalizes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the generic type &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;'a -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;
: this function takes a generic type &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

When you call a generic function, the compiler substitutes a function's generic type's with the data types of the values passed to the function. As a demonstration, let's use the following function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let throwAwayFirstInput x y = y&lt;/source&gt;
Which has the type &lt;code&gt;'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that the function takes a generic &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and a generic &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt; and returns a &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt;.

Here are some sample inputs and outputs in F# interactive:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let throwAwayFirstInput x y = y;;

val throwAwayFirstInput : 'a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b

&gt; throwAwayFirstInput 5 &quot;value&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;value&quot;

&gt; throwAwayFirstInput &quot;thrownAway&quot; 10.0;;
val it : float = 10.0

&gt; throwAwayFirstInput 5 30;;
val it : int = 30&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput 5 &quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; calls the function with an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, which substitutes &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt;. This changes the data type of &lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; string -&gt; string&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput &quot;thrownAway&quot; 10.0&lt;/code&gt; calls the function with a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, so the function's data type changes to &lt;code&gt;string -&gt; float -&gt; float&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput 5 30&lt;/code&gt; just happens to call the function with two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, so the function's data type is incidentally &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;.

Generic functions are strongly typed. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let throwAwayFirstInput x y = y
let add x y = x + y

let z = add 10 (throwAwayFirstInput &quot;this is a string&quot; 5)&lt;/source&gt;
The generic function &lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput&lt;/code&gt; is defined again, then the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function is defined and it has the type &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that this function must be called with two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; parameters.

Then &lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput&lt;/code&gt; is called, as a parameter to &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, with two parameters on itself, the first one of type string and the second of type int. This call to &lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput&lt;/code&gt; ends up having the type &lt;code&gt;string -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;. Since this function has the return type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, the code works as expected:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; add 10 (throwAwayFirstInput &quot;this is a string&quot; 5);;
val it : int = 15&lt;/source&gt;

However, we get an error when we reverse the order of the parameters to &lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; add 10 (throwAwayFirstInput 5 &quot;this is a string&quot;);;

  add 10 (throwAwayFirstInput 5 &quot;this is a string&quot;);;
  ------------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

stdin(13,31): error FS0001: This expression has type
        string
but is here used with type
        int.&lt;/source&gt;
The error message is very explicit: The &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function takes two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; parameters, but &lt;code&gt;throwAwayFirstInput 5 &quot;this is a string&quot;&lt;/code&gt; has the return type &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, so we have a type mismatch.

Later chapters will demonstrate how to use generics in creative and interesting ways.

== About Me ==
[[Image:Liliumbulbiferumflowertop.jpg|100px|left]]
I'm a professional code monkey, presently working as a C# consultant in Omaha, NE. I think, breathe, and dream code because I have absolutely no friends or social life to speak of.

I enjoy reading, cooking, writing, and confounding strangers with my self-depreciating wit and droll humor.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Animal Rights Background ==
[[Image:Netherlandwarf.jpg|100px|right]]
It turns out that human beings aren't the center of the moral universe.

In general, my animal rights philosophy is inspired by Peter Singer. I have been a strict vegan since 2004.
&lt;/div&gt;

=Preparing Business Proposals=

A business proposal is a statement that is meant to persuade the reader. 

==Objective==
In a proposal, you make an offer in attempt to persuade the reader to accept it.  In exchange for money, time, or some other consideration, you will give the reader something they want, create something they desire, or do something they wish to have done. 

Business proposals have two objectives: To '''persuade''' and to '''protect'''. 

#Persuasion comes from the wording of the proposal.  By definition, a proposal is an offer that needs to be accepted by the reader in order to succeed.  If the proposal is not persuasive, you will not get what you want. * Refer to Chapter 2, Section 6 on Persuading the Reader to learn more
#Proposals serve metaphorically and often legally as a '''contract''', so they need to protect you. If they are worded vaguely or they exaggerate promises, clients can take legal action if you do not perform the expectations stated. You also need to make sure you comply with any state laws when writing a proposal. 

Expertise in writing proposals requires two things: you must be able to present your offer in the most appealing way possible, while carefully defining the limits of your offer so that no one thinks you are promising more than you can offer.

Making a proposal appealing without promising more than you can offer can be difficult, since you need to set limits on your persuasiveness.

==Variety==

There are many different kinds of proposal situations.

#You may need to write for a reader who is employed in your own organization.
#Your proposal may be your own idea, or the idea of your reader.
#Your proposal may stand alone or compete with other proposals.
#Your company/group may have to proofread and approve of your proposal before you submit it to your readers, or you may have to send it directly to them.
#Your proposal may be heavily regulated for content and structure, or you may have free range on what you think it should sound like.
#Finally, the proposal can be evaluated in a plethora of ways.

==Readers==

When you write a proposal, you are representing yourself, your idea, and your company.  You are asking your readers to invest something (time, money, other resources), because you can not provide it yourself.  The readers will review the proposal with caution because they may have limited supplies and if your idea does not seem well thought out or effective, they will not consider it.  If your business proposal is competing against others, the readers will need to consider each one in order to pick the best.  

'''Point: If your business proposal is not convincing, respectful, or well-written, it will not be considered.'''

=Writing a Business Proposal=

Business proposals need to be organized. There are many different ways to write a business proposal. Asking the reader to make a decision whether to invest in you or not is a very important aspect and should be incorporated in every business proposal. For the reader, investing in you takes their limited resources and puts them in your hands. Therefore, business proposals should be precise and address many different issues the reader might have such as money, time, space, etc.

==Frequently Asked Questions==

Most of the time, readers want to know three things when they consider a proposal:  '''Problem, solution, and cost.'''

The problem, need, or goal of your proposal should be clearly addressed in order to let the reader know why the proposal was written and why they should be interested in it. A properly written problem/need/goal will add clarity to your proposal.

If you provide a problem, be sure to describe what actions you plan on taking to solve the problem. The reader wants to make sure that your solution will work effectively and if it is worth investing in.

Cost is also important. The reader will consider the problem and solution and determine their answer on what their financial situation is. A good business proposal can flounder because the cost may be too high.

Capability can be considered as well, if you agree to perform some work. If you are being paid, readers want to make sure that you will work hard.

==Strategy of Conventions==

A business proposal needs to have a framework.  Usually, there are ten topics that need to be addressed.  However, all proposals need to have the following:

'''Introduction, Problem, Solution, and Cost''' 

The following is a detailed description of the ideal sequence of thought you should lead your reader through:

• In the introduction, the reader should learn what you want to do.

• You should present a problem, need, or goal to the reader. This should persuade the reader that the problem is important to them.

• The plan of action to solve the problem, meet the need, or achieve the goal should give objectives and solutions in order to persuade the reader that the plan of action is effective.

• Giving methods, providing a schedule, showing resources, and describing qualifications should persuade the reader that you are capable of planning, managing, and completing the proposed solution.

• Explaining how the benefit exceeds the cost will persuade the reader that the proposed action is reasonable.

By including at least these four sections, you are leading the reader through a persuasive argument on why your proposal deserves to be considered. If you divide the proposal up into several sections, it is more efficient for the reader to concentrate on the sections that are more important and skim through the other sections, instead of having to read the whole thing and look for key points.

==Superstructure==

The superstructure provides a framework for writers to organize their proposal. Writers can use it as a guideline, but note that it is not mandatory for writers to include every single element listed below in their proposal. Sections can be combined or even briefly stated in other sections. 

===Introduction===

In the introduction, you want to focus on what you are announcing. Although you may want to reveal the full description in the beginning, it may be better to make the introduction brief and allow the full description to be revealed throughout the letter.  This way, readers can get a glimpse of what you will be talking about without you explaining it several times (in the beginning and later on).

===Problem===

After the introduction, you should present your readers with a problem, need, or goal that is significant to them.  It is important to summarize the problem from the readers' point of view, otherwise they may think that it doesn't affect them and become disinterested.  Stating a problem can take some research.  Sometimes, readers may provide a problem for you (like when a firm writes your company a letter explaining a problem and how you should solve it).  Other times, readers may still give you a problem, but be vague.  Other times, you may have to define the problem yourself, based on your own frustration or helplessness.  Before you consider something to be a problem, try to talk about it with a potential reader to see if it is worth writing a business proposal about.  If the feedback is positive, you will know you have more means for continuing the proposal.
===Objectives===

After you describe your problem and before you state your solution, tell your reader what the goals of the solution are.  The objectives help to connect the problem and solution together.  Objectives should be brief or listed, and should tell how the action of the solution solves the problem.

===Solution===

How do you want to achieve the objectives that you have listed? Your solution should answer this question. To do this, you must '''address''' each objective and persuade your readers that your solution is the '''best way to achieve''' the objectives.  These statements are only necessary when they are not obvious to the readers. This can be the case when your readers are coworkers and are aware of problems around the workplace.

The solution's description can be tricky because you may find that you are promising more than you can deliver. The best way to counter that is to be very specific (i.e., what are the limits of the program, what are the capabilities, etc.) Make sure that everything you are not sure you can perform is clearly noted as a possibility, not a promise.

===Method===

After you propose a solution to the problem, readers will want to know the steps you will take to make sure the solution is carried out.  How will you produce the result?  These are the aspects that most readers will look for:

#Facilities
#Equipment
#Your schedule
#Your qualifications
#A plan for managing the proposed project

Sometimes, explaining the method is superfluous.  If everyone is already familiar with your methods, you do not have to give a detailed explanation.  However, make sure your readers know what you are talking about before you assume that they will know everything about your project.

===Resources===

If your plan requires equipment, facilities, or other resources this section should be included.  Tell your readers what you need and why it is needed.  If no special resources are required, you do not need to include this section in your proposal.

===Schedule===

Schedules help provide readers with three things. First, they give readers a deadline so they know when to expect a final result.  Second, schedules can be critiqued by readers to make sure they are feasible. Third, a schedule is a good way to keep track of how a project is proceeding.

In addition to project deadlines, schedules should also include due dates for drafts, resources, and other information that is needed to assist you with your project goal.

===Qualifications===

A qualifications section is a good place to explain the talent and experience of yourself and your team members.  Depending on your readers, this section may be small or large. As with all business documents, you need to be honest when you write your qualifications.  If you think that you need to learn new programs, remember that the time and money spent gaining experience can take away from the project's completion.

===Management===

A project's success depends on its management team, and readers are impressed if you can describe your project management structure in your proposal.  By identifying each person on your team and explaining what their tasks and responsibilities are, you can coordinate your work efficiently.  It is very helpful for each person to know what they will be doing beforehand so there won't be many problems concerning leadership and time management further into the project.

===Costs===

Since your readers are investing their money and time into your project, it helps to know how much it will cost. A budget statement is good for organizing your expenses, but you should also think about the amount of time you and your team members will spend on the project. You may also include how much money your project will save the readers to make it seem more appealing.

==Design==

Believe it or not, design DOES matter when writing a business proposal. You want to make the proposal appealing to the readers. If the reader is looking at two proposals and one has graphics and color on the front cover and one has just text, which one do you think they will want to read first?

=Revision Checklist=

Now that you know what information is required, you can prepare a checklist to make sure that everything is covered and you are not missing something that may be essential.

'''Introduction'''
#Does it state the purpose clearly?
#Does it provide sufficient background information?
#Does it foreshadow the rest of the proposal to help guide the reader? 

'''Problem'''
#Does it explain the proposed action's need or goal?
#Does it persuade the reader that the problem is important to them?

'''Objectives'''
#Do your objectives relate directly to the problem?
#Can you present them without going into the solution?

'''Solution'''
#Is it understandable when it is being described?
#Is it persuasive in saying that it will achieve the objectives?
#Does it effectively show that it is the most desirable way to achieve the objectives?
#Does it offer protection to you and your team members/employer by only promising things that you can deliver?

'''Method'''
#Are the steps in the method described clearly?
#Is it persuasive enough for your readers to be convinced that it will work?

'''Resources'''
#Can you persuade the readers that you have them or can attain them?
#Can you clearly identify all of the resources you can supply, protecting you and your employer?

'''Schedule'''
#Does it say when the project will be completed?
#Has your work been reasonably scheduled?
#Does the schedule clearly state what you must do to meet your deadlines, protecting you and your employer?
#Have you included a schedule chart (if it makes your proposal more persuasive?)

'''Qualifications'''
#Can you persuade your readers that you can complete the project successfully?

'''Management'''
#Can you persuade your readers that your team is organized effectively?
#Have you included an organizational chart that illustrates the hierarchy of your team members and their responsibilities?

'''Costs'''
#Have you presented all of them?
#Are they reasonable?
#Are all of your costs included, protecting you and your employer?
#Do you have a budget table?

'''Conclusion'''
#Are all of your key points summarized?
#Have you ended on a positive note?

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|mbox}} or '''multi namespace message box''' meta-template.

This meta-template is used to build message box templates that are used on several types of pages and thus need to change style depending on what page they are used on. Based on page type detected it uses one of 
{{tl|ambox}}, {{tl|tmbox}}, {{tl|imbox}}, {{tl|cmbox}} and {{tl|ombox}}.

Note that this template should only be used for message boxes that really need to adapt their style. Most message boxes do not need this and should use one of {{tl|ambox}}, {{tl|tmbox}}, {{tl|imbox}}, {{tl|cmbox}} or {{tl|ombox}} directly. Using those templates directly means that your template will look the same on its template page and at any other place you show it, which makes it clear on what kind of pages it is supposed to be used. It also gives you access to any extra features those templates offer, and it saves some server load.

=== Usage ===
This template takes the same parameters as {{tl|ambox}} and {{tl|imbox}} etc. See full documentation there. 

Some of the boxes this template calls only handles images of max 52px width, thus that limitation also applies to this template or you will get ugly padding problems.

=== Demospace ===
This template optionally takes the &quot;demospace&quot; parameter as described at {{tl|namespace detect}}. That parameter is only for testing and demonstration purposes. If you want to lock your message box to one style then instead use one of the other mboxes directly.

Namespace &quot;Image:&quot; was renamed to &quot;File:&quot; on 11 December 2008. This template was updated to understand both names well before that, thus it still works fine. For backwards compatibility it still understands &quot;demospace = image&quot; which means the same thing as &quot;demospace = file&quot;. But using &quot;demospace = image&quot; is now deprecated.

This template uses the {{tl|ambox}} style on &quot;Wikijunior:&quot;  and &quot;Cookbook:&quot; pages or when &quot;demospace=wikijunior&quot; or when &quot;demospace=cookbook&quot;. And it uses the {{tl|tmbox}} style on &quot;Wikijunior talk:&quot; and &quot;Cookbook talk:&quot; pages or when &quot;demospace=talk&quot;. Note that &quot;demospace=talk&quot; means any talk space, there is no &quot;demospace=wikijunior talk&quot; or &quot;demospace=cookbook talk&quot;.

=== Parameters ===
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{mbox
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}} / main / talk / file / category / other
| type  = speedy / delete / content / style / notice / move / protection
| image = none / [[File:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[File:Some image.svg|40px]]
| style = CSS values
| textstyle  = CSS values
| text  = The message body text. 
| small = {{{small|}}} / left / yes
| smallimage = none / [[File:Some image.svg|30px]]
| smallimageright = none / [[File:Some image.svg|30px]]
| smalltext  = A shorter message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: The small parameters only have effect when the template is on an article, talk page or an &quot;other&quot; page. For documentation on the small parameters see {{tl|ambox}}, {{tl|tmbox}}, and {{tl|ombox}}. Using the small parameters when they are not valid has no effect, but also does no harm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Axioms of the Integers ==
'''Axioms''' are the foundation of the integers. They provide the fundamental basis for proving the theorems that you will see through the rest of the book.

Here is a mostly complete list:

For ''&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'', ''&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;'', and ''&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'' integers:

''Closure of &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;'': &lt;math&gt;a\times b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a+b&lt;/math&gt; are integers

''Commutativity of &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;'': &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a&lt;/math&gt;

''Associativity of &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;'': &lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)&lt;/math&gt;

''Commutativity of &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;'': &lt;math&gt;a\times b=b\times a&lt;/math&gt;

''Associativity of &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;'': &lt;math&gt;(a\times b)\times c=a\times(b\times c)&lt;/math&gt;

''Distributivity'': &lt;math&gt;a\times(b+c)=a\times b+a\times c&lt;/math&gt;

''Trichotomy'': Either &lt;math&gt;a&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

''Well-Ordered Principle'': Every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element. (This is equivalent to induction.)

''Non-Triviality'': &lt;math&gt;0 \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.

''Existence'': &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

      <comment>/* Extracting the Markers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The present example shows how to calibrate your setup in a semi-automatic fashion by taking a picture of markers at known real-world positions. This procedure is preferred if the blobs cannot be detected reliably with the automatic calibration.

In this procedure, you will determine a set of points of which you know their real-world position and their position on the image taken by the camera. The calibration component used in SwisTrack will fit a function which best describes the mapping between the real-world and the image coordinates.

== Setup and Marker Placement ==

Setup your experimental arena as if you would run an experiment. Make sure that the camera is mounted properly at its final position. It is furthermore advisable to do the calibration under the same light conditions as the final experiment.

Place 6 to 50 markers in your arena. More markers will generally result in better calibration on heavily distorted images, but take more time to place. If your are working with low distortion, a 4-by-4 pattern (16 markers) will probably yield good enough results. 

If you are using simple markers in your experiment later on, reuse the very same markers to do the calibration. Otherwise, simply use circles printed on paper. Make sure that the markers can be well-distinguished from the background (at least locally), such as black filled circles on white paper, for instance. The markers should have a size of at least 5 by 5 pixels on the image. A size of about 10 by 10 pixels is preferred, though.

Place these markers in your arena and carefully measure the center position (x, y) of each of them. You may use one of your markers or the arena boundary as reference point. Note that you can place the markers at positions of your choice. It is not necessary to place them in a specific pattern, although placing them in a systematic fashion usually makes it easier to determine their real-world position.

Note that the calibration markers should be placed at the same height as the final marker (or object) to track during your experiment. Placing them on the ground will result in significant offsets at the image border.

== Taking a Picture ==

Switch on the camera and launch SwisTrack. If you have a SwisTrack configuration for your experiment already, use that one to take a picture. Otherwise, start with a new (empty) configuration and add the component corresponding to your camera, as well as a ''Conversion to Grayscale'' (or ''Conversion to Color'') component.

Click on the ''Conversion to Grayscale'' (or ''Conversion to Color'') component and press the '''Step''' button in the toolbar. SwisTrack will acquire and image and display it on the screen. Make sure that your blobs are well visible on the image and adjust the camera acquisition parameters if necessary. This is also the last moment you could move the camera or adjust the focus if needed.

Once you are happy with the image, right-click on the displayed image and choose ''Save original image as ...''. Save the image as ''calibration.bmp''.

== Extracting the Markers ==

Launch Matlab and load the saved image with
 image = imread('calibration.bmp');
To display the image on the screen (for verification purposes), type
 imagesc(image)
 axis equal
Switch to the ''calibrationFileTools'' folder of SwisTrack and type
 image_positions = FindBlobs(image, N, THRESHOLD_LEVEL);
where N stands for the number of markers visible on your picture and THRESHOLD_LEVEL for the value (0..1) at which the image should be thresholded. You will have to find a suitable threshold value for your image by modifying this value until the markers are (at least locally) well distinguished from the surroundings. A good value to start with is 0.5.

Once you have found a suitable threshold value, click on each marker. The script will automatically calculate the center of the marker by taking into account nearby pixels of the same color. When you are done, the script returns an N-by-2 matrix with the image positions of the markers.

== Creating an XML Calibration File ==

In addition to the image positions, you'll need the world positions of these markers. Create an N-by-2 with the world positions of your markers in the same order as they appear in the ''image_positions'' matrix (i.e. in the same order as you clicked them).
 world_positions = [2.0, 1.0
                    2.0, 1.5
                    ...
                    ];
Then, write the XML file by calling
 writeSwisTrackCalibXMLFile(worldPoints,imagePoints,'calibration_points.xml')
The file ''calibration_points.xml'' can subsequently be used with the calibrations components available in SwisTrack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SwisTrack includes several calibration components. The purpose of all these components is the same: they convert image positions (expressed in pixels) to real-world positions (usually expressed in meters). What differs is the geometrical model that they use to do this transformation.

All calibration components implemented so far use a list of points to fit such a model. I.e. you provide the component with a list of points of which you know the image position and the real-world position:
 (i_x1, i_y1) =&gt; (w_x1, w_y1)
 (i_x2, i_y2) =&gt; (w_x2, w_y2)
 (i_x3, i_y3) =&gt; (w_x3, w_y3)
 ...
The component then finds the model parameters that minimize the error when converting your image points to the corresponding real-world points, and subsequently uses these parameters to map image coordinates to world coordinates.

Hence, all you need to do is to come up with a list of such points. This is fairly simple and can be done in several ways:
* [[SwisTrack/Examples/Calibration/SemiAutomatic|Semi-Automatic Calibration]]: This is the simplest approach and consists of placing markers at known position in your arena. On the image, you manually click on each marker.
* [[SwisTrack/Examples/Calibration/Automatic|Automatic Calibration with a Known Pattern]]: This is similar to the semi-automatic calibration, except that the markers are found automatically.
* [[SwisTrack/Examples/Calibration/AutomaticSequential|Automatic Calibration in a Sequential Fashion]]: Use this method if you have the possibility to move a marker to specific (precisely known) places in the arena.

For each of the methods, we provide you with a detailed description and the necessary scripts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The present example shows how to calibrate your setup in an automatic fashion by taking pictures of a marker that is moving around in your arena. Note that this requires that you have a mechanism to move a marker to precisely known positions in the arena. We have previously tested that with
* a well-calibrated mobile robot moving around and keeping track of its position using odometry
* a calibrated 2-axis traversing system
In the remainder of this chapter, we describe the procedure with a Khepera III mobile robot. Adapting this to another mobile robot (or other system) should be fairly straightforward.

== Setup ==

Setup your experimental arena as if you would run an experiment. Make sure that the camera is mounted properly at its final position. It is furthermore advisable to run this procedure under the same light conditions and with the same markers as the final experiment. If you do not have makers in the final experiments, put a circular marker that can be well distinguished from the background on top of the Khepera III robot.

From the [http://en.wikibooks.org/Khepera_III_Toolbox Khepera III Toolbox], copy the ''odometry_goto'' program onto the robot. This program tracks the position of the robot using the rotation of the wheels (odometry). In addition, a simple control algorithm moves the robot to any given position. Make sure that you properly calibrated the odometry of your Khepera III robot - carrying out the procedure with a badly calibrated odometry will result in huge errors. An a flat surface, a well-calibrated Khepera III robot will accumulate an error of about 10 cm after 10 m.

Also copy the ''motor_initialize'' program onto the robot and execute it to initialize the motors.

== Preparing the Position File ==

In the folder ''Examples/Calibration/AutomaticSequential'', you will find a file called ''positions'' with a series of target points. The points describe a 5-by-5 grid with a spacing of 50 cm between grid points. At each grid point, the robot will stop for 3 seconds, letting SwisTrack take several pictures. At the end, the robot goes back to the origin (0, 0) to allow for verification of the odometry error.

Adapt this file to the size and shape of your arena. You may also use the ''create_position_file_grid.pl'' script to generate such a file.

Once your position file is ready, copy it onto the robot.

== Preparing SwisTrack ==

Run SwisTrack and load the configuration file you use for the experiment. You may disable the calibration component, if you are using any. Add the ''Output particles via TCP'' component to your processing pipeline.

Make sure that your marker is detected reliably over the whole arena and that no other spot is detected. Removing points manually at a later step is tedious and error-prone.

Note that SwisTrack must be in manual mode (i.e. the ''Run'' button must not be pressed).

== Running the Calibration ==

Carefully place the robot at the (0, 0) position in the arena. Pay attention to the orientation - the robot must point towards the (1, 0) point.

Adapt the scripts ''run_calibration.pl'' and ''trigger_swistrack_at_target_positions.pl''. You will find instructions in these files, but you mainly have to provide the IP addresses of the robot and the computer running SwisTrack. Launch
 ./run_calibration.pl | tee calibration_output
The robot will start moving to the first target point and wait there for 3 seconds. During this time, SwisTrack will takes images and send the image position of the robot. These positions appear both in your terminal and in the file ''calibration_output''.

== Writing the XML Calibration File ==

To parse the ''calibration_output'' file, type
 ./parse_calibration_points.pl &lt; calibration_output &gt; matlab_calibration_output
To plot these points, launch Matlab and type
 data = load('matlab_calibration_output')
 plot(data(:, 1), data(:, 2), 'bo');
Finally, the XML file can be created with
 ./write_xml_file.pl &lt; matlab_calibration_output &gt; calibration_points.xml

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi All,

The &quot;construct on first use&quot; idiom isn't thread-safe as documented here.  The problem is that C++ compilers don't serialize the initialization code.  This is discussed in great detail elsewhere: see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern Singleton Pattern] or google &quot;C++ concurrent static initialization&quot;.

In the first example, if two threads called ''Foo::bar()'' concurrently, the following line could execute twice, concurrently:

    static Bar *b = new Bar ();

Two ''Bar'' objects would be constructed, but of course ''b'' can only point to one, so the other one would be leaked.  That may or may not be a problem, depending on what the Bar ctor does. 

In the second example, ''Bar::Bar()'' could be called concurrently on ''b''.  Again depending on what the constructor does, the results could range from benign to catastrophic.

Even if this pattern is coded in a thread-safe way, the problem of destruction order remains to be solved.

In any event, we should be able to come up with a solution that's less codey than the one given on the Wikipedia page I mentioned.  Anyone interested in working on this?

The approximate values for S, W and Z don't match the IPA symbols given. [θ] in most english dialects is not equivalent to a sound of /s/. It's the sound of /th/ in ''thin''. [β] is not a /v/ sound. It's present in Spanish. /v/ is a labiodental fricative, [β] is a voiced bilabial fricative. /v/ is kinda close, but [β] is a little further forward, with both lips instead of teeth and lips. And [ð] is the sound of /th/ in ''this'', not a sound of /z/.   [[User:TarisWerewolf|TarisWerewolf]] ([[User talk:TarisWerewolf|talk]]) 15:16, 29 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary==
'''loD'''- man
'''be'''' - woman

==Word Order==
One of the most confusing things about Klingon is the word order. In Klingon the word order is important because Grammatical roles such as object and subject are shown through word order. This means that Klingon is &quot;configurational&quot; (another configurational language is English). However, unlike English which is Subject Verb Object, the Klingon word order is Object Verb Subject.

If you don't know what subjects, objects and verbs are [[Klingon/Grammar/Subject-Object-Verb|click here]].

===Example:===
====Vocabulary====
'''loD''' - man

'''be'''' - woman

'''qIp''' - hit


Look at this Klingon sentence:

'''be' qIp loD'''

From an English point of view it looks like the sentence means 'Woman hits man'

However, that's not right. The object is at the start of the sentence and the subject is at the end in Klingon, so '''be' qIp loD''' actually means 'Man hits woman'

(Note: 'woman hits man' would be '''loD qIp be'''')

==Articles==

There are two articles in English; 'a/an' (indefinite article) and 'the' (definite article). Klingon has no equivalents to these words. So the sentence '''be' qIp loD''' could mean any of the following:

''The man hits the woman.''

''A man hits the woman''

''The man hits a woman''

''A man hits a woman''

==Affixes==

An affix is either a prefix or a suffix.
For example, in English the prefix '''dis-''' is used to reverse the meaning of a verb, as in agree and disagree. Suffixes are used to form plurals, as in child and children.

Affixes are central to Klingon grammar and they will be introduced gradually.

===Verb Prefixes===

''See also: [[Klingon/Grammar/Pronouns|Pronouns]]

Only verbs have prefixes. A prefix indicates the pronouns that accompany a verb. As such, they are sometimes called pronomial prefixes. There are almost thirty of them and they will be introduced throughout the course. Here are the first four:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|Prefix
|Subject 	
|Object
|-
|'''jI-''' 	
|I 	
|none
|-
|'''bI-''' 	
|you (sing.) 	
|none
|-
|'''Su-''' 	
|you (plural) 	
|none
|-
|'''ma-''' 	
|we 	
|none
|}

Suffixes with an object will be introduced in a later lesson.

A prefix is added to the front of a verb to form a simple sentence:

*'''jIQam'''. 	I stand.
*'''bIQam'''. 	You stand. (referring to one person)
*'''SuQam'''. 	You stand. (referring to more than one person)
*'''maQam'''. 	We stand.


Punctuation: Some writers do not end single sentences of Klingon with the final period (.). This practice is common in The Klingon Dictionary. However it is normal practice when writing several sentences to end each with a period, as in English. I would recommend that all sentences in Klingon end with a period.

Verbs can be used without any prefix. The absence of a prefix can be translated in several ways, but the most common is where the subject is any one of he, she, it or they, and with no object.

So '''yIt''', which is a verb meaning ''walk'', on its own can form a sentence meaning ''He walks'', ''She walks'', or ''They walk'', and so on. Of course, if there is a noun, it is used instead of the pronoun. We will see examples of this later.

===Suffixes===

Klingon also makes extensive use of suffixes, which are added to the end of verbs and nouns.

There are several different suffixes, but this lesson introduces just one, '''-be''''. It is added to the end of a verb to negate it, so is often translated by not or do not.

*'''jIyItbe'.''' 	I do not walk.

===Simple Sentences===

In Klingon, the word order in a sentence is reversed. The subject comes after the verb instead of before it. The subject is the noun carrying out the action of the verb, so in Klingon it appears at the end of the sentence:

*'''qet loD'.''' 	The man runs.

In this sentence, no prefix is required on the verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page explains to what a subject, object and verb are.

Words to learn:

'''loD''' - man

'''legh''' - see

'''jup''' - friend

==Example sentence==
'''The man''' ''eats'' &lt;u&gt;the chicken&lt;/u&gt;

===Verb===
The verb is in italic. It is the 'action word', it tells you what the subject (the man) is doing. In this sentence it is 'eat'. Other verbs could be 'walk' 'sit' or 'jump'

===Subject===
The subject is in bold. It is the thing that is doing the action (verb). In this sentence 'the man' is the subject. He 'eats'

===Object===
The object is underlined. It is the thing that the verb is being 'done to'. So in this sentence it is the chicken that is being eaten. Unlike the other two, a sentence does not have to have an object. The sentence 'The man eats.' makes sense, while 'Eats the chicken' does not.

==English==
In English, the order is Subject Verb Object. In other languages other word orders are used e.g. in Turkish Subject Object Verb, in Welsh Verb Subject Object.

==Klingon==
In Klingon the order is Object Verb Subject. (This is unusual; 95% of languages have the Subject before the Object). This takes time to get used to; 'Man sees friend' is not 'loD legh jup' but 'jup legh loD'. It may help you if you think of it as 'Friend is seen by man'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plurals in Klingon are a bit more complicated than in English. There are no less than three endings for plurals. However, everything is still quite simple - except for the dreaded irregular nouns.

==What does plural mean?==
A plural is a word that shows there is more than one thing being talked about. E.g. - 'dogs' is plural; there must be more than one dog being talked about (you wouldn't say 'one dogs').

==Words to learn==
'''be'Hom''' - girl

'''mIn''' - eye

'''yan''' - sword

'''peng''' - torpedo

==pu'==
'''pu'''' is the suffix used for beings capable of using language. So the plural of '''be'Hom''' (girl) is '''be'Hompu'''' (girls).

==Du'==
'''Du'''' is the suffix used for body parts. So the plural of '''mIn''' (eyes)is '''mInDu''''. [http://www.kli.org/wiki/index.php?body%20parts%20vocab Click here] for a list of body parts.

==mey==
mey is the plural suffix for everything else. The plural of '''yan''' (sword) is '''yanmey''' (swords).

==Irregular nouns==
Some plurals are completely different to the singular word. Sorry - you'll just have to learn these. For, example, the plural of '''peng''' (torpedo) is '''cha'''.

[[Klingon/Grammar/Plurals/Irregular-Nouns|Click here]] for a list of some irregular nouns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MINC2.0 support for ITK was submitted to the Insight-Journal sometime at the end of 2006. The code was then added to the review directory of Insight tree sometime 2007.

To build ITK with MINC2.0, you must set the following options ON. Note that ITK is configured using cmake, to build ITK with MINC support follow these steps:

 $ ccmake .
 
 toggle advanced options (press t)
 
 ITK_USE_REVIEW --&gt; set to ON
 ITK_USE_MINC2  --&gt; set to ON
 
 (press c) to reconfigure
 
 (press g) to generate


*NOTE: when you set using MINC2.0 to ON, you will then have to set the location of the following libraries from cmake

 netcdf
 
 hdf5
 
 minc2.0

Once cmake is completed, run &quot;make&quot; to build ITK ( this will take some time depending on the options you switched on )

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reading and Writing MINC2.0 images from ITK is very very simple.You'll see!


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;itkImageFileReader.h&quot;
#include &quot;itkImageFileWriter.h&quot;
#include &quot;itkOrientedImage.h&quot;

#include &quot;itkImageIOFactory.h&quot;
#include &quot;itkMINC2ImageIOFactory.h&quot;
#include &quot;itkMINC2ImageIO.h&quot;


typedef itk::Image&lt;float, 3&gt;     ImageType;

/* READING */

typedef itk::MINC2ImageIO        ImageIOType;
ImageIOType::Pointer minc2ImageIO = ImageIOType::New();

itk::ImageFileReader&lt;myImage&gt;::Pointer reader = itk::ImageFileReader&lt;myImage&gt;::New();
reader-&gt;SetFileName(&quot;/home/myimage.mnc&quot;);
reader-&gt;SetImageIO( minc2ImageIO );
reader-&gt;Update;

/* WRITING */
itk::ImageFileWriter&lt; myImage &gt;::Pointer writer = itk::ImageFileWriter&lt;myImage&gt;::New();
writer-&gt;SetFileName(&quot;/home/myimage.mnc&quot;);
writer-&gt;SetImageIO( minc2ImageIO );
writer-&gt;SetInput( reader-&gt;GetOutput() );
writer-&gt;Update();
&lt;/source&gt;

'''VERY IMPORTANT NOTE'''
If your image has &quot;direction cosines&quot; and you want ITK to take them into account instead of itkImage you must use itkOrientedImage OR the direction cosines will NOT be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Terminology Confusion ==

So is it a list or an array? What is the correct term, and how interchangeable are they? I'm no expert at Python; quite to the contrary; I'm a beginner. So I find it just a little hard to understand when the terminology is mixed without explanation.

It is a list. Python has arrays, in the array module, and it means another thing. This chapter needs serious work. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:201.80.72.200|201.80.72.200]] ([[User talk:201.80.72.200|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/201.80.72.200|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Yet Another Terminology Confusion ==

The set data structure is called an unordered collection of distinct hashable values. Why call it unordered when every input value is insertet sorted and checked for duplicity? I'm new to python myself and this really confuses me. Even in the Python doku it is called unordered [http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset].
:Values are checked for duplicity but I am curious why you believe they are sorted.  I don't know sets myself, although I am reasonably fluent in Python. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 18:28, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

== Slicing ==

I notice that slicing was reserved for special &quot;rabbit trail&quot; pages, i.e. sections which aren't in the standard progression of chapters.  As strings were also left unmentioned, I added them with an explanation of string slicing and inserted list slicing into that section.  I can understand why slicing might be considered a more advanced topic, but it is also a fairly fundamental one.  How much should we mention in the tutorial and how much in the rabbit trails (appendices in the printed-book tradition)? --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 18:26, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

== Indexes ==

Which version is better?  A friend told me the first is more confusing but I disagree.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Indexes are numbered from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of items (or characters), and they are positioned between the items:
&lt;pre&gt;
 H  e  l  l  o  ,  _  w  o  r  l  d  !
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
&lt;/pre&gt;
:The item which comes immediately after an index is the one selected by that index.  Negative indexes are counted from the end of the string:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-2]
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-9]
'o'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-13]
'H'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-1]
'!'
&lt;/source&gt;

:But in Python, the colon : allows the square brackets to take as many as two numbers.  For any sequence which only uses numeric indexes, this will return the portion which is between the specified indexes.  This is known as &quot;slicing,&quot; and the result of slicing a string is often called a &quot;substring.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Indexes are numbered from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of items (or characters):
&lt;pre&gt;
H  e  l  l  o  ,  _  w  o  r  l  d  !
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
&lt;/pre&gt;
:Negative indexes are subtracted from the length of the string:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-2]
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-9]
'o'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-13]
'H'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-1]
'!'
&lt;/source&gt;

:But in Python, the colon : allows the square brackets to take as many as two numbers.  For any sequence which only uses numeric indexes, this will return all items from the first index up to but not including the last.  This is known as &quot;slicing,&quot; and the result of slicing a string is often called a &quot;substring.&quot;

#
# Introsort is a version of Quicksort with &quot;introspection&quot;.
#
# When Introsort notices that its recursion depth exceeds
# a specified height, it switches over to Heapsort to
# process the (Quicksort) partition it is currently working on.
# In this way the recursion depth does not continue to increase
# as it would with Quicksort. Unconstrained recursion can reduce
# Quicksort's performance to O(n^2), whereas on the same data,
# Introsort guarantees a worst-case performance of O(n*log2(n)).
#
# This version of Introsort switches to Heapsort when its 
# recursion depth reaches 2*(floor(log2(n))).
# See Musser, David (1997). &quot;Introspective Sorting and Selection Algorithms&quot;.
# Software: Practice and Experience 27 (8): 983?993. Wiley.

# The algorithm for Heapsort is adapted from 
# Cormen, Thomas H.; Leiserson, Charles E.; Rivest, Ronald L.; Stein, Clifford (2001).

This 'looks unattractive' is mere personal opinion. Some playing techniques, indeed DEPEND on the bellows 'curving'. Authority for this statement: I Play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A Word About Notes ==

&quot;An octave goes from a C note to the next C note and contains 8 notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. &quot;

This is a serious oversimplification and even misdirection. The keyboard clearly visually (so the poor beginner will be totally confused!) has 11 (11+1) notes per octave, not 8. It also contains black notes. This also assumes only the Key of C Major.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Statement==

If ''p'' is a rational prime, for all integers ''a'' ≠ 0,

::: &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \mod{p}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proofs==
There are many proofs of Fermat's Little Theorem.

'''Proof 1 (Bijection)'''

Define a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax&lt;/math&gt; (mod ''p'').
Let ''S''={1,2,...,p-1} and ''T''=f(''S'')={a,2a,...,(p-1)a}. We claim that these two sets are identical mod ''p''.

Since all integers not equal to 0 have inverses mod ''p'', for any integer ''m'' with 1≤''m''&lt;''p'', &lt;math&gt;f(a^{-1}m)=m&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is surjective.

In addition, if &lt;math&gt;f(x)= f(y) &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;ax\equiv ay&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}ax\equiv x\equiv y\equiv a^{-1}ay &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and is bijective between ''S'' and ''T''.

Then, mod ''p'', the product of all of the elements of ''S'' will be equal to the product of elements of ''T'', meaning that 

::: &lt;math&gt; \prod_{k=1}^{p-1} k \equiv \prod_{k=1}^{p-1} ak \pmod p&lt;/math&gt;     and that
::: &lt;math&gt; \prod_{k=1}^{p-1}k \equiv a^{p-1}\prod_{k=1}^{p-1} k \pmod p  &lt;/math&gt;.

Then 

::: &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \mod{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Definition 3.1.1''' A '''metric space''' is an ordered pair (''X'',''d'') where ''X'' is a set and ''d'' a function 

::&lt;math&gt;d : X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

:such that:

::{|-
 | 1.
 | ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
 | (''non-negativity'');
 |-
 |2.
 | ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y''
 | (''non-degeneracy'');
 |-
 |3.
 | ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'') 
 | (''symmetry'');
 |-
 |4.
 | ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'')
 |(''triangle inequality'').
 |}

:The function ''d'' is called the '''metric''' on ''X''.  It is also sometimes called a '''distance function''' or simply a ''distance''.

Often ''d'' is omitted and one just writes ''X'' for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is being used.

We already know a few examples of metric spaces.  The most familiar is the real numbers with the usual absolute value.  That is, we take ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R''' and we let ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''|.  To see this is a metric space we need to check that ''d'' satisfies the four properties given above.  Let's check and see.
*The first property follows from the fact that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative.   
*The second property follows from the fact that the only the real number 0 has absolute value equal to 0.
*The symmetry property follows form the fact that |''x''|=|−''x''|.
*The triangle inequality is the most non-trivial to check.  This is usually the case.  For the this metric it follows from the fact that |''a''+''b''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;|''a''|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''b''|, where we take ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z''.

[[File:R^2 metric.svg|right|x200px]] Another familiar example is the plane.  That is we take ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  In order to define the metric, let's recall how we usually measure the distance between two points ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the plane.  We simply use the Pythagorean theorem,
to see that we should define &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sqrt{(x_1-y_2)^2+(x_2-y_2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  First notice that this is always defined, because we are squaring the terms inside the square root we are never in danger of attempting to take the square root of a negative number, so ''d''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.  Now we need to check that it is a metric.
*The first property follows from the fact that the square root of a number is always non-negative.   
*The second property follows from the fact that the only the number 0 has a square root equal to 0.
*The symmetry property follows form the fact that (''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=(−''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*Again the triangle inequality is the least obvious to check.  In the case of the plane, it follows from the triangle inequality from Euclidean geometry.  Recall that the triangle inequality in Euclidean geometry states that the length of any side of a triangle is always less the the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.  A proof that does not appeal to Euclidean geometry will be given in the more general context of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Other examples are abundant.  As alluded to above we could take  ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the usual metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\textstyle\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Or instead, we could keep ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and simply take a different metric.  This would be a different metric space, because a metric space is the ''pair'' (''X'',''d''), so a change in ''d'' changes the metric space.  Some very interesting metrics occur if you take the metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d_p(x,y)=\textstyle\Big(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\Big)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d_\infty(x,y)=\textstyle\max_{i=1\ldots n} |x_i-y_i|&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice the first metric we defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to taking ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.  This metric is often called the '''Euclidean''' (or '''usual''') metric, because it is the metric that is suggested by Euclidean geometry, and it is the most common metric used on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. 

[[File:Uniform metric.svg|right|200px]]Metric spaces could also have a much more complex set as its set of points as well.  For example, we let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C([a,b]), that is ''X'' consists of all continuous function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[a,b]&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.   And we could let &lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=\sup_{a\leq x \leq b}|f(x)-g(x)|&lt;/math&gt;.  Part of the Beauty of the study of metric spaces is that the definitions, theorems, and ideas we develop are applicable to many many situations.  

:'''Defintion:''' Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a metric spaces.  We define an '''open ball''' centered at ''x'' of radius ''r'' to be the set ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''):={''y''∈ ''X''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''d''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''}.

Of course most of our intuition for metric spaces comes from our understanding of distances in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so we should think about what an open ball looks like in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is hopefully a familiar fact from calculus that the equation (''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; describes a circle of radius ''r''.  The points such that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}&lt;r&lt;/math&gt; is just the set of points inside this circle.  None of on the boundary of the circle are contained in the set, which is why choice to call this set an ''open'' ball.

It is also instructive to examine what this definition is when ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R''', and ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')=|''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''|.  Following the definition we have that 
''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{y∈'''R'''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;|''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''|&lt;r}.  Thus, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the open interval (''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r'').

Once we have defined an open ball, the next definition we need is that of an open and close sets.

:'''Definition''' Let (''X'',''d'') be a metric space, and suppose that ''G'' ⊆ ''X''.  Then ''G'' is said to be '''open''' if for every point ''g'' ∈ ''G'' there is an ''r'' &gt; 0  so that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') ⊆ ''G''.

Before we move on to closed sets, we first must clean up one potentially awkward situation.  We have just given a general definition of what it means for any set to be open, but we have been using the phrase previously been talking about &quot;open balls.&quot;  But nothing guarantees us ahead of time that our open balls are in fact open in the sense of the definition above.  This could leave us in a position where we mean two different things with the expression &quot;open ball&quot;.  Thankfully it turns out that the open ball is in fact open in the sense of the definition above, but this is still a theorem and '''requires proof'''. 

:'''Theorem''' Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be any metric space. The sets ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are open in the sense of the previous definition.

[[File:Open_ball_open.svg|x400px|right]]
:'''Proof.''' We need to show that for a generic ball ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X'', that for any point ''y'' we choose in ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), we can find a (probably much smaller ball) around ''y'' that stays inside ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').   Our intuition is again going to come from the pictures we draw in the plane, but our proof needs to only rely on the axioms given above.  So we shall let ''s''=r-''d''(''x'',''y'').  We know ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, since ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').  Now consider the ball ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'').  We wish to show that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').  Take any ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'').  By using the triangle inequality we see that: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}d(x,z)&amp;\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)=d(x,y)+s&lt;d(x,y)+\Big(r-d(x,y)\Big)\\
                         &amp;\leq r\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Since ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r'', it follows that ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').      &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

One important point needs to made about the definition of open.  Consider the empty set, it is certainly a subset of the metric space ''X''.  Is it open?  Well for every point ''x'' in the empty set we need to find a ball around it.  This is easy because there are no points in the empty set.  That is, for the empty set, the condition is '''vacuously true.'''  Informally speaking, a statement that requires some property hold under various conditions is said to be vacuously true when the conditions are never met.  For example, the statement &quot;Every time I stand on the sun, I break dance&quot; is a vacuously true statement.  It may not be possible to break dance on the sun, but the statement remains true.  For the statement to be false, there would have to be a time when I was standing on the sun, but I did not break dance.  But since I have never stood on the sun, there is nothing to check.     

Another very use, and very simple example of an open set is the whole space. For every point ''x''∈''X'', we may simply take the open ball ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), by definition this ball is a subset of ''X'', so there is an open ball around ''x'' that remains inside of ''X''.
 
:'''Definition''' Let (''X'',''d'') be a metric space, and suppose that ''F'' ⊆ ''X''.  Then ''F'' is said to be '''closed''' if the complement of ''F'', that is ''X'' \ ''F'', is open.

Now we again have two easy examples of closed sets.  First let's consider the whole space ''X'', the complement of ''X'' is ''X'' \ ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∅.  Similarly, if we consider the empty set ∅, then ''X'' \ ∅&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''.  Since the set ''X'' is open, it follows that ∅ a is closed set.  An important point here is that we already see that there are sets which are both open and closed.  Even though the definitions involve complements, this does not mean that the two types of sets are disjoint.  There are cases, depending on the metric space, when many sets are both open and closed.  Even more, in every metric space the whole space and the empty set are always ''both'' open and closed, because our arguments above did not make use to the metric in any essential way.

:'''Theorem''' In a any metric space finite arbitrary unions and finite intersections of open sets are open. 

:'''Proof.''' Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a metric space and suppose that for each for each λ ∈ Λ we are given open sets ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then the theorem states that ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;λ∈Λ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is open.  To see this suppose that ''x'' ∈ ''G''.  Then there is some index λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; so that ''x'' ∈ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since we are assuming that ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, there must exist an ''r'' &gt; 0 so that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the elements of the union defining ''G'' it follows immediately that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ⊆ ''G''.  Hence ''G'' is open.  

:The theorem also claims that finite intersections are open.  That is, if we suppose that ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are open sets then the theorem claims that the set ''G''=&lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''=1,…,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is open. To see this suppose ''x'' ∈ ''G'', then we know that ''x'' ∈ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Since each of the sets ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is open, we can choose real numbers ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; so that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.  If we set ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;min(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) then we have that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ⊆ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus, we have that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ⊆ &lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''=1,…,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''G'' and so ''G'' is open. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;
== Basic definitions ==
Let X be a metric space. All points and sets are elements and subsets of X.

# A point p is a ''limit point'' of the set E if every neighbourhood of p contains a point q&lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt;p such that q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E.
#If p &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E and p is not a limit point of E then p is called an ''isolated point'' of E.
#E is ''closed'' if every limit point of E is a point of E.
#A point p is an ''interior point'' of E if there is a neighborhood N of p such that N &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; E.
#E is ''open'' if every point of E is an interior point of E.
#E is ''perfect'' if E is closed and if every point of E is a limit point of E.
#E is ''bounded'' if there is a real number M and a point q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; X such that d(p,q) &lt; M for all p &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E.
#E is ''dense'' in X every point of X is a limit point of E or a point of E (or both).

== Basic proofs ==

1. ''Every neighborhood is an open set''

:''Proof'': Consider a neighborhood N = &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt;. Now if q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; N then as d(p,q) &lt; r we have h =  d(p,q) - r &gt; 0. Consider s &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;N_h(q)&lt;/math&gt;. Now d(p,s) &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; d(p,q) + d(q,s) &lt; r - h + h = r, and so &lt;math&gt;N_h(q)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; N. Thus q is an interior point of N.

2. ''If p is a limit point of a set E, then every neighborhood of p contains infinitely many points of E''

:''Proof'': Suppose there is a neighborhood N of p which contains only a finite number of points of E. Let r be the minimum of the distances of these points from p. The minimum of a finite set of positive numbers is clearly positive so that r &gt; 0. The neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N_r(p)&lt;/math&gt; contains no point q of E such that q &lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt; p which contradicts the fact that p is a limit point of E.

3. ''A finite set has no limit points''   

:''Proof'': This is obvious from the proof 2.

4. ''A set is open if and only if its complement is closed.''

:''Proof'': Suppose E is open and x is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt;. We need to show that x &lt;math&gt;\in E^c&lt;/math&gt;. Now every neighborhood of x contains a point of &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; so that x is not an interior point of E. Since E is open it means x &lt;math&gt;\notin&lt;/math&gt; E and so x &lt;math&gt;\in E^c&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed. 

:Now suppose &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Choose x &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; E. Then x &lt;math&gt;\notin E^c&lt;/math&gt;, and so x is not a limit point of &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt;. So there must be a neighborhood of x entirely inside E. So x is an interior point of E and so E is open. 

5. ''A set is closed if and only if its complement is open.''

:''Proof'': This is obvious from the proof 4.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==

Lithium is a very soft silvery metal, and can be cut with a knife just like butter. Lithium tarnishes quickly in the air, and will turn black within seconds. It is the lightest metal. Its density is only 0.53 g/cm^3, about the same as pine wood. Lithium is light enough to float in water. But like all alkali metals, it also reacts violently with water to form lithium hydroxide (a base) and hydrogen gas. So don't expect any lithium bath toys.

==How was it discovered?==
Lithium was discovered in Sweden in 1817 by Johann August Arfvedson.

==Where did its name come from?==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
*Lithium is one of the few elements that was synthesized by the Big Bang, at the start of the universe.
&lt;/div&gt;

The name &quot;lithium&quot; comes from the Greek name ''lithos'' which means &quot;stone.&quot;

==Where is it found?==
It is found in mineral springs and is found in most igneous rocks.

==What are its uses?==
Lithium is used to transfer heat from one object to the next.  Some things lithium is used in are glasses, organic compounds, and ceramics.  Because it is such a good conductor of electricity, it is used in batteries as well.

==Is it dangerous?==
Lithium is not dangerous but it is highly reactive.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Beryllium has a sweet taste to it, but due to its toxicity it should never be eaten or sampled.  It is grey, and light-weight.

==How was it discovered?==
Beryllium was found by Louis-Nicolas Vaquelin in 1798. Vacquelin found beryllium in beryl and emeralds.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name came from the Greek word for pale because the gemstone beryl is pale.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* It is not known to be useful or necessary for plant or animal life.
* It usually used as hardening for metals.
* It does not rust at room temperature.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
It is found rarely in isolation in the earth. It is found in 30 mineral species including: Terlandite, Beryl, Chrsoberge, and Phenacite. It is found in large quantities in old stars. This was discovered in 1992 where scientists found a lot of beryllium in 6 old stars on the edge of the Milky Way.

==What are its uses?==
Because beryllium is one of the lightest metals and has one of the highest melting points of light metals, it has been used in structures for high speed aircraft and missiles.  Because it also does not spark, it is used in non-sparking tools.  Because it reacts with the alpha particles released by polonium to produce neutrons, it is used in A-bomb initiators.  And finally, because it does not react with acid and uranium it is used to make nuclear generators.

==Is it dangerous?==
Yes, it is EXTREMELY toxic when eaten.  Only 0.000000001g of the substance is required to kill you.

== New book proposal subject to peer review ==

Hello to all,

First I'd like to thank everyone for their support and vote to keep the [[Optimal Classification]] article. I have returned the [[Optimal_Classification#Application_Example|application example]] to the main page and added a [[Optimal Classification#Computational example|computational example]] section.

Because two papers I have published at the Wikia are under peer review ([http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/Check_sort Check and Rapid sort routines] and [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/A_Method_for_Simulating_the_Process_of_Logical_Human_Thought A Method for Simulating the Process of Logical Human Thought]) it is sometimes difficult to make any contribution anywhere without it being considered original research. 

However, with the inclusion of a working example in a book here of the [[Optimal_Classification#Count__multisets|Rapid sort routine]] I was wondering if a number of you might be willing to do a peer review of the [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/Check_sort Check and Rapid sort routines] so that it could be published here in full? 

Thanks again for your votes to keep the [[Optimal Classification]] article. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 03:27, 28 August 2008 (UTC)
:I don't think we can do that - none of us are experts on the subject (so far as I know). Even if someone were to be an expert, the paper would need to be published in a reputable, peer-reviewed scientific journal before it would be something we can reference. Wikia doesn't count (at least not in my books). I think the statement &quot;it is sometimes difficult to make any contribution anywhere without it being considered original research&quot; is telling. If you're having difficulty, perhaps it would be best to wait until there is more material published from which to draw. As a scientist, your first stop should be a journal, not a wiki. After getting published, you'll have something you can reference here. But perhaps someone will disagree with my view of what is needed here. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:04, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

::#No one is inviting you to do peer review without proper credentials. You are being invited to do a peer review only if you have the proper credentials.
::#Because the very purpose of the Wikia is for publication of original research it is not also used as a reliable reference. However, that does not mean there is a lack of unreliable, but verifiable sources, such as the National Enquirer and books with blank pages which can be referenced as verified sources. My experience is that no one involved with a Wikimedia project is required to tell the truth or required to read any reference, including a closing administrator.
::#Once published in the Wikia it is easy for anyone with a grudge to falsely claim everything else an author writes is original research. That is the difficulty to which I am speaking.
::#Peer review and publication by a real world publisher often includes a contract that requires a copyright which would prevent publication here. After being peer reviewed and published elsewhere there will be nothing that can be legally published here to reference. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:12, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

::I agree with Mike.  As we keep having to tell people wikibooks is [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_place_to_publish_original_works | not a place for original research]].  And until a paper is published in a reputable scientific journal that's exactly what it is.  Also I think that writing a textbook about your own theories seems a little like self promotion to me.  If you have already published them elsewhere then what does it add by writing a textbook about them here? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 12:25, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

:::The [http://www.elsevierdirect.com/brochures/academicpress/ Academic Press] is a highly respected and reputable publisher, yet in my experience that is meaningless compared to the opinion of more than one 19 year old Wikimedia project user. This may come as a shock but since open edit sources can be vandalized moments prior to viewing or updated moments later they can not logically be considered reliable sources even when under constant peer review. But you make a good point about self promotion and keeping a preface or an introduction which includes a statement by the author as to his personal motivation and purpose for doing a work separate and distinct from from the work itself. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:12, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

::Indeed it is a conflict of interest, which was raised in the VFD. I have serious concerns about how appropriate it is for Typetive to be writing on this subject, especially since this work has yet to be published in a repuatable peer-reviewed journal. We have no policy or guideline on this problem, but common sense tells me this is the sort of situation we should strongly discourage. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:26, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

:::What is a conflict of interest? [[Optimal Classification]] is not original research and the accusation that it is, is not based on fact. Claiming that use of pseudo code in an article to elucidate and make clear the mathematical notation or examples used in the reference is not original research and to say that it is only casts doubt on the validity of the accuser's motive and qualifications. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:23, 28 August 2008 (UTC)
:::Also I might mention that the Wikipedia forever forfeited the opportunity to host [[Optimal Classification]] due to the failure of anyone there supporting its deletion to read the primary reference, tell the truth and to not practice religious and sexual discrimination. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 23:24, 28 August 2008 (UTC)

::::First off, I don't think it's really a good thing to be accusing people on Wikipedia of all sorts of discrimination. It certainly doesn't help here and it's not important so don't make it a part of this discussion.
::::Notions of &quot;Verifiability&quot; and &quot;Original Research&quot; have always had a far different meaning and different connotations here then it has on Wikipedia. Considering the rich diversity of projects in the WMF, and they're widely differing attitudes about &quot;original research&quot;, it seems strange to hold everything to Wikipedia's standards. We are very tolerant of original research here, and I strong recommend we maintain that standard. We not only tolerate, but actually encourage authors to utilize novel and experimental presentation methods for material in their books. We require only that material in a book be verifiable by the reader. Therefore, it makes no difference whether Typetive is indeed an unpublished author in this area, because readers can take him to task over any unfounded or unsupported claims that he makes. Plus, if he doesn't provide all the necessary supporting background, he isn't really writing a book and this will be deleted as being some kind of article or essay. 
::::If we ''are going to delete this book'', we're going to delete it because it's fundamentally flawed, not a book, or some other kind of garbage. I really can't condone deleting quality book-like material just because we worry the author studies, researches, or practices the material in his daily life. If it's not a copyvio, obvious quackery, or some other nonsense, we should give it time to develop and mature before we start throwing stones. If we do deem it to be inappropriate at that later time, we can discuss whether and where to move it, as we always do. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:16, 29 August 2008 (UTC)
:::::Thanks [[User:Whiteknight]] for your very thoughtfully comments. I apologize for assuming sexual discrimination based on the fact that Wang used his real name and my assumption that he must have assumed the female pseudonym I used was real. However, my comment regarding religious discrimination is based on the fact that Wang told me his decision to nominate the Optimal Classification article for deletion was based on his disagreement with my religious convictions, which inspired my Wikia article and therefore believed it to be a hoax. He also claimed Optimal Classification was original research based on not having ever heard of Optimal Classification himself or of Dr. Rypka's method. He did not read the primary reference as instructed. 
:::::To help defend the book I created here from future attack I added a computational example. To my extreme delight I discovered that in preforming the multiset count step and displaying the results I had also created a working example of the Rapid sort routine which I published in the Wikia. With a working example created by accident (or by subconscious endeavor) but a working example nonetheless I feel the time for peer review of the Rapid sort routine has ended; that the time for it to be published some where it can be referenced without fear of reprisal has begun. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 07:14, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

:::::Whiteknight, there is a difference between self-verifying information as might be found in [[Knots]] or [[Introduction to Crochet]] or [[The GIMP]] and technical information such as is being discussed here. (I should be clear, I don't think the book need be deleted.) What I'm saying is that Typetive should be very careful to source information he adds to this book; where that is impossible (ie it hasn't been published yet) it should either be published first or not included where such information is not self-verifying. One could say that the research I do is self-verifying as well: &quot;All you need to do is get Deaf people in an EEG and perform this series of tasks and analyze the ERPs like this - then you'll see!&quot; But that is not &quot;self-verifying&quot; by any reasonable definition. It may be the case (I do not know) that this subject is something which can be called self-verifying - if that's the case, then I see no serious issue. However, at first blush it seems to be a rather technical subject with [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Optimal_Classification&amp;diff=1243903&amp;oldid=1243865 &quot;a large area of research&quot;] which readers should not be expected to verify themselves. I might be wrong. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:27, 29 August 2008 (UTC)
::::::Mike, I did not make the statement in my prior response that you have the situation reversed, however, that is the case. I am not referencing my work in the Wikia here but referencing the self-verifying example here from over there. Had I not gone through the deletion process and ended up doing the computational example to back up the validity of the equations I may not have realized the multiset count step was missing or realized the opportunity it provides to validate the Rapid sort routine for many years, if at all. Consequently, surviving the deletion process and then adding the computational example as a wheel chock to provide any reader with the means to verify and validate the authenticity of the equations for themselves turned out to be highly beneficial for the original research I did in developing the Rapid sort routine. It is entirely coincidence that one of the steps used in the Optimal Classification computational example lends itself so perfectly as a real world example of using the Rapid sort routine, but it is reality nonetheless. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 19:15, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

::::::Mike, sorry if I misread you. I agree that we can be judicious about what we call &quot;verifiable&quot;, and there is a difference between things that can be verified with a piece of rope or some time in front of the GIMP, and things which require graduate-level theory. I've already said on a number of occasions that there are a few requirements for this book to remain here in the long term, not the least of which involves Typetive adding the necessary background information to his book to support his high-level information that's there now. Books obviously need to be more then just a single article on a single topic. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:16, 29 August 2008 (UTC)
:::::::*It may turn out to be there are no other Optimal Classification methods than Dr. Rypka's. Frankly, I did not go searching for any but rather for applications such as developing an entirely new and different database for soils. Soil is a '''bounded''' class with attributes in common which is virtually impossible for the laymen in a timely manner to easily identify using current [[w:Soil taxonomy|soil taxonomy]] schemes. All that is needed is to find those common attributes and to provide names or numbers for their states. Other Optimal Classification methods are certainly welcome but I may not be the one who seeks them out.
:::::::*Currently there is a tag requesting the book be broken into pages which I had done previously for the application example. However, a user then suggested the application example was better left inline. After developing the computational example I decided to start from scratch and put both of them inline. I really have no preference here but suggest that a book, especially a book which utilizes online Internet capability, need only have a page number marker after a fixed number of words so that if the reader is called away or there is a power failure that they can return to the last page they were on yet can also find where they were last by scrolling to that point rather than having to get there by clicking on page after page.

:No. The Wiktionary and the Wikipedia are internal project resources and if there is a word or topic that needs clarification or to be given the right context up front then it is far better to take advantage of the expertise and knowledge they provide than to replicate it myself. I will only provide more in depth clarification myself here if it is not provided there. In a &lt;s&gt;few weeks&lt;/s&gt; DONE! I hope to have a .gif ready to illustrate the &quot;cover&quot;.

:::I did not have the difference between magazine and textbook in mind when I made the comment. The difference I had in mind is the similarity between the printed version and the online version in terms of layout with pictures, tables and diagrams interspersed throughout the text. If you intend to emulate the printed version of a textbook here with the same constraints of a 600 page book and 30 to 90 lines per page with graphics to neatly fit a desktop screen then perhaps the formatting could be done by several hundred bots according to established WB:xxx rules, leaving the author with the sole task of concentrating on content accuracy, etc. rather than formatting and layout, However, just like intentional misspellings sometimes an override is necessary to assure that the author's intended meaning is not mangled by a dictatorial speller or a format, layout and grammar dog. The [[Chess]] book offers a pdf file format version which seems to already provide such matching capability so maybe it is really a mute point or a point for having yet another file format which can be downloaded by users.

== Blocked from Wikipedia ==

Hi!

I badly need help.
I am developing a section of the book with the generic title iStuff to cover
things such as iPod, iPhone, iBook, and so on.

No sooner had I created a page with the title I-stuff on Wikipedia than it was deleted (within 10 minutes).
I recreated it...
It was immediately deleted.
Upon second try I was blocked from Wikipedia.

I regard this as very unfair.

Can you help?

(Михал Орела 10:21, 1 September 2008 (UTC))

:Perhaps after the page was deleted the first time you should have stopped to work out why before just recreating it.  Perhaps have a discussion with whoever deleted your article as to why they did and what you could change to make it more suitable?  I'm sure that they had a reason to delete it and simply recreating the article doesn't change that reason.

:Not being an administrator here and this not being a reference desk I am making the following comment simply because the question caught my eye. Wikipedia '''''user''''' sandboxes are utilized for this purpose. Once you have the article up and running then you can move it onto a ''public'' page with its final name with little risk of deletion for incompleteness or a bot interpreting it as spam.

:There is very little that we can do about wikipedia here at wikibooks. Although it does seem a little bit harsh to block you that quickly, you should have probably asked why they deleted it. You can protest your block if you feel that it is unfair.-[[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 16:44, 2 September 2008 (UTC)

== New Meta Logo - Image:Wikimedia_Community_Logo.svg ==

Hi, Can someone update the meta logo on the main page per [[m:Meta:Babel/Wiki_logo]]. The new logo is Image:Wikimedia_Community_Logo.svg. Thanks [[Special:Contributions/203.122.240.118|203.122.240.118]] ([[User talk:203.122.240.118|talk]]) 15:38, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

== Patrolling help ==

The class from Dominion University which will be beginning the latest version of [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] have created accounts and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:NewPages&amp;hidepatrolled=1&amp;namespace=2 userpages]. I've been patrolling them (and sometimes giving a few pointers on wiki markup: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Vlane02&amp;diff=1274172&amp;oldid=1271277] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Abake028&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1274189] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ascha006&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1274144]) and welcoming the users. If a patroller or admin has available time, I could use some help. The usernames are something like Abcde123, and they will normally have a few paragraphs of text on the userpage describing themseves and their teaching philosophy (actually, fairly interesting to read) - please mark the userpage as patrolled, then add {{tlx|bigwelcome|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} to the userpage, moving any prior comments to a generic section as applicable.

Thanks for your help! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:55, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

== move in a different direction ==

After due consideration it now appears to me that Optimal Classification should become a chapter in a book on classification rather than being a book itself with other chapters on temporal classification or the type of classification use for soil taxonomy. What is the best way to go about doing this? [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 14:59, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

:I think that's a great idea. I always recommend that you take some time to write up an outline first for your new book, so you know all the things you want to include before you actually start writing. That way you can stay more focused with a plan, and things don't come out so free-form. Plus, having an outline helps to define some things like the scope of your book, which will prevent it from sprawling endlessly as new materials are added. Some points:
:# If you need to make a new book, do that. If you need to make two or three new books, do that. As the author, you get to pick the best way to present your information, and you want to do it right.
:# Try to answer a few important questions first:
:#*What is the title of your book?
:#*What is the target audience?
:#*What is the scope, how much do you want to try to squeeze into a single book?
:#Do you need any help with all this?
:We have a few resources that you can look at when starting a new book: [[Using Wikibooks]], which has a section for authors, and my personal [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|new book notes]] which I've compiled from my time and efforts here. I also have a few javascript tools that can help automate some of the processes you're going to need to follow, if you are interested in that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:02, 13 September 2008 (UTC)
::Okay, yes I think that is the best way to proceed. I'd like to start a new book from scratch entitled &quot;Classification&quot; with help in setting up the layout so that it best conforms to prescribed Wikibook layout and once that is done add the current book on &quot;Optimal Classification&quot; to it as a chapter along with other possible chapters such as &quot;Temporal Classification&quot;, etc. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 12:59, 15 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Protein|Proteins]] are one of the most important macromolecules in living organisms that have many functions for biochemical processes. They are consisting almost entirely of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The protein is a polymer of multiple monomer units called [[w:amino acid|amino acid]], which have many different functional groups. The 20 major amino acids, along with hundreds of other minor amino aids, sustain our lives. Proteins can have interactions with other proteins and biomolecules to form more complex structures and have either rigid or flexible structures for different functions.

== Amino Acid ==
===Optical Activity===

All proteins or polypeptides are α amino acids. A typical α amino acid consists of a central carbon (which is the [[w:alpha carbon|alpha carbon]] in this case) that is attached to an amino group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a distinctive R group. The R groups, usually referred to as the side chains, determine the properties of each amino acid and classify amino acids into different categories. A tetrahedral carbon atom with four distinct groups is called '''chiral'''. The ability of a molecule to rotate to the polarized plane to the left is called Levorotatory, and all amino acids exhibit the same configuration as L-isomers. Although D-amino acids (D for Dextrorotatory, meaning that they rotate the plane of polarized light to the right instead), exist naturally, they are not found in proteins. Note: Since the central carbon has four distinct attached groups attached, all of amino acids are chiral except for glycine in which R group is another hydrogen atom.

===Zwitterion===

An amino acid is a zwitterion when it is both &quot;acidic and basic&quot; (amphoteric) as a result of the two functional groups. Zwitterion is the ability of an ion to be positively charged (+) and negatively charged (-). In solid state, the carboxylic acid group deprotonates the amine function protonates, forming a '''zwitterion''' (dipolar ion). The structure of an amino acid in aqueous solution depends on the environment pH. The major form in neutral solution is the zwitterion. In strong acid (pH &lt; 1), the predominant form is the cationic ammonium carboxylic acid. In strongly basic solutions (pH &gt; 13), the predominant form is the deprotonated 2-aminocarboxylate ion. These forms interconvert by acid-base equilibria. For pH of about 2 to 9, an amino acid is zwitterion, for which the amino group is protonated (-NH3+) and carboxyl group is deprotonated (-COO-).

===Amino Acid Subdivisions===

Twenty different side chains of amino acids have different functional groups, size, form, charge, capacity for hydrogen bond, hydrophobic nature, and chemical reactivity of proteins. The amino acids can be broadly divided into two catageories, '''hydrophobic''' and '''hydrophilic''', according to the chemical properties of the R group. In aqueous environment, the hydrophobic amino acids are unable to participate in hydrogen bonding. They associate with one another and reside mostly inside the protein. On the other hand, hydrophilic amino acids tend to interact in the aqueous environment due to polarity. These amino acids are normally found on the exterior surface of proteins.

*'''Amino Acids Classification'''

**''Non-polar'' Amino Acids

:'''Aliphatic''' : glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine

:'''Aromatic''' : phenylalanine, tryptophan.

:'''Cyclic''' : Proline

**''Polar'' Amino Acids

:'''Sulfur-Containing''' : cysteine, methionine

:'''Hydroxyl-Containing''' : serine, threonine

:'''Aromatic''' : tyrosine

==Alanine - Ala/ A==

'''Structure''' 

Alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A) is an α-amino acid with the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH3. The α-carbon atom of alanine is bound with a methyl group (-CH3), making it one of the simplest α-amino acids with respect to molecular structure and also resulting in alanine being classified as an aliphatic amino acid. The methyl group of alanine is non-reactive and is thus almost never directly involved in protein function.

'''Features'''

Alanine is a nonessential amino acid which meant that it can be manufactured by the human body and does not need to be obtained directly through the diet. Alanine is found in a wide variety of foods, but is particularly concentrated in meats.

'''Functions'''

Alanine is the primary amino acids for sugar metabolism. It boosts up the immune system by producing antibodies, and provide energy for muscles. 

'''Chemical Synthesis'''

Alanine can be manufactured in the body from pyruvate and branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Alanine is most commonly produced by reductive amination of pyruvate. Because transamination reactions are readily reversible and pyruvate pervasive, alanine can be easily formed and thus has close links to metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. It also arises together with lactate and generates glucose from protein via the alanine cycle. Racemic alanine can be prepared via the condensation of acetaldehyde with ammonium chloride in the presence of potassium cyanide by the Strecker reaction.

==Arginine - Arg/ R==

'''Structure'''

Arginine contained of a four-carbon aliphatic straight chain with the end of which is capped by a guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic and even most basic environments. Therefore, arginine has basic chemical properties. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized and enable the formation of multiple H-bonds.

Arginine is an essential amino acid that plays important role in nitrogen metabolism.

'''Functions'''

Arginine assists in wound healing and help in burn treatment. It is necessary in normal immune system activity by enhancing the production of T-cells. 

'''Biosynthesis'''

Arginine is synthesized from citrulline with the presence of cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinatelyase. This is energetically costly reaction. Therefore, the synthesis of each molecule of argininosuccinate will be coupling with hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).

Synthesis of arginine in human body occurs principally via the intestinal–renal axis, wherein epithelial cells of the small intestine, which produce citrulline primarily from glutamine and glutamate, then join with the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract citrulline from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which comes back to the circulation.

Glutamic acid take place in the excitatory neurotransmitter and the metabolism of sugars and fats. It aids potassium move through the blood-brain barrier. Glutamic acid are a source of fuel for the brain. Glutamic acid can attach to amine group to form glutamine. The process of forming glutamine will detoxifies ammonia that the body contains. 

Glutamic acid is user in correcting personality disorders and treating childhood behavioral disorders.  It also take places in treating epilepsy, metal retardation, muscular dystrophy, ulcers, and hypoglycemic coma.

==Glycine - Gly/ G==

'''Structure'''

Glycine is the smallest amino acid out of all 20 amino acids For this reason, it has the ability to fit into tight spaces of molecules where no other amino acid could possibly fit therefore glycine is evolutionarily conserved. Most proteins contain small amount of glycine, however collagen is one of the exception that contains 35% glycine. Thus, if glycine were cleaved from an amino acid chain composing a whole protein, it would either alter the function of that protein, or denature it entirely. It is also the only achiral amino acid since its R group is simply a H atom. In particular it does not favor the helix formation.

'''Functions'''

Glycione is a non-essential amino acids meaning the human can manufacture it in their body. It serves an important role in maintaining central nervous and digestive systems. Glycine prevents the breakdown of muscle by increase creatine, which is compound that helps build muscle mass. Glycine also keeps the skin firm and flexible. Without glycine, the skin can be damage from the UV rays, oxidation and free radical.

Glycine regulate blood sugar levels and helps provide glucose for the body. 

Glycine serve as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord. When glycine binds to receptors, it activated chloride ion channels to open. As chloride ions enter the channels, the membrane becomes hyperpolarized, causing an Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).

==Lysine - Lys/ K==

'''Structure'''

Lysine has a positively charged amine group chain. The ε-amino group has a significant high pKa value of about 10.8, which is more basic than the terminal α-amino group. This basic amino group is highly reactive and parcipates in the reactions at the active center of enzymes. Although the terminal ε-amino group is charged under physiological condition, the hydrcarbon side chain with three methylene group is still hydrophobic.

'''Features'''

Lysine is a naturally occurring essential amino acid in human body. It promotes optimal growth of infants and nitrogen equilibrium in adults.

'''Functions'''

Lysine can be a treatment of Herpes Simplex and virus-associated Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as it inhibits viral growth. It facilitates the formation of collagen, which is the main component of fascia, bone, ligament, tendons, cartilage and skin. It also helps in absorption of calcium, which is critical in bone growth of infants.

Synthesis of DNA and RNA requires the presence of Methionine. It is also precursors of several critical amino acids, hormones, and neurotransmittors in human body. Its AUG codon also serves as a &quot;start&quot; signal for ribosomal translation of messenger RNA; this means that every peptide chain began with an methionine residual at its N-terminal. It may however be removed later on by cleavage.

'''Deficiency and Excess'''

Methionine deficiency can be seen in chemical exposure and vegetarians. Severe liver disease can be result of having excessive methionine.

==Phenylalanine - Phe/ F==

'''Structure'''

The side chain of Phenylalanine has a derivative of alanine and a phenyl group on the β carbon.  Phenylalanine has a stronger hydrophobic characteristics compared to the other amino acids that contain aromatic side chain, tyrosine and tryptophan. Tyrosine and tryptophan are less hydrophobic than phenylalanine due to their hydroxyul and NH side groups. The property of hydrophobicity allows the structure of phenylalanine to be almost always buried in the protein. The electrons of the phenyl ring stabilizes the protein by stacking to other aromactic structures.

'''Features'''

Phenylalaine is a naturally occurring amino acid that promote growth in infants and regulate nitrogen concentration in adults.

'''Functions'''

Phenylalaine is the precursor of amino acid tyrosine, which give rise to neutrotransmiters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. It can be used to manage certain types of depression as a powerful anti-depressant and is found to be able to enhance memory, thought, and mood. This amino acid also plays a role in increasing blood pressure in hypertension. All other amino acids are beneficial to human body in L form; the D form of Phenylalanine can be used to reduce pain in arthritis.

'''Deficiency and Excess'''

Deficiency of Phenylalanine can be seen in depression, AIDS, obesity, Parkison's Disease, etc. People with the genetic PKU cannot process phenylalanine resulting in a buildup of the amino acid which leads to mental retardation and other permanent damages.

==Proline - Pro/ P==

'''Structure'''

Proline is one of the twenty DNA-encoded amino acids. It is unique among the 20 protein-forming amino acids because the α-amino group is secondary rather than primary as other amino acid. The distinctive cyclic structure of proline side chain locks its φ backbone dihedral angle at approximately -75°, giving proline an exceptional conformational rigidity compared to other amino acids. Hence, proline loses less conformational entropy upon folding, which may account for its higher prevalence in the proteins. 

'''Functions'''

Proline behaves as a structural disruptor in the middle of regular secondary structure elements. However, proline is commonly found as the first residue of an alpha helix and in the edge strands of beta sheets. Proline is most commonly found in turns, which may account for the curious fact that proline is usually solvent-exposed although it has a completely aliphatic side chain. Because proline lacks a hydrogen on the amide group, it cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor, only as a hydrogen bond acceptor.

==Serine - Ser/ S==

'''Structure'''

This amino acid's R group is a hydroxyl group attached to a CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. The hydroxyl group is polar giving serine polar/hydrophilic properties. It has a pH of 5.68. pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.21, 9.15 .Serine is a non-essential amino acid which means it can be synthesized by the human body. For instance, serine can be synthesized by glycine.

'''Function'''

Serine is found in phospholipids,  active sites of trypsin and chymotrypsin. It can synthesize pyrimidines and proteins, cysteine and tryptophan. It is also involved in fat and fatty acid formation, muscle synthesis.

==Threonine - Thr/ T==

'''Structure'''

Threonine is a polar and uncharged amino acid, which is of an aliphatic side chain bonded by a hydroxyl group; the amino acid is constructed as a valine amino acid of a hydroxyl group instead of a methyl group, which is more hydrophilic and reactive. The amino acid is also of two chiral centers for the α-carbon atom and the R group. One of the only 2 amino acids with 2 chiral centers is threonine, the other being isoleucine. This results in the formation of 4 stereoisomers because of 2 chiral centers.

'''Features'''

Threonine is an essential amino acd, which means it cannot be synthesized by the human body. Humans must ingest it in the form of threonine containing foods.

'''Functions'''

Threonine aids the formation of elastin and collagen. In the immune system, threonine helps in the formation of antibodies. It also promotes growth and function thymus glands and absorption of nutrients. In addition, threonine is the precursor to isoleucine.

==Tryptophan - Trp/ W==

'''Structure''' 

Tryptophan is an amino acid of aromatic group of an indole group bonded to a methylene group as the side chain, which is of two aromatic rings of nitrogen and hydrogen group and is hydrophilic. One of the side chains is 5 membered while the oher is 6, and 2 carbons are shared by both aromatic rings.

'''Features'''

Tryptophan is an essential amino acid meaning it cannot be produced by the human body. It usually present in peptides, enzymes, and structural proteins.

'''Functions'''

Trytophan is the precursor for various proteins, serotonin and niacin. It also promotes the formation of peptides and proteins.

==Tyrosine - Tyr/ Y==

'''Tyrosine'''

Tyrosine is a polar aromatic amino acid that contains a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring.  The hydroxyl group is particularly important because these residues are utilized in the phosphorylation of other proteins.
Tyrosine is a non essential amino acid meaning it ca be synthesized in the body. It is synthesized using phenylalanine in the body.

'''Functions'''

Tyrosine plays crucial roles in the human body: It helps deal with stress by becoming an adaptanogen, which helps minimize effects of the stress syndrome; in drug detoxification such as for cocaine, coffee and nicotine addictions, it reduces withdrawal symptoms and abuse. It assists in treating Vitiligo, pigmentation of skin, and Phenylketonuria, the condition where phenylalanine is not metabolized. In addition, it is effective for depression treatment.

Tyrosine is also important in the production of epinephrine, norepinephrine, seratonin, dopamine, melanin, and enkephalins, which has pain-relieveing effects in the body. It also affects the function of hormones by regulating thryoid, pituatary and adrenal glands. Moreover, tyrosine disattaches molecules that may be harmful to the cells, therefore is an antioxidant.

'''Deficiency and Excess'''

Deficiency of tyrosine is seen in low blood pressure, depression, low body temperature.

==Valine - Val/ V==

'''Structure'''

Valine is an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain, therefore a hydrophobic side chain. Valine differs from threonine in a way that the OH group of threonine is replaced by a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group. This is a non polar amino acid. It is essential and therefore cannot be produced by the human body. Being hydrophobic this amino acid is found in the interior of proteins. 

'''Features'''

In animals, valine must be ingested. In plants, it is created by using pyruvic acid converting it to leucine followed by the reductive amination with glutamate. Valine is found in food: soy flour, fish, cheese, meat and vegetables. 

'''Functions'''

Valine is essential in muscle growth and development, muscle metabolism, and maintenance of nitrogen balance in the human body. It can be used as energy source in glucose and treatment of damage caused by alcohol in the brain.

'''Deficiency and Excess'''

Deficiency of valine affects myelin sheets of nerves.  Maple Syrup Urine Disease is caused because Leucine, valine and Isoleucine can't be metabolized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At any instant there may be a number of processes concurrently running on a system. Each process holds some resources for executing instructions and waits for other resources. Similarly, a large number of resources hold resources and continue with their own execution process. So there must be inter-process communication so that the processes can share each others results and resources. 

Shared memory is a way of inter-process communication where processes share a single lump of physical memory space. The memory space is the resource pool for the processes from where the processes are allocated resources according to some predefined algorithms.

Water (molecular formula H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is an essential part of all living organisms, making up 70% or more of the weight of most organisms. It consists of an oxygen atom connected to two hydrogen atoms by polar covalent bonds. It is considered to be the universal solvent for many reasons including its structural, chemical and physical properties. These properties result in the many unique characteristics of water.

== Structure ==
=== Intramolecular Structure  ===
[[Image:Water molecule dimensions.svg|thumb|left|100px|Bonding angles of a water molecule]]
Water is a compound that consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom attached together by two sigma bonds and with two lone pairs of electrons around the oxygen atom. This attachment of the hydrogen nucleus to the central oxygen atom by electrons is called a covalent chemical bond.  These components of a water molecule generally form a tetrahedral arrangement around the oxygen atom, having an expected bond angle of 109.5° between each component. However, this is not the case due to the repulsive forces of the lone electron pairs. As a result, the electrons push the hydrogen atoms closer together, resulting in a bond angle between the hydrogen atoms of 104.5°. The geometry of water molecules is typically referred to as &quot;bent&quot; or &quot;angular&quot;. Since this is a bent structure and not a linear structure, the distribution of charges is not symmetrical which gives a polar trait to water molecules.

=== Intermolecular Structure ===
[[Image:Hydrogenbonding.jpg‎|thumb|right|100px|Hydrogen bonding of many water molecules]]
The partial charges on the oxygen and the hydrogen allow for water to participate in hydrogen bonding. The partial negative charge on the oxygen is attracted to the partial positive charge on the hydrogen of another water molecule. The oxygen atom is partially negative because the oxygen nucleus draws away the electrons from the two hydrogen atoms. Thus, the net charge of the hydrogen atoms becomes partially positive. Due to this hydrogen bonding characteristic, the water molecule exhibits an attractive force to other water molecules and has the ability of ionization. Hydrogen bonding, although much weaker than ionic and covalent bonding, is one of the strongest electrostatic interactions, and is responsible for many of water's unique properties, such as high melting and boiling points, high heat of vaporization, and high surface tension.

== Chemical and Physical Properties of Water ==
Some of the unique properties of water include high boiling point, high melting point, high heat of vaporization, high surface tension,and high heat capacity. All these properties indicate that inter-molecular forces of attraction between water molecules are high. 
====Hydrogen Bonding====
High melting point, boiling point, and heat of vaporization are unique qualities of water caused by the attractions between adjacent water molecules.  Each hydrogen of a water molecule shares an electron pair of the central oxygen atom.  Because oxygen is more electronegative, its nucleus attracts electrons more strongly than the hydrogen nucleus.  The result gives each hydrogen a partial positive charge, and the oxygen a partial negative charge, otherwise known as a dipole moment.  This allows for [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]], the electrostatic attraction between the hydrogen atom of one water molecule to the oxygen atom of another, as well as resulting in the following properties:

[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.jpg|right|thumb|3D model of hydrogen bonds between molecules of water]]

====High Heat Capacity====
Specific heat is a measure of heat required to raise the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of water 1°C. Water has a high heat capacity, meaning that it changes temperature slowly after gaining or losing energy. In fact, water has the second highest specific heat capacity of any known substance after ammonia.  The heat capacity of water is a property directly resulting from hydrogen bonding. The combined effects from hydrogen bonding are enormous, although hydrogen bonds are linked by weak non-convalent interaction. When heat is absorbed, hydrogen bonds are broken and water molecules can move freely. When the temperature of water decreases, the hydrogen bonds are formed and release a considerable amount of energy. The resistance to sudden temperature changes makes water an excellent habitat, allowing organisms to survive without experiencing wide temperature fluctuation. Furthermore, because many organisms are mainly composed of water, the property of high heat capacity allows highly regulated internal body temperature.

====High Melting Point====
[[Image:Group6AMP.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plot of the melting points of four Group 6A hydrides. Following the trend of the other hydrides, water should have a much lower melting point than it actually does.]]
Water has an unusually high melting point when compared to that of other Group 6A hydrides, due to the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. In its solid form (ice), each water molecule is subject to four different hydrogen bonds - two hydrogens that are capable of each being a hydrogen bond donor and an oxygen that is capable of accepting two hydrogen bonds from neighboring molecules.

====High Boiling Point====
[[Image:Group6ABP.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plot of the boiling points of four Group 6A hydrides. Following the trend of the other hydrides, water should have a much lower boiling point than it actually does.]]
Just like with its melting point, water molecules also have a higher boiling point than one would expect if the boiling points of other Group 6A hydrides were extrapolated. Likewise, the reason for this is the hydrogen bonding between neighboring water molecules. Because hydrogen bonding is a relatively strong intermolecular force, high heat energy is required to break up the force.

====High Heat of Vaporization====
Heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat required to transform 1&amp;nbsp;gram of liquid water into its gaseous form. Similarly to the high specific heat of water, the high heat of vaporization is also due the hydrogen bonding. The earth is mostly covered by water, thus water having a higher heat capacity provides a much more stable climate on earth. Evaporative cooling occurs when liquid molecules with the highest kinetic energy escapes as gas, leaving the remaining molecules with lower kinetic energy. This property of water stabilizes temperature in lakes and ponds. It prevents plants and animals from becoming over-heated when exposed to excess heat.

====Colligative properties====
&quot;Colligative properties&quot; are defined as the properties of solutions that are correlated to how many molecules are in a given volume of solvent instead of what the molecules are. Examples of these properties are the decrease of vapor pressure, the increase of boiling point, the decrease of freezing point and the depression of osmotic pressure. They apply to water as well. When a solute, like NaCl, is added into water to form a solution, the boiling point of the whole solution will increase. Surrounded by water molecules, the lattice structure of NaCl will break down due to the displacement of solute-solute interaction by stronger solute-water interaction. Then there are fewer free-moving water molecules in the solution which decrease the entropy of the system. In order to balance that, higher enthalpy change is required to break the intermolecular forces so as to boil the solution to its gas state.  

The freezing point is lowered when solvent is dissolved in water. The reason for that is because that the size of the solute molecule may not fit into the water crystal structure and less free space is offered for other molecules to move when the molecule of liquid joins the crystal. So higher enthalpy change is required to balance the loss in entropy and replace the solute molecule by water molecules. A common example in our daily life is adding salt to snow in winter in order to melt it at a faster speed. Thus, colligative properties are all determined by the properties of solutes other than by their amount of molecules.

=== Density Relationships ===
====Liquid and Solid Phase Densities====
Water is one of the few substances that has the exception of having less dense solid than its liquid. Hydrogen bonding is the reason behind ice floating to the top of liquid water. It is because of this special property of water that enables for the survival of life inside a lake during cold weathers because the lake freezes top down rather than bottom up. As the temperature of water drops below 0°C, each water molecules forms a crystalline lattice with four other neighbors. The hydrogen bonds keep each molecule at a distance that makes ice less dense than liquid water. The crystalline structure of ice as the result of hydrogen bonds is disrupted as temperature increases. The hydrogen bonds aggregate and become denser as crystals collapse. Thus, the density of water is highest at 4°C.

=== Cohesion of Water Molecules ===
====High Cohesion====
High cohesion is a property in which individual water molecules tend to “stick” with other water molecules due to hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds are very fragile in the liquid form of water, and the property of cohesion is observed when hydrogen bonds, collectively, hold water molecules together. These bonds form, break, and re-form at a high frequency, making water molecules more structured than most other liquids. High cohesion leads to two significant characteristics of water: strong capillary action and high surface tension. The cohesion of water molecules is a crucial property in the transportation of water to plants.
Strong capillary action is essential to plants in the effective transport of water. Water is willing to diffuse to dry areas especially in a small-spaced fabric, where water will use its cohesion property to attract or pull the water molecules behind before the water molecules evaporate. Therefore, the transportation of water molecules can keep moving even when the plant has a high evaporation rate. Without this property, plants will end up dehydrated and unable to continue photosynthesis

====High Surface Tension====
[[File:Surface Tension 01.jpg|thumbnail|right|Surface tension demonstrated by a paperclip floating on water.]]
Surface tension is a property that stems from cohesion. Water has a higher surface tension than most other liquids except mercury because of the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The ordered arrangement of water molecules result in a strong interface for surface tension. This property allows water to act as a stretchable film. It also serves as a supporting surface for many aquatic organisms, which have evolved to spread their body weight over a large surface area without breaking the water's surface tension.

====Amphoteric====
Water is known to be amphoteric, which means it is capable of acting as a base or an acid. When the water is a part of a solution, the equilibrium can change. When water reacts with a stronger acid, water will act as a base, and vice versa, water acts as an acid with a stronger base. Due to the oxygen atom’s two lone pairs in the water molecule, water will often act as an electron pair donor, or a Lewis base in reactions involving Lewis acids. However, water can react with Lewis bases, by forming hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen atoms of water and the electron pair donors.

=== Universal Solvent ===
Water is considered the universal solvent due to its ability to dissolve or dissociate most compounds. This property is due to its polarity, where oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen. In a solution, the positive hydrogen side of water is attracted to the negative parts of the compound being dissolved, and vice versa with the negative oxygen being attracted to the positive parts. Thus, water can dissociate and break apart ionic compounds.
====High Dielectric Constant====
* Dielectric Constant - Dielectric matter implies that the electric charges are associated with a particular nucleus; these electrons are &quot;bounded&quot; to the atom. The presence of an electric field will induce a net dipole, meaning that electrons will move toward the positive potential but remain bounded to the molecule; the dielectric matter is then said to be polarized. Water has a dipole moment of 6.17×10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt;.
The dielectric constant is a measure of the extent of the polarization. Water's high dielectric constant is due to the water molecule having a dipole moment in which water can be polarized. Because of a high dielectric constant, water has the ability to surround ions therefore diminish attractions from other charges, making it a good solvent for ionic or polar substances, hence its name as the universal solvent.

====Solvency on Polar Substances====
Due to the polar nature and how readily water molecules can undergo hydrogen bonding, uncharged but polar molecules can easily be dissolved. This is primarily due to the stabilizing effect caused by the hydrogen bonding between a polar molecule and a water molecule. Ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, and compounds that have N-H bonds, form hydrogen bonds with water molecule. These biomolecules tend to be very soluble in water. 

Hydrogen bonds between an uncharged polar molecule and water tend to be the strongest when the hydrogen atom is in a straight line between two atoms with electronegative atoms. Due to this, hydrogen bonds are considered to be very highly directional.

Hydrogen bonds are able to adjust to the position around the solutes. This means that the pattern of hydrogen bonds must recognize the difference in shape and size in order to adapt to the new molecule.

Water also forms a hydration shell. This occurs in an aqueous solution when a solute dissolves in the solution. The solute is then surrounded by the partially positive hydrogen atoms and later binds to the solute. This ultimately creates new bonds and makes a solution.

====Solvency on Charged Substances====
Water also has a stabilizing effect on ions such as Na+ and Cl-. By hydrating both ions, the electrostatic interaction between both ions are greatly diminished and it weakens their tendency to form crystalline lattice structures. This also applies to many charged functional groups present in biomolecules such as carboxylic acid, anhydrides, and protonated amines. Water dissolves such compounds with these given types of charged functional groups by replacing solute—solute interactions with solute—water interactions. In doing so, the electrostatic interactions screen between the solute molecules. Water is primarily an effective screening for electrostatic interactions due to its high dielectric constant. 

====Solvency on Crystalline Substances====
[[Image:Hydration.jpg‎|thumb|200px|right|Hydration of Na+ and Cl-]]
Water is a very versatile solvent. When a crystal of the ionic compound, NaCl for example, is placed in water, the sodium and chloride ions are separated in the solvent. The hydrogen atoms of water molecules are positively charged and attract chloride anions. Meanwhile, oxygen atoms of water molecules are positively charged and attract sodium cations.  Water molecules shield individual sodium and chloride ions from one another by hydration; thus, the polarity of water molecules directly affect the dissociation of solutes.
Furthermore, when crystalline substances dissolve in water, they acquire greater freedom of motion, which increases the entropy of the system. This resulting increase in entropy of the system is greatly responsible for the ease of dissolving salts in water. In terms of thermodynamics, the formation of the solution occurs with a favorable free-energy change.

== Interactions with Nonpolar Compounds ==
[[Image:HydrophobicOrdering.jpg‎||left|thumb|180px|The non-polar hydrophobic portion of a molecule causes surrounding molecules to become ordered, an energetically unfavorable interaction.]]
[[Image:Micelles.jpg‎||right|thumb|180px|A micelle. The hydrophilic heads of molecule are aligned so that they shield the hydrophobic tails from outside water molecules.]]
[[Image:SubstrateEnzymeH2O.jpg|thumb||right|400px|The displacement of ordered water molecules increases entropy and makes the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex more thermodynamically favorable.]]

While water acts as a relatively good solvent for polar compounds, this is definitely not the case with non-polar compounds. Not only will non-polar compounds not dissolve in water, but they also cause an unfavorable interaction in water. The non-polar (and usually hydrophobic) portions of a molecule (such as the hydrocarbon backbone of many organic molecules) cause surrounding water molecules to become ordered, which is an unfavorable process since entropy has decreased.

Oftentimes, molecules will also align themselves in a way such that the hydrophilic, polar portions of the molecule will shield the hydrophobic, non-polar portions from surrounding water molecules, forming a micelle. A common example is the [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|&quot;lipid bilayer&quot;]] in the plasma membrane of a cell, where the polar heads align to shield the non-polar fatty acid tails from water outside of the cell. This way, the hydrophilic heads are exposed to outside water molecules while the hydrophobic tails are almost completely free of water. The micelle structure is important in the absorptions of fat-soluble vitamins and complicated lipids that are found in the human body.

When enzymes and substrates are present in a solution, sometimes ordered water molecules will move away from the middle of the two groups to allow interaction. This phenomenon increases the disorder of molecules, which is an increase in entropy, signifying that the process is thermodynamically favorable. With the water molecules out of the way, the substrate and the enzyme can form an enzyme-substrate complex, which then kicks off the chain of chemical reactions governed by the enzyme. This is an example of [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Desolvation|Desolvation]].

== Water as a Reactant ==
Water is not only a solvent for many biomolecules but also plays a huge role in many reactions with biomolecules within living organisms. A prime example is the conversion of ADP to ATP, which is an essential process for storing energy in living organisms. In this process, a condensation reaction occurs which is characterized by the elimination of water when the reactant ADP couples with a 3rd phosphate group; water is thus a product in this reaction. When energy is needed, a type of hydrolysis reaction occurs where water is required to hydrate ATP to release the energy. When water acts as a reactant, such as in a hydrolysis reaction, the electron-rich oxygen will serve as a nucleophile.  Hydrolysis reactions tend to be exergonic which means that energy is released. Seeing how two molecules are produced from one molecule due to the aid of water, these types of reactions are favorable since the randomness of the system is increased. Water also tends to an essential component in oxidation reduction reactions that occur in respiration for plants and animals.

== Weak Interactions are Crucial to Macromolecular Structure and Function ==
Hydrogen bonds and ionic, hydrophobic, and Van der Waal interactions are much weaker than covalent bonds. Despite their weakness, the cumulative effect of these various interactions can be very significant. For instance, the noncovalent binding of an enzyme to its substrate may involve several hydrogen bonds and at least one or more ionic interactions, as well as some hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. The formation of each of these weak bonds contributes to the net decrease in the free energy of the system. The stability of the noncovalent interactions can then be measured from the binding energy. Stability varies exponentially with the binding energy. Therefore, macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, which have so many sites of potential hydrogen bonding or ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic interactions, have many small binding forces that when combined, the force becomes enormous. For macromolecules, the most stable structure is usually that in which weak interactions are maximized. This explains why the folding of a single polypeptide or polynucleotide chain into its three-dimensional shape is determined by this principle.

= Data Querying =

== Query Languages ==

* SQL (Structured Query Language ). SQL is a Data Definition and Manipulation Language (both DDL and DML)
* RA (Relational Algebra)
* Datalog

== Creating Tables ==

* Command : CREATE TABLE

For the relations:

Gene(&lt;u&gt;gid&lt;/u&gt;, name, annotation)

Experiment(&lt;u&gt;eid&lt;/u&gt;, name,date)

Microarray(&lt;u&gt;gid&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;eid&lt;/u&gt;, exprlevel)

Tables can be created using the following set of commands in  
SQL:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE Gene( gid INTEGER, name VARCHAR(20), annotation  
VARCHAR(50), PRIMARY KEY (gid));

CREATE TABLE Experiment(eid INTEGER, name VARCHAR(10), date  
DATE, PRIMARY KEY (eid));

CREATE TABLE Microarray (a INTEGER, b INTEGER, exprlevel REAL,  
PRIMARY KEY (gid, eid));
&lt;/source&gt;

A primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a  
table. It can either be part of the actual record itself, or  
it can be an artificial field. SQL will automatically index  
the table based on the primary key. Indexing with other keys  
(other than the primary key) is also possible; it can be done  
by using the CREATE INDEX command.

Note that the primary key for the &quot;Microarray&quot; table is  
composed of keys from the other two tables i.e. Gene and  
Experiment. These fields are called Foreign Keys. It is  
important to reference where the table gets its primary key  
from. The syntax is as follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE Microarray (a INTEGER, b INTEGER, exprlevel REAL,  
PRIMARY KEY (gid, eid), FOREIGN KEY (a) REFERENCES Gene 
(gid), FOREIGN KEY (b) Experiment (eid) );
&lt;/source&gt;

These types of constraints are often called Referential  
Integrity Constraints.
 
== Storing Data ==

* Command : INSERT INTO

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
INSERT INTO Gene VALUES(1, &quot;1433E&quot;, &quot;enzyme binding&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Most database management systems have the capability to load  
bulk data at once.

== Feasibility Report==


==='''What is a Feasibility Report/Study?'''===
What you should include when putting together a feasibility study/report:

*A feasibility report is a testimony that attempts to create some sort of action. Feasibility reports are created to persuade/help the decision makers to choose between available options. Remember that your option is not the only one, the decision makers will probably have many to choose from. A feasibility report also determines whether or not the investigated task can be done with the amount of resources available OR how many resources will be necessary in order to complete the task. A feasibility may be useful in a lot of different situations such as event planning, finances, or even remodeling your home.

===What is a feasibility study?===
A feasibility study is a way to evaluate the practicality and desirability of a project. Before a company invests time and money into a project, they need to know how successful the project will be before investing. Sometimes companies want to understand input costs, the amount of research that will need to be done, or even the marketability of a project. With input prices, it is essential that companies understand, (even before they put time and research into the project), how much it would cost to go through with their product. Companies also like to know if they put time into research and go through with their change or promotion of a product, how the public/people will react to the change. Will people be fighting over the new product or will it fall through? The purpose of feasibility studies is to provide companies information and analysis on whether or not you or your company should pursue this course of action.

Feasibility reports are usually used to sway decision makers towards one direction or the other. Many times there is only one course of action but, there needs to be a second course of action.

==Questions to Consider for Your Report:==

===What to consider in creating feasibility studies/reports?===

It remains important to consider alternatives when you are creating a feasibility study. Decision makers in companies want to understand why they have to make a choice, and then why they should choose this certain option. Feasibility reports need to include detailed information on the problem that has presented itself to provide decision makers with a reason to consider further options.

==='''Is your argument important and appropriate?'''===

When deciding on whether or not your feasibility study is important you must first recognize the target audience or reader. For professional organizations people want your argument or study to be based around needs or aims of the organization and their future. In professional settings, it is believed that those guiding points or criteria should be known by the people judging your study. In other words, make the study reasonable and have it relate to what you are looking at implementing or the change you want to see happen.
 
Facts can make your argument important. However, decision makers want to know that your sources are reliable. They want to be assured that the information they are receiving is from a credible source in the industry. This may turn out to be the most important aspect of any feasibility study and report. Due simply to the fact that any information you gather, no matter the presentation, can be ruined if you're lacking information about your sources or in the worst case if your sources are not credible.

==='''What to consider about your alternatives?'''===

It is important to understand how your alternatives compare to the criteria you set in place. In most cases your readers will want to understand how your results compared to others. This allows them to make an educated decision based simply around facts and results. Anderson considers this to be the heart of any feasibility report.

==='''What have you found against your alternatives?'''===

Based on experiments and finding results about possible alternatives and how they fare, it is important to draw conclusions about the alternatives. This is not made to bash other options or products, but is made to set your product or idea apart. You should include general knowledge or conclusions about what each product does well. This remains an important part because once again decision makers need a basis for comparison, they need a reason to select your idea compared to the alternatives and may already be set in place, or in the near future.'''

==='''What should you throw into a conclusion?'''===

Include in your conclusion how you’re going to go implement your ideas for the company and how it will enrich the company. Explain why the company should choose your course of action. Compare statistics and data and help the readers understand the logical choice and the course of action that would aid in selecting one option over the other. Explain your expertise on the subject matter and help them realize that your idea is the choice they are looking for. Based on your experiences they will most likely take your side if you present the argument efficiently. The company will select your course of action, based on the key points you outline in your feasibility study.

==Important Features of a Basic Feasibility Report==
Below are the seven elements of a feasibility report:

*'''Introduction''' - You need to persuade the decision maker to even consider any sort of alternative. You need to convince them to even read your report first. Tell them what they will gain personally or as an organization by considering your work. 
*'''Criteria/Constraints''' - You must specifically map out the criteria of what the ideal outcomes are. This will allow you to make  practical and logical decisions. You can present the criteria in your feasibility report in one of two ways. First, you can separate the criteria into its own section. This is best when you have a extensive report and you need to go in-depth with the explanation. Second, you can incorporate the criteria throughout your report as the criteria become relevant. However, it is important to realize that whichever strategy you chose make sure that the criteria is introduced early in the report. It is also very important to map out the constraints of your suggested solutions. This will show the audience that you understand and acknowledge the fact that no solution is perfect. This will also make sure that the audience makes the decision in their best interest.
*'''Method''' - It is very important to present facts that are accurate and relevant. You should state the reliable sources you used and what method they came from (internet,interview, book, etc.). Without a credible research method or credible sources your document itself will lack credibility.
*'''Overview of Alternative Options''' - You must underline the key features of each possible option. Make sure they are easy to understand and presented in a friendly layout. Keep in mind that the goal is to allow your audience to make the best decision.
*'''Evaluation''' - This should be the bulk of your report, you must evaluate the options using the criteria you created. Add graphs, charts, etc. to show that you have studied your options, and have come up with statistics that back up your reasons as to why your alternative beats the competition. 
*'''Conclusions''' - You need to state the conclusion you have came up with. How did you evaluate the alternatives? And then from there, which alternative best fit your organization. 
*'''Recommendations''' - You need to use your experience and knowledge in order to state which option you think should be adopted.

*Note: All seven element outlined do not need to be included in the feasibility report depending on audience, circumstance, mission, etc. Also the elements do not need to be in the exact order outlined above. Specifically the conclusion should be mentioned more than just at the end of the report. It should also be summarized in the beginning of the report and in the case the the feasibility report is long, it can be mentioned in the middle as well.

==Executive Summary==

An executive summary should be included at the beginning of the report. In 2-3 pages,
the main points of the feasibility study are summarized for a quick review by busy
administrators and school board members. The executive summary provides the reader
with an overview of the feasibility study and will help them see the entire picture before
they read the details. Some decision-makers may only read the executive summary.
Thus, the executive summary should be concise and include the major findings of the
study followed by a recommendation.

==Introduction==
'''The purpose of the introduction of a feasibility report is two-fold:'''  
*To answer the readers' question: &quot;Why do we need to look into these alternatives-do they matter?&quot;
In order to answer this question, it is necessary to identify the problem that your report will help resolve or what your report is aimed at accomplishing.  
*To talk about the other options that you have looked at and analyzed, as well as to tell how you went about researching and analyzing them.
'''Note''': Usually, the introduction to a feasibility report briefly discloses some of the important conclusions and the most feasible options for change.  Other elements of a report of this nature, such as the criteria, method, or any other kind of general background, may also be concisely noted and mentioned in this portion of the report.

== Criteria/Constraints ==

'''What to consider in your feasibility study/report.'''
As you begin formulating what you would like to consider you should realize that usually criteria works around one or more of the following questions.

'''Will your plan or course of action really do what is desired?'''

This is often seen on the technical sides. What you have to ask yourself is whether or not your implementation or change really makes that much of a difference. Lets say you are looking to improve an aspect of your company. Will your change really improve the proficiency and speed of what their trying to do. Or will you find in your study that the change actually slows down production or the efficiency of the company’s workers. This is important to predict beforehand because sometimes an improvement in the workplace is not always an improvement in how a company works. But many of these factors you will not notice until after you complete your study. And in the worst case you may not see negative ailments until after the plan is implemented.

'''What will it take to implement your course of action?'''

Even though your plan of action may seem correct and efficient on paper, it may not be practical towards your line of work. You must take into account the circumstances that arise in every aspect of a professional setting. What you may find is that in one field your plan may be extremely successful, but in another may be a bust. This can also take place from company to company. As you work at different companies along the same field, you will begin to understand what can be successful in one workplace that may not work in another. Sometimes you have to take into account the amount of changes that will need to be implemented for your plan. Do you need to go through extensive changes in operations, or make upgrades to current equipment or materials that are currently in use or in stock? Sometimes the amount of money that needs to be put into a new project may be much more than the actual amount of benefit that would be received from the changes. You must consider your plan as a cost-benefit analysis.

'''Cost of implementation.'''

This may become the biggest factor in any business decision. How much will it cost? In not only business, but any professional field, the benefits must outweigh the costs in any decision. This is even the case when deciding to work on one aspect of a project compared to the other. When forming criteria for a feasibility report, you must understand the costs if all went as planned. Then you might even want to find out what the cost would be if you had minor or major setbacks. It is important to understand the costs because unless the benefits outweigh the costs, a company will most likely not go through with your proposed plan of action. Also it is important to look into the future of the company. Maybe your plan of action will not be beneficial for the first year in existence, but what about the years following that? This must be considered because like any other decision in business, the original fixed cost may be high but the marginal gains may be high. In that case it may be a good decision for the company to make a change if it is beneficial for the future. Think about health care companies. Would it be beneficial for a company to invest in new equipment even though the upright payment is very high? 

'''Is your idea/product desirable?'''

This is as simple as is your plan going to sell. Will people want to overextend themselves for change, or will they reject what you are trying to do? Sometimes a change or solution must be more than just effective and affordable. You must consider the consumers and people that will be changing. Sometimes many feasible courses of action do not succeed simply because they create effects that drive the consumers away. Because of this, the product or plan does not sell. These undesirable side effects can be as simple as tearing away employee morale. Sometimes even though a plan is promoting and expected to increase productivity, how will the employees react? Many times companies overlook how their employees are going to react to change. But the fact of the matter is that the only way to increase production is to keep employees happy. If they are not pushed to improve the company and their own status then they simply will not find change necessary.

==Method==
====='''Things to keep in mind:'''=====
This section of your feasibility report is one of substantial magnitude and importance.  This part of your paper demonstrates to the reader what you discovered, through your research, actually matters and has reliability.  By telling your audience how you came to know what you have found out and know now, you are demonstrating to them that your results are trustworthy and that they truly hold significance in meaning.  With strong methods for finding out your facts, your readers will then feel comfortable and confident to make the necessary changes.

====='''It's all about the source'''=====
The question of what sources to use completely varies from study to study.  There are several different types of sources that you could use to find your facts-it all just depends on what you are trying to find answers to.  
Sources can include (but are not limited to):
*Academic journals or reports
*Library research
*Phone calls
*Face-to-face interviews
*Meetings with those who are knowledgeable about the topic or are in your company/organization
*Surveys (Survey Monkey!)
*Usability Testing
*Lab testings

====='''How much is enough?'''=====
The length and density of content will vary from each report to the next.  You should take into consideration your audience as well as the context and purpose, for which your paper is written.  The main goal is to purely get the point across to the readers that what you are reporting has validity, by describing how the means of attaining your information are sound and secure.  Make sure that your writing is reader-centered and that they would be satisfied.  Doing thus will ensure that your method is long and descriptive enough.

====='''Where does it fit?'''=====
The placement of this section of your report will also depend on the type of report that you are writing.  If there are only a couple of different methods used throughout your research, it might be a good idea to fit them into the beginning of your report, writing a paragraph for each technique.  If you have several, unrelated methods, however, it would be good to place those paragraphs throughout the report, where they would best accompany your analysis or data.

===='''Important note'''====
Sometimes, if it is really obvious how you went about your research, then there might not even be a need to talk about your methods.  It is key, though, that your readers always have a clear understanding of the way you obtained your facts and that they are worth trusting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a quick overview of Catalyst and FastCGI. This assumes you've already [[IIS and FastCGI/Registering interpreter|registered the interpreter]].

Tested with Catalyst 5.7014 and 5.7015.

== Stansa in fcgiext.ini ==

Make sure you have something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[Catalyst]
ExePath=C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
; The -e is important, this flag tells MyApp_fastcgi.pl to change the way it treats stderr
Arguments=&quot;D:\Inetpub\www\DMApp\script\MyApp_fastcgi.pl -e&quot;

; these three lines tell it to always let Cat handle requests.
IgnoreDirectories=1
IgnoreFiles=1
IgnoreExistingFiles=1

; these three lines you can muck with for performance/resource optimizations
QueueLength=999
MaxInstances=20
InstanceMaxRequests=500
&lt;/source&gt;

== Editing MyApp_fastcgi.pl ==
''' This is no longer needed now that MyApp_fastcgi.pl accepts arguments (-e) in above '''

Some early versions (still bugged as of writing) need to have stderr mucked with in order to run on windows. You'll have to make a change to MyApp_fastcgi.pl.

Change the line that says keep_stderr
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;

        manager =&gt; $manager,
        detach  =&gt; $detach,
  keep_stderr =&gt; $keep_stderr,
    }
);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Photos and Illustrations=
Photos are used in professional documents as tools for communicating a message that a writer feels can be strengthened through the use of proper imagery.  Photographs can do many things to enhance a message, some examples can be seen here:

===Illustration Checklist===
'''Planning'''
* What kinds of illustrations are your audience familiar with?
* Do you have information that could be more easily or quickly communicated to your audience visually or in a combination of words and graphics?
* Do you have definitions that could be displayed visually in whole or in part?
* Do you have any processes or procedures that could be depicted in a flowchart?
* Do you have information on trends or relationships that could be displayed in tables and graphics?
* Do you have masses of statistics that could be summarized in tables?
* Do you need to depict objects? If so, what do you need to display about the objects? Do you need to focus attention on specific aspects of the objects? Do you require the realism of photographs?
* What are the design conventions of your illustrations?
* Are there suitable illustrations you could borrow or adapt? Or will you need to create them yourself?

'''Revising'''
* Are you illustrations suited to your purpose and audience?
* Do your illustrations communicate information ethically?
* Are your illustrations effectively located and easy to find?
* Are your illustrations numbered and labeled?
* Do your verbal and visual elements reinforce each other?
* Are your illustrations genuinely informative instead of simply decorative?
* When necessary, have you helped your readers to interpret your illustrations with commentary or annotations?
* Have you acknowledged the sources for borrowed or adapted tables and figures?

===How To Perform an Action===
Pictures are an effective tool for giving visual representation of how to do something. They can can stand alone or work in conjunction with the given text, and they can enhance a message if used properly.  

''If you are using pictures in conjunction with text:'' As in a set of instructions, the imagery increases understanding of the task, in addition to  decreasing confusion that may arise from text that stands alone.  When using a picture to help portray how to perform a task, it is your responsibility to make sure the picture matches up with the text.  You must explain the picture using text, and vice versa, explain the text using a picture. Also, the viewer will accomplish the task more often when the picture looks how it would if they were watching the task, not necessarily if they were experiencing it.  

An example would be: if your task was doing a cartwheel, you wouldn't want the pictures at an angle where the person is looking through the eyes of the one doing the cartwheel.  You would want the pictures to be from someone watching the event, so that the viewer isn't confused by what they can't see (such as where their feet are when they're looking at their hands).
It's the simple things that make or break a document when using pictures.  Think and re-think the pictures you are using and how someone seeing them for the first time will react to them.

===How a Finished Product Should Look===
When textual information does not capture the essence of what your trying to describe, try putting an actual photo of what your trying to describe in the document. This type of picture enables you to come as close to reality as possible. Make sure your pictures are in color and of high quality. Black and white photos tend to blur easily on paper and lack the detail needed to fully understand a photo. Images cut down on excessive use of describing words. &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot; relates to this situation. 

Be sure to use the text wrap abilities of most word processors. A well placed picture with clean text wrapping can make an otherwise overwhelming block of text seem reasonably approachable. Looking at 25 pages of block, justified alignment, plain black text is one of the most boring ways to see a report. A picture can liven up a report, make it more memorable, and help clarify the report all in one motion.

===Map Out an Object, Place, or Process===
An example of these types of pictures can be found in an automotive manual or a science textbook. This can be anything from a picture of a machine to an example of how photosynthesis works. Arrows and labels can be used in order to show where everything is and how the process takes place. The picture should include a big enough background so that the reader can locate the area in relation to things around it. 


Photographs can also play a major role in connecting with the audience. They are useful in multi-cultural situations when a shared written language may not exist. Pictures can speak louder than words, and usually portray the message quicker. It is very important to keep the first initial reaction in mind when choosing the image you will place within your document. Be sure to avoid photos that may have several meanings, or the true meaning may be unclear. In order to avoid this type of situation, put yourself in the audience that you are writing for and try to be unbiased when you view the image. Better yet, test the image on someone who does not know much about your photo's topic and ask them what message the photo sends to them. Clarity is essential in conveying your message. 

Do not rely too heavily on pictures though. Pictures and text should be used simultaneously in order to give the audience the most accurate direction. Pictures can make a great break in words, but are not always as useful to get a point across as words are.

==Software Can Tremendously Increase Photograph Effectiveness==
There are a great deal of photo editing programs for computers that can be utilized to bring out the right angle, zoom, view, and color of a photo. Some of the most popular photo editing software includes Photoshop, Corel, and Image Smart. Many computers now come with basic image editing software, which allows one to adjust color, brightness, crop, and other basic edits.

'''Cropping''' is an essential key feature that allows you to enlarge the area of the photo you want the reader to see, while omitting the background and obsolete area of the background. Cropping is equivalent to looking at an image under a microscope where you can focus on the areas you want the readers to see the clearest. However, this can decrease image quality and make the image hard to see. When possible, it is best to use images that need little to no editing.

When using imagery make sure it is of high image resolution (300 dpi for print, 72 dpi for screen) and the proper format to be inserting into your document. Typically, sticking with images from original sources, such as a camera or other .jpg or .tif file are best.

If you find your photograph is not using the right coloring, computer programs such as Photoshop, Corel, etc. will allow you to adjust the color balance and light in many different variations. This is an important feature, especially when the photograph was not professionally taken or lacks the appropriate lighting for the setting. Be careful not to over or under expose the photography.

'''Labeling''' is also another feature you can do in a computer program. You can insert boxes with text and arrows into a photograph in order to label key details. Labeling your photographs keeps the information you are trying to convey to the reader clear. 

These computer programs may take some time to become familiar with how they work. It might be necessary to take a course or tutorial on how to use them to their full advantages, but it's worth it for all the features these programs have. There are some free tutorials available on the internet or through the actual program.

==Using Graphics From the Artists, Internet, and Other Misc. Sources==
Graphics can be found for just about any topic relatively easily if you know how to search for them and cite the artist properly. Like any written material, pictures are also property of the original artist in many cases. It is important to use good ethics and cite artists when necessary. The internet and your computer's clip art file have countless pictures and graphics as well. Knowing how to use these techniques and tools will make finding and using images easier.

====Citing Images====

In order to use or manipulate an image or graphic not your own, from either the Internet or any other source, you must obtain permission from whoever created or has rights to that image. Usually some type of arrangement between you and this person or organization will have to be negotiated. This could be anything from paying for the rights to use the image, or citing the image in the way that is expressed by the owner. Sometimes graphics will be considered public domain. Studying the copyright information of an image is one way to determine whether or not it is public domain. Images belonging to a government agency or even to your employer would typically be considered public domain. Even so, these images should still be cited. A quick guide to citing images from books and internet can be found at, [[http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/daap/resources/visualresources/how_to/cite_image.html]]

====Finding Images on the Internet====

If you are looking for a high resolution image from the internet, you can select in the Google header bar that you want it only to search for &quot;large images, or extra large images&quot;. If you are not finding what you are looking for, there are many stock photography sites out there that allow you to have the image, royalty free for very little of your own money. Some sites to consider would be: Stock.XCHNG (this is a free site, with some restrictions), Stock Xpert, Corbis, Getty, or others, just type in stock photography in the search bar.

== Clip Art/Illustrations ==
{| style=&quot;padding:2px; text-align:center; float:right;&quot;
 | [[Image:Polar_bear_clip_art.svg|thumb|An example of Clip Art]]
 |}
Illustrations are a great way to convey information easily and effectively to an audience of all ages. However, when using illustrations be sure that there is relevance from the illustration to the topic your discussing. Illustrations can serve as tangents if they have no relevance to the topic being discussed. Illustrations must be chosen to highlight the topic you are discussing and not to distract readers from it. 

Graphics can portray ideas more easily than a picture. They give a different type of quality than text in the document. However, when presenting the ideas to well-educated and technologically savvy professionals, clip art may not present the information efficiently. Illustrations that have a low image resolution can take away from the details you are trying to portray to your audience.If this is the case then photos may be a better choice because they are more clear and may get you point across better.

== Headline text ==
Headline text is used to introduce or even explain graphics. It is expected that you label all of your graphics in one way or another so that when you reference them in you document the reader knows which graphic you are talking about. Headline text can be as simple as a title for a graph or as complex as a short paragraph below a photo explaining the origin and context of the image. Your images and text may seem to go together logically without headlines to you, but your readers will not have your same familiarity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mathematica supports 3D contours on surfaces using the option MeshFunctions.

MeshFunctions draws ISO lines of an arbitary function of the x,y,z values, and for some functions additional parameters. 

For a conventional set of altitude contours we just use the identity function of the z value (the third parameter) using MeshFunctions-&gt;{#3&amp;}

eg
 Plot3D[Sin[x y], {x, 0, 3}, {y, 0, 3}, MeshFunctions -&gt; {#3 &amp;}]

In addition the region between the contours can be colored using the option MeshShading. The following example divides the image into 10 altitude contours and colors them in gray scale.

 Plot3D[Sin[x y], {x, 0, 3}, {y, 0, 3}, Mesh -&gt; 10,  MeshFunctions -&gt; {#3 &amp;},  MeshShading -&gt; GrayLevel /@ Range[0, 1, 0.1], Lighting -&gt; &quot;Neutral&quot;]

===Preface by W.F. Giese===
&lt;p&gt;The following stories from Alarcón are offered to the student of Spanish
in the belief that the easy style, the interest of the narrative, and
the incidental sidelights that they throw on Spanish life and history
will make the book a welcome one in the earlier stages of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories have been very fully annotated, and nothing that seemed to
offer any real difficulty has been passed over. All proper names have
been explained, with the exception of a few too well known or too
insignificant to justify comment. The notes are further reënforced by an
&lt;i&gt;Idiomatic Commentary&lt;/i&gt;, to be studied in connection with the text. By
frequent reviews and by oral drill in translating the idioms from either
language to the other, with changes of person, tense, etc., wherever
possible, the Commentary should enable the student to attain to a real
mastery of the idioms that are here tabulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N.B. In studying the commentary the student should underline in the text
the idiomatic expressions here indicated, including those to which he is
referred back in the Reviews. As irregular verb-forms are introduced
with special frequency, it would be well to keep the list of irregular
verbs at hand for reference. The &lt;i&gt;italicized words&lt;/i&gt; are those that are
especially idiomatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--&lt;p&gt;Easy exercises for translation into Spanish are added. They are based on
very short passages from the text, and are so graded and arranged as to
afford a systematic review of the elements of grammar, a drill which
beginners always need.&lt;/p&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary, while registering all the words in the text, except such
as are nearly or quite identical, does not aim at giving, without any
labor of adaptation on the part of the student, the precise equivalent
required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories are complete, except for a few trifling omissions dictated
by class-room proprieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledgment is gratefully made for a number of welcome suggestions
due to my esteemed colleague Mr. A.R. Seymour.&lt;/p&gt;


===Vocabulary===
&lt;p&gt;N.B. Words alike or nearly alike have in general been omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all adverbs ending in &lt;i&gt;mente&lt;/i&gt;, the corresponding adjective form has
been given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ch&lt;/i&gt; follows &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ll&lt;/i&gt; follows &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;, differing from the English order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender has not been indicated for nouns ending in &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; which are
masculine, nor for those in &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; which are feminine, nor for those nouns
whose gender is inherent. The feminine ending in &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; has not been
indicated for adjectives ending in &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;. In other cases the feminine has
been indicated except in invariable adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following abbreviations occur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;adj.&lt;/i&gt;         adjective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;aug.&lt;/i&gt;         augmentative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;dim.&lt;/i&gt;         diminutive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;part.&lt;/i&gt;        participle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;vr.&lt;/i&gt;          reflexive verb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;prep.&lt;/i&gt;        preposition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;m.&lt;/i&gt;           masculine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;f.&lt;/i&gt;           feminine&lt;/p&gt;

===Text===

&lt;p&gt;Querer es poder.&lt;/p&gt;

====I====
&lt;p&gt; Don Basilio, ¡toque V. la corneta, y bailaremos!&amp;mdash;Debajo
     de estos árboles no hace calor[[#i71|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii71&quot;&gt;(71)&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí, sí..., D. Basilio: ¡toque V. la corneta de llaves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Traedle a D. Basilio la corneta en que se está enseñando
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   Joaquín!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Poco vale!...&amp;mdash;¿La tocará V., D. Basilio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Cómo que no?[[#p14n1|&lt;sup&gt;[14-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Por qué?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Porque no sé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que no sabe[[#p14n2|&lt;sup&gt;[14-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!...&amp;mdash;¡Habrá hipócrita igual![[#p14n3|&lt;sup&gt;[14-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sin duda quiere que le regalemos el oído[[#p14n4|&lt;sup&gt;[14-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vamos![[#p14n5|&lt;sup&gt;[14-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Ya sabemos que ha sido V. músico mayor[[#p14n6|&lt;sup&gt;[14-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; de infantería!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y que nadie ha tocado la corneta de llaves como V....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y que lo oyeron en Palacio[[#p14n7|&lt;sup&gt;[14-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]..., en tiempos de
     Espartero[[#p14n8|&lt;sup&gt;[14-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y que tiene V. una pensión....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vaya,[[#p14n9|&lt;sup&gt;[14-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] D. Basilio! ¡Apiádese V.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues, señor.... ¡Es verdad! He tocado la corneta
     de llaves; he sido una... una &lt;i&gt;especialidad&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p14n10|&lt;sup&gt;[14-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] como dicen

     ustedes ahora...; pero también es cierto que hace dos años
     regalé mi corneta a un pobre músico licenciado, y que desde
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; entonces no he vuelto[[#p14n11|&lt;sup&gt;[14-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]]... ni a tararear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Qué lástima! &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p15&quot; id=&quot;p15&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p15)&lt;/span --&gt;

     &amp;mdash;¡Otro[[#p15n1|&lt;sup&gt;[15-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Rossini!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Oh! ¡Pues lo que es esta tarde,[[#p15n2|&lt;sup&gt;[15-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ha de tocar[[#p15n3|&lt;sup&gt;[15-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     usted!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Aquí, en el campo, todo es permitido....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   &amp;mdash;¡Recuerde V. que es mi día,[[#p15n4|&lt;sup&gt;[15-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] papá abuelo[[#p15n5|&lt;sup&gt;[15-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Viva! ¡Viva! ¡Ya está aquí la corneta!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí, ¡que[[#i72|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii72&quot;&gt;(72)&lt;/sup&gt;]] toque!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Un vals....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No..., ¡una polca!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Polca!... ¡Quita allá![[#p15n6|&lt;sup&gt;[15-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Un fandango!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí..., sí..., ¡fandango! ¡Baile nacional!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Lo siento[[#i73|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii73&quot;&gt;(73)&lt;/sup&gt;]] mucho, hijos míos; pero no me es posible tocar
     la corneta....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Usted, tan amable!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Tan complaciente....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Se lo suplica a V.[[#p15n7|&lt;sup&gt;[15-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] su nietecito!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y su sobrina....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Dejadme, por Dios!&amp;mdash;He dicho que no toco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Por qué?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Porque no me acuerdo; y porque, además, he jurado no
     volver a aprender....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿A quién se lo ha jurado?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡A mí mismo, a un muerto, y a tu pobre madre, hija

     mía!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Todos los semblantes se entristecieron súbitamente al escuchar
     estas palabras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Oh!... ¡Si supierais a qué costa aprendí a tocar la
     corneta!...&amp;mdash;añadió el viejo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡La historia! ¡La historia! (exclamaron los jóvenes.)
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Contadnos esa historia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;En efecto.... (dijo D. Basilio.)&amp;mdash;Es toda una historia.
     Escuchadla, y vosotros juzgaréis si puedo o no puedo tocar la
     corneta....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y sentándose bajo un árbol rodeado de unos curiosos y &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p16&quot; id=&quot;p16&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p16)&lt;/span --&gt;
     afables adolescentes, contó la historia de sus lecciones de
     música.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No de otro modo, &lt;i&gt;Mazzepa&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p16n1|&lt;sup&gt;[16-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el héroe de Byron, contó una

     noche a Carlos XII,[[#p16n2|&lt;sup&gt;[16-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] debajo[[#i74|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii74&quot;&gt;(74)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de otro árbol, la terrible historia
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   de sus lecciones de equitación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oigamos[[#i75|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii75&quot;&gt;(75)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a D. Basilio.&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt; Hace diez y siete años que ardía en España la guerra civil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Carlos e[[#i76|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii76&quot;&gt;(76)&lt;/sup&gt;]] Isabel[[#p16n3|&lt;sup&gt;[16-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se disputaban la corona, y los españoles,

     divididos en dos bandos, derramaban su sangre en lucha fratricida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Tenía yo un amigo, llamado Ramón Gámez, teniente de
     cazadores de mi mismo batallón, el hombre más cabal que he
     conocido....&amp;mdash;Nos habíamos educado juntos; juntos salimos
     del colegio; juntos peleamos mil veces, y juntos deseábamos

     morir por la libertad....&amp;mdash;¡Oh! ¡Estoy por decir,[[#p16n4|&lt;sup&gt;[16-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; que él era más liberal que yo y que todo el ejército!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero he aquí[[#i77|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii77&quot;&gt;(77)&lt;/sup&gt;]] que cierta injusticia cometida por nuestro Jefe
     en daño de Ramón; uno de esos abusos de autoridad que disgustan

     de la más honrosa carrera; una arbitrariedad, en fin,
     hizo desear al Teniente de cazadores abandonar las filas de sus
     hermanos, al amigo dejar al amigo, al liberal pasarse a la facción,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; al subordinado matar a su Teniente Coronel....&amp;mdash;¡Buenos
     humos tenía[[#p16n5|&lt;sup&gt;[16-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Ramón para aguantar insultos e injusticias

     ni al lucero[[#p16n6|&lt;sup&gt;[16-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del alba!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ni mis amenazas, ni mis ruegos, bastaron a disuadirle de su
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; propósito. ¡Era cosa resuelta! ¡Cambiaría el morrión[[#p16n7|&lt;sup&gt;[16-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por

     la boina,[[#p16n8|&lt;sup&gt;[16-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] odiando como odiaba mortalmente a los facciosos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A la sazón nos hallábamos en el Principado,[[#p16n9|&lt;sup&gt;[16-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a tres leguas del
     enemigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Era la noche en que Ramón debía desertar, noche lluviosa
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; y fría, melancólica y triste, víspera de una batalla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A eso de las doce entró Ramón en mi alojamiento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo dormía.

            &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p17&quot; id=&quot;p17&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p17)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Basilio....&amp;mdash;murmuró a mi oído.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Quién es?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Soy yo.[[#i78|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii78&quot;&gt;(78)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Adiós!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Te vas[[#i79|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii79&quot;&gt;(79)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;   &amp;mdash;Sí; adiós.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y me cogió una mano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Oye... (continuó); si mañana hay,[[#i80|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii80&quot;&gt;(80)&lt;/sup&gt;]] como se cree, una
     batalla, y nos encontramos en ella....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Ya lo sé: somos amigos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Bien; nos damos un abrazo, y nos batimos en seguida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Yo moriré mañana regularmente,[[#p17n1|&lt;sup&gt;[17-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pues pienso atropellar

     por todo hasta que mate al Teniente Coronel!&amp;mdash;En cuanto[[#i81|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii81&quot;&gt;(81)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a
     ti, Basilio, no te expongas....[[#p17n2|&lt;sup&gt;[17-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;La gloria es humo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y la vida?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Dices bien: hazte comandante.... (exclamó Ramón.)

     La paga no es humo..., sino después que uno se la ha[[#p17n3|&lt;sup&gt;[17-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     fumado....&amp;mdash;¡Ay! ¡Todo eso acabó para mí!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Qué tristes ideas! (dije yo no sin susto.)&amp;mdash;Mañana sobreviviremos
     los dos a la batalla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues emplacémonos[[#i82|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii82&quot;&gt;(82)&lt;/sup&gt;]] para después de[[#i83|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii83&quot;&gt;(83)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ella....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Dónde?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;En la ermita de San Nicolás, a la una de la noche.&amp;mdash;El
     que no asista,[[#p17n4|&lt;sup&gt;[17-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] será porque haya muerto.&amp;mdash;¿Quedamos

     conformes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Conformes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Entonces.... ¡Adiós!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Adiós.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así dijimos; y después de abrazarnos tiernamente, Ramón
     desapareció en las sombras nocturnas.&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Como esperábamos, los facciosos nos atacaron al siguiente día.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La acción fué muy sangrienta, y duró desde las tres de la
     tarde hasta el anochecer.
                    &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p18&quot; id=&quot;p18&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p18)&lt;/span --&gt;
     A cosa de las cinco, mi batallón fué rudamente acometido
     por una fuerza de alaveses[[#p18n1|&lt;sup&gt;[18-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que mandaba Ramón....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ramón llevaba ya las insignias de Comandante y la boina
     blanca de carlista[[#p18n2|&lt;sup&gt;[18-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Yo mandé hacer fuego[[#i84|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii84&quot;&gt;(84)&lt;/sup&gt;]] contra Ramón, y Ramón contra mí:
     es decir, que su gente y mi batallón lucharon cuerpo a

     cuerpo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nosotros quedamos vencedores, y Ramón tuvo que huir con
     los muy mermados restos de sus alaveses; pero no sin que antes
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; hubiera dado muerte por sí mismo, de un pistoletazo,[[#p18n3|&lt;sup&gt;[18-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] al que la

     víspera era su Teniente Coronel; el cual en vano procuró
     defenderse de aquella furia....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A las seis la acción se nos volvió desfavorable, y parte de mi
     pobre compañía y yo fuimos cortados y obligados a rendirnos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Condujéronme, pues, prisionero a la pequeña villa de...,

     ocupada por los carlistas desde los comienzos de aquella campaña,
     y donde era de suponer[[#p18n4|&lt;sup&gt;[18-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que me fusilarían
     inmediatamente....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La guerra era entonces sin cuartel.&lt;/p&gt;

====IV====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Sonó la una de la noche de tan aciago día: ¡la hora de mi
     cita con Ramón!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo estaba encerrado en un calabozo de la cárcel pública de

     dicho pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pregunté por mi amigo, y me contestaron:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es un valiente! Ha matado a un Teniente Coronel.
     Pero habrá perecido[[#p18n5|&lt;sup&gt;[18-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la última hora de la acción....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cómo! ¿Por qué lo decís?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Porque no ha vuelto del campo, ni la gente que ha estado
     hoy a sus órdenes da razón[[#p18n6|&lt;sup&gt;[18-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de él....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Ah! ¡Cuánto sufrí aquella noche!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una esperanza me quedaba.... Que Ramón me estuviese &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p19&quot; id=&quot;p19&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p19)&lt;/span --&gt;
     aguardando en la ermita de San Nicolás, y que por este motivo
     no hubiese vuelto al campamento faccioso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cuál será su pena al ver que no asisto a la cita! (pensaba
     yo.)&amp;mdash;¡Me creerá muerto!&amp;mdash;¿Y, por ventura, tan lejos

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; estoy de mi última hora? ¡Los facciosos fusilan ahora siempre
     a los prisioneros; ni más ni menos que nosotros!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así amaneció el día siguiente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Un Capellán entró en mi prisión.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todos mis compañeros dormían.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡La muerte!&amp;mdash;exclamé al ver al Sacerdote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí&amp;mdash;respondió éste con dulzura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No: dentro de tres horas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Un minuto después habían despertado[[#p19n1|&lt;sup&gt;[19-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mis compañeros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Mil gritos, mil sollozos, mil blasfemias llenaron los ámbitos
     de la prisión.&lt;/p&gt;

====V====
&lt;p&gt; Todo hombre que va a morir suele aferrarse a una idea cualquiera[[#i85|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii85&quot;&gt;(85)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     y no abandonarla más.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pesadilla, fiebre o locura, esto me sucedió a mí.&amp;mdash;La idea

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de Ramón; de Ramón vivo, de Ramón muerto, de Ramón en
     el cielo, de Ramón en la ermita, se apoderó de mi cerebro de
     tal modo, que no pensé en otra cosa durante aquellas horas
     de agonía.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Quitáronme el uniforme de Capitán, y me pusieron una gorra

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; y un capote viejo de soldado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así marché a la muerte con mis diez y nueve compañeros de
     desventura....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sólo uno había sido indultado... ¡por la circunstancia de
     ser músico!&amp;mdash;Los carlistas perdonaban entonces la vida a los

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; músicos, a causa de tener gran falta de ellos en sus
     batallones....
                  &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p20&quot; id=&quot;p20&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p20)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Y ¿era V. músico, D. Basilio?&amp;mdash;¿Se salvó V. por eso?&amp;mdash;preguntaron
     todos los jóvenes a una voz.[[#p20n1|&lt;sup&gt;[20-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, hijos míos.... (respondió el veterano.) ¡Yo no era
     músico![[#i86|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii86&quot;&gt;(86)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Formóse el cuadro, y nos colocaron en medio de él....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo hacía el número once, es decir, yo moriría el
     undécimo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entonces pensé en mi mujer y en mi hija, ¡en ti y en tu
     madre, hija mía!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Empezaron los tiros....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Aquellas detonaciones me enloquecían!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Como tenía vendados los ojos, no veía caer a mis compañeros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Quise contar las descargas para saber, un momento antes de
     morir, que se acababa mi existencia en este mundo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Pero a la tercera o cuarta detonación perdí la cuenta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh! ¡Aquellos tiros tronarán eternamente en mi corazón y

     en mi cerebro, como tronaban aquel día!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ya creía oírlos a mil leguas de distancia; ya los sentía reventar
     dentro de mi cabeza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Y las detonaciones seguían!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ahora!&amp;mdash;pensaba yo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y crujía la descarga, y yo estaba vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Esta es!...&amp;mdash;me dije por último.[[#p20n2|&lt;sup&gt;[20-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y sentí que me cogían por los hombros, y me sacudían, y me
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; daban voces[[#i87|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii87&quot;&gt;(87)&lt;/sup&gt;]] en los oídos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Caí....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No pensé más....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero sentía algo como un profundo sueño....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y soñé que había muerto fusilado.&lt;/p&gt;

excluding women from the throne. A long and disastrous civil warfare

====VI====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Luego soñé que estaba tendido en una camilla, en mi prisión.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No veía.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Llevéme la mano a los ojos como para quitarme una venda, &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p21&quot; id=&quot;p21&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p21)&lt;/span --&gt;

     y me toqué los ojos abiertos, dilatados....&amp;mdash;¿Me había
     quedado ciego?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No....&amp;mdash;Era que la prisión se hallaba llena de tinieblas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oí un doble de campanas..., y temblé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Era el toque de &lt;i&gt;Animas&lt;/i&gt;.[[#p21n1|&lt;sup&gt;[21-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Son las nueve.... (pensé.)&amp;mdash;Pero ¿de qué día?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una sombra más obscura que el tenebroso aire de la prisión
     se inclinó sobre mí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Parecía un hombre....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Y los demás? ¿Y los otros diez y ocho?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Todos habían muerto fusilados!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Y yo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo vivía, o deliraba dentro del sepulcro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mis labios murmuraron maquinalmente un nombre, el nombre
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; de siempre,[[#p21n2|&lt;sup&gt;[21-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mi pesadilla....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡«Ramón!»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué quieres?&amp;mdash;me respondió la sombra que había a mi
     lado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Me estremecí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Dios mío! (exclamé.)&amp;mdash;¿Estoy en el otro mundo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No!&amp;mdash;dijo la misma voz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Ramón, ¿vives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y yo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;También.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Dónde estoy?&amp;mdash;¿Es ésta la ermita de San Nicolás?&amp;mdash;¿No
     me hallo prisionero?&amp;mdash;¿Lo he soñado todo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, Basilio; no has soñado nada.&amp;mdash;Escucha.&lt;/p&gt;

====VII====
&lt;p&gt; Como sabrás,[[#p21n3|&lt;sup&gt;[21-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ayer maté al Teniente Coronel en buena lid....&amp;mdash;¡Estoy
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; vengado!&amp;mdash;Después, loco de furor, seguí[[#i88|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii88&quot;&gt;(88)&lt;/sup&gt;]] matando...,

     y maté... hasta después de anochecido..., hasta
     que no había un cristino[[#p21n4|&lt;sup&gt;[21-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en el campo de batalla....
                     &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p22&quot; id=&quot;p22&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p22)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Cuando salió la luna, me acordé de[[#i89|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii89&quot;&gt;(89)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ti.&amp;mdash;Entonces enderecé
     mis pasos a la ermita de San Nicolás con intención de

     esperarte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Serían las diez de la noche. La cita era a la una, y la noche
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; antes no había yo pegado los ojos....&amp;mdash;Me dormí,[[#i90|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii90&quot;&gt;(90)&lt;/sup&gt;]] pues,
     profundamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al dar[[#i91|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii91&quot;&gt;(91)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la una, lancé un grito y desperté.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Soñaba que habías muerto....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Miré a mi alrededor,[[#i92|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii92&quot;&gt;(92)&lt;/sup&gt;]] y me encontré solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Qué había sido de[[#i93|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii93&quot;&gt;(93)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ti?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dieron las dos..., las tres..., las cuatro....&amp;mdash;¡Qué

     noche de angustia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tú no parecías....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Sin duda habías muerto!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Amaneció.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entonces dejé la ermita, y me dirigí a este pueblo en busca
     de los facciosos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Llegué al salir el sol.[[#p22n1|&lt;sup&gt;[22-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todos creían que yo había perecido la tarde antes....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Así fué que, al verme, me abrazaron, y el General me colmó

     de distinciones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En seguida supe que iban a ser fusilados veintiún[[#p22n2|&lt;sup&gt;[22-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] prisioneros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Un presentimiento se levantó en mi alma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Será Basilio uno de ellos?&amp;mdash;me dije.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Corrí, pues, hacia el lugar de la ejecución.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El cuadro estaba formado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oí unos tiros....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Habían empezado a fusilar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tendí la vista...; pero no veía....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Me cegaba el dolor; me desvanecía el miedo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al fin te distingo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ibas a morir fusilado!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Faltaban dos víctimas para llegar a ti....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Qué hacer?[[#i94|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii94&quot;&gt;(94)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
                &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p23&quot; id=&quot;p23&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p23)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Me volví loco; dí un grito; te cogí entre mis brazos, y, con
     una voz ronca, desgarradora, tremebunda, exclamé:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Éste no! ¡Éste no, mi General!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El General, que mandaba el cuadro, y que tanto me conocía[[#p23n1|&lt;sup&gt;[23-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; por mi comportamiento de la víspera, me preguntó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues qué, ¿es músico?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aquella palabra fué para mí lo que sería para un viejo ciego
     de nacimiento ver de pronto el sol en toda su refulgencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La luz de la esperanza brilló a mis ojos tan súbitamente, que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; los cegó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Músico (exclamé); sí..., sí..., mi General! ¡Es

     músico! ¡Un gran músico!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tú, entretanto, yacías sin conocimiento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué instrumento toca?&amp;mdash;preguntó el General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;El... la... el... el...; ¡si!... ¡justo!...,

     eso es..., ¡la corneta de llaves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Hace falta[[#i95|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii95&quot;&gt;(95)&lt;/sup&gt;]] un corneta[[#p23n2|&lt;sup&gt;[23-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de llaves?&amp;mdash;preguntó el General,
     volviéndose a la banda de música.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cinco segundos, cinco siglos, tardó la contestación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí, mi General; hace falta&amp;mdash;respondió el Músico mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues sacad a ese hombre de las filas, y que siga la ejecución
     al momento....&amp;mdash;exclamó el jefe carlista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entonces te cogí en mis brazos y te conduje a este calabozo.&lt;/p&gt;

====VIII====
&lt;p&gt; No bien dejó de[[#i96|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii96&quot;&gt;(96)&lt;/sup&gt;]] hablar Ramón, cuando me levanté[[#i97|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii97&quot;&gt;(97)&lt;/sup&gt;]] y le dije,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; con lágrimas, con risa, abrazándolo, trémulo, yo no sé cómo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Te debo la vida!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No tanto!&amp;mdash;respondió Ramón.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Cómo es eso?&amp;mdash;exclamé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Sabes tocar la corneta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues no me debes la vida, sino que he comprometido la
     mía sin salvar la tuya.
             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p24&quot; id=&quot;p24&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p24)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Quedéme frío como una piedra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y música? (preguntó Ramón.) ¿Sabes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Poca, muy poca....&amp;mdash;Ya recordarás la que nos enseñaron
     en el colegio....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Poco es, o, mejor dicho, nada!&amp;mdash;¡Morirás sin remedio!...
     ¡Y yo también, por traidor..., por falsario!&amp;mdash;¡Figúrate

     tú que dentro de quince días estará organizada la banda de
     música a que has de[[#i98|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii98&quot;&gt;(98)&lt;/sup&gt;]] pertenecer!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Quince días!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ni más ni menos!&amp;mdash;Y como no tocarás la corneta....
     (porque Dios no hará un milagro), nos fusilarán a los dos sin

     remedio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Fusilarte! (exclamé.) ¡A ti! ¡Por mí! ¡Por mí, que
     te debo la vida!&amp;mdash;¡Ah, no, no querrá el cielo! Dentro de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; quince días sabré música[[#p24n1|&lt;sup&gt;[24-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y tocaré la corneta de llaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ramón se echó a reír.&lt;/p&gt;

====IX====
&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué más queréis que os diga, hijos míos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En quince días... ¡oh poder de la voluntad! En quince

     días con sus quince noches (pues no dormí ni reposé un momento
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; en medio mes), ¡asombraos!... ¡En quince días aprendí
     a tocar la corneta!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Qué días aquellos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ramón y yo nos salíamos al campo, y pasábamos horas y

     horas con cierto músico que diariamente venía de un lugar
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; próximo a[[#i99|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii99&quot;&gt;(99)&lt;/sup&gt;]] darme lección....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;¡Escapar!&lt;/i&gt;...&amp;mdash; Leo en vuestros ojos esta palabra....&amp;mdash;¡Ay!
     Nada más imposible!&amp;mdash;Yo era prisionero, y me vigilaban....

     Y Ramón no quería escapar sin mí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y yo no hablaba, yo no pensaba, yo no comía....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Estaba loco, y mi monomanía era la música, la corneta, la
     endemoniada corneta de llaves....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Quería aprender, y aprendí!

                     &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p25&quot; id=&quot;p25&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p25)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Y, si hubiera sido mudo, habría hablado....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, paralítico, hubiera andado....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, ciego, hubiera visto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Porque &lt;i&gt;quería&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Oh! ¡La voluntad suple por todo!&amp;mdash;QUERER ES PODER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Quería&lt;/i&gt;: ¡he aquí la gran palabra!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Quería&lt;/i&gt;..., y lo conseguí.&amp;mdash;¡Niños, aprended esta gran

     verdad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Salvé, pues, mi vida y la de Ramón.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Pero me volví loco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, loco, mi locura fué el arte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En tres años no solté la corneta de la mano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si&lt;/i&gt;; he aquí mi mundo durante todo aquel
     tiempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Mi vida se reducía a soplar.[[#p25n1|&lt;sup&gt;[25-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ramón no me abandonaba....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Emigré a Francia, y en Francia seguí tocando la corneta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡La corneta era yo! ¡Yo cantaba con la corneta en la boca!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los hombres, los pueblos, las notabilidades[[#p25n2|&lt;sup&gt;[25-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del arte se

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; agrupaban para oírme....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aquello era un pasmo, una maravilla....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La corneta se doblegaba entre mis dedos; se hacía elástica,
     gemía, lloraba, gritaba, rugía; imitaba al ave[[#p25n3|&lt;sup&gt;[25-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]], a la fiera, al sollozo

     humano....&amp;mdash;Mi pulmón era de hierro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Así viví otros dos años más.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al cabo de ellos falleció mi amigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mirando su cadáver, recobré la razón....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y cuando, ya en mi juicio, cogí un día la corneta... (¡qué
     asombro!), me encontré con que[[#p25n4|&lt;sup&gt;[25-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no sabía tocarla....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Me pediréis ahora que os haga són[[#p25n5|&lt;sup&gt;[25-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para bailar?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Madrid, 1854.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p22n2&quot; id=&quot;p22n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;22-2: &lt;b&gt;veintiún&lt;/b&gt;: (for &lt;i&gt;veinte y un&lt;/i&gt;.) Observe that &lt;i&gt;uno&lt;/i&gt; in
compounds is not pluralized and drops &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; before a noun. Other compounds
are similarly formed, e.g. &lt;i&gt;dieciseis, veintiseis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p23n1&quot; id=&quot;p23n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;23-1: &lt;b&gt;tanto me conocía&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;knew me so well&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p24n1&quot; id=&quot;p24n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;24-1: &lt;b&gt;sabré música&lt;/b&gt;: ordinarily the definite article is used before
a noun employed in a general sense. Here a partitive sense is hinted: &lt;i&gt;I
shall know&lt;/i&gt; (some) &lt;i&gt;music&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p25n1&quot; id=&quot;p25n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;25-1: &lt;b&gt;mi vida se reducía a soplar&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;I passed all my time in
playing&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;soplar&lt;/i&gt;, to blow).&lt;/p&gt;

with accented &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ha. Un&lt;/i&gt; is occasionally used for &lt;i&gt;una&lt;/i&gt; in the same
cases (not academic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p25n4&quot; id=&quot;p25n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;25-4: &lt;b&gt;me encontré con que&lt;/b&gt;, etc.: &lt;i&gt;con&lt;/i&gt; governs the whole following
clause as its object. Psychologically an intervening noun is indicated:
&lt;i&gt;I met with&lt;/i&gt; (the discovery) &lt;i&gt;that I could not&lt;/i&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p25n5&quot; id=&quot;p25n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;25-5: &lt;b&gt;haga són&lt;/b&gt;: (make sound) &lt;i&gt;play&lt;/i&gt;. Alarcón has accented &lt;i&gt;són&lt;/i&gt; to

===Text===
&lt;p&gt; Un día que el célebre pintor flamenco Pedro Pablo Rubens[[#p26n1|&lt;sup&gt;[26-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     andaba recorriendo los templos de Madrid acompañado de sus
     afamados discípulos, penetró en la iglesia de un humilde convento,
     cuyo nombre no designa la tradición.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Poco o nada encontró que[[#i100|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii100&quot;&gt;(100)&lt;/sup&gt;]] admirar el ilustre artista en aquel
     pobre y desmantelado templo, y ya se marchaba renegando,

     como solía, del mal gusto de los frailes de Castilla la Nueva,[[#p26n2|&lt;sup&gt;[26-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     cuando reparó en cierto cuadro medio oculto en las sombras
     de feísima capilla;[[#p26n3|&lt;sup&gt;[26-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] acercóse a él, y lanzó una exclamación
     de asombro.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Sus discípulos le rodearon al momento,[[#p26n4|&lt;sup&gt;[26-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] preguntándole:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué habéis encontrado, maestro?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Mirad!&amp;mdash;dijo Rubens señalando, por toda contestación,
     al lienzo que tenía delante.[[#p26n5|&lt;sup&gt;[26-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Los jóvenes quedaron tan maravillados como el autor del

     &lt;i&gt;Descendimiento&lt;/i&gt;.[[#p26n6|&lt;sup&gt;[26-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Representaba aquel cuadro la &lt;i&gt;Muerte de un religioso&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;mdash; Era
     éste muy joven, y de una belleza que ni la penitencia ni la agonía
     habían podido eclipsar, y hallábase tendido sobre los ladrillos

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de su celda, velados ya los ojos por la muerte, con una mano
     extendida sobre una calavera, y estrechando con la otra, a su
     corazón, un crucifijo de madera y cobre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En el fondo del lienzo se veía pintado otro cuadro, que
     figuraba estar colgado[[#p26n7|&lt;sup&gt;[26-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cerca del[[#i101|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii101&quot;&gt;(101)&lt;/sup&gt;]] lecho de que se suponía haber

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; salido el religioso para morir con más humildad sobre la dura
     tierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aquel segundo cuadro representaba a una difunta, joven 
     hermosa, tendida en el ataúd entre fúnebres cirios y negras y
     suntuosas colgaduras....

                  &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p27&quot; id=&quot;p27&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p27)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Nadie hubiera podido mirar estas dos escenas, contenida la
     una en la otra, sin comprender que se explicaban y completaban
     recíprocamente. Un amor desgraciado, una esperanza
     muerta, un desencanto de la vida, un olvido eterno del mundo:
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; he aquí el poema misterioso que se deducía de los dos ascéticos

     dramas que encerraba aquel lienzo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Por lo demás, el color, el dibujo, la composición, todo revelaba
     un genio de primer orden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Maestro, ¿de quién puede ser esta magnífica obra?&amp;mdash;preguntaron
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; a Rubens sus discípulos, que ya habían alcanzado

     el cuadro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;En este ángulo ha habido un nombre escrito (respondió
     el maestro); pero hace muy pocos meses que ha sido borrado.&amp;mdash;En
     cuanto a la pintura, no tiene arriba de treinta años, ni
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; menos de veinte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero el autor....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;El autor, según el mérito del cuadro, pudiera ser Velazquez,[[#p27n1|&lt;sup&gt;[27-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     Zurbarán, Ribera, o el joven Murillo, de quien tan prendado
     estoy.... Pero Velazquez no siente de este modo.
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Tampoco es Zurbarán, si atiendo al color y a la manera de ver

     el asunto. Menos aún debe atribuirse a Murillo ni a Ribera:
     aquél[[#i102|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii102&quot;&gt;(102)&lt;/sup&gt;]] es más tierno, y éste es más sombrío; y, además, ese
     estilo no pertenece ni a la escuela del uno ni a la del otro. En
     resumen: yo no conozco al autor de este cuadro, y hasta juraría
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; que no he visto jamás obras suyas.&amp;mdash;Voy más lejos: creo que

     el pintor desconocido, y acaso ya muerto, que ha legado al
     mundo tal maravilla,[[#p27n2|&lt;sup&gt;[27-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no perteneció a ninguna escuela, ni ha
     pintado más cuadro que éste, ni hubiera podido pintar otro que
     se le acercara en mérito.... Ésta es una obra de pura inspiración,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; un asunto &lt;i&gt;propio&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p27n3|&lt;sup&gt;[27-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] un reflejo del alma, un pedazo de la

     vida.... Pero.... ¡Qué idea!&amp;mdash;¿Queréis saber quién ha
     pintado ese cuadro?&amp;mdash;¡Pues lo ha pintado ese mismo muerto
     que veis en él!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eh! Maestro.... ¡Vos[[#p27n4|&lt;sup&gt;[27-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] os burláis!

                       &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p28&quot; id=&quot;p28&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p28)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;No: yo me entiendo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero ¿cómo concebís que un difunto haya podido pintar
     su agonía?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Concibiendo que un vivo pueda adivinar o representar su

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; muerte!&amp;mdash;Además, vosotros sabéis que profesar &lt;i&gt;de veras&lt;/i&gt;[[#p28n1|&lt;sup&gt;[28-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en
     ciertas Órdenes religiosas es morir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ah! ¿Creéis vos?...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Creo que aquella mujer que está de cuerpo presente[[#p28n2|&lt;sup&gt;[28-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en el
     fondo del cuadro era el alma[[#p28n3|&lt;sup&gt;[28-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y la vida de este fraile que agoniza
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; contra el suelo; creo que, cuando ella murió, él se creyó
     también muerto, y murió efectivamente para el mundo; creo,

     en fin, que esta obra, más que el último instante de su héroe o
     de su autor (que indudablemente son una misma persona),
     representa la profesión de un joven desengañado de alegrías
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; terrenales....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿De modo que puede vivir todavía?...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Sí, señor, que puede[[#p28n4|&lt;sup&gt;[28-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] vivir! Y como la cosa tiene fecha,
     tal vez[[#i103|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii103&quot;&gt;(103)&lt;/sup&gt;]] su espíritu se habrá serenado[[#p28n5|&lt;sup&gt;[28-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y hasta regocijado, y el
     desconocido artista sea ahora un viejo muy gordo y muy
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; alegre....&amp;mdash;Por todo lo cual ¡hay que[[#i104|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii104&quot;&gt;(104)&lt;/sup&gt;]] buscarlo! Y, sobre

     todo, necesitamos averiguar si llegó a pintar más
     obras....&amp;mdash;Seguidme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y así diciendo, Rubens se dirigió a un fraile que rezaba en
     otra capilla y le preguntó con su desenfado habitual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Queréis decirle al Padre Prior que deseo hablarle de

     parte del Rey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El fraile, que era hombre de alguna edad, se levantó trabajosamente,
     y respondió con voz humilde y quebrantada:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué me queréis?&amp;mdash;Yo soy el Prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Perdonad, padre mío, que interrumpa vuestras oraciones

     (replicó Rubens). ¿Pudierais decirme quién es el autor de
     este cuadro?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿De ese cuadro? (exclamó el religioso.) ¿Qué pensaría
     V. de mí si le contestase que no me acuerdo?
                 &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p29&quot; id=&quot;p29&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p29)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¿Cómo? ¿Lo sabíais, y habéis podido olvidarlo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí, hijo mío, lo he olvidado completamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues, padre... (dijo Rubens en són de burla[[#p29n1|&lt;sup&gt;[29-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] procaz),
     ¡tenéis muy mala memoria!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; El Prior volvió a arrodillarse sin hacerle caso.[[#i105|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii105&quot;&gt;(105)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vengo en nombre del Rey!&amp;mdash;gritó el soberbio y mimado
     flamenco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué más queréis, hermano mío?&amp;mdash;murmuró el fraile,
     levantando lentamente la cabeza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Compraros[[#p29n2|&lt;sup&gt;[29-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] este cuadro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Ese cuadro no se vende.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues bien: decidme dónde encontraré a su autor....&amp;mdash;Su
     Majestad deseará conocerlo, y yo necesito abrazarlo, felicitarlo...,

     demostrarle mi admiración y mi cariño....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Todo eso es también irrealizable....&amp;mdash;Su autor no está
     ya[[#i106|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii106&quot;&gt;(106)&lt;/sup&gt;]] en el mundo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ha muerto!&amp;mdash;exclamó Rubens con desesperación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡El maestro decía bien! (pronunció uno de los jóvenes.)
     Ese cuadro está pintado por un difunto....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ha muerto!... (repitió Rubens.) ¡Y nadie lo ha conocido!
     ¡Y se ha olvidado su nombre!&amp;mdash;¡Su nombre, que
     debió ser inmortal![[#p29n3|&lt;sup&gt;[29-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Su nombre, que hubiera eclipsado el

     mío!&amp;mdash;Sí; &lt;i&gt;el mío&lt;/i&gt;..., padre.... (añadió el artista con
     noble orgullo.) ¡Porque habéis de saber[[#p29n4|&lt;sup&gt;[29-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que yo soy Pedro Pablo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Rubens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A este nombre, glorioso en todo el universo, y que ningún
     hombre consagrado a Dios desconocía ya, por ir unido[[#p29n5|&lt;sup&gt;[29-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a cien
     cuadros místicos, verdaderas maravillas del arte, el rostro pálido
     del Prior se enrojeció súbitamente, y sus abatidos ojos se clavaron
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; en el semblante del extranjero con tanta veneración

     como sorpresa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ah! ¡Me conocíais! (exclamó Rubens con infantil satisfacción.)
     ¡Me alegro en el alma! ¡Así seréis menos fraile
     conmigo!&amp;mdash;Conque... ¡vamos![[#p29n6|&lt;sup&gt;[29-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¿Me vendéis el cuadro?

                            &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p30&quot; id=&quot;p30&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p30)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡Pedís un imposible!&amp;mdash;respondió el Prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues bien: ¿sabéis de alguna otra obra de ese malogrado
     genio? ¿No podréis recordar su nombre? ¿Queréis decirme
     cuándo murió?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Me habéis comprendido mal.... (replicó el fraile.)&amp;mdash;Os
     he dicho que el autor de esa pintura no pertenece al mundo;
     pero esto no significa precisamente que haya muerto....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Oh! ¡Vive! ¡vive! (exclamaron todos los pintores.)
     ¡Haced que lo conozcamos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Para qué? ¡El infeliz ha renunciado a todo lo de la
     tierra! ¡Nada tiene que ver[[#i107|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii107&quot;&gt;(107)&lt;/sup&gt;]] con los hombres!... ¡nada!...&amp;mdash;Os
     suplico, por tanto, que lo dejéis morir en paz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Oh! (dijo Rubens con exaltación.) ¡Eso no puede ser,
     padre mío! Cuando Dios enciende en un alma[[#p30n1|&lt;sup&gt;[30-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el fuego sagrado

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; del genio, no es para que esa alma se consuma en la soledad,
     sino para que cumpla su misión sublime de iluminar el alma de
     los demás hombres. ¡Nombradme el monasterio en que se oculta
     el grande artista,[[#p30n2|&lt;sup&gt;[30-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y yo iré a buscarlo y lo devolveré al siglo[[#p30n3|&lt;sup&gt;[30-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     &amp;mdash;¡Oh! ¡Cuánta gloria le espera!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero... ¿y si la rehusa?&amp;mdash;preguntó el Prior tímidamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Si la rehusa acudiré al Papa, con cuya amistad me honro,
     y el Papa lo convencerá mejor que yo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡El Papa!&amp;mdash;exclamó el Prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Sí, padre; el Papa!&amp;mdash;repitió Rubens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ved por lo que[[#p30n4|&lt;sup&gt;[30-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no os diría el nombre de ese pintor

     aunque lo recordase! ¡Ved por lo que[[#i108|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii108&quot;&gt;(108)&lt;/sup&gt;]] no os diré a qué convento
     se ha refugiado!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues bien, padre, ¡el Rey y el Papa os obligarán á decirlo!
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; (respondió Rubens exasperado.)&amp;mdash;Yo me encargo de que así
     suceda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Oh! ¡No lo haréis! (exclamó el fraile.)&amp;mdash;¡Haríais muy
     mal, señor Rubens!&amp;mdash;Llevaos[[#p30n5|&lt;sup&gt;[30-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el cuadro si queréis; pero dejad
     tranquilo al que descansa.&amp;mdash;¡Os hablo en nombre de Dios!&amp;mdash; &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p31&quot; id=&quot;p31&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p31)&lt;/span --&gt;

     ¡Sí! Yo he conocido, yo he amado, yo he consolado, yo he
     redimido, yo he salvado de entre las olas de las pasiones y las desdichas,
     náufrago y agonizante, a ese grande hombre, como vos
     decis, a ese infortunado y ciego mortal, como yo le llamo; olvidado[[#p31n1|&lt;sup&gt;[31-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ayer de Dios y de sí mismo, hoy cercano a la suprema

     felicidad!...&amp;mdash;¡La gloria!...&amp;mdash;¿Conocéis alguna mayor
     que aquélla a que él aspira? ¿Con qué derecho queréis resucitar
     en su alma los fuegos fatuos de las vanidades de la tierra,
     cuando arde en su corazón la pira inextinguible de la caridad?&amp;mdash;¿Creéis
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; que ese hombre, antes de dejar el mundo, antes de

     renunciar a las riquezas, a la fama, al poder, a la juventud, al
     amor, a todo lo que desvanece a las criaturas, no habrá sostenido
     ruda batalla con su corazón? ¿No adivináis los desengaños y
     amarguras que lo llevarían[[#p31n2|&lt;sup&gt;[31-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] al conocimiento de la mentira de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; las cosas humanas?&amp;mdash;Y ¿queréis volverlo a la pelea cuando ya

     ha triunfado?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero ¡eso es renunciar a la inmortalidad!&amp;mdash;gritó Rubens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eso es aspirar a ella!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y ¿con qué derecho os interponéis vos entre ese hombre
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; y el mundo?&amp;mdash;¡Dejad que le hable, y él decidirá!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Lo hago con el derecho de un hermano mayor, de un
     maestro, de un padre; que todo esto soy para él.... ¡Lo hago
     en el nombre de Dios, os vuelvo a decir!&amp;mdash;Respetadlo...,
     para bien de vuestra alma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Y, así diciendo, el religioso cubrió su cabeza con la capucha

     y se alejó a lo largo del templo.[[#p31n3|&lt;sup&gt;[31-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Vámonos[[#p31n4|&lt;sup&gt;[31-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (dijo Rubens.) Yo sé lo que me toca[[#i109|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii109&quot;&gt;(109)&lt;/sup&gt;]] hacer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Maestro! (exclamó uno de los discípulos, que durante la
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; anterior conversación había estado mirando alternativamente al

     lienzo y al religioso.) ¿No creéis, como yo, que ese viejo frailuco
     se parece muchísimo al joven que se muere en este cuadro?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Calla![[#p31n5|&lt;sup&gt;[31-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Pues es verdad!&amp;mdash;exclamaron todos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Restad las arrugas y las barbas, y sumad los treinta años

     que manifiesta la pintura, y resultará que el maestro tenía &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p32&quot; id=&quot;p32&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p32)&lt;/span --&gt;
     razón[[#i110|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii110&quot;&gt;(110)&lt;/sup&gt;]] cuando decía que ese religioso muerto era a un mismo tiempo
     retrato y obra de un religioso vivo.&amp;mdash;Ahora bien:[[#i111|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii111&quot;&gt;(111)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Dios me
     confunda si ese religioso vivo no es el Padre Prior!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entretanto Rubens, sombrío, avergonzado y enternecido profundamente,

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; veía alejarse al anciano, el cual lo saludó cruzando
     los brazos sobre el pecho poco antes de desaparecer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡&lt;i&gt;Él era&lt;/i&gt;..., sí!... (balbuceó el artista.)&amp;mdash;¡Oh!...
     Vamonos.... (añadió volviéndose a sus discípulos.) ¡Ese

     hombre tenía razón! ¡Su gloria vale más que la mía!&amp;mdash; ¡Dejémoslo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; morir en paz!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y dirigiendo una última mirada al lienzo que tanto le había
     sorprendido, salió del templo y se dirigió a Palacio,[[#p32n1|&lt;sup&gt;[32-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] donde lo

     honraban SS. MM. teniéndole a la mesa.[[#p32n2|&lt;sup&gt;[32-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tres días después volvió Rubens, enteramente solo, a aquella
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; humilde capilla, deseoso de contemplar de nuevo[[#i112|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii112&quot;&gt;(112)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la maravillosa
     pintura, y aun de hablar otra vez[[#i113|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii113&quot;&gt;(113)&lt;/sup&gt;]] con su presunto autor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero el cuadro no estaba ya en su sitio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En cambio se encontró con que[[#p32n3|&lt;sup&gt;[32-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la nave principal del templo
     había un ataúd en el suelo, rodeado de toda la comunidad,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que salmodiaba el Oficio de difuntos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Acercóse a mirar el rostro del muerto, y vió que era el Padre
Prior.
     &amp;mdash;¡Gran pintor fué!... (dijo Rubens, luego que la sorpresa
     y el dolor hubieron cedido lugar a otros sentimientos.)&amp;mdash;¡Ahora
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; es cuando más se parece a su obra!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Madrid, 1858.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p26n1&quot; id=&quot;p26n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;26-1: &lt;b&gt;Pedro Pablo Rubens&lt;/b&gt;: Peter Paul Rubens, the great Flemish
painter (1577-1640). He enjoyed much royal patronage, and consequently
much of his work is now in the galleries of Spain and France.&lt;/p&gt;

of the indefinite article before &lt;i&gt;tal&lt;/i&gt;. Cf. note &lt;i&gt;a otro&lt;/i&gt;, p. 10, 1, and
also &lt;i&gt;un tal García&lt;/i&gt;, p. 33, 4.&lt;/p&gt;

prepositions, taking a verb in the second person plural. It is more
formal than &lt;i&gt;tú&lt;/i&gt; and less so than &lt;i&gt;usted&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Spanish &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; are the only consonants doubled. The Spanish
equivalents of English words with initial &lt;i&gt;imm&lt;/i&gt; are written &lt;i&gt;inm&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

====I====
&lt;p&gt; En la pequeña villa del &lt;i&gt;Padrón&lt;/i&gt;, sita en territorio gallego,[[#p33n1|&lt;sup&gt;[33-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y

     allá por el año[[#p33n2|&lt;sup&gt;[33-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del 1808, vendía sapos y culebras y agua llovediza,[[#p33n3|&lt;sup&gt;[33-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     a fuer[[#i114|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii114&quot;&gt;(114)&lt;/sup&gt;]] de legítimo boticario, un tal[[#i115|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii115&quot;&gt;(115)&lt;/sup&gt;]] GARCÍA[[#p33n4|&lt;sup&gt;[33-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] DE PAREDES,
     misántropo solterón, descendiente acaso, y sin acaso,[[#p33n5|&lt;sup&gt;[33-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de aquel

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; varón[[#p33n6|&lt;sup&gt;[33-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ilustre que mataba un toro de una puñada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Era una fría y triste noche de otoño. El cielo estaba encapotado
     por densas nubes, y la total carencia de alumbrado terrestre
     dejaba a las tinieblas campar por su respeto[[#p33n7|&lt;sup&gt;[33-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en todas las

     calles y plazas de la población.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; A eso de las diez de aquella pavorosa noche, que las lúgubres
     circunstancias de la patria hacían mucho más siniestra, desembocó
     en la plaza que hoy se llamará[[#p33n8|&lt;sup&gt;[33-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;de la Constitución&lt;/i&gt; un silencioso

     grupo de sombras, aun más negras que la obscuridad de
     cielo y tierra, las cuales avanzaron hacia la botica de García de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Paredes, cerrada completamente desde &lt;i&gt;las Ánimas&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p33n9|&lt;sup&gt;[33-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] o sea[[#i116|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii116&quot;&gt;(116)&lt;/sup&gt;]] desde
     las ocho y media en punto.[[#i117|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii117&quot;&gt;(117)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué hacemos?[[#p33n10|&lt;sup&gt;[33-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;dijo una de las sombras en correctísimo
     gallego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Nadie nos ha visto....&amp;mdash;observó otra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Derribar la puerta!&amp;mdash;propuso una mujer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Y matarlos!&amp;mdash;murmuraron hasta quince voces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Yo me encargo[[#i118|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii118&quot;&gt;(118)&lt;/sup&gt;]] del boticario!&amp;mdash;exclamó un chico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡De ése nos encargamos todos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Por judío![[#p33n11|&lt;sup&gt;[33-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Por &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dicen que hoy cenan con él más de[[#i119|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii119&quot;&gt;(119)&lt;/sup&gt;]] veinte franceses....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ya[[#i120|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii120&quot;&gt;(120)&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo creo! ¡Como saben que ahí están seguros, han
     acudido en montón!

              &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p34&quot; id=&quot;p34&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p34)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡ Ah! Si fuera en mi casa! ¡Tres alojados llevo echados[[#p34n1|&lt;sup&gt;[34-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     al pozo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Mi mujer degolló ayer a uno!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Y yo... (dijo un fraile con voz de figle) he asfixiado a

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; dos capitanes, dejando carbón encendido en &lt;i&gt;su celda&lt;/i&gt;, que antes
     era mía![[#p34n2|&lt;sup&gt;[34-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Y ese infame boticario los protege!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Qué expresivo estuvo ayer en paseo con esos viles

     excomulgados!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Quién lo había de esperar[[#p34n3|&lt;sup&gt;[34-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de García de Paredes! ¡No
     hace un mes que era el más valiente, el más patriota, el más
     realista del pueblo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma! ¡Como que[[#p34n4|&lt;sup&gt;[34-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] vendía en la botica retratos del
     príncipe Fernando![[#p34n5|&lt;sup&gt;[34-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Y ahora los vende de Napoleón!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Antes nos excitaba a la defensa contra los invasores....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y desde que vinieron al Padrón se pasó a[[#i121|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii121&quot;&gt;(121)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ellos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Y esta noche da de cenar[[#i122|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii122&quot;&gt;(122)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a todos los jefes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Oíd qué algazara traen![[#p34n6|&lt;sup&gt;[34-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Pues no gritan &lt;i&gt;¡viva el

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Emperador!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Paciencia.... (murmuró el fraile.) Todavía es muy
     temprano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dejémosles emborracharse.... (expuso una vieja.)
     Después entramos[[#p34n7|&lt;sup&gt;[34-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]... ¡y ni[[#i123|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii123&quot;&gt;(123)&lt;/sup&gt;]] uno ha de quedar vivo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pido que se haga cuartos[[#p34n8|&lt;sup&gt;[34-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] al boticario!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Se le hará ochavos,[[#p34n9|&lt;sup&gt;[34-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] si queréis! Un &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt; es más

     odioso que un francés. El francés atropella a un pueblo extraño:
     el afrancesado vende y deshonra a su patria. El francés comete
     un asesinato: el afrancesado ¡un parricidio!&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Mientras ocurría la anterior escena en la puerta de la botica,

     &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt; y sus convidados corrían la francachela[[#p34n10|&lt;sup&gt;[34-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] más
     alegre y desaforada que os podáis figurar.
                   &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p35&quot; id=&quot;p35&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p35)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Veinte eran, en efecto, los franceses que el boticario tenía a

     la mesa, todos ellos[[#i124|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii124&quot;&gt;(124)&lt;/sup&gt;]] jefes y oficiales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt; contaría[[#p35n1|&lt;sup&gt;[35-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cuarenta y cinco años; era
     alto y seco y más amarillo que una momia; dijérase[[#p35n2|&lt;sup&gt;[35-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que su

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; piel estaba muerta hacía mucho tiempo; llegábale la frente a
     la nuca, gracias a una calva limpia y reluciente, cuyo brillo tenía
     algo de fosfórico; sus ojos, negros y apagados, hundidos en las
     descarnadas cuencas, se parecían a esas lagunas encerradas
     entre montañas, que sólo ofrecen obscuridad, vértigos y muerte
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; al que las mira; lagunas que nada reflejan; que rugen sordamente

     alguna vez,[[#p35n3|&lt;sup&gt;[35-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pero sin alterarse; que devoran todo lo que
     cae en su superficie; que nada devuelven; que nadie ha podido
     sondear; que no se alimentan de ningún río, y cuyo fondo
     busca la imaginación en los mares antípodas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; La cena era abundante, el vino bueno, la conversación

     alegre y animada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los franceses reían, juraban, blasfemaban, cantaban, fumaban,
     comían y bebían a un mismo tiempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Quién[[#p35n4|&lt;sup&gt;[35-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] había contado los amores secretos de Napoleón;

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; quién la noche del 2 de Mayo[[#p35n5|&lt;sup&gt;[35-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en Madrid; cuál[[#p35n6|&lt;sup&gt;[35-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la batalla de
     las Pirámides;[[#p35n7|&lt;sup&gt;[35-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cuál otro la ejecución de Luis XVI.[[#p35n8|&lt;sup&gt;[35-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt; bebía, reía y charlaba como los demás, o
     quizás más que ninguno;[[#p35n9|&lt;sup&gt;[35-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y tan elocuente había estado en favor
     de la causa imperial, que los soldados del César[[#p35n10|&lt;sup&gt;[35-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo habían

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; abrazado, lo habían vitoreado, le habían improvisado himnos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Señores! (había dicho el boticario): la guerra que os
     hacemos los españoles es tan necia como inmotivada. Vosotros,
     hijos de la Revolución, venís a sacar a España[[#p35n11|&lt;sup&gt;[35-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de su tradicional

     abatimiento, a despreocuparla, a disipar las tinieblas religiosas,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; a mejorar sus anticuadas costumbres, a enseñarnos esas utilísimas
     e inconcusas «verdades de que no hay Dios, de que no hay
     otra vida, de que la penitencia, el ayuno, la castidad y demás
     virtudes católicas son quijotescas[[#p35n12|&lt;sup&gt;[35-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] locuras, impropias de un pueblo

     civilizado, y de que Napoleón es el verdadero Mesías, el &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p36&quot; id=&quot;p36&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p36)&lt;/span --&gt;
     redentor de los pueblos, el amigo de la especie humana....
     ¡Señores! ¡Viva el Emperador cuanto yo deseo que viva!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bravo, vítor!&amp;mdash;exclamaron los hombres del 2 de Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El boticario inclinó la frente con indecible angustia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Pronto volvió a alzarla, tan firme y tan sereno como antes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bebióse un vaso de vino, y continuó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Un abuelo mío, un &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;, un bárbaro, un
     Sansón,[[#p36n1|&lt;sup&gt;[36-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] un Hércules, un Milón de Crotona,[[#p36n2|&lt;sup&gt;[36-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mató doscientos

     franceses en un día.... Creo que fué en Italia. ¡Ya veis que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; no era tan &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt; como yo! ¡Adiestróse en las lides contra
     los moros del reino de Granada; armóle caballero el mismo[[#i125|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii125&quot;&gt;(125)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     Rey Católico,[[#p36n3|&lt;sup&gt;[36-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y montó más de una vez la guardia en el Quirinal,[[#p36n4|&lt;sup&gt;[36-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     siendo Papa &lt;i&gt;nuestro tío&lt;/i&gt; Alejandro Borja![[#p36n5|&lt;sup&gt;[36-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Eh, eh!
     ¡No me hacíais tan linajudo!&amp;mdash;Pues este DIEGO GARCÍA DE
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; PAREDES, este ascendiente mío..., que ha tenido un descendiente

     boticario, tomó a Cosenza y Manfredonia; entró por
     asalto en Cerinola, y peleó como bueno[[#p36n6|&lt;sup&gt;[36-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la batalla de Pavía![[#p36n7|&lt;sup&gt;[36-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     ¡Allí &lt;i&gt;hicimos&lt;/i&gt; prisionero a un rey de Francia, cuya espada ha
     estado en Madrid cerca de tres siglos, hasta que nos la robó

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; hace tres meses ese hijo de un posadero que viene a vuestra
     cabeza, y a quien llaman Murat![[#p36n8|&lt;sup&gt;[36-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aquí hizo otra pausa el boticario. Algunos franceses demostraron
     querer contestarle; pero él, levantándose, e imponiendo
     a todos silencio con su actitud, empuñó convulsivamente un

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; vaso, y exclamó con voz atronadora:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Brindo, señores, porque maldito sea mi abuelo, que era
     un animal, y porque se halle ahora mismo[[#i126|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii126&quot;&gt;(126)&lt;/sup&gt;]] en los profundos
     infiernos!&amp;mdash;¡Vivan los franceses de Francisco I[[#p36n9|&lt;sup&gt;[36-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y de Napoleón

     Bonaparte!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vivan!...&amp;mdash;respondieron los invasores, dándose por[[#i127|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii127&quot;&gt;(127)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     satisfechos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y todos apuraron su vaso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oyóse en esto[[#p36n10|&lt;sup&gt;[36-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] rumor en la calle, o, mejor dicho, a la puerta
     de la botica.
              &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p37&quot; id=&quot;p37&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p37)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¿Habéis oído?&amp;mdash;preguntaron los franceses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt; se sonrió.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vendrán[[#p37n1|&lt;sup&gt;[37-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a matarme!&amp;mdash;dijo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Quién?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Los vecinos[[#p37n2|&lt;sup&gt;[37-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del Padrón.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Por qué?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Por &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;mdash;Hace algunas noches que rondan mi

     casa....&amp;mdash;Pero ¿qué nos importa?&amp;mdash;Continuemos nuestra
     fiesta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí... ¡continuemos! exclamaron los convidados.
     ¡Estamos aquí para defenderos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y chocando ya botellas contra botellas, que no[[#p37n3|&lt;sup&gt;[37-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] vasos contra
     vasos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Viva Napoleón! ¡Muera Fernando![[#p37n4|&lt;sup&gt;[37-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Muera Galicia![[#p37n5|&lt;sup&gt;[37-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;gritaron

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; a una voz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt; esperó a que[[#p37n6|&lt;sup&gt;[37-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se acallase el brindis, y
     murmuró con acento lúgubre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Celedonio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El mancebo[[#p37n7|&lt;sup&gt;[37-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de la botica asomó por una puertecilla su cabeza
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; pálida y demudada, sin atreverse a penetrar en aquella caverna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Celedonio, trae papel y tintero&amp;mdash;dijo tranquilamente el

     boticario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El mancebo volvió con recado de escribir.[[#p37n8|&lt;sup&gt;[37-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Siéntate! (continuó su amo.)&amp;mdash;Ahora, escribe las cantidades
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; que yo te vaya diciendo. Divídelas en dos columnas.

     Encima de la columna de la derecha, pon: &lt;i&gt;Deuda&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p37n9|&lt;sup&gt;[37-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y encima
     de la otra: &lt;i&gt;Crédito&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Señor... (balbuceó el mancebo.)&amp;mdash;En la puerta hay

     una especie de motín.... Gritan &lt;i&gt;¡muera el boticario!&lt;/i&gt;...
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Y ¡quieren entrar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cállate y déjalos!&amp;mdash;Escribe lo que te he dicho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los franceses se rieron de admiración al ver al farmacéutico

     ocupado en ajustar cuentas cuando le rodeaban la muerte y la
     ruina.
            &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p38&quot; id=&quot;p38&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p38)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Celedonio alzó la cabeza y enristró la pluma, esperando cantidades
     que anotar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vamos a ver,[[#i128|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii128&quot;&gt;(128)&lt;/sup&gt;]] señores! (dijo entonces &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;,

     dirigiéndose a sus comensales.)&amp;mdash;Se trata de resumir nuestra
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; fiesta en un solo brindis. Empecemos por orden de colocación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Vos,[[#p38n1|&lt;sup&gt;[38-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Capitán, decidme: ¿cuántos españoles habréis matado[[#p38n2|&lt;sup&gt;[38-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     desde que pasasteis los Pirineos?[[#p38n3|&lt;sup&gt;[38-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bravo! ¡Magnífica idea!&amp;mdash;exclamaron los franceses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo.... (dijo el interrogado, trepándose en la silla y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; retorciéndose el bigote con petulancia.) Yo... habré
     matado... personalmente... con mi espada... ¡poned
     unos diez o doce!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Once a la[[#i129|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii129&quot;&gt;(129)&lt;/sup&gt;]] derecha![[#p38n4|&lt;sup&gt;[38-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;gritó el boticario, dirigiéndose al
     mancebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; El mancebo repitió, después de escribir:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Deuda&lt;/i&gt;... once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Corriente! (prosiguió el anfitrión.)&amp;mdash;¿Y vos?...&amp;mdash;Con
     vos hablo, señor Julio....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... seis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y vos, mi Comandante?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... veinte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... ocho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo catorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... ninguno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Yo no sé!...; he tirado a ciegas[[#i130|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii130&quot;&gt;(130)&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&amp;mdash;respondía
     cada cual,[[#i131|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii131&quot;&gt;(131)&lt;/sup&gt;]] según le llegaba su turno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y el mancebo seguía anotando cantidades a la derecha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Veamos ahora, Capitán! (continuó &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;.)&amp;mdash;Volvamos

     a empezar[[#p38n5|&lt;sup&gt;[38-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por vos. ¿Cuántos españoles esperáis
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; matar en el resto de la guerra, suponiendo que dure todavía...
     tres años?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eh!... (respondió el Capitán.)&amp;mdash;¿Quién calcula[[#p38n6|&lt;sup&gt;[38-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] eso?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Calculadlo...; os lo suplico....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Poned otros once.
           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p39&quot; id=&quot;p39&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p39)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Once a la izquierda....&amp;mdash;dictó &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y Celedonio repitió:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Crédito&lt;/i&gt;, once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Y vos?&amp;mdash;interrogó el farmacéutico por el mismo orden[[#p39n1|&lt;sup&gt;[39-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; seguido anteriormente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... quince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... veinte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... ciento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo... mil&amp;mdash;respondían los franceses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ponlos todos a &lt;i&gt;diez&lt;/i&gt;, Celedonio!... (murmuró irónicamente
     el boticario.)&amp;mdash;Ahora, suma por separado[[#p39n2|&lt;sup&gt;[39-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] las dos
     columnas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El pobre joven, que había anotado las cantidades con sudores
     de muerte, vióse obligado a hacer el resumen con los dedos,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; como las viejas. Tal era su terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al cabo de un rato de horrible silencio, exclamó, dirigiéndose
     a su amo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Deuda&lt;/i&gt;..., 285.&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Crédito&lt;/i&gt;..., 200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Es decir[[#i132|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii132&quot;&gt;(132)&lt;/sup&gt;]]... (añadió &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;), ¡doscientos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ochenta y cinco &lt;i&gt;muertos&lt;/i&gt;, y doscientos &lt;i&gt;sentenciados&lt;/i&gt;! ¡Total,

     cuatrocientas ochenta y cinco &lt;i&gt;víctimas&lt;/i&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y pronunció estas palabras con voz tan honda y sepulcral,
     que los franceses se miraron alarmados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En tanto,[[#i133|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii133&quot;&gt;(133)&lt;/sup&gt;]] el boticario ajustaba una nueva cuenta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Somos unos héroes!&amp;mdash;exclamó al terminarla.&amp;mdash;Nos
     hemos bebido[[#p39n3|&lt;sup&gt;[39-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] setenta botellas, o sean[[#p39n4|&lt;sup&gt;[39-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ciento cinco libras y
     media de vino, que, repartidas entre veintiuno, pues todos hemos

     bebido con igual bizarría, dan cinco libras de líquido por
     cabeza.&amp;mdash;¡Repito que somos unos héroes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Crujieron en esto las tablas de la puerta de la botica, y el
     mancebo balbuceó tambaleándose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ya entran!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué hora es?[[#i134|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii134&quot;&gt;(134)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;preguntó el boticario con suma
     tranquilidad.
                  &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p40&quot; id=&quot;p40&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p40)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Las once. Pero ¿no oye usted que entran?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Déjalos! &lt;i&gt;Ya es hora&lt;/i&gt;.[[#p40n1|&lt;sup&gt;[40-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hora!... ¿de qué?&amp;mdash;murmuraron los franceses, procurando
     levantarse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Pero estaban tan &lt;i&gt;ebrios&lt;/i&gt;, que no podían moverse de sus sillas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que entren![[#p40n2|&lt;sup&gt;[40-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Que entren!... (exclamaban, sin embargo,

     con voz vinosa, sacando los sables con mucha dificultad
     y sin conseguir ponerse de pie.)[[#i135|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii135&quot;&gt;(135)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Que entren esos canallas!
     ¡Nosotros los recibiremos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; En esto,[[#p40n3|&lt;sup&gt;[40-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sonaba ya abajo, en la botica, el estrépito de los

     botes y redomas que los vecinos[[#p40n4|&lt;sup&gt;[40-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del Padrón hacían pedazos,[[#i136|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii136&quot;&gt;(136)&lt;/sup&gt;]] y
     oíase resonar en la escalera este grito unánime y terrible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Muera el &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt; Levantóse &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;, como impulsado por un resorte,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; al oír semejante clamor dentro de su casa, y apoyóse en la mesa
     para no caer de nuevo sobre la silla. Tendió en torno suyo

     una mirada de inexplicable regocijo, dejó ver[[#i137|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii137&quot;&gt;(137)&lt;/sup&gt;]] en sus labios la
     inmortal sonrisa del triunfador, y así, transfigurado y hermoso,
     con el doble temblor de la muerte y del entusiasmo, pronunció
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; las siguientes palabras, entrecortadas y solemnes como las campanadas
     del toque de agonía:[[#p40n5|&lt;sup&gt;[40-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Franceses!... Si cualquiera de vosotros, o todos juntos,
     hallarais ocasión propicia de vengar la muerte de doscientos
     ochenta y cinco compatriotas y de salvar la vida a otros doscientos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; más; si sacrificando vuestra existencia pudieseis desenojar
     la indignada sombra de vuestros antepasados, castigar a los

     verdugos de doscientos ochenta y cinco héroes, y librar de la
     muerte a doscientos compañeros, a doscientos hermanos,
     aumentando así las huestes del ejército patrio con doscientos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; campeones de la independencia nacional, ¿repararíais ni[[#p40n6|&lt;sup&gt;[40-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] un
     momento en vuestra miserable vida? ¿Dudaríais ni un punto &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p41&quot; id=&quot;p41&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p41)&lt;/span --&gt;

     en abrazaros, como Sansón,[[#p41n1|&lt;sup&gt;[41-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a la columna del templo, y morir,
     a precio de matar a los enemigos de Dios?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué dice?&amp;mdash;se preguntaron los franceses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Señor..., ¡los asesinos están en la antesala!&amp;mdash;exclamó

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Celedonio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que entren!... (gritó &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;.)&amp;mdash;Ábreles
     la puerta de la sala.... ¿Qué vengan todos... a ver[[#i138|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii138&quot;&gt;(138)&lt;/sup&gt;]] cómo
     muere el descendiente de un soldado de Pavía![[#p41n2|&lt;sup&gt;[41-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los franceses, aterrados, estúpidos, clavados en sus sillas por
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; insoportable letargo, creyendo que la muerte de que hablaba el
     español iba a entrar en aquel aposento en pos de[[#i139|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii139&quot;&gt;(139)&lt;/sup&gt;]] los amotinados,
     hacían penosos esfuerzos por levantar los sables, que yacían
     sobre la mesa; pero ni siquiera conseguían que sus flojos dedos

     asiesen las empuñaduras: parecía que los hierros[[#p41n3|&lt;sup&gt;[41-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] estaban adheridos[[#p41n4|&lt;sup&gt;[41-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; a la tabla por insuperable fuerza de atracción.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En esto inundaron la estancia más de cincuenta hombres y
     mujeres, armados con palos, puñales y pistolas, dando tremendos

     alaridos y lanzando fuego por los ojos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Mueran todos!&amp;mdash;exclamaron algunas mujeres, lanzándose
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; las primeras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Deteneos!&amp;mdash;gritó &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt; con tal voz, con

     tal actitud, con tal fisonomía, que, unido este grito a la inmovilidad
     y silencio de los veinte franceses, impuso frío terror a
     la muchedumbre, la cual no se esperaba[[#p41n5|&lt;sup&gt;[41-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] aquel tranquilo y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; lúgubre recibimiento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No tenéis para qué[[#p41n6|&lt;sup&gt;[41-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[#i140|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii140&quot;&gt;(140)&lt;/sup&gt;]] blandir los puñales.... (continuó
     el boticario con voz desfallecida.)&amp;mdash;He hecho más que todos
     vosotros por la independencia de la Patria.... ¡Me he fingido
     &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt;!... Y ¡ya veis!... los veinte Jefes y Oficiales

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; invasores... ¡los veinte!&amp;mdash;no los toquéis[[#p41n7|&lt;sup&gt;[41-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]...&amp;mdash;¡están
     envenenados!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Un grito simultáneo de terror y admiración salió del pecho
     de los españoles. Dieron[[#i141|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii141&quot;&gt;(141)&lt;/sup&gt;]] éstos un paso más hacia los convidados,

     y hallaron que la mayor parte estaban ya muertos, con la &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p42&quot; id=&quot;p42&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p42)&lt;/span --&gt;
     cabeza caída hacia adelante, los brazos extendidos sobre la
     mesa, y la mano crispada en la empuñadura de los sables. Los
     demás agonizaban silenciosamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Viva &lt;i&gt;García de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;mdash;exclamaron entonces los españoles,

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; rodeando al héroe moribundo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Celedonio.... (murmuró el farmacéutico.)&amp;mdash;El &lt;i&gt;opio&lt;/i&gt; se
     ha concluido.... Manda por opio a la Coruña[[#p42n1|&lt;sup&gt;[42-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y cayó de rodillas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sólo entonces comprendieron los vecinos del Padrón que el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; boticario estaba también envenenado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Vierais[[#p42n2|&lt;sup&gt;[42-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] entonces un cuadro tan sublime como espantoso.&amp;mdash;Varias

     mujeres, sentadas en el suelo, sostenían en sus faldas y en
     sus brazos al expirante patriota, siendo las primeras en colmarlo
     de caricias y bendiciones, como antes fueron las primeras en
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; pedir su muerte.&amp;mdash;Los hombres habían cogido todas las luces
     de la mesa, y alumbraban arrodillados aquel grupo de patriotismo

     y caridad....&amp;mdash;Quedaban, finalmente, en la sombra
     veinte muertos o moribundos, de los cuales algunos iban desplomándose
     contra el suelo con pavorosa pesantez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Y a cada suspiro de muerte que se oía, a cada francés que
     venía a tierra, una sonrisa gloriosa iluminaba la faz de &lt;i&gt;García

     de Paredes&lt;/i&gt;, el cual de allí a poco[[#i142|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii142&quot;&gt;(142)&lt;/sup&gt;]] devolvió su espíritu al cielo,
     bendecido por un Ministro del Señor y llorado de sus hermanos
     en la Patria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Madrid, 1856.&lt;/p&gt;

negative pronouns and adverbs, sometimes loses its negative value. Cf.

===Text===

====I====
&lt;p&gt; El tierno episodio que voy a referir es rigurosamente histórico,
     como los anteriores y como los siguientes; pero no ya sólo

     por la materia, sino también por la forma.&amp;mdash;Vivo está quien lo
     cuenta, como suele decirse..., y entiéndase que quien le
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; cuenta no soy yo; es un Capitán retirado que dejó el servicio
     en 1814.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hoy no soy escritor; soy mero amanuense: no os pido, pues,

     admiración ni indulgencia, sino que me creáis a puño cerrado.[[#p43n1|&lt;sup&gt;[43-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Para invención, el asunto es de poca monta; y luego pertenece
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; a un género en que yo no me tomaría el trabajo de inventar
     nada....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Presumo de liberal,[[#p43n2|&lt;sup&gt;[43-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y un pobre Capitán retirado me ha conmovido

     profundamente contándome los sinsabores... políticos
     de un Papa muy absolutista....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Mi objeto es conmoveros hoy a vosotros con su misma
     relación, a fin de que el número de los derrotados cohoneste
     mi derrota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Habla mi Capitán.&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt; Uno de los más calurosos días del mes de Julio de 1809, y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ¡cuidado que[[#p43n3|&lt;sup&gt;[43-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] aquel dichoso año hizo calor! a eso de las diez

     de la mañana, entrábamos en Montelimart, villa o ciudad del
     Delfinado,[[#p43n4|&lt;sup&gt;[43-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que lo que sea no lo sé,[[#p43n5|&lt;sup&gt;[43-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ni lo he sabido &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p44&quot; id=&quot;p44&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p44)&lt;/span --&gt;
     nunca, y  maldita la falta[[#p44n1|&lt;sup&gt;[44-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que me hacía saber que existía

     tal Francia en el mundo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ah! ¿Conque era en Francia?...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues ¡hombre![[#p44n2|&lt;sup&gt;[44-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Me gusta! ¿Dónde está el Delfinado
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; sino en Francia?&amp;mdash;Y no crean ustedes que ahí, en la frontera...,

     sino muy tierra adentro,[[#p44n3|&lt;sup&gt;[44-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] más cerca del Piamonte[[#p44n4|&lt;sup&gt;[44-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que de
     España....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Siga V...., Capitán! Los niños... que aprendan[[#p44n5|&lt;sup&gt;[44-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     en la escuela....&amp;mdash;Y tú, ¡a ver si[[#p44n6|&lt;sup&gt;[44-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] te callas, Eduardito!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues como digo, entrábamos en Montelimart, ahogados
     de calor y polvo, y rendidos[[#p44n7|&lt;sup&gt;[44-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de caminar a pie[[#i143|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii143&quot;&gt;(143)&lt;/sup&gt;]] durante tres semanas,

     veintisiete[[#p44n8|&lt;sup&gt;[44-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] oficiales españoles que habíamos caído prisioneros
     en Gerona[[#p44n9|&lt;sup&gt;[44-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... Mas no creáis[[#p44n10|&lt;sup&gt;[44-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que en la capitulación
     de la plaza, sino en una salida que hicimos pocos días antes, a

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; fin de[[#i144|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii144&quot;&gt;(144)&lt;/sup&gt;]] estorbar unas obras en el campamento francés.... Pero
     esto no hace al caso.[[#i145|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii145&quot;&gt;(145)&lt;/sup&gt;]] Ello es[[#p44n11|&lt;sup&gt;[44-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que nos atraparon y nos llevaron
     a Perpiñán,[[#p44n12|&lt;sup&gt;[44-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] desde donde nos destinaron a Dijon[[#p44n13|&lt;sup&gt;[44-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... Y

     ahí tienen Vds. el por qué[[#p44n14|&lt;sup&gt;[44-14]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de lo que voy a referir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pues, señor, como uno se acostumbra a todo, y el Emperador
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; nos pasaba[[#p44n15|&lt;sup&gt;[44-15]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;diez reales&lt;/i&gt; diarios durante el viaje&amp;mdash;que íbamos

     haciendo a jornadas militares de tres o cuatro leguas,&amp;mdash;y nadie
     nos custodiaba, porque cada uno de nosotros había respondido
     con su cabeza de que no desertarían los demás, y veintisiete
     españoles juntos no se han aburrido nunca, sucedía que, sin embargo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; del[[#p44n16|&lt;sup&gt;[44-16]&lt;/sup&gt;]] calor, de la fatiga y de no saber ni una palabra de

     francés, pasábamos muchos ratos divertidos,[[#p44n17|&lt;sup&gt;[44-17]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sobre todo desde
     las once de la mañana hasta las siete de la tarde, horas que permanecíamos
     en las poblaciones del tránsito; pues las jornadas
     las hacíamos de noche con la fresca.... A ver, Antonio,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; enciéndeme esta pipa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Montelimart....&amp;mdash;¡Bonito pueblo!...&amp;mdash;El café está en
     una calle cerca de la Plaza, y en él entramos a refrescarnos, es
     decir, a evitar el sol... (pues los bolsillos no se prestaban a
     gollerías), en tanto que[[#p44n18|&lt;sup&gt;[44-18]&lt;/sup&gt;]] tres de nuestros compañeros  &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p45&quot; id=&quot;p45&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p45)&lt;/span --&gt;

     iban a ver al Prefecto[[#p45n1|&lt;sup&gt;[45-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para que nos diese las boletas de
      alojamiento,[[#p45n2|&lt;sup&gt;[45-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que en Francia se llaman &lt;i&gt;mandat&lt;/i&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No sé si el café estará todavía como entonces estaba. ¡Han
     pasado cuarenta y cuatro años! Recuerdo que a la izquierda[[#p45n3|&lt;sup&gt;[45-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; de la puerta había una ventana de reja,[[#p45n4|&lt;sup&gt;[45-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con cristales, y delante
     una mesa a la cual nos sentamos algunos de los oficiales, entre
     ellos C...., que ha sido diputado a Cortes[[#p45n5|&lt;sup&gt;[45-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por Almería[[#p45n6|&lt;sup&gt;[45-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y

     murió el año pasado[[#i146|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii146&quot;&gt;(146)&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&amp;mdash;Ya veis que esto es cosa que puede
     preguntarse.[[#p45n7|&lt;sup&gt;[45-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues ¿no dice V. que ha muerto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hombre! Supongo que C.... se lo habrá contado[[#p45n8|&lt;sup&gt;[45-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a

     su familia&amp;mdash;respondió el Capitán, escarbando la pipa con la
     uña.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Tiene V. razón, Capitán!&amp;mdash;Siga V....; el que no lo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; crea, que[[#p45n9|&lt;sup&gt;[45-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo busque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bien hablado, hijo mío!&amp;mdash;Pues, como íbamos diciendo,
     sentados estábamos a la mesa del café, cuando vimos correr
     mucha gente por la calle, y oímos una gritería espantosa....
     Pero como la gritería era en francés, no la entendimos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Le Pape!&lt;/i&gt;[[#p45n10|&lt;sup&gt;[45-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;Le Pape! Le Pape!&lt;/i&gt;...&amp;mdash;decían los muchachos

     y las mujeres, levantando las manos al cielo, en tanto
     que todos los balcones se abrían y llenaban de gente, y los
     mozos del café y algunos gabachos que jugaban al billar se lanzaban
     a la calle con un palmo de boca abierta,[[#p45n11|&lt;sup&gt;[45-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] como si oyeran
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; decir que el sol se había parado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pues parado está, papá abuelo![[#p45n12|&lt;sup&gt;[45-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cállese V. cuando hablan los mayores! ¡A ver[[#p45n13|&lt;sup&gt;[45-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]]... el
     deslenguado!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No haga V. caso, Capitán.... ¡Estos niños de

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; ahora!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Toma[[#p45n14|&lt;sup&gt;[45-14]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... ¡Y si está parado[[#p45n15|&lt;sup&gt;[45-15]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!...&amp;mdash;murmuró el
     muchacho entre dientes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Le Pape! Le Pape!&lt;/i&gt; ¿Qué significa esto?&amp;mdash;nos preguntamos
     todos los oficiales.
                 &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p46&quot; id=&quot;p46&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p46)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Y cogiendo a uno de los mozos del café, le dimos a entender[[#i147|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii147&quot;&gt;(147)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     nuestra curiosidad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El mozo tomó dos llaves; trazó con las manos una especie
     de morrión sobre su cabeza; se sentó en una silla, y dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Le Pontife!&lt;/i&gt;[[#p46n1|&lt;sup&gt;[46-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ah!... (dijo C....&amp;mdash;que era el más avisado de

     nosotros.&amp;mdash;¡Por eso fué luego diputado a Cortes!)&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡El
     Pontífice! ¡El Papa!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Oui, monsieur. Le Pape! Pie sept.&lt;/i&gt;[[#p46n2|&lt;sup&gt;[46-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pío VII[[#p46n3|&lt;sup&gt;[46-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!... ¡El Papa!... (exclamamos nosotros,

     sin atrevernos a creer lo que oíamos.) ¿Qué hace el
     Papa en Francia? Pues ¿no está el Papa en Roma? ¿Viajan
     los Papas? ¿El Papa en Montelimart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; No extrañéis nuestro asombro, hijos míos.... En aquel
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; entonces[[#p46n4|&lt;sup&gt;[46-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] todas las cosas tenían más prestigio que hoy.&amp;mdash;No

     se viajaba tan fácilmente, ni se publicaban tantos periódicos.&amp;mdash;Yo
     creo que en toda España no había más que uno, tamaño
     como un recibo de contribución.[[#p46n5|&lt;sup&gt;[46-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;El Papa era para nosotros
     un sér[[#p46n6|&lt;sup&gt;[46-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sobrenatural..., no un hombre de carne y hueso....&amp;mdash;¡En

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; toda la tierra no había más que un Papa!... Y en
     aquel tiempo era la tierra mucho más grande que hoy.... ¡La
     tierra era el mundo..., y un mundo lleno de misterios, de
     regiones desconocidas, de continentes ignorados!&amp;mdash;Además,
     aun sonaban en nuestros oídos aquellas palabras de nuestra

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; madre y de nuestros maestros: «El Papa es el Vicario de
     Jesucristo; su representante en la tierra; una autoridad
     infalible, y lo que desatare o atare aquí, remanecerá atado o
     desatado en el cielo....»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Creo haberme explicado.&amp;mdash;Creo que habréis comprendido

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; todo el respeto, toda la veneración, todo el susto que experimentaríamos
     aquellos pobres españoles del siglo pasado, al oír
     decir que el Sumo Pontífice estaba en un villorrio de Francia y
     que íbamos a verle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Efectivamente: no bien salimos del café, percibimos allá,&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p47&quot; id=&quot;p47&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p47)&lt;/span --&gt;

     en la Plaza (que como os he dicho estaba cerca), una empolvada
     silla de posta, parada delante de una casa de vulgar
     apariencia y custodiada por dos gendarmes de caballería,
     cuyos desnudos sables brillaban que era un contento[[#p47n1|&lt;sup&gt;[47-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Más de quinientas personas había alrededor del carruaje,

     que examinaban con viva curiosidad, sin que se opusiesen a
     ello los gendarmes, quienes, en cambio,[[#p47n2|&lt;sup&gt;[47-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no permitían al público
     acercarse a la puerta de aquella casa, donde se había
     apeado Pío VII mientras mudaban el tiro de caballos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Y ¿qué casa era aquélla, abuelito? ¿La del Alcalde?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, hijo mío.&amp;mdash;Era el Parador de diligencias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A nosotros, como a militares que éramos, nos tuvieron un
     poco más de consideración los gendarmes, y nos permitieron
     arrimarnos a la puerta.... Pero no así pasar el umbral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; De cualquier modo, pudimos ver perfectamente el siguiente

     grupo, que ocupaba uno de los ángulos de aquel portal u
     oficina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dos ancianos..., ¿qué digo? dos viejos decrépitos, cubiertos
     de sudor y de polvo, rendidos de fatiga, ahogados de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; calor, respirando apenas, bebían agua en un vaso de vidrio,

     que el uno pasó al otro después de mediarlo. Estaban sentados
     en sillas viejas de enea. Sus trajes talares, blanco el uno,
     y el otro de color de púrpura, hallábanse tan sucios y ajados
     por resultas de aquella larga caminata, que más parecían humildes
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ropones de peregrinos, que ostentosos hábitos de príncipes
     de la Iglesia....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ningún distintivo podía revelarnos cuál era Pío VII (pues
     nada entendíamos nosotros de trajes cardenalicios ni pontificales),
     pero todos dijimos a un tiempo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es el más alto! ¡El de las blancas vestiduras!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y ¿sabéis por qué lo dijimos? Porque su compañero lloraba

     y él no; porque su tranquilidad revelaba que él era mártir;
     porque su humildad denotaba que él era el Rey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En cuanto a su figura, me parece estarla viendo todavía.&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p48&quot; id=&quot;p48&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p48)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Imaginaos un hombre de más de setenta años, enjuto de carnes,
     de elevada talla y algo encorvado por la edad. Su rostro, surcado

     de pocas pero muy hondas arrugas, revelaba la más
     austera energía, dulcificada por unos labios bondadosos que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; parecían manar persuasión y consuelo. Su grave nariz, sus
     ojos de paz, marchitos por los años, y algunos cabellos tan
     blancos como la nieve, infundían juntamente reverencia y confianza.
     Sólo contemplando la cara de mi buen padre y la de

     algunos santos de mi devoción, había yo experimentado hasta
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; entonces una emoción por aquel estilo.[[#i148|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii148&quot;&gt;(148)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El sacerdote que acompañaba a Su Santidad era también muy
     viejo, y en su semblante, contraído por el dolor y la indignación,
     se descubría al hombre de pensamientos profundos y de acción

     rápida y decidida. Más parecía un general que un apóstol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Pero ¿era cierto lo que veíamos? ¿El Pontífice preso, caminando
     en el rigor del estío, con todo el ardor del sol, entre
     dos groseros gendarmes, sin más comitiva que un sacerdote,
     sin otro hospedaje que el portal de una casa de postas, sin otra

     almohada que una silla de madera?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; En tan extraordinario caso, en tan descomunal atropello, en
     tan terrible drama, sólo podía mediar un hombre más extraordinario,
     más descomunal, más terrible que cuanto veíamos[[#p48n1|&lt;sup&gt;[48-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&amp;mdash;El

     nombre de NAPOLEÓN circuló por nuestros labios.
     ¡Napoleón nos tenía también a nosotros en el interior de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Francia! ¡Napoleón había revuelto el Oriente,[[#p48n2|&lt;sup&gt;[48-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] encendido en
     guerra nuestra patria, derribado todos los tronos de Europa!&amp;mdash;¡Él

     debía de ser quien arrancaba al Papa de la Silla de San
     Pedro[[#p48n3|&lt;sup&gt;[48-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y lo paseaba así por el Imperio francés, como el pueblo
     judío paseó al Redentor por las calles de la ciudad deicida!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Pero ¿cuál era la suerte del beatísimo prisionero? ¿Qué

     había ocurrido en Roma? ¿Había una nueva religión en el
     Mediodía de Europa? ¿Era papa Napoleón?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nada sabíamos..., y, si he de deciros[[#p48n4|&lt;sup&gt;[48-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la verdad, por lo
     que a mí hace,[[#p48n5|&lt;sup&gt;[48-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] todavía no he tenido tiempo de averiguarlo....

                  &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p49&quot; id=&quot;p49&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p49)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Yo se lo diré a V., por vía de paréntesis, en muy pocas
     palabras, Capitán.&amp;mdash;Esto completará la historia de V., y dará
     toda su importancia a ese peregrino relato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p46n3&quot; id=&quot;p46n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;46-3: &lt;b&gt;Pío VII&lt;/b&gt;: (&lt;i&gt;sétimo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;séptimo&lt;/i&gt;) cf. note &lt;i&gt;Carlos XII&lt;/i&gt;, p.
16, 2. Pius VII was pope 1800-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p46n4&quot; id=&quot;p46n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;46-4: &lt;b&gt;En aquel entonces&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;at that time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p46n5&quot; id=&quot;p46n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;46-5: &lt;b&gt;recibo de contribución&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;tax receipt&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p46n6&quot; id=&quot;p46n6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;46-6: &lt;b&gt;sér&lt;/b&gt;: used as a noun, is by some accented to distinguish it
from the verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p47n1&quot; id=&quot;p47n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;47-1: &lt;b&gt;brillaban que era un contento&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;shone (so) that it was a
delight&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p47n2&quot; id=&quot;p47n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;47-2: &lt;b&gt;en cambio&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;on the other hand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p48n1&quot; id=&quot;p48n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;48-1: &lt;b&gt;que cuanto veíamos&lt;/b&gt;: (= &lt;i&gt;que tanto cuanto veíamos&lt;/i&gt;): &lt;i&gt;than
everything we saw&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p48n2&quot; id=&quot;p48n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;48-2: &lt;b&gt;el Oriente&lt;/b&gt;: the reference is to Bonaparte's Egyptian campaign
in 1798. Cf. note &lt;i&gt;batalla de las Pirámides&lt;/i&gt;, p. 35, 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p48n3&quot; id=&quot;p48n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;48-3: &lt;b&gt;Silla de San Pedro&lt;/b&gt;: papal throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p48n4&quot; id=&quot;p48n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;48-4: &lt;b&gt;he de deciros&lt;/b&gt;: cf. note &lt;i&gt;había de conocer&lt;/i&gt;, p. 3, 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p48n5&quot; id=&quot;p48n5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;48-5: &lt;b&gt;por lo que a mí hace&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;as far as I am concerned; as for me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

===Text===

====III====
&lt;p&gt; El día 17 de Mayo de ese mismo año de 1809 dió Napoleón
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; un decreto, por el que[[#p49n1|&lt;sup&gt;[49-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] reunió al Imperio francés los Estados
     pontificios, declarando a Roma[[#p49n2|&lt;sup&gt;[49-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;ciudad imperial libre&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El pueblo romano no se atrevió a protestar contra esta medida;
     pero el Papa la resistió pasivamente desde su palacio
     del Quirinal,[[#p49n3|&lt;sup&gt;[49-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] donde aun contaba con[[#i149|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii149&quot;&gt;(149)&lt;/sup&gt;]] algunas autoridades y su
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; guardia de suizos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sucedió entonces que unos pescadores del Tiber cogieron
     un esturión y quisieron regalárselo al Sucesor de San Pedro.
     Los franceses aprovecharon esta ocasión para dar el último
     paso contra la autoridad de Pío VII; gritaron: &lt;i&gt;¡al arma!&lt;/i&gt;;
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; el cañón de Sant-Angelo[[#p49n4|&lt;sup&gt;[49-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pregonó la extinción del gobierno

     temporal de los Papas, y la bandera tricolor[[#p49n5|&lt;sup&gt;[49-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ondeó sobre el
     Vaticano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El Secretario de Estado, cardenal Pacca (que sin duda era
     el sacerdote que V. encontró con Pío VII), corrió al lado de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Su Santidad; y, al verse los dos ancianos, exclamaron: &lt;i&gt;Consummatum

     est!&lt;/i&gt;[[#p49n6|&lt;sup&gt;[49-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En efecto: mientras el Papa lanzaba su última excomunión
     contra los invasores, éstos penetraban en el Quirinal, derribando
     las puertas a hachazos.[[#p49n7|&lt;sup&gt;[49-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; En la Sala de las Santificaciones[[#p49n8|&lt;sup&gt;[49-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] encontraron a cuarenta

     suizos, resto del poder del ex Rey de Roma,[[#p49n9|&lt;sup&gt;[49-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] quienes los dejaron
     pasar adelante por haber recibido orden de no oponer
     resistencia alguna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El general Radet, jefe de los demoledores, encontró al Papa
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; en la Sala de las Audiencias ordinarias, rodeado de los cardenales

     Pacca y Despuig y de algunos empleados de Secretaría.
                  &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p50&quot; id=&quot;p50&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p50)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Pío VII vestía roquete y muceta;[[#p50n1|&lt;sup&gt;[50-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] había dejado su lecho
     para recibir al enemigo, y daba muestras de una tranquilidad
     asombrosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Era media noche.  Radet, profundamente conmovido, no
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; se atreve a hablar. Al fin intima al Sumo Pontífice que renuncie
     al gobierno temporal de los Estados romanos.[[#p50n2|&lt;sup&gt;[50-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] El Papa
     contesta que no le es posible hacerlo, porque no son suyos,

     sino de la Iglesia, cuyo administrador lo hizo la voluntad del
     Cielo.... Y el general Radet le replica mostrándole la orden
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; de llevarlo prisionero a Francia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al amanecer del siguiente día salía Pío VII de su palacio
     entre esbirros y gendarmes, saltando sobre los escombros de

     las puertas, sin más comitiva que el cardenal Pacca, ni más
     restos de su grandeza mundanal que un &lt;i&gt;papetto&lt;/i&gt;, moneda
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; equivalente a cuatro reales de vellón,[[#p50n3|&lt;sup&gt;[50-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que llevaba en el
     bolsillo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En las afueras de la puerta del Popolo[[#p50n4|&lt;sup&gt;[50-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo esperaba una silla
     de posta, a la cual le hicieron subir, y después de esto cerraron
     las portezuelas con una llave, que Radet entregó a un gendarme
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de caballería.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Las persianas del lado derecho, en que se sentó el Papa,
     estaban clavadas, a fin de que no pudiese ser visto....&lt;/p&gt;

====IV====
&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡En esa silla lo encontré yo!...&amp;mdash;¿Ven ustedes cómo

     no miento?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Hace V. bien en interrumpirme, Capitán; porque yo he
     terminado, y el resto queremos oírlo de labios de V....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues voy allá,[[#p50n5|&lt;sup&gt;[50-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] señores míos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Íbamos diciendo[[#i150|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii150&quot;&gt;(150)&lt;/sup&gt;]] que Pío VII y el cardenal Pacca (¡mucho
     me alegro de haber llegado a saber su nombre!) estaban sentados
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; en el portal de la casa de postas; que el pueblo se había
     agrupado en la calle; que los gendarmes le impedían el paso,&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p51&quot; id=&quot;p51&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p51)&lt;/span --&gt;
     y que nosotros los españoles conseguimos acercarnos tanto a la

     puerta, que veíamos perfectamente a los dos augustos
     sacerdotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pío VII fijó casualmente la vista en nosotros, y sin duda
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; conoció, por nuestros raros y destrozados uniformes, que también
     éramos extranjeros y cautivos de Napoleón.... Ello

     fué[[#p51n1|&lt;sup&gt;[51-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que, después de decir algunas palabras al Cardenal, clavó
     en nosotros una larga y expresiva mirada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; En esto sonó allí cerca un fandango, divinamente tocado y
     cantado por los tres compañeros nuestros, que volvían ya con

     las boletas para alojarnos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Creo haberos dicho que habíamos comprado dos guitarras
     antes de abandonar a Cataluña;[[#p51n2|&lt;sup&gt;[51-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y si se me ha olvidado[[#p51n3|&lt;sup&gt;[51-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] decíroslo,
     os lo digo ahora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Al oír aquel toque y la copla que le siguió, el Papa levantó
     otra vez la cabeza, y nos miró con mayor interés y ternura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El italiano, el músico, había reconocido el canto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ya sabía que éramos españoles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ser español, significaba en aquel tiempo mucho más que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ahora. Significaba ser vencedor del Capitán del siglo; ser soldado
     de Bailén y Zaragoza;[[#p51n4|&lt;sup&gt;[51-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ser defensor de la historia, de la
     tradición, de la fe antigua; mantenedor de la independencia
     de las naciones; paladín[[#p51n5|&lt;sup&gt;[51-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de Cristo; cruzado[[#p51n6|&lt;sup&gt;[51-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de la libertad.

     &amp;mdash;En esto último nos engañábamos.... Pero ¡cómo ha
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de ser!&amp;mdash;¿Quién había de adivinar entonces, al defender a
     D. Fernando VII[[#p51n7|&lt;sup&gt;[51-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] contra los franceses, que él mismo los llamaría
     al cabo de catorce años y los traería a España en contra nuestra,[[#p51n8|&lt;sup&gt;[51-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     como sucedió en 1823?...&amp;mdash;En fin; no quiero hablar...,
     ¡pues hay cosas que todavía me encienden la sangre!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; El caso fué, volviendo a mi relato, que el rostro del Papa
     se cubrió de santo rubor al considerar nuestra desventura y
     recordar el heroísmo de que España estaba dando muestras al

     mundo..., y que el más puro entusiasmo chispeó en sus
     amantísimos ojos....&amp;mdash;¡Parecía que aquellos ojos nos besaban!
             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p52&quot; id=&quot;p52&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p52)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Nosotros, por nuestra parte, comprendiendo toda la predilección
     que nos demostraba en aquel momento el Sumo Pontífice,

     procurábamos expresarle con la mirada, con el gesto, con
     la actitud, nuestra veneración y piedad, así como el dolor y la
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; indignación que sentíamos al verlo preso y ultrajado por sus
     malos hijos....&amp;mdash;Casi instintivamente nos quitamos los morriones
     (cosa que chocó mucho a los franceses, los cuales seguían

     con sus gorros[[#p52n1|&lt;sup&gt;[52-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] encasquetados), y nos llevamos la mano derecha
     al corazón como quien hace[[#p52n2|&lt;sup&gt;[52-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] protestación de su fe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; El Papa levantó los ojos al cielo y se puso a rezar.&amp;mdash;¡Sabía

     que una bendición de su mano podía atraer sobre nosotros la
     cólera del pueblo impío que nos rodeaba, como nosotros sabíamos
     que un grito de &lt;i&gt;¡viva el Papa!&lt;/i&gt; podía empeorar la situación
     del beatísimo prisionero!&amp;mdash;¡Mostrábanse tan orgullosos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; los franceses que nos rodeaban al ver aquel supremo triunfo de

     la Revolución sobre la autoridad!... ¡Creían tan grande a
     la Francia en aquel momento!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En esto se abrió paso por entre la muchedumbre, y apareció
     en el cuadro que habían despejado los gendarmes, una mujer
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; del pueblo, mucho más anciana que el Pontífice: una viejecita

     centenaria, pulcra y pobremente[[#p52n3|&lt;sup&gt;[52-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] vestida,[[#i151|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii151&quot;&gt;(151)&lt;/sup&gt;]] coronada de cabellos
     como la nieve, trémula por la edad y el entusiasmo, encorvada,
     llorosa, suplicante, llevando en las manos un azafate de mimbres
     secos lleno de melocotones, cuyos matices rojos y dorados se
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; veían debajo de las verdes hojas con que estaban cubiertos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los gendarmes quisieron detenerla.... Pero ella los miró
     con tanta mansedumbre; era tan inofensiva su actitud; era su
     presente tan tierno y cariñoso; inspiraba su edad tanto respeto;
     había tal verdad en aquel acto de devoción; significaba tanto,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; en fin, aquel siglo pasado, fiel a sus creencias, que venía a saludar

     al Vicario de Jesucristo en medio de su calle de Amargura,[[#p52n4|&lt;sup&gt;[52-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     que los soldados de la Revolución y del Imperio comprendieron
     o sintieron que aquel anacronismo, aquella caridad de otra
     época, aquel corazón inerme y pacífico que había sobrevivido&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p53&quot; id=&quot;p53&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p53)&lt;/span --&gt;
     casualmente a la guillotina, en nada aminoraba ni deslucía los

     triunfos del conquistador de Europa, y dejaron a la pobre mujer
     del pueblo entrar en aquel afortunado portal, que ya nos había
     traído a la memoria otro portal, no menos afortunado, donde
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; unos sencillos pastores hicieron también ofrendas al Hijo de
     Dios vivo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Comenzó entonces una interesante escena entre la cristiana
     y el Pontífice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Púsose ella de rodillas, y, sin articular palabra, presentó el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; azafate de frutos al augusto prisionero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pío VII enjugó con sus manos beatísimas las lágrimas que

     inundaban el rostro de la viejecita; y cuando ésta se inclinaba
     para besar el pie del Santo Padre,[[#p53n1|&lt;sup&gt;[53-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] él colocó una mano sobre
     aquellas canas humilladas, y levantó la otra al cielo con la
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; inspirada actitud de un profeta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡VIVA EL PAPA!&amp;mdash;exclamamos entonces nosotros en
     nuestro idioma español, sin poder contenernos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y penetramos en el portal resueltos a todo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Pío VII se pone de pie al oír aquel grito, y, tendiendo hacia
     nosotros las manos, nos detiene, cual si[[#i152|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii152&quot;&gt;(152)&lt;/sup&gt;]] su majestuosa actitud

     nos hubiese aniquilado.... Caemos, pues, de rodillas, y el
     Padre Santo nos bendice una, otra y tercera vez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al propio tiempo álzase en la puerta y en toda la Plaza como
     un huracán de gritos, y nosotros volvemos la cabeza horrorizados,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; creyendo que los franceses amenazan al Sumo Pontífice....&amp;mdash;¡Lo

     de menos[[#p53n2|&lt;sup&gt;[53-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] era que nos amenazasen a nosotros!&amp;mdash;¡Decididos
     estábamos a morir!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero ¡cuál fué nuestro asombro al ver que los gendarmes,
     los hombres del pueblo, las mujeres, los niños..., ¡todo

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Montelimart! estaba arrodillado, con la frente descubierta,
     con las lágrimas en los ojos, exclamando:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Vive le Pape!&lt;/i&gt;[[#p53n3|&lt;sup&gt;[53-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entonces se rompió la consigna: el pueblo invadió el portal
     y pidió su bendición al Pontífice.

             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p54&quot; id=&quot;p54&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p54)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Éste cogió una hoja verde de las que cubrían el azafate de
     melocotones que seguía ofreciéndole la anciana, y la llevó a sus
     labios y la besó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La multitud, por su parte, se apoderó de los frutos como de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; reliquias; todos abrazaron a la pobre mujer del pueblo; el

     Papa, trémulo de emoción, atravesó por entre la muchedumbre,
     nos bendijo otra vez al paso, y penetró en la silla de
     posta; y los gendarmes, avergonzados de lo que acababa de
     pasar, dieron la orden[[#p54n1|&lt;sup&gt;[54-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de partir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; En cuanto a nosotros, durante todo aquel día no fuimos en

     Francia prisioneros de guerra, sino huéspedes de paz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Conque... he dicho.&lt;/p&gt;

====V====
&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Aun queda algo que[[#i153|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii153&quot;&gt;(153)&lt;/sup&gt;]] decir!...&amp;mdash;(exclamó el mismo

     que contó poco antes lo acontecido en Roma.) ¡Óiganme
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Vds. a mí un momento!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En 1814, cinco años después de la escena referida por el
     Capitán, la fuerza de la opinión de toda Francia obligó a Napoleón
     Bonaparte a poner en libertad a Pío VII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Volvió, pues, el Sumo Pontífice a recorrer el mismo camino
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; en que le habían encontrado los prisioneros españoles, y he
     aquí cómo describe Chateaubriand[[#p54n2|&lt;sup&gt;[54-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la despedida que hizo
     Francia al sucesor de San Pedro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Pío VII caminaba en medio de los cánticos y de las lágrimas,
     del repique de las campanas y de los gritos de &lt;i&gt;¡Viva el Papa!
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Viva el Jefe de la Iglesia!&lt;/i&gt;... En las ciudades sólo quedaban
     los que no podían marchar, y los peregrinos pasaban la
     noche en los campos, en espera de la llegada del anciano sacerdote.

     TAL ES, SOBRE LA FUERZA DEL HACHA[[#p54n3|&lt;sup&gt;[54-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Y DEL CETRO,
     LA SUPERIORIDAD DEL PODER DEL DÉBIL SOSTENIDO POR LA
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; RELIGIÓN Y LA DESGRACIA.»&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Guadix, 1857.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p50n4&quot; id=&quot;p50n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;50-4: &lt;b&gt;puerta del Popolo&lt;/b&gt;: (Italian: &lt;i&gt;Porta del Popolo&lt;/i&gt;) one of the

loses this termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p52n4&quot; id=&quot;p52n4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;52-4: &lt;b&gt;calle de Amargura&lt;/b&gt;: the &lt;i&gt;Via Dolorosa&lt;/i&gt;, or road passed over by

Santo&lt;/i&gt; is one of the Fathers of the church, as Saint Augustine, etc.,&amp;mdash;a
distinction not always observed,&amp;mdash;cf. line 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p53n2&quot; id=&quot;p53n2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;53-2: &lt;b&gt;Lo de menos&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;a far less important matter&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p53n3&quot; id=&quot;p53n3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;53-3: &lt;b&gt;Vive le Pape&lt;/b&gt;: (French) &lt;i&gt;long live the Pope&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span name=&quot;p54n1&quot; id=&quot;p54n1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;54-1: &lt;b&gt;la orden&lt;/b&gt;: cf. note &lt;i&gt;orden&lt;/i&gt;, p. 39, 1.&lt;/p&gt;

be a kind of official paladin of Catholicism.&lt;/p&gt;

====I====
&lt;p&gt; «&lt;i&gt;No consiste la fuerza en echar por tierra&lt;/i&gt;[[#p55n1|&lt;sup&gt;[55-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;al enemigo, sino en

     domar la propia cólera,&lt;/i&gt;»&amp;mdash;dice una máxima oriental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «&lt;i&gt;No abuses de la victoria,&lt;/i&gt;»&amp;mdash;añade un libro de nuestra
     religión.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; «&lt;i&gt;Al culpado que cayere debajo de tu jurisdicción, considérale

     hombre miserable, sujeto a las condiciones de la depravada naturaleza
     nuestra; y en todo cuanto estuviere de tu parte, sin hacer
     agravio a la contraria, muéstratele piadoso y clemente, porque,
     aunque los atributos de Dios son todos iguales, más resplandece
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; y campea, a nuestro ver,&lt;/i&gt;[[#i154|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii154&quot;&gt;(154)&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;el de la misericordia, que el de la justicia,&lt;/i&gt;»

     aconsejó, en fin, D. Quijote a Sancho Panza.[[#p55n2|&lt;sup&gt;[55-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Para dar realce a todas estas elevadísimas doctrinas, y cediendo
     también a un espíritu de equidad, nosotros, que nos
     complacemos frecuentemente en referir y celebrar los actos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; heroicos de los españoles durante la &lt;i&gt;Guerra de la Independencia&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p55n3|&lt;sup&gt;[55-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     y en condenar y maldecir la perfidia y crueldad de los
     invasores, vamos a narrar hoy un hecho que, sin entibiar en el
     corazón el amor a la patria, fortifica otro sentimiento no menos
     sublime y profundamente cristiano:&amp;mdash;el amor a nuestro prójimo;&amp;mdash;sentimiento
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que, si por congénita desventura de la humana

     especie, ha de transigir[[#p55n4|&lt;sup&gt;[55-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con la dura ley de la guerra,
     puede y debe resplandecer cuando el enemigo está humillado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El hecho fué el siguiente, según que[[#p55n5|&lt;sup&gt;[55-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] me lo han contado
     personas dignas de entera fe, que intervinieron en él muy de

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; cerca[[#p55n6|&lt;sup&gt;[55-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y que todavía andan por el mundo.&amp;mdash;Oíd sus palabras
     textuales.
              &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p56&quot; id=&quot;p56&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p56)&lt;/span --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Buenos días,[[#i155|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii155&quot;&gt;(155)&lt;/sup&gt;]] abuelo[[#p56n1|&lt;sup&gt;[56-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]...&amp;mdash;dije yo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dios guarde a V., señorito...&amp;mdash;dijo él.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Muy solo va V. por estos caminos!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí, señor. Vengo de las minas de Linares,[[#p56n2|&lt;sup&gt;[56-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] donde he estado
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; trabajando algunos meses, y voy a Gádor[[#p56n3|&lt;sup&gt;[56-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a ver a mi familia.

     &amp;mdash;¿Usted irá[[#p56n4|&lt;sup&gt;[56-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Voy a Almería[[#p56n5|&lt;sup&gt;[56-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]..., y me he adelantado un poco a la
     galera[[#p56n6|&lt;sup&gt;[56-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] porque me gusta disfrutar de estas hermosas mañanas

     de Abril.&amp;mdash;Pero, si no me engaño, usted rezaba cuando yo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; llegue....&amp;mdash;Puede V. continuar.&amp;mdash;Yo seguiré leyendo entretanto,
     supuesto que el escaso andar de esa infame galera le
     permite a uno estudiar en mitad de los caminos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vamos! Ese libro es alguna historia....&amp;mdash;Y ¿quién
     le ha dicho a V. que yo rezaba?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma! ¡yo, que le he visto a V. quitarse el sombrero[[#p56n7|&lt;sup&gt;[56-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y
     santiguarse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues ¡qué[[#i156|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii156&quot;&gt;(156)&lt;/sup&gt;]] demonio! hombre.... (¿Por qué he de negarlo?)[[#p56n8|&lt;sup&gt;[56-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     Rezando iba....&amp;mdash;¡Cada uno tiene sus cuentas con
     Dios!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Es mucha verdad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Piensa V. andar largo?[[#p56n9|&lt;sup&gt;[56-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Yo?&amp;mdash;Hasta la venta....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;En este caso, eche V. por esa vereda[[#p56n10|&lt;sup&gt;[56-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y cortaremos

     camino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Con mucho gusto. Esa cañada me parece deliciosa.&amp;mdash;Bajemos
     a ella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, siguiendo al viejo, cerré el libro, dejé el camino y descendí
     a un pintoresco barranco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Las verdes tintas y diafanidad del lejano horizonte, así como
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; la inclinación de las montañas, indicaban ya la proximidad del
     Mediterráneo.
           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p57&quot; id=&quot;p57&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p57)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Anduvimos en silencio algunos minutos, hasta que el minero

     se paró de pronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cabales!&amp;mdash;exclamó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y volvió a quitarse el sombrero y a santiguarse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Estábamos bajo unas higueras cubiertas ya de hojas, y a la

     orilla de un hermoso torrente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡A ver,[[#p57n1|&lt;sup&gt;[57-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] abuelito!... (dije, sentándome sobre la hierba.)
     Cuénteme V. lo que ha pasado aquí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cómo! ¿Usted sabe....&amp;mdash;replicó él, estremeciéndose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo no sé más... (añadí con suma calma), sino que aquí
     ha muerto un hombre...; ¡y de mala muerte, por más
     señas![[#p57n2|&lt;sup&gt;[57-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No se equivoca V., señorito, no se equivoca usted!&amp;mdash;Pero

     ¿quién le ha dicho...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Me lo dicen sus oraciones de V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es mucha verdad! Por eso rezaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Miré tenazmente la fisonomía del minero, y comprendí que
     había sido siempre hombre honrado.&amp;mdash;Casi lloraba, y su rezo

     era tranquilo y dulce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Siéntese V.[[#p57n3|&lt;sup&gt;[57-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] aquí, amigo mío....&amp;mdash;le dije, alargándole
     un cigarro de papel.[[#p57n4|&lt;sup&gt;[57-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues verá V., señorito....&amp;mdash;Vaya,[[#p57n5|&lt;sup&gt;[57-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡muchas gracias!&amp;mdash; ¡Delgadillo[[#p57n6|&lt;sup&gt;[57-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     es!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Reúna V. dos, y resultará uno bastante grueso&amp;mdash;añadí,

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; dándole otro cigarro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Dios se lo pague a V.!&amp;mdash;Pues, señor... (dijo el viejo,
     sentándose a mi lado): hace cuarenta y cinco años que una
     mañana muy parecida a ésta, pasaba yo casi a esta hora por
     este mismo sitio....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cuarenta y cinco años!&amp;mdash;medité yo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y la melancolía del tiempo cayó sobre mi alma.&amp;mdash;¿Dónde
     estaban las flores de aquellas cuarenta y cinco primaveras?&amp;mdash;¡Sobre
     la frente del anciano blanqueaba la nieve de setenta

     inviernos!
                 &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p58&quot; id=&quot;p58&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p58)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Viendo él que yo no decía nada, echó unas yescas,[[#p58n1|&lt;sup&gt;[58-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] encendió
     el cigarro y continuó de este modo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Flojillo es![[#p58n2|&lt;sup&gt;[58-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;Pues, señor, el día que le digo a usted,

     venía yo de Gérgal[[#p58n3|&lt;sup&gt;[58-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con una carga de barrilla, y al llegar al
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; punto en que hemos dejado el camino para tomar esta vereda,
     me encontré con dos soldados españoles que llevaban prisionero
     a un polaco.[[#p58n4|&lt;sup&gt;[58-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;En aquel entonces era cuando estaban aquí los

     primeros franceses, no los del año 23,[[#p58n5|&lt;sup&gt;[58-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sino los otros....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ya comprendo! Usted habla de la guerra de la
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Independencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hombre! ¡Pues entonces no había V. nacido!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Yo lo creo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ah, sí! Estará apuntado[[#p58n6|&lt;sup&gt;[58-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en ese libro que venía V. leyendo.&amp;mdash;Pero
     ¡ca! ¡Lo mejor de estas guerras no lo rezan[[#p58n7|&lt;sup&gt;[58-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; los libros! ¡Ahí ponen lo que más acomoda..., y la gente

     se lo cree a puño cerrado![[#p58n8|&lt;sup&gt;[58-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Ya[[#i157|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii157&quot;&gt;(157)&lt;/sup&gt;]] se ve! ¡Es necesario tener
     tres duros y medio[[#p58n9|&lt;sup&gt;[58-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de vida, como yo los tendré en el mes de
     San Juan,[[#p58n10|&lt;sup&gt;[58-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para saber más de cuatro cosas!&amp;mdash;En fin, el polaco

     aquel[[#p58n11|&lt;sup&gt;[58-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] servía a las órdenes de Napoleón...&amp;mdash;del bribonazo[[#p58n12|&lt;sup&gt;[58-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que murió ya....&amp;mdash;Porque ahora dice el señor Cura que hay
     otro[[#p58n13|&lt;sup&gt;[58-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]]...&amp;mdash;Pero yo creo que ése no vendrá por estas tierras....&amp;mdash;¿Qué

     le parece a[[#i158|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii158&quot;&gt;(158)&lt;/sup&gt;]] V., señorito?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué quiere V. que yo le diga?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es verdad! Su merced no habrá estudiado todavía de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; estas cosas....&amp;mdash;¡Oh! El señor Cura, que es un sujeto muy
     instruido, sabe cuándo se acabarán los mamelucos de Oriente[[#p58n14|&lt;sup&gt;[58-14]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     y vendrán a Gádor[[#p58n15|&lt;sup&gt;[58-15]&lt;/sup&gt;]] los rusos y moscovitas[[#p58n16|&lt;sup&gt;[58-16]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a quitar la
     Constitución[[#p58n17|&lt;sup&gt;[58-17]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&amp;mdash;Pero ¡entonces ya me habré yo muerto!...&amp;mdash;Conque
     vuelvo a la historia de mi polaco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; El pobre hombre se había quedado enfermo en Fiñana,[[#p58n18|&lt;sup&gt;[58-18]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mientras
     que sus compañeros fugitivos se replegaban hacia Almería.&amp;mdash;Tenía
     calenturas, según supe[[#p58n19|&lt;sup&gt;[58-19]&lt;/sup&gt;]] más tarde....&amp;mdash;Una vieja

     lo cuidaba por caridad, sin reparar que era un enemigo....
     (¡Muchos años de gloria llevará[[#p58n20|&lt;sup&gt;[58-20]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya la viejecita por&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p59&quot; id=&quot;p59&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p59)&lt;/span --&gt;
     aquellam buena acción!); y, a pesar de[[#i159|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii159&quot;&gt;(159)&lt;/sup&gt;]] que aquello la comprometía,
     guardábalo escondido en su cueva, cerca de la Alcazaba[[#p59n1|&lt;sup&gt;[59-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Allí fué donde, la noche antes, dos soldados españoles, que
     iban a reunirse á su batallón, y que por casualidad entraron a
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; encender un cigarro en el candil[[#p59n2|&lt;sup&gt;[59-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de aquella solitaria vivienda,
     descubrieron al pobre polaco, el cual, echado en un rincón, profería

     palabras de su idioma en el delirio de la calentura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Presentémoslo a nuestro jefe! (se dijeron los españoles).
     Este bribón será fusilado mañana, y nosotros alcanzaremos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; un empleo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Iwa, que así se llamaba[[#i160|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii160&quot;&gt;(160)&lt;/sup&gt;]] el polaco, según luego me contó la

     viejecita, llevaba[[#p59n3|&lt;sup&gt;[59-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya seis meses de tercianas, y estaba muy débil,
     muy delgado, casi hético.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La buena mujer lloró y suplicó, protestando que el extranjero
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; no podía ponerse en camino sin caer muerto a[[#i161|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii161&quot;&gt;(161)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la media

     hora[[#p59n4|&lt;sup&gt;[59-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero sólo consiguió ser apaleada por su falta de «&lt;i&gt;patriotismo&lt;/i&gt;».
     &amp;mdash;¡Todavía no se me ha olvidado[[#p59n5|&lt;sup&gt;[59-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] esta palabra, que antes no

     había oído pronunciar nunca!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; En cuanto al[[#p59n6|&lt;sup&gt;[59-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] polaco, figúrese V. cómo miraría[[#p59n7|&lt;sup&gt;[59-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] aquel lance.
     &amp;mdash;Estaba postrado por la fiebre, y algunas palabras sueltas que

     salían de sus labios, medio polacas, medio españolas, hacían reír
     a los dos militares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Cállate, &lt;i&gt;didon&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p59n8|&lt;sup&gt;[59-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] perro, gabacho![[#p59n9|&lt;sup&gt;[59-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;le decían.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Y, a fuerza de golpes, lo sacaron del lecho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Para no cansar a V., señorito: en aquella disposición, medio
     desnudo, hambriento..., bamboleándose, muriéndose...,
     ¡anduvo el infeliz cinco leguas!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Cinco leguas, señor!...&amp;mdash;¿Sabe V. los pasos que tienen

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; cinco leguas?&amp;mdash;Pues es desde Fiñana hasta[[#i162|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii162&quot;&gt;(162)&lt;/sup&gt;]] aquí....&amp;mdash;¡Y a
     pie!... ¡descalzo!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Piénselo V.!... ¡Un hombre fino, un joven hermoso y
     blanco como una mujer, un enfermo, después de seis meses de
     tercianas!... ¡y con la terciana en aquel momento mismo!...

                     &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p60&quot; id=&quot;p60&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p60)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¿Cómo pudo resistir?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ah! ¡No resistió!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero ¿cómo anduvo cinco leguas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma! ¡A fuerza de bayonetazos!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Prosiga V., abuelo.... Prosiga V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo venía por este barranco, como tengo de costumbre,[[#p60n1|&lt;sup&gt;[60-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     para ahorrarme terreno, y ellos iban por allá arriba, por el camino.
     Detúveme, pues, aquí mismo, a fin de observar el remate
     de aquel horror, mientras fingía picar un cigarro[[#p60n2|&lt;sup&gt;[60-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] negro de los

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; de entonces....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Iwa jadeaba como un perro próximo a rabiar.... Venía con
     la cabeza descubierta, amarillo como un desenterrado, con dos
     rosetas encarnadas en lo alto de las mejillas y con los ojos
     llameantes, pero caídos...: ¡hecho,[[#p60n3|&lt;sup&gt;[60-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en fin, un Cristo en la

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; calle de la Amargura[[#p60n4|&lt;sup&gt;[60-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Mí querer morir!&lt;/i&gt;[[#p60n5|&lt;sup&gt;[60-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;¡Matar a mi, por Dios!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;balbuceaba
     el extranjero con las manos cruzadas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los españoles se reían de aquellos disparates, y le llamaban
     &lt;i&gt;franchute&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p60n6|&lt;sup&gt;[60-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;didon&lt;/i&gt; y otras cosas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Dobláronse al fin las piernas de Iwa, y cayó redondo[[#p60n7|&lt;sup&gt;[60-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] al

     suelo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo respiré, porque creí que el pobre había dado su alma a
     Dios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero un pinchazo que recibió en un hombro le hizo erguirse
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entonces se acercó a este barranco para precipitarse y
     morir....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al impedirlo los soldados, pues no les acomodaba que
     muriera su prisionero, me vieron aquí con mi mulo, que, como
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; he dicho, estaba cargado de barrilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eh, camarada! (me dijeron, apuntándome con los
     fusiles.)&amp;mdash;¡Suba V ese mulo![[#p60n8|&lt;sup&gt;[60-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo obedecí sin rechistar, creyendo hacer un favor al extranjero.
                       &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p61&quot; id=&quot;p61&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p61)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¿Dónde va V.?[[#p61n1|&lt;sup&gt;[61-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;me preguntaron cuando hube subido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Voy a Almería.... (les respondí). ¡Y eso que ustedes
     están haciendo es una inhumanidad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Fuera sermones!&amp;mdash;gritó uno de los verdugos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Un arriero &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;mdash;dijo el otro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Charla mucho..., y verás lo que te sucede!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La culata de un fusil cayó sobre mi pecho....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Era la primera vez que me pegaba un hombre, fuera de mi
     padre!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡No irritar, no incomodar!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;exclamó el polaco, asiéndose[[#i163|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii163&quot;&gt;(163)&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     a mis pies; pues había caído de nuevo en tierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Descarga la barrilla!&amp;mdash;me dijeron los soldados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Para qué?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Para montar en el mulo a este judío.[[#p61n2|&lt;sup&gt;[61-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Eso es otra cosa.... Lo haré con mucho gusto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dije, y me puse a descargar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;No..., no..., no....&lt;/i&gt; (exclamó Iwa.) &lt;i&gt;¡Tú dejar
     que me maten!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Yo no quiero que te maten, desgraciado!&amp;mdash;exclamé,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; estrechando las ardientes manos del joven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Pero mí sí querer! ¡Matar tú a mí, por Dios&lt;/i&gt;!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Quieres que yo te mate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Sí..., sí..., hombre bueno! ¡Sufrir mucho!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mis ojos se llenaron de lágrimas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Volvíme a los soldados, y les dije con tono de voz que hubiera
     conmovido a una piedra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Españoles, compatriotas, hermanos! Otro[[#p61n3|&lt;sup&gt;[61-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] español, que
     ama tanto como el que más[[#p61n4|&lt;sup&gt;[61-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a nuestra patria, es quien os suplica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;¡Dejadme solo con este hombre!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No digo que es &lt;i&gt;afrancesado&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;mdash;exclamó uno de ellos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Arriero del diablo! (dijo el otro): ¡cuidado con lo que
     me dices![[#p61n5|&lt;sup&gt;[61-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Mira que te rompo la crisma![[#p61n6|&lt;sup&gt;[61-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Militar de los demonios! (contesté con la misma fuerza.)
     Yo no temo a la muerte.[[#p61n7|&lt;sup&gt;[61-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;¡Sois dos infames sin corazón!&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p62&quot; id=&quot;p62&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p62)&lt;/span --&gt;

     ¡Sois dos hombres fuertes y armados, contra un moribundo
     inerme!... ¡Sois unos cobardes!&amp;mdash;Dadme uno de esos
     fusiles, y pelearé con vosotros hasta mataros o morir...; pero
     dejad a este pobre enfermo, que no puede defenderse.&amp;mdash;¡Ay!
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; (continué, viendo que uno de aquellos tigres se ruborizaba): si,

     como yo, tuvieseis hijos; si pensarais que tal vez mañana se verán
     en la tierra de este infeliz, en la misma situación que él,
     solos, moribundos, lejos de sus padres; si reflexionarais en[[#p62n1|&lt;sup&gt;[62-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que
     este polaco no sabe siquiera lo que hace en España; en que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; será un quinto[[#p62n2|&lt;sup&gt;[62-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] robado a su familia para servir a la ambición de

     un Rey..., ¡qué diablo![[#p62n3|&lt;sup&gt;[62-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] vosotros le perdonaríais....&amp;mdash; ¡Si;
     porque vosotros sois hombres antes que españoles, y este polaco
     es un hombre, un hermano vuestro!&amp;mdash;¿Qué ganará España
     con la muerte de un tercianario? ¡Batíos[[#p62n4|&lt;sup&gt;[62-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] hasta morir con

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; todos los granaderos de Napoleón; pero que sea[[#p62n5|&lt;sup&gt;[62-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en el campo
     de batalla! Y perdonad al débil; ¡sed generosos con el vencido;
     sed cristianos, no seáis[[#p62n6|&lt;sup&gt;[62-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] verdugos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Basta de letanías![[#p62n7|&lt;sup&gt;[62-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;dijo el que siempre había llevado
     la iniciativa de la crueldad, el que hacía andar a Iwa a fuerza
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de bayonetazos, el que quería comprar un empleo al precio de
     su cadáver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Compañero, ¿qué hacemos?[[#p62n8|&lt;sup&gt;[62-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;preguntó el otro, medio

     conmovido con mis palabras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es muy sencillo! (repuso el primero.) ¡Mira!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Y sin darme tiempo, no digo de evitar, sino de prever sus
     movimientos, descerrajó un tiro sobre el corazón del polaco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Iwa me miró con ternura, no sé si antes o después de morir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aquella mirada me prometió el cielo, donde acaso estaba ya
     el mártir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; En seguida los soldados me dieron una paliza con las baquetas
     de los fusiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El que había matado al extranjero, le cortó una oreja, que

     guardó en el bolsillo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Era la credencial del empleo que deseaba!
             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p63&quot; id=&quot;p63&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p63)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Después desnudó a Iwa, y le robó... hasta cierto medallón
     (con un retrato de mujer o de santa) que llevaba al cuello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entonces se alejaron hacia Almería.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo enterré a Iwa en este barranco..., ahí..., donde
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; está V. sentado..., y me volví a Gérgal, porque conocí que
     estaba malo.[[#p63n1|&lt;sup&gt;[63-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, con efecto, aquel lance me costó una terrible enfermedad,

     que me puso a las puertas de la muerte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Y ¿no volvió V. a ver a aquellos soldados? ¿No sabe V.
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; cómo se llamaban?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, señor; pero, por las señas que me dió más tarde la
     viejecita que cuidó al polaco, supe[[#p63n2|&lt;sup&gt;[63-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que uno de los dos españoles

     tenía el apodo de &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;, y que aquél era justamente el
     que había matado y robado al pobre extranjero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; En esto nos alcanzó la galera: el viejo y yo subimos al
     camino; nos apretamos la mano, y nos despedimos muy contentos
     el uno del otro.&amp;mdash; ¡Habíamos llorado juntos!&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt; Tres noches después tomábamos café varios amigos en el
     precioso casino de Almería.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Cerca de nosotros, y alrededor de otra mesa, se hallaban dos

     viejos, militares retirados, Comandante el uno y Coronel el otro,
     según dijo alguno que los conocía.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A pesar nuestro,[[#i164|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii164&quot;&gt;(164)&lt;/sup&gt;]] oíamos su conversación, pues hablaban tan
     alto como suelen los que han mandado mucho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; De pronto hirió mis oídos y llamó mi atención esta frase del

     Coronel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;El pobre &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Risas!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;exclamé para mí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y me puse a escuchar de intento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;El pobre &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;... (decía el Coronel) fué hecho prisionero
     por los franceses cuando tomaron a Málaga, y, de depósito &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p64&quot; id=&quot;p64&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p64)&lt;/span --&gt;
     en[[#i165|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii165&quot;&gt;(165)&lt;/sup&gt;]] depósito, fué a parar nada menos que a Suecia,[[#p64n1|&lt;sup&gt;[64-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] donde yo

     estaba también cautivo, como todos los que no pudimos escaparnos
     con el Marqués de la Romana.[[#p64n2|&lt;sup&gt;[64-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;Allí lo conocí, porque
     intimó con Juan, mi asistente de toda la vida, o de toda mi
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; carrera; y cuando Napoleón tuvo la crueldad de llevar a Rusia,
     formando parte de su Grande Ejército, a todos los españoles

     que estábamos prisioneros en su poder, tomé de ordenanza a
     &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;.[[#p64n3|&lt;sup&gt;[64-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Entonces me enteré de que tenía un miedo cerval[[#p64n4|&lt;sup&gt;[64-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a
     los polacos, o un terror supersticioso a Polonia,[[#p64n5|&lt;sup&gt;[64-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pues no hacía

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; más que preguntarnos a Juan y a mi «si tendríamos que pasar
     por aquella tierra para ir a Rusia,» estremeciéndose a la idea
     de que tal[[#p64n6|&lt;sup&gt;[64-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] llegase a acontecer.&amp;mdash;Indudablemente, a aquel
     hombre, cuya cabeza no estaba muy firme por lo mucho que

     había abusado de las bebidas espirituosas,[[#p64n7|&lt;sup&gt;[64-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pero que en lo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; demás era un buen soldado y un mediano cocinero, le había
     ocurrido algo grave con algún polaco, ora[[#p64n8|&lt;sup&gt;[64-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la guerra de
     España,[[#p64n9|&lt;sup&gt;[64-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ora en su larga peregrinación por otras naciones.&amp;mdash;Llegados

     a Varsovia,[[#p64n10|&lt;sup&gt;[64-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] donde nos detuvimos algunos días, &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;
     se puso gravemente enfermo, de fiebre cerebral, por resultas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; del terror pánico que le había acometido desde que entramos
     en tierra polonesa; y yo, que le tenía ya cierto cariño, no quise

     dejarlo allí solo cuando recibimos la orden de marcha, sino que
     conseguí de mis Jefes que Juan se quedase en Varsovia cuidándolo,
     sin perjuicio de que,[[#p64n11|&lt;sup&gt;[64-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] resuelta aquella crisis de un modo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; o de otro, saliese luego en mi busca con algún convoy de
     equipajes y víveres, de los muchos que seguirían a la nube de

     gente en que mi regimiento figuraba a vanguardia.&amp;mdash;¡Cuál
     fué, pues, mi sorpresa cuando, el mismo día que nos pusimos
     en camino, y a las pocas horas de haber echado a andar,[[#p64n12|&lt;sup&gt;[64-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; me presentó mi antiguo asistente lleno de terror, y me dijo lo

     que acababa de suceder con el pobre &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;mdash;¡Dígole a V.
     que el caso es de lo más singular[[#p64n13|&lt;sup&gt;[64-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y estupendo que haya ocurrido
     nunca!&amp;mdash;Óigame, y verá si hay motivo para que yo no
     haya olvidado esta historia en cuarenta y dos años.&amp;mdash;Juan&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p65&quot; id=&quot;p65&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p65)&lt;/span --&gt;

     había buscado un buen alojamiento para cuidar a &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;, en
     casa de cierta labradora viuda, con tres hijas casaderas, que
     desde que llegamos a Varsovia los españoles no había dejado
     de preguntarnos a varios, por medio de intérpretes franceses,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; si sabíamos algo de un hijo suyo llamado &lt;i&gt;Iwa&lt;/i&gt;, que vino a la

     guerra de España en 1808, y de quien hacía tres años no tenía
     noticia alguna, cosa que no pasaba a las demás familias que se
     hallaban en idéntico caso.&amp;mdash;Como Juan era tan zalamero,
     halló modo de consolar y esperanzar a aquella triste madre, y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; de aquí[[#p65n1|&lt;sup&gt;[65-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el que, en recompensa, ella se brindara[[#p65n2|&lt;sup&gt;[65-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a cuidar a

     &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt; al verlo caer en su presencia atacado de una fiebre
     cerebral...&amp;mdash;Llegados a casa de la buena mujer, y cuando ésta
     ayudaba a desnudar al enfermo, Juan la vió palidecer de pronto
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y apoderarse convulsivamente de cierto medallón de plata, con
     una efigie o retrato en miniatura, que &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt; llevaba siempre al

     pecho, bajo la ropa, a modo de talismán o conjuro contra los
     polacos, por creer[[#p65n3|&lt;sup&gt;[65-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que representaba a una Virgen o Santa de
     aquel país.&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Iwa! ¡Iwa!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;gritó después la viuda de un
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; modo horrible, sacudiendo al enfermo, que nada entendía,

     aletargado como estaba por la fiebre.&amp;mdash;En esto acudieron las
     hijas; y, enteradas del caso, cogieron el medallón, lo pusieron
     al lado del rostro de su madre, llamando por medio de señas la
     atención de Juan para que viese, como vió, que la tal efigie[[#p65n4|&lt;sup&gt;[65-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; no era más que el retrato de aquella mujer, y, encarándose

     entonces con él, visto que su compatriota no podía responderles,
     comenzaron a interrogarle mil cosas con palabras ininteligibles,
     bien que con gestos y ademanes que revelaban claramente la
     más siniestra furia.&amp;mdash;Juan se encogió de hombros, dando a
     entender por señas que él no sabía nada de la procedencia de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; aquel retrato, ni conocía a &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt; más que de muy poco

     tiempo....&amp;mdash;Elnoble semblante de mi honradísimo asistente debió
     de probar[[#p65n5|&lt;sup&gt;[65-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a aquellas cuatro leonas encolerizadas que el pobre
     no era culpable....&amp;mdash;¡Además, él no llevaba el medallón!&amp;mdash;Pero
     el otro... ¡al otro, al pobre &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt;, lo mataron a&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p66&quot; id=&quot;p66&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p66)&lt;/span --&gt;

     golpes y lo hicieron pedazos con las uñas!&amp;mdash;Es cuanto[[#i166|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii166&quot;&gt;(166)&lt;/sup&gt;]] sé[[#p66n1|&lt;sup&gt;[66-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     con relación a este drama, pues nunca he podido averiguar por
     qué tenía &lt;i&gt;Risas&lt;/i&gt; aquel retrato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Permítame V. que se lo cuente yo....&amp;mdash;dije sin poder

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; contenerme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y acercándome a la mesa del Coronel y del Comandante,
     después de ser presentado a ellos por mis amigos, les referí a
     todos la espantosa narración del minero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Luego que concluí, el Comandante, hombre de más de

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; setenta años, exclamó con la fe sencilla de un militar antiguo,
     con el arranque de un buen español y con toda la autoridad de
     sus canas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vive Dios, señores, que[[#p66n2|&lt;sup&gt;[66-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en todo eso hay algo más que

     una casualidad!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Almería, 1854.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;HISTORIETA RURAL&lt;/b&gt;

====I====
&lt;p&gt; La acción comienza en Rota.&amp;mdash;Rota es la menor de aquellas
     encantadoras poblaciones hermanas que forman el amplio semicírculo
     de la bahia de Cádiz;[[#p67n2|&lt;sup&gt;[67-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pero, con ser la menor,[[#p67n3|&lt;sup&gt;[67-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no ha

     faltado quien ponga los ojos en ella.&amp;mdash;El Duque de Osuna, a
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; título de Duque de Arcos,[[#p67n4|&lt;sup&gt;[67-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la ostenta entre las perlas de su
     corona hace muchísimo tiempo, y tiene allí su correspondiente
     castillo señorial, que yo pudiera describir piedra por piedra....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mas no se trata aquí de castillos, ni de duques, sino de los
     célebres campos que rodean a Rota y de un humildísimo hortelano,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; a quien llamaremos &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p67n5|&lt;sup&gt;[67-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] aunque no era
     éste su verdadero nombre, según parece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los campos de Rota (particularmente las huertas) son tan
     productivos que, además de tributarle al Duque de Osuna
     muchos miles de fanegas de grano y de abastecer de vino a
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; toda la población (poco amante del agua potable y malísimamente
     dotada de ella), surten de frutas y legumbres a Cádiz, y

     muchas veces a Huelva,[[#p67n6|&lt;sup&gt;[67-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y en ocasiones a la misma Sevilla,[[#p67n7|&lt;sup&gt;[67-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     sobre todo en los ramos de tomates y calabazas, cuya excelente
     calidad, suma abundancia y consiguiente baratura exceden
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; a toda ponderación;&amp;mdash;por lo que[[#p67n8|&lt;sup&gt;[67-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en &lt;i&gt;Andalucía la Baja&lt;/i&gt;[[#p67n9|&lt;sup&gt;[67-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     se da a los roteños[[#p67n10|&lt;sup&gt;[67-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el dictado de &lt;i&gt;calabaceros&lt;/i&gt; y de
     &lt;i&gt;tomateros&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p67n11|&lt;sup&gt;[67-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que ellos aceptan con noble orgullo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, a la verdad, motivo tienen para enorgullecerse de semejantes
     motes; pues es el caso que aquella tierra de Rota que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; tanto produce (me refiero a la de las huertas); aquella tierra&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p68&quot; id=&quot;p68&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p68)&lt;/span --&gt;
     que da para el consumo y para la exportación; aquella tierra
     que rinde tres o cuatro cosechas al año, ni es tal tierra,[[#p68n1|&lt;sup&gt;[68-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ni Cristo

     que lo fundó,[[#p68n2|&lt;sup&gt;[68-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sino arena pura y limpia, expelida sin cesar por
     el turbulento Océano, arrebatada por los furiosos vientos del
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Oeste y esparcida sobre toda la comarca roteña, como las
     lluvias de ceniza que caen en las inmediaciones del Vesubio.[[#p68n3|&lt;sup&gt;[68-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero la ingratitud de la Naturaleza está allí más que compensada
     por la constante laboriosidad del hombre.&amp;mdash;Yo no
     conozco, ni creo que haya en el mundo, labrador que trabaje
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; tanto como el roteño.&amp;mdash;Ni[[#p68n4|&lt;sup&gt;[68-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] un leve hilo de agua dulce fluye

     por aquellos melancólicos campos.... ¿Qué importa? ¡El
     &lt;i&gt;calabacero&lt;/i&gt; los ha acribillado materialmente de pozos, de donde
     saca, ora[[#p68n5|&lt;sup&gt;[68-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a pulso, ora por medio de norias, el precioso humor
     que sirve de[[#i167|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii167&quot;&gt;(167)&lt;/sup&gt;]] sangre a los vegetales!&amp;mdash;La arena carece de

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; fecundos principios, del asimilable &lt;i&gt;humus&lt;/i&gt;[[#p68n6|&lt;sup&gt;[68-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... ¿Qué importa?
     ¡El &lt;i&gt;tomatero&lt;/i&gt; pasa la mitad de su vida buscando y
     allegando sustancias que puedan servir de abono, y convirtiendo
     en estiércol hasta las algas del mar!&amp;mdash;Ya poseedor de

     ambos preciosos elementos, el hijo de Rota va estercolando
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; pacientemente, no su heredad entera (pues le faltarla abono
     para tanto), sino redondeles de terreno del vuelo de un plato
     chico,[[#p68n7|&lt;sup&gt;[68-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y en cada uno de estos redondeles estercolados siembra
     un grano de simiente de tomate o una pepita de calabaza, que

     riega luego a mano con un jarro muy diminuto, como quien da
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de beber a un niño.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Desde entonces hasta la recolección cuida diariamente una por
     una las plantas que nacen en aquellos redondeles, tratándolas con
     un mimo y un esmero sólo comparables a la solicitud con que

     las solteronas cuidan sus macetas. Un día le añade a tal mata[[#p68n8|&lt;sup&gt;[68-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; un puñadillo de estiércol; otro le echa una chorreadita de
     agua; ora las limpia a todas de orugas y demás insectos dañinos;
     ora cura a las enfermas, entablilla a las fracturadas, y
     pone parapetos de caña y hojas secas a las que no pueden

     resistir los rayos del sol o están demasiado expuestas a los&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p69&quot; id=&quot;p69&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p69)&lt;/span --&gt;
     vientos del mar; ora, en fin, cuenta los tallos, las hojas, las
     flores o los frutos de las más adelantadas y precoces, y les
     habla, las acaricia, las besa, las bendice y hasta les pone expresivos
     nombres para distinguirlas e individualizarlas en su
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; imaginación.&amp;mdash;Sin exagerar: es ya un proverbio (y yo lo he

     oído repetir muchas veces en Rota) que el hortelano de aquel
     país &lt;i&gt;toca por lo menos cuarenta veces con su propia mano a
     cada mata de tomates que nace en su huerta&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;mdash;Y así se explica
     que los hortelanos viejos de aquella localidad lleguen a quedarse
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; encorvados, hasta tal punto que casi se dan[[#p69n1|&lt;sup&gt;[69-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con las

     rodillas en la barba[[#p69n2|&lt;sup&gt;[69-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Es la postura en que han pasado toda su noble y meritoria
     vida!&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt; Pues bien: &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt; pertenecía al gremio de estos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; hortelanos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ya principiaba a encorvarse en la época del suceso que voy
     a referir: y era que[[#p69n3|&lt;sup&gt;[69-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya tenía[[#i168|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii168&quot;&gt;(168)&lt;/sup&gt;]] sesenta años... y llevaba[[#p69n4|&lt;sup&gt;[69-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     cuarenta de labrar una huerta lindante con la playa de la &lt;i&gt;Costilla&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Aquel año había criado allí unas estupendas calabazas,
     tamañas[[#p69n5|&lt;sup&gt;[69-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] como bolas decorativas de pretil de puente monumental,
     y que ya principiaban a ponerse por dentro y por fuera

     de color de naranja, lo cual quería decir que había mediado el
     mes de Junio.  Conocíalas perfectamente &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;
     por la forma, por su grado de madurez y hasta de[[#i169|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii169&quot;&gt;(169)&lt;/sup&gt;]] nombre,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; sobre todo a los cuarenta ejemplares más gordos y lucidos, que
     ya estaban diciendo &lt;i&gt;guisadme&lt;/i&gt;, y pasábase[[#p69n6|&lt;sup&gt;[69-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] los días mirándolos

     con ternura y exclamando melancólicamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Pronto tendremos que separarnos!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al fin, una tarde se resolvió al sacrificio; y señalando a los
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; mejores frutos de aquellas amadísimas cucurbitáceas que tantos
     afanes le habían costado, pronunció la terrible sentencia.

           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p70&quot; id=&quot;p70&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p70)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Mañana (dijo) cortaré estas cuarenta, y las llevaré al
     mercado de Cádiz.&amp;mdash;¡Feliz quien se las coma![[#p70n1|&lt;sup&gt;[70-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y se marchó a su casa con paso lento, y pasó la noche con
     las angustias del padre que va a casar una hija al día siguiente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Lástima[[#p70n2|&lt;sup&gt;[70-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de mis calabazas!&amp;mdash;suspiraba a veces sin
     poder conciliar el sueño.&amp;mdash;Pero luego reflexionaba, y concluía
     por decir:&amp;mdash;Y ¿qué he de hacer,[[#p70n3|&lt;sup&gt;[70-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sino salir de ellas?[[#p70n4|&lt;sup&gt;[70-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Para

     eso las he criado!&amp;mdash;Lo menos van a valerme quince duros....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gradúese, pues, cuánto sería[[#p70n5|&lt;sup&gt;[70-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] su asombro, cuánta su furia y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; cuál su desesperación, cuando, al ir a la mañana siguiente a la
     huerta, halló que, durante la noche, le habían robado las cuarenta

     calabazas....&amp;mdash;Para ahorrarme de razones,[[#p70n6|&lt;sup&gt;[70-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] diré que,
     como el judío de Shakespeare, llegó al más sublime paroxismo
     trágico, repitiendo frenéticamente aquellas terribles palabras
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; de Shylock, en que tan admirable dicen que estaba el actor

     Kemble:[[#p70n7|&lt;sup&gt;[70-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;¡Oh! ¡Si te encuentro!&lt;/i&gt;[[#p70n8|&lt;sup&gt;[70-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;¡Si te encuentro!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Púsose luego &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt; a recapacitar fríamente, y

     comprendió que sus amadas prendas no podían estar en Rota,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; donde sería imposible ponerlas a la venta sin riesgo de que él
     las reconociese, y donde, por otra parte,[[#p70n9|&lt;sup&gt;[70-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] las calabazas tienen
     muy bajo precio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Como si lo viera, están en Cádiz! (dedujo de sus cavilaciones.)
     El infame, pícaro, ladrón, debió de robármelas[[#p70n10|&lt;sup&gt;[70-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; anoche a las nueve o las diez y se escaparía con ellas a las doce
     en el &lt;i&gt;barco de la carga&lt;/i&gt;[[#p70n11|&lt;sup&gt;[70-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... ¡Yo saldré para Cádiz hoy por

     la mañana en el &lt;i&gt;barco de la hora&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p70n12|&lt;sup&gt;[70-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y maravilla será que no
     atrape al ratero y recupere a las hijas de mi trabajo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así diciendo, permaneció todavía cosa de veinte minutos en
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; el lugar de la catástrofe, como acariciando las mutiladas calabaceras,

     o contando las calabazas que faltaban, o extendiendo una
     especie de &lt;i&gt;fe de livores&lt;/i&gt;[[#p70n13|&lt;sup&gt;[70-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para algún proceso que pensara
     incoar hasta que, a eso de las ocho, partió con dirección al muelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ya estaba dispuesto para hacerse a la vela[[#p70n14|&lt;sup&gt;[70-14]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el &lt;i&gt;barco&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p71&quot; id=&quot;p71&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p71)&lt;/span --&gt;

     de la hora&lt;/i&gt;, humilde falucho que sale todas las mañanas para
      Cádiz a las nueve en punto, conduciendo pasajeros, así como el
      &lt;i&gt;barco de la carga&lt;/i&gt; sale todas las noches á las doce,
      conduciendo frutas y legumbres....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Llámase &lt;i&gt;barco de la hora&lt;/i&gt; el primero, porque en este espacio

     de tiempo, y hasta en cuarenta minutos algunos días, si el viento
     es de popa, cruza las tres leguas que median entre la antigua
     villa del Duque de Arcos y la antigua ciudad de Hércules[[#p71n1|&lt;sup&gt;[71-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt; Eran, pues, las diez y media de la mañana cuando aquel día
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; se paraba &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt; delante de un puesto de verduras
     del mercado de Cádiz, y le decía a un aburrido polizonte que
     iba con él:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Estas son mis calabazas!&amp;mdash;¡Prenda V. a ese hombre!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y señalaba al revendedor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Prenderme a mí! (contestó el revendedor, lleno de sorpresa
     y de cólera.)&amp;mdash;Estas calabazas son mías; yo las he

     comprado....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Eso podrá V. contárselo al Alcalde&amp;mdash;repuso &lt;i&gt;el tío
     Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que no![[#p71n2|&lt;sup&gt;[71-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que sí!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Tío ladrón![[#p71n3|&lt;sup&gt;[71-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Tío tunante!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hablen Vds. con más educación,[[#p71n4|&lt;sup&gt;[71-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] so indecentes![[#p71n5|&lt;sup&gt;[71-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Los

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; hombres no deben faltarse[[#p71n6|&lt;sup&gt;[71-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de esa manera!&amp;mdash;dijo con mucha
     calma el polizonte, dando un puñetazo[[#p71n7|&lt;sup&gt;[71-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en el pecho a cada
     interlocutor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En esto ya había acudido alguna gente, no tardando en presentarse
     también allí el Regidor encargado de la policía de los
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; mercados públicos, o sea[[#p71n8|&lt;sup&gt;[71-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;el Juez de abastos&lt;/i&gt;, que es su
      verdadero nombre.

                       &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p72&quot; id=&quot;p72&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p72)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Resignó[[#p72n1|&lt;sup&gt;[72-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la jurisdicción el polizonte en Su Señoría, y enterada
     esta digna autoridad de todo lo que pasaba, preguntó al revendedor
     con majestuoso acento:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿A quién[[#p72n2|&lt;sup&gt;[72-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] le ha comprado V. esas calabazas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Al tío Fulano,[[#p72n3|&lt;sup&gt;[72-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] vecino[[#p72n4|&lt;sup&gt;[72-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de Rota....&amp;mdash;respondió el
     interrogado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ése había de ser! (gritó &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;.) ¡Muy

     abonado[[#p72n5|&lt;sup&gt;[72-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] es para el caso! ¡Cuando su huerta, que es muy
     mala, le produce poco, se mete a robar en la del vecino!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero, admitida la hipótesis de que a V. le han robado
     anoche cuarenta calabazas (siguió interrogando el Regidor,

     volviéndose al viejo hortelano), ¿quién le asegura a V. que
     éstas, y no otras, son las suyas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma! (replicó &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;.) ¡Porque las
     conozco como V. conocerá a sus hijas, si las tiene!&amp;mdash;¿No ve

     V. que las he criado?&amp;mdash;Mire V.: ésta se llama &lt;i&gt;rebolonda&lt;/i&gt;;[[#p72n6|&lt;sup&gt;[72-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     ésta, &lt;i&gt;cachigordeta&lt;/i&gt;;[[#p72n7|&lt;sup&gt;[72-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ésta, &lt;i&gt;barrigona&lt;/i&gt;;[[#p72n8|&lt;sup&gt;[72-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ésta,

     &lt;i&gt;coloradilla&lt;/i&gt;; [[#p72n9|&lt;sup&gt;[72-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ésta &lt;i&gt;Manuela&lt;/i&gt;..., porque se
     parecía mucho a mi hija la menor....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Y el pobre viejo se echó a llorar amarguísimamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Todo eso está muy bien... (repuso el Juez de abastos);
     pero la ley no se contenta con que usted reconozca sus calabazas.
     Es menester que la autoridad se convenza al mismo tiempo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de la preexistencia de la cosa, y que V. la identifique con
     pruebas fehacientes....&amp;mdash;Señores, no hay que sonreírse....&amp;mdash;¡Yo

     soy abogado!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Pues verá V. qué pronto le pruebo yo a todo el mundo,
     sin moverme de aquí, que esas calabazas se han criado en mi
     huerta!&amp;mdash;dijo &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;, no sin grande asombro de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; los circunstantes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y soltando en el suelo un lío que llevaba en la mano, agachóse,
     arrodillándose hasta sentarse sobre los pies, y se puso a
     desatar tranquilamente las anudadas puntas del pañuelo que lo
     envolvía.
                &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p73&quot; id=&quot;p73&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p73)&lt;/span --&gt;
     La admiración del Concejal, del revendedor y del corro subió

     de punto.[[#p73n1|&lt;sup&gt;[73-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué va a sacar de ahí?&amp;mdash;se preguntaban todos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Al mismo tiempo llegó un nuevo curioso a ver qué ocurría
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; en aquel grupo, y habiéndole divisado el revendedor,

     exclamó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Me alegro de que llegue V., tío Fulano! Este hombre
     dice que las calabazas que me vendió usted anoche, y que
     están aquí oyendo la conversación, son robadas....&amp;mdash;Conteste
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; V....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El recién llegado[[#p73n2|&lt;sup&gt;[73-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se puso más amarillo que la cera, y trató
     de irse; pero los circunstantes se lo[[#p73n3|&lt;sup&gt;[73-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] impidieron 
     materialmente,[[#p73n4|&lt;sup&gt;[73-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y el mismo[[#p73n5|&lt;sup&gt;[73-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Regidor le mandó quedarse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En cuanto al &lt;i&gt;tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;, ya se había encarado con el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; presunto ladrón, diciéndole:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ahora verá V. lo que es bueno!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El tío Fulano recobró su sangre fría, y expuso:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Usted es quien ha de ver[[#p73n6|&lt;sup&gt;[73-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo que habla; porque si no
     prueba, y no podrá probar, su denuncia, lo llevaré a la cárcel
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; por calumniador.&amp;mdash;Estas calabazas eran mías; yo las he
     criado, como todas las que he traído este año a Cádiz, en mi

     huerta del &lt;i&gt;Egido&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p73n7|&lt;sup&gt;[73-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y nadie podrá probarme lo contrario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ahora verá V.!&amp;mdash;repitió &lt;i&gt;el tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt; acabando de
     desatar el pañuelo y tirando de él.[[#p73n8|&lt;sup&gt;[73-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Y entonces se desparramaron por el suelo una multitud de
     trozos de tallo de calabacera, todavía verdes y chorreando
     jugo, mientras que el viejo hortelano, sentado sobre sus piernas
     y muerto de risa, dirigía el siguiente discurso al Concejal y
     a los curiosos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Caballeros: ¿no han pagado Vds. nunca contribución?
     Y ¿no han visto aquel libraco[[#p73n9|&lt;sup&gt;[73-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] verde que tiene el recaudador,
     de donde va cortando recibos, dejando allí pegado un tocón o
     pezuelo,[[#p73n10|&lt;sup&gt;[73-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para que luego pueda comprobarse si tal o cual[[#p73n11|&lt;sup&gt;[73-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     recibo es falso o no lo es?
                    &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p74&quot; id=&quot;p74&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p74)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Lo que V. dice se llama el &lt;i&gt;libro talonario&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;observó
     gravemente el Regidor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues eso es lo que yo traigo aqui: el &lt;i&gt;libro talonario&lt;/i&gt; de mi

     huerta, o sea[[#p74n1|&lt;sup&gt;[74-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] los cabos a que estaban unidas estas calabazas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; antes de que me las robasen.&amp;mdash;Y, si no, miren Vds.&amp;mdash;Este
     cabo era de esta calabaza.... Nadie puede dudarlo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Este otro..., ya lo están Vds. viendo..., era de esta

     otra.&amp;mdash;Este más ancho..., debe de ser de aquélla....
     ¡Justamente!&amp;mdash;Y éste es de ésta.... Ése es de ésa....
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Ésta es de aquél....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y en tanto que[[#p74n2|&lt;sup&gt;[74-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] así decía, iba adaptando un cabo o pedúnculo

     a la excavación que había quedado en cada calabaza al ser
     arrancada, y los espectadores[[#p74n3|&lt;sup&gt;[74-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] veían con asombro que, efectivamente,
     la base irregular y caprichosa de los pedúnculos convenía
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; del modo más exacto con la figura blanquecina y leve
     concavidad que presentaban las que pudiéramos llamar cicatrices

     de las calabazas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pusiéronse, pues, en cuclillas los circunstantes, inclusos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; los polizontes y el mismo Concejal,[[#p74n4|&lt;sup&gt;[74-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y comenzaron a
     ayudarle al &lt;i&gt;tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt; en aquella singular comprobación,

     diciendo todos a un mismo tiempo con pueril
     regocijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Nada! ¡Nada! ¡Es indudable! ¡Miren Vds.!&amp;mdash;Éste
     es de aquí.... Ése es de ahí.... Aquélla es de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; éste.... Ésta es de aquél....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y las carcajadas de los grandes se unían a los silbidos de los
     chicos, a las imprecaciones de las mujeres, a las lágrimas de
     triunfo y alegría del viejo hortelano y a los empellones que los
     guindillas daban ya al convicto ladrón, como impacientes por
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; llevárselo[[#p74n5|&lt;sup&gt;[74-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a la cárcel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Excusado es decir que los guindillas tuvieron este gusto;
     que el tío Fulano vióse obligado desde luego a devolver al
     revendedor los quince duros que de él había percibido; que el
     revendedor se los entregó en el acto al &lt;i&gt;tío Buscabeatas&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p75&quot; id=&quot;p75&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p75)&lt;/span --&gt;
     y que éste se marchó a Rota sumamente contento, bien que fuese

     diciendo[[#p75n1|&lt;sup&gt;[75-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por el camino:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Qué hermosas estaban en el mercado! ¡He debido
     traerme[[#p75n2|&lt;sup&gt;[75-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a &lt;i&gt;Manuela&lt;/i&gt;, para comérmela[[#p75n3|&lt;sup&gt;[75-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] esta noche y guardar

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; las pepitas!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Noviembre de 1877.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;(CUENTO)&lt;/b&gt;

====I====
&lt;p&gt; La antes famosa y ya poco nombrada villa de Aldeire forma
     parte del marquesado del Cenet, o como si dijéramos, del respaldo
     de la Alpujarra,[[#p76n1|&lt;sup&gt;[76-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] hacia Levante,[[#p76n2|&lt;sup&gt;[76-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y está medio colgada,

     medio escondida, en un escalón o barranco de la formidable
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; mole central de Sierra Nevada, a cinco o seis mil pies sobre el
     nivel del mar y seis o siete mil por debajo de las eternas nieves
     del Mulhacen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aldeire, dicho sea con perdón de su señor cura, es un pueblo

     morisco. Que fué moro, lo dicen claramente su nombre, su
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; situación y su estructura; y que no ha llegado aún a ser enteramente
     cristiano, aunque figure en la España reconquistada y
     tenga su iglesita católica y sus cofradías de la Virgen, de Jesús
     y de no pocos santos y santas, lo demuestran el carácter y costumbres
     de sus moradores, las pasiones terribles cuanto quiméricas

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; que los unen o separan en perpetuos bandos, y los lúgubres
     ojos negros, pálida tez y escaso hablar y reír de mujeres, hombres
     y niños....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Porque bueno será recordar, para que ni dicho señor cura ni
     nadie[[#p76n3|&lt;sup&gt;[76-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ponga en cuarentena[[#p76n4|&lt;sup&gt;[76-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la solidez de este razonamiento,

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que los moriscos del marquesado del Cenet no fueron expulsados
     en totalidad como los de la Alpujarra, sino que muchos de
     ellos lograron quedarse allí agazapados y escondidos gracias a
     la prudencia o cobardía con que desoyeron el temerario y heroico
     grito de su malhadado príncipe Aben-Humeya;[[#p76n5|&lt;sup&gt;[76-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de donde

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; yo deduzco que el tío Juan Gómez (a)[[#p76n6|&lt;sup&gt;[76-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;Hormiga&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p77&quot; id=&quot;p77&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p77)&lt;/span --&gt;
     alcalde constitucional de Aldeire en el año de gracia de 1821, podía
     muy bien ser nieto de algún Mustafá, Mahommed o cosa por el estilo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cuéntase, pues, que el tal Juan[[#p77n1|&lt;sup&gt;[77-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Gómez, hombre a la sazón

     de más de media centuria, rústico muy avisado aunque no entendía
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; de letra,[[#p77n2|&lt;sup&gt;[77-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y codicioso y trabajador con fruto, como lo
     acreditaba, no solamente su apodo, sino también su mucha hacienda,
     por él adquirida a fuerza de buenas o malas artes, y
     representada en las mejores suertes de tierra de aquella jurisdicción,

     tomó a censo enfitéutico[[#p77n3|&lt;sup&gt;[77-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del caudal de Propios,[[#p77n4|&lt;sup&gt;[77-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y casi de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; balde,[[#i170|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii170&quot;&gt;(170)&lt;/sup&gt;]] mediante algunas gallinas no ponedoras que regaló al secretario
     del Ayuntamiento, unos secanos situados a las inmediaciones
     de la villa, en medio de los cuales veíanse los restos y

     escombros de un antiguo castillejo,[[#p77n5|&lt;sup&gt;[77-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] morabito o atalaya árabe,
     cuyo nombre era todavía &lt;i&gt;La Torre del Moro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Excusado es decir que el tío Hormiga no se detuvo ni un instante
     a pensar en qué moro sería aquél, ni en la índole o pristino

     objeto de la arruinada construcción; lo único que vió desde
     luego más claro que el agua fué que con tantas desmoronadas
     piedras, y con las que él desmoronara, podía hacer allí un hermoso
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; y muy seguro corral para sus ganados; por lo que[[#p77n6|&lt;sup&gt;[77-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] desde
     el día siguiente, y como recreo muy propio de quien tan económico

     era, dedicó las tardes a derribar por sí mismo, y a sus
     solas,[[#p77n7|&lt;sup&gt;[77-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] lo que en pie quedaba del vetusto edificio arábigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Te vas a reventar!&amp;mdash;le decía su mujer, al verlo llegar
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; por la noche lleno de polvo y de sudor, y con la barra de hierro

     oculta bajo la capa....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Al contrario!&amp;mdash;respondía él.&amp;mdash;Este ejercicio me conviene
     para no podrirme como nuestros hijos los estudiantes, que
     según me ha dicho el estanquero, estaban la otra noche en el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; teatro de Granada y tenían un color de manteca que daba asco[[#p77n8|&lt;sup&gt;[77-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     mirarlos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pobres! ¡De tanto estudiar! Pero a ti debía de darte
     vergüenza de trabajar como un peón siendo el más rico del
     pueblo, alcalde por añadidura.[[#i171|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii171&quot;&gt;(171)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
          &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p78&quot; id=&quot;p78&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p78)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Por eso voy solo.... ¡A ver!... Acércame esa

     ensalada....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sin embargo, convendría que te ayudase alguien. ¡Vas a
     echar un siglo[[#p78n1|&lt;sup&gt;[78-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en derribar la Torre, y hasta quizá no sepas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; componértelas[[#p78n2|&lt;sup&gt;[78-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para volcarla toda!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No digas simplezas, Torcuata! Cuando se trate de construir
     la tapia del corral pagaré jornales, y hasta llevaré un
     maestro alarife....&amp;mdash;¡Pero derribar sabe cualquiera! ¡Y es
     tan divertido[[#p78n3|&lt;sup&gt;[78-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] destruir!... ¡Vaya!... ¡quita la mesa y

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; acostémonos!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Eso lo dices porque eres hombre. ¡A mí me da miedo y
     lástima todo lo que es deshacer![[#p78n4|&lt;sup&gt;[78-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Debilidades de vieja! ¡Si supieras tú cuántas cosas hay
     que deshacer[[#p78n5|&lt;sup&gt;[78-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en este mundo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Calla, francmasón![[#p78n6|&lt;sup&gt;[78-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡En mal hora te han elegido alcalde!
     ¡Verás cómo, el día que vuelvan a mandar los realistas,
     te ahorca el Rey absoluto!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eso... lo veremos! ¡Santurrona! ¡Beata! ¡Lechuza!

     ¡Vaya!: apaga esa luz, y no te santigües más...,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que tengo[[#p78n7|&lt;sup&gt;[78-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mucho sueño.[[#i172|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii172&quot;&gt;(172)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y así continuaban los diálogos hasta que se dormía uno de
     los dos consortes.&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt; Una tarde regresó de su faena el tío Hormiga, muy preocupado
     y caviloso, y más temprano que de costumbre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Su mujer aguardó a que despachase a los mozos de labor

     para preguntarle qué tenía, y él respondió enseñándole un tubo
     de plomo con tapadera por el estilo del cañuto[[#p78n8|&lt;sup&gt;[78-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de un licenciado
     del ejército; sacó de allí, y desarrolló cuidadosamente, un
     amarillento pergamino escrito en caracteres muy enrevesados, y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; dijo con imponente seriedad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Yo no sé leer,[[#i174|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii174&quot;&gt;(174)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ni tan siquiera[[#p78n9|&lt;sup&gt;[78-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en castellano, que es la&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p79&quot; id=&quot;p79&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p79)&lt;/span --&gt;
     lengua más clara del mundo; pero el diablo me lleve si esta escritura
     no es de moros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Es decir, que la has encontrado en la Torre?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No lo digo sólo por eso, sino porque estos garrapatos no
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; se parecen a ninguno de los que he visto hacer a gente cristiana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La mujer de Juan Gómez miró y olió el pergamino, y exclamó
     con una seguridad tan cómica como gratuita:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡De moros es!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pasado un rato, añadió melancólicamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Aunque también me estorba a mí lo negro,[[#p79n1|&lt;sup&gt;[79-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] juraría que
     tenemos en las manos la licencia absoluta[[#p79n2|&lt;sup&gt;[79-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de algún soldado de

     Mahoma,[[#p79n3|&lt;sup&gt;[79-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que ya estará en los profundos infiernos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Lo dices por el cañuto de plomo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Por el cañuto lo digo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues te equivocas de medio a medio,[[#p79n4|&lt;sup&gt;[79-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] amiga Torcuata;

     porque ni los moros entraban en quintas,[[#p79n5|&lt;sup&gt;[79-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] según me ha dicho
     varias veces nuestro hijo Agustín, ni esto es una licencia absoluta.
     Esto es... un....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El tío Hormiga miró en torno suyo,[[#p79n6|&lt;sup&gt;[79-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] bajó la voz y dijo con

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; entera fe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Estas son las señas de un tesoro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Tienes razón!&amp;mdash;respondió la mujer, súbitamente inflamada
     por la misma creencia.&amp;mdash;¿Y lo has encontrado ya? ¿Es

     muy grande? ¿Lo has vuelto a tapar bien? ¿Son monedas de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; plata, o de oro? ¿Crees tú que &lt;i&gt;pasarán&lt;/i&gt; todavía? ¡Qué felicidad
     para nuestros hijos! ¡Cómo van a gastar y a triunfar en
     Granada[[#p79n7|&lt;sup&gt;[79-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y en Madrid! ¡Yo quiero ver eso! Vamos allá....

     Esta noche hace luna[[#i175|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii175&quot;&gt;(175)&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Mujer de Dios! ¡Sosiégate! ¿Cómo quieres que haya
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; topado ya con el tesoro guiándome por estas señas, si yo no sé
     leer en moro ni en cristiano?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es verdad! Pues, mira.... Haz una cosa: en cuanto[[#i176|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii176&quot;&gt;(176)&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     Dios eche sus luces,[[#p79n8|&lt;sup&gt;[79-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] apareja un buen mulo; pasa la sierra por
     el puerto[[#p79n9|&lt;sup&gt;[79-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de la Ragua, que dicen está bueno, y llégate a&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p80&quot; id=&quot;p80&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p80)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Ugíjar,[[#p80n1|&lt;sup&gt;[80-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a casa de[[#i177|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii177&quot;&gt;(177)&lt;/sup&gt;]] nuestro compadre[[#p80n2|&lt;sup&gt;[80-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] D. Matías Quesada, el cual

     sabes entiende de todo[[#p80n3|&lt;sup&gt;[80-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]].... El te pondrá en claro ese papel
     y te dará buenos consejos, como siempre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Mis dineros me cuestan todos sus consejos a pesar de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; nuestro compadrazgo!... Pero, en fin, lo mismo había pensado
     yo. Mañana iré a Ugíjar, y a la noche estaré aquí de

     vuelta;[[#i178|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii178&quot;&gt;(178)&lt;/sup&gt;]] pues todo será apretar un poco a la caballería[[#p80n4|&lt;sup&gt;[80-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pero ¡cuidado[[#p80n5|&lt;sup&gt;[80-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que le expliques bien las cosas!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Poco tengo que explicarle. El cañuto estaba escondido

     en un hueco o nicho revestido de azulejos como los de Valencia,[[#p80n6|&lt;sup&gt;[80-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     formado en el espesor de una pared. He derribado todo
     aquel lienzo, y nada más de particular he hallado. Debajo de
     lo ya destruido comienza la obra de sillería de los cimientos,
     cuyas enormes piedras, de más de vara en cuadro,[[#p80n7|&lt;sup&gt;[80-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no removerán

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; fácilmente dos ni tres personas de puños tan buenos como
     los míos. Por consiguiente, es necesario saber de una manera
     fija en qué punto estaba escondido el tesoro, so pena[[#p80n8|&lt;sup&gt;[80-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de tener
     que arrancar con ayuda de vecinos todos los cimientos de la
     Torre....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Nada! ¡Nada! ¡A Ugíjar en cuanto amanezca! Ofrécele
     a nuestro compadre una parte..., no muy larga, de lo
     que hallemos, y, cuando sepamos dónde hay que excavar,[[#p80n9|&lt;sup&gt;[80-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] yo
     misma te ayudaré a arrancar piedras de sillería. ¡Hijos de mi

     alma! ¡Todo para ellos! Por lo que a mí toca, sólo siento
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; si habrá algo que sea pecado en esto que hablamos en voz baja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué pecado puede haber, grandísima tonta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No sé explicártelo.... Pero los tesoros me habían parecido
     siempre cosa del demonio, o de duendes.... Además,

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; ¡tomaste a censo aquel terreno por tan poco rédito al año!...
     ¡Todo el pueblo dice hubo trampa[[#p80n10|&lt;sup&gt;[80-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en el tal[[#i179|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii179&quot;&gt;(179)&lt;/sup&gt;]] negocio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eso es cuenta del secretario y de los concejales! Ellos
     me hicieron la escritura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Por otro lado, tengo entendido[[#p80n11|&lt;sup&gt;[80-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que de los tesoros hay
     que dar parte al Rey....
                      &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p81&quot; id=&quot;p81&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p81)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Eso es cuando no se hallan en terreno propio, como éste
     mío....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Propio! ¡Propio!... ¡A saber[[#p81n1|&lt;sup&gt;[81-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de quién sería esa
     torre que te ha vendido el Ayuntamiento!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma! ¡Del &lt;i&gt;Moro&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡A saber quién sería ese &lt;i&gt;Moro&lt;/i&gt;!... Por de pronto,[[#p81n2|&lt;sup&gt;[81-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     Juan, las monedas que el &lt;i&gt;Moro&lt;/i&gt; escondiera en su casa, serían
     suyas o de sus herederos; no tuyas, ni mías....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Estás diciendo disparates! ¡Por esa cuenta, no debía
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; yo ser alcalde de Aldeire, sino el que lo era el año pasado
     cuando se pronunció Riego![[#p81n3|&lt;sup&gt;[81-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Por esa cuenta, habría que
     mandar[[#p81n4|&lt;sup&gt;[81-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] todos los años a África, a los descendientes de los

     moros, las rentas que produjesen las vegas de Granada, de
     Guadix[[#p81n5|&lt;sup&gt;[81-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y de centenares de pueblos!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Puede que[[#p81n6|&lt;sup&gt;[81-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] tengas razón!... En fin, ve a Ugíjar, y el

     compadre te aconsejará lo mejor en todo.&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt; Ugíjar dista de Aldeire cosa de cuatro leguas de muy mal camino.
     No serían,[[#p81n7|&lt;sup&gt;[81-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sin embargo, las nueve de la siguiente mañana

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; cuando el tío Juan Gómez, vestido con su calzón corto de
     punto azul y sus bordadas botas blancas de los días de fiesta,
     hallábase ya en el despacho de D. Matías de Quesada, hombre
     de mucha edad y mucha salud, doctor en ambos Derechos[[#p81n8|&lt;sup&gt;[81-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     y autor de la mayor parte de los &lt;i&gt;entuertos&lt;/i&gt; contra la justicia que

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; se hacían por entonces en aquella tierra. Había sido toda su
     vida lo que se llama un abogado picapleitos, y estaba riquísimo
     y muy bien relacionado en Granada y Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oído que hubo[[#p81n9|&lt;sup&gt;[81-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la historia de su digno compadre, y después

     de examinar atentamente el pergamino, díjole que, en su
     opinión, nada de aquello olía a[[#i180|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii180&quot;&gt;(180)&lt;/sup&gt;]] tesoro: que el nicho en que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; halló el tubo debió de ser[[#p81n10|&lt;sup&gt;[81-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] un &lt;i&gt;babuchero&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p81n11|&lt;sup&gt;[81-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y que el

     escrito le parecía una especie de oración que los moros suelen&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p82&quot; id=&quot;p82&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p82)&lt;/span --&gt;
     leer todos los viernes[[#p82n1|&lt;sup&gt;[82-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por la mañana.... Pero que, sin embargo,
     no siéndole a él completamente conocida la lengua árabe, remitiría
     el documento a Madrid a un condiscípulo suyo que estaba
     empleado en la Comisaría de los Santos Lugares,[[#p82n2|&lt;sup&gt;[82-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a fin de que

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; lo enviara a Jerusalén, donde lo traducirían al castellano; por
     todo lo cual sería conveniente mandarle al madrileño un par
     de onzas de oro,[[#p82n3|&lt;sup&gt;[82-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en letra,[[#p82n4|&lt;sup&gt;[82-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] para una jícara de chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mucho lo pensó el tío Juan Gómez antes de pagar un chocolate
     tan caro (que resultaba a diez mil doscientos cuarenta
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; reales la libra); pero tenía tal seguridad en lo del &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt;[[#p82n5|&lt;sup&gt;[82-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     (y a fe que[[#p82n6|&lt;sup&gt;[82-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no se equivocaba según después veremos), que sacó

     de la faja ocho monedillas de a cuatro[[#p82n7|&lt;sup&gt;[82-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] duros y se las entregó al
     abogado, quien las pesó una por una antes de guardárselas[[#p82n8|&lt;sup&gt;[82-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; el bolsillo; con lo que el tío Hormiga tomó la vuelta de Aldeire
     decidido a seguir excavando en la Torre del Moro, mientras

     tanto que[[#p82n9|&lt;sup&gt;[82-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] enviaban el pergamino a Tierra Santa y volvía de
     allá traducido; diligencias en que, según el letrado, se tardaría
     cosa de año y medio.&lt;/p&gt;

====IV====
&lt;p&gt; No bien había vuelto la espalda el tío Juan, cuando su compadre
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; y asesor cogió la pluma y escribió la siguiente carta
     comenzando por el sobre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «SR. D. BONIFACIO TUDELA Y GONZALEZ,[[#p82n10|&lt;sup&gt;[82-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;Maestro de capilla&lt;/i&gt;[[#p82n11|&lt;sup&gt;[82-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     &lt;i&gt;de la Santa Iglesia Catedral de CEUTA.&lt;/i&gt;[[#p82n12|&lt;sup&gt;[82-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Mi querido sobrino político:[[#p82n13|&lt;sup&gt;[82-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; «Solamente a un hombre de tu religiosidad confiaría yo el
     importantísimo secreto contenido en el documento adjunto.

     Dígolo porque indudablemente están escritas en él las señas de
     un &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt;, de que te daré alguna parte si llego a descubrirlo
     con tu ayuda. Para ello es necesario que busques un moro
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; que te traduzca ese pergamino, y que me mandes la traducción&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p83&quot; id=&quot;p83&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p83)&lt;/span --&gt;
     en carta certificada,[[#p83n1|&lt;sup&gt;[83-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sin enterar a nadie del asunto, como no

     sea[[#p83n2|&lt;sup&gt;[83-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a tu mujer, que me consta es persona reservada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Perdona que no te haya escrito en tantos años; pero bien
     conoces mis muchos quehaceres. Tu tía sigue rezando por ti
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; todas las noches al tiempo de acostarse. Que estés mejor[[#p83n3|&lt;sup&gt;[83-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del

     dolor de estómago[[#p83n4|&lt;sup&gt;[83-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que padecías en 1806, y sabes que te quiere
     tu tío político,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «MATÍAS DE QUESADA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  «UGÍJAR, 15 de ENERO, 1821.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; «POSDATA.&amp;mdash;Expresiones a Pepa, y dime, si habéis tenido
     hijos.»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Escrita la precedente carta,[[#p83n5|&lt;sup&gt;[83-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el insigne jurisconsulto pasó a la
     cocina, donde su mujer estaba haciendo calceta y cuidando el

     puchero, y díjole las siguientes expresiones en tono muy áspero
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y desabrido, después de echarle en la falda las ocho monedas
     de a cuatro duros que ya conocemos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Encarnación,[[#p83n6|&lt;sup&gt;[83-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ahí tienes: compra más trigo, que va a subir

     en los meses mayores,[[#p83n7|&lt;sup&gt;[83-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y procura que lo midan bien. Hazme
     de almorzar mientras yo voy a echar al correo[[#i181|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii181&quot;&gt;(181)&lt;/sup&gt;]] esta carta para
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Sevilla preguntando los precios de la cebada. ¡Que el huevo
     esté bien frito y el chocolate claro! ¡No tengamos la de
     todos los días![[#p83n8|&lt;sup&gt;[83-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La mujer del abogado no respondió palabra, y siguió haciendo
     calceta como un autómata.&lt;/p&gt;

====V====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Dos semanas después, un hermosísimo día de Enero, como

     sólo los hay en el Norte de África y en el Sur de Europa,
     tomaba el sol[[#i182|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii182&quot;&gt;(182)&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la azotea de su casa de dos pisos el maestro
     de capilla de la catedral de Ceuta con la tranquilidad
     de quien ha tocado el órgano en misa mayor y se ha comido
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; luego una libra de boquerones, otra de carne y otra de
     pan, con su correspondiente dosis de vino de Tarifa.[[#p83n9|&lt;sup&gt;[83-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p84&quot; id=&quot;p84&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p84)&lt;/span --&gt;
     El buen músico, gordo como un cebón y colorado como una
     remolacha, digería penosamente, paseando su turbia mirada de
     apoplético por el magnífico panorama del Mediterráneo, y del
     Estrecho de Gibraltar, del maldecido Peñón[[#p84n1|&lt;sup&gt;[84-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que le da nombre,

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; de las cercanas cumbres de Anghera y Benzú[[#p84n2|&lt;sup&gt;[84-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y de las remotas
     nieves del Pequeño Atlas, cuando sintió acelerados pasos en la
     escalera y la argentina voz de su mujer, que gritaba gozosamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bonifacio! ¡Bonifacio! ¡Carta de Ugíjar! ¡Carta de

     tu tío! ¡Y vaya si es gorda![[#p84n4|&lt;sup&gt;[84-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hombre![[#p84n5|&lt;sup&gt;[84-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;respondió el maestro de capilla, girando
     como una esfera o globo terráqueo sobre el punto de su
     redonda individualidad, que descansaba en el asiento.&amp;mdash;¿Qué

     santo se habrá empeñado para que mi tío se acuerde de mí?
     ¡Quince años hace que resido[[#i183|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii183&quot;&gt;(183)&lt;/sup&gt;]] en esta tierra usurpada a Mahoma,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y cata aquí[[#p84n6|&lt;sup&gt;[84-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la primera vez que me escribe aquel abencerraje,[[#p84n7|&lt;sup&gt;[84-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     sin embargo de haberle yo escrito cien veces a él!

     ¡Sin duda me necesita para algo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, dicho esto,[[#p84n8|&lt;sup&gt;[84-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] abrió la epístola (procurando que no la leyese
     la &lt;i&gt;Pepa&lt;/i&gt; de la posdata), y apareció, crujiente y tratando de[[#i184|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii184&quot;&gt;(184)&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; arrollarse por sí propio,[[#p84n9|&lt;sup&gt;[84-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] el amarillento pergamino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué nos envía?&amp;mdash;preguntó entonces la mujer, gaditana[[#p84n10|&lt;sup&gt;[84-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     y rubia por más señas,[[#p84n11|&lt;sup&gt;[84-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y muy agraciada y valiente a pesar de
     sus cuarenta agostos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pepita, no seas tan curiosa!... Yo te lo diré, si debo

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; decírtelo, luego que me entere. ¡Mil veces te he advertido
     que respetes mis cartas!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Advertencia propia de un libertino como tú! En fin,
     ¡despacha! y veamos si yo puedo saber qué papelote[[#p84n12|&lt;sup&gt;[84-12]&lt;/sup&gt;]] te

     manda tu tío. ¡Parece un billete de Banco del otro mundo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; En tanto que[[#p84n13|&lt;sup&gt;[84-13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] su mujer decía aquellas cosas y otras, el
     músico leyó la carta, y maravillóse hasta el extremo de ponerse
     de pie sin esfuerzo alguno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tenía, sin embargo, tal hábito de disimular, que acertó a
     decir muy naturalmente:
              &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p85&quot; id=&quot;p85&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p85)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡Qué tontería! ¡Sin duda está ya chocheando aquel mal
     hombre! ¿Querrás creer que me remite esta hoja de una
     Biblia en hebreo, para que yo busque algún judío que la compre

     imaginándose el muy bobo que darán por ella un dineral?
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Al mismo tiempo...&amp;mdash;añadió para cambiar la conversación
     y guardándose[[#p85n1|&lt;sup&gt;[85-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la faltriquera la carta y el pergamino:&amp;mdash;al
     propio tiempo... me pregunta con mucho interés si tenemos

     hijos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Él no los tiene!...&amp;mdash;observó vivamente Pepita.&amp;mdash;¡Sin
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; duda piensa dejarnos por herederos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡ Más fácil es que al muy avaro se le haya ocurrido heredarnos

     a nosotros!... Pero ¡calla!: están dando las once,
     y yo tengo que afinar el órgano para las vísperas de esta tarde....
     Me voy. Oye, prenda: que la comida esté dispuesta a
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; la una, y que no se te olvide[[#p85n2|&lt;sup&gt;[85-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] echar dos buenas patatas en el
     puchero. ¡Que si tenemos hijos[[#p85n3|&lt;sup&gt;[85-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]!... ¡Vergüenza me da

     de haber de contestarle que no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Escucha! ¡Espera! ¡Oye!&amp;mdash;contestó como un rayo
     la parte contraria....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ya! ¡Ya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Anda, zambombo, tonel, desagradecido![[#p85n4|&lt;sup&gt;[85-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¿Quién te
     habrá amado a ti en el mundo como esta necia, que, con ese
     barrigón y todo, te considera el hombre más hermoso que
     Dios ha criado?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Sí? ¿Me has dicho &lt;i&gt;hermoso&lt;/i&gt;? ¡Pues mira, Pepa&amp;mdash;respondió

     el artista, pensando seguramente en el pergamino
     árabe;&amp;mdash;si mi tío llega a dejarme por heredero, o yo me
     hago[[#i185|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii185&quot;&gt;(185)&lt;/sup&gt;]] rico de cualquier otro modo, te juro llevarte a vivir a la
     plaza de San Antonio de la ciudad de Cádiz, y comprarte más
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; joyas que tiene la Virgen de las Angustias[[#p85n5|&lt;sup&gt;[85-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de Granada! Conque

     hasta luego, pichona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y tirando un pellizco[[#p85n6|&lt;sup&gt;[85-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la barba a la que de antemano
     tenía ya el hoyo en ella, cogió el sombrero y tomó el camino...,&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p86&quot; id=&quot;p86&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p86)&lt;/span --&gt;
     no de la catedral, sino de las callejuelas en que suelen

     vivir las familias moras avecindadas en aquella plaza fuerte.[[#p86n1|&lt;sup&gt;[86-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

===Text===

====VI====
&lt;p&gt; En la más angosta de dichas callejuelas, y a la puerta de
     una muy pobre, pero muy blanqueada casucha, estaba sentado

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; en el suelo, o más bien[[#i186|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii186&quot;&gt;(186)&lt;/sup&gt;]] sobre sus talones, fumando en pipa de
     barro secado al sol, un moro de treinta y cinco a cuarenta años,
     revendedor de huevos y gallinas, que le traían a las puertas de
     Ceuta los campesinos independientes de Sierra-Bullones y
     Sierra-Bermeja, y que él despachaba, a domicilio o en el mercado,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; con una ganancia de ciento por ciento. Vestía chilava[[#p86n2|&lt;sup&gt;[86-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     de lana blanca y jaique[[#p86n3|&lt;sup&gt;[86-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de lana negra, y llamábase entre los
     españoles &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;, y entre los marroquíes
     Admet-ben-Carime-el-Abdoun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tan luego como el moro vió al maestro de capilla levantóse

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y salió a su encuentro, haciéndole grandes zalemas; y, cuando
     estuvieron ya juntos, díjole cautelosamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Querer[[#p86n4|&lt;sup&gt;[86-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] morita? Yo traer mañana cosa meleja; de doce
     años....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Mi mujer no quiere más criadas moras....&amp;mdash;respondió
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; el músico con inusitada dignidad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; se echó a reír.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Además...&amp;mdash;prosiguió D. Bonifacio&amp;mdash;tus endiabladas

     moritas son muy sucias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Lavar....&amp;mdash;respondió el moro, poniéndose en cruz[[#p86n5|&lt;sup&gt;[86-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ladeando la cabeza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Te digo que no quiero moritas!&amp;mdash;prosiguió D. Bonifacio.&amp;mdash;Lo

     que necesito hoy es que tú, que sabes tanto y que
     por tanto saber eres intérprete de la plaza, me traduzcas al
     español este documento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; cogió el pergamino, y a la primera ojeada
     murmuró:

           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p87&quot; id=&quot;p87&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p87)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Estar moro....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ya lo creo que es árabe! Pero quiero saber qué dice,
     y, si no me engañas, te haré un buen regalo... cuando se
     realice el negocio que confio a tu lealtad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; A todo esto, Admet-ben-Carime había pasado ya la vista por
     todo el pergamino y puéstose muy pálido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Ves que se trata de un gran tesoro?&amp;mdash;medio afirmó,
     medio interrogó el maestro de capilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Creer que sí&amp;mdash;tartamudeó el mahometano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Cómo creer? ¡Tu misma turbación lo dice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Perdona....&amp;mdash;replicó &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; sudando a mares.[[#p87n1|&lt;sup&gt;[87-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     &amp;mdash;Haber aquí palabras de árabe moderno, y yo entender. Haber

     otras de árabe antiguo o literario, y yo no entender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué dicen las palabras que entiendes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Decir &lt;i&gt;oro&lt;/i&gt;, decir &lt;i&gt;perlas&lt;/i&gt;, decir &lt;i&gt;maldición de Alah&lt;/i&gt;[[#p87n2|&lt;sup&gt;[87-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....

     Pero yo no entender sentido, explicaciones ni señas. Necesitar
     ver al derwich de Anghera, que estar sabio, y él traducir
     todo. Llevarme yo pergamino hoy, y traer pergamino mañana,
     y no engañar ni robar al señor Tudela. ¡Moro jurar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Así diciendo, cruzó las manos, se las llevó a la boca[[#p87n3|&lt;sup&gt;[87-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y las

     besó fervorosamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reflexionó D. Bonifacio: conoció que para descifrar aquel
     documento tendría que fiarse de algún moro, y que ninguno le
     era tan conocido ni tan afecto como &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;, y accedió
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; a dejarle el manuscrito, bien que bajo reiterados juramentos

     de que al día siguiente estaría de vuelta de Anghera con la
     traducción, y jurándole él, por su parte, que le entregaría lo
     menos[[#p87n4|&lt;sup&gt;[87-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cien duros cuando fuese descubierto el tesoro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Despidiéronse el musulmán y el cristiano, y éste se dirigió,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; no a su casa ni a la catedral, sino a la oficina de un amigo,

     donde escribió la siguiente carta:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «SR. D. MATÍAS DE QUESADA Y SÁNCHEZ[[#p88n1|&lt;sup&gt;[88-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p88&quot; id=&quot;p88&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p88)&lt;/span --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Alpujarra, &lt;i&gt;UGÍJAR&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Mi queridísimo tío:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Gracias a Dios que hemos tenido[[#i187|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii187&quot;&gt;(187)&lt;/sup&gt;]] noticias de usted y de tía
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Encarnación, y que éstas son tan buenas como Josefa y yo
     deseábamos. Nosotros, querido tío, aunque más jóvenes que
     ustedes, estamos muy achacosos y cargados de diez hijos, que

     pronto se quedarán huérfanos y pidiendo limosna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Se burló de usted quien le dijera que el pergamino que me
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ha enviado contenía las señas de un tesoro. He hecho traducirlo
     por persona muy competente, y ha resultado ser una sarta
     de blasfemias contra Nuestro Señor Jesucristo, la Santísima

     Virgen y los santos de la Corte celestial, escritas en versos árabes
     por un perro morisco del marquesado del Cenet durante la
     rebelión de Aben-Humeya.[[#p88n2|&lt;sup&gt;[88-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] En vista de semejante sacrilegio,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y por consejo del señor Penitenciario,[[#p88n3|&lt;sup&gt;[88-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] acabo de quemar tan impío

     testimonio de la perversidad mahometana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Memorias a mi tía: recíbanlas ustedes de Josefa, y mande
     algún socorro a su sobrino, que está en los huesos[[#p88n4|&lt;sup&gt;[88-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por resultas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; del pícaro dolor de estómago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «BONIFACIO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     «CEUTA, 29 de Enero de 1821.»&lt;/p&gt;

====VII====
&lt;p&gt; Al mismo tiempo que el maestro de capilla escribía la precedente

     carta y la echaba al correo, Admet-ben-Carime-el-Abdoun
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; reunía en un envoltorio no muy grande todo su hato y
     ajuar, reducidos a tres jaiques viejos, dos mantas de pelo de cabra,
     un mortero para hacer alcuzcuz,[[#p88n5|&lt;sup&gt;[88-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] un candil[[#p88n6|&lt;sup&gt;[88-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de hierro y una
     olla de cobre llena de pesetas (que desenterró de un rincón del

     patinillo de su casa); cargó con todo ello a su única mujer, esclava,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; odalisca o lo que fuera, más fea que una mala noticia&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p89&quot; id=&quot;p89&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p89)&lt;/span --&gt;
     dicha de pronto[[#p89n1|&lt;sup&gt;[89-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y más sucia que la conciencia de su marido, y
     salióse de Ceuta, diciendo al oficial de guardia de la puerta que

     da[[#i188|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii188&quot;&gt;(188)&lt;/sup&gt;]] al campo moro que se iban a Fez[[#p89n2|&lt;sup&gt;[89-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a mudar de aires por consejo
     de un veterinario. Y como quiera que esta sea la hora,[[#p89n3|&lt;sup&gt;[89-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; después de sesenta años y algunos meses de ausencia, que no se
     haya vuelto a saber de &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; ni en Ceuta, ni en sus cercanías,

     dicho se está[[#p89n4|&lt;sup&gt;[89-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que D. Bonifacio Tudela y González no
     tuvo el gusto de recibir de sus manos la traducción del pergamino,
     ni al día siguiente, ni al otro, ni en toda su vida, que por
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; cierto debió de ser muy corta, puesto que de informes dignos
     de crédito aparece que su adorada Pepita se casó en Marbella

     en terceras nupcias con un tambor mayor asturiano, a quien hizo
     padre de cuatro hijos como cuatro soles, y era otra vez viuda a
     la muerte del Rey absoluto,[[#p89n5|&lt;sup&gt;[89-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] fecha en que ganó por oposición en
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Málaga el destino de matrona aduanera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Con que busquemos nosotros a &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;, y sepamos qué
     fué de él y del interesante pergamino.&lt;/p&gt;

====VIII====
&lt;p&gt; Admet-ben-Carime-el-Abdoun respiró alegremente, y aun

     hizo alguna zapateta,[[#p89n6|&lt;sup&gt;[89-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sin que por eso se le cayesen las mal aseguradas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; zapatillas, tan luego como se vió fuera de los redoblados
     muros de la plaza española y con toda el África[[#p89n7|&lt;sup&gt;[89-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] delante de
     sí....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Porque África, para un verdadero africano como &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;,
     es la tierra de la libertad absoluta; de una libertad anterior
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; y superior a todas las Constituciones e instituciones humanas;
     de una libertad parecida a la de los conejos no caseros y
     demás animales de monte, valle o arenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; África, quiero decir, es la Jauja[[#p89n8|&lt;sup&gt;[89-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de los malhechores, el seguro
     de la impunidad, el campo neutral de los hombres y de las fieras,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; protegido por el calor y la extensión de los desiertos. En&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p90&quot; id=&quot;p90&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p90)&lt;/span --&gt;
     cuanto a los sultanes, reyes y beyes que presumen imperar en

     aquella parte del mundo, y a las autoridades y mílites que los
     representan, puede decirse que vienen a ser, para tales vasallos,
     lo que el cazador para las liebres o para los corzos: un mal encuentro
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; posible, que muy pocos tienen en la vida, y en el cual
     muere uno o no muere: si muere, tal día hizo un año;[[#p90n1|&lt;sup&gt;[90-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y si no

     muere, con poner mucha tierra por medio[[#p90n2|&lt;sup&gt;[90-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no hay que pensar[[#p90n3|&lt;sup&gt;[90-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     más en el asunto. Sirva esta digresión de advertencia a quien
     la necesitare, y prosigamos nosotros nuestra relación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma aquí,[[#p90n4|&lt;sup&gt;[90-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zama!&amp;mdash;dijo el moro a su cansada esposa,

     como si hablase con una acémila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, en lugar de dirigirse al Oeste, o sea hacia el Boquete de
     Anghera, en busca del sabio santón, según había dicho a D.
     Bonifacio, tomó hacia el Sur, por un barranquillo tapado de malezas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y árboles silvestres, que muy luego le llevó al camino de

     Tetuán,[[#p90n5|&lt;sup&gt;[90-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] o bien a la borrosa vereda que, siguiendo las ondulaciones
     de puntas y playas, conduce a Cabo-Negro por el valle
     del Tarajar, por el de los Castillejos, por Monte-Negrón y por
     las lagunas de Río-Azmir, nombres que todo español bien nacido
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; leerá hoy con amor y veneración, y que entonces no se habían

     oído pronunciar todavía en España ni en el resto del mundo
     civilizado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Llegado que hubieron[[#p90n6|&lt;sup&gt;[90-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ben-Carime[[#p90n7|&lt;sup&gt;[90-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y Zama al vallecillo del
     Tarajar, diéronse un punto de descanso a la orilla del arroyuelo

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de agua potable que lo atraviesa, procedente de las alturas de
     Sierra-Bullones; y en aquella tan segura y áspera soledad, que
     parecía recién salida[[#p90n8|&lt;sup&gt;[90-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de manos del Criador y no estrenada
     todavía por el hombre; a la vista de un mar solitario, únicamente
     surcado, tal o cual[[#p90n9|&lt;sup&gt;[90-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] noche de luna, por cárabos de piratas

     o buques oficiales de Europa encargados de perseguirlos,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; la mora se puso a lavarse y peinarse, y el moro sacó el manuscrito
     y volvió a leerlo con tanta emoción como la primera
     vez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Decía así el pergamino árabe:

            &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p91&quot; id=&quot;p91&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p91)&lt;/span --&gt;
     «La bendición de Alah sea con los hombres buenos que lean
     estas letras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «No hay más gloria que la de Alah, de quien Mahoma fué y
     es, en el corazón de los creyentes, profeta y enviado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; «Los hombres que roban la casa del que está en la guerra o
     en el destierro viven bajo la maldición de Alah y de Mahoma,
     y mueren roídos de escarabajos y cucarachas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «¡Bendito sea, pues, Alah, que crió estos y otros bichos para
     que se coman[[#p91n1|&lt;sup&gt;[91-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a los hombres malos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; «Yo soy el caid &lt;i&gt;Hassan-ben-Jussef&lt;/i&gt;, siervo de Alah, aunque
     malamente he sido llamado D. Rodrigo de Acuña por los sucesores
     de los perros cristianos que, haciéndoles fuerza y violando
     solemnes capitulaciones, bautizaron con una escoba, a guisa de
     hisopo, a mis infortunados ascendientes y a otros muchos islamitas

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; de estos reinos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Yo soy capitán bajo el estandarte del que, desde la muerte
     de Aben-Humeya,[[#p91n2|&lt;sup&gt;[91-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] titúlase legítimamente rey de los andaluces,
     Muley-Abdalá-Mahamud-Aben-Aboó, el cual, si no está ya sentado

     en el trono de Granada, es por la traición y cobardía con
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que los moros valencianos han faltado a sus compromisos y juramentos,
     dejando de alzarse al mismo tiempo que los moros
     granadinos contra el tirano común; pero de Alah recibirán el
     pago, y, si somos vencidos nosotros, vencidos serán también
     ellos y expulsados a la postre de España, sin el mérito de haber

     luchado hasta última hora en el campo del honor y en defensa
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de la justicia; y, si somos vencedores, les cortaremos el pescuezo
     y echaremos sus cabezas a los marranos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Yo soy, en fin, el dueño de esta &lt;i&gt;Torre&lt;/i&gt; y de toda la tierra

     que hay a su alrededor, hasta llegar por Occidente al barranco
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; del Zorro y por Oriente al de los Espárragos, el cual debe tal
     nombre a los muchos y muy exquisitos que cultivó allí mi abuelo
     Sidi-Jussef-ben-Jussuf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «La cosa no anda bien. Desde que el mal nacido D. Juan

     de Austria[[#p91n3|&lt;sup&gt;[91-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (confúndalo Alah) vino a combatir contra os&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p92&quot; id=&quot;p92&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p92)&lt;/span --&gt;
     creyentes, prevemos que por ahora vamos a ser derrotados, sin perjuicio
     de que,[[#p92n1|&lt;sup&gt;[92-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] andando los años[[#p92n2|&lt;sup&gt;[92-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] o las centurias, otro Príncipe

     de la sangre del Profeta venga a recobrar el trono de Granada,
     que ha pertenecido setecientos[[#p92n3|&lt;sup&gt;[92-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] años a los moros, y volverá a
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; pertenecerles[[#p92n4|&lt;sup&gt;[92-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cuando Alah quiera, con el mismo título con que
     lo poseyeron antes vándalos y godos, y antes los romanos, y

     antes aquellos otros africanos que se llamaban los cartagineses:[[#p92n5|&lt;sup&gt;[92-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     ¡con el título de la conquista! Pero conozco, vuelvo a decir,
     que por la presente[[#p92n6|&lt;sup&gt;[92-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la cosa anda mal, y que muy pronto tendré
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; que trasladarme a Marruecos con mis cuarenta y tres hijos,

     suponiendo que[[#p92n7|&lt;sup&gt;[92-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] los austriacos no me cojan en la primera batalla
     y me cuelguen de un alcornoque, como yo los colgaría a
     todos ellos si pudiera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «Pues bien:[[#i189|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii189&quot;&gt;(189)&lt;/sup&gt;]] al salir de esta &lt;i&gt;Torre&lt;/i&gt; para emprender la última

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; y decisiva campaña dejo escondidos aquí, en sitio a que no
     podrá llegar nadie sin topar primero con el presente manuscrito,
     todo mi oro, toda mi plata, todas mis perlas; el tesoro de mi
     familia; la hacienda de mis padres, mía y de mis herederos; el
     caudal de que soy dueño y señor por ley divina y humana, como
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; es del ave la pluma que cría, o como son del niño los dientes que

     echa con trabajo, o como son de cada mortal los malos humores
     de cáncer o de lepra que hereda de sus padres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; «¡Detente, por tanto, oh tú, moro, cristiano o judío que, habiéndote
     puesto a derribar esta mi casa, has llegado a descubrir

     el arca de tu prójimo![[#p92n8|&lt;sup&gt;[92-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡No pongas la mano en su caudal!
     ¡No te apoderes de lo ajeno! Aquí no hay nada del
     fisco, nada de dominio público, nada del Estado. El oro de
     las minas podrá pertenecer a quien lo descubra, y una parte de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; él al Rey del territorio. Pero el oro fundido y acuñado, el

     dinero, la moneda, es de su dueño, y nada más que[[#p92n9|&lt;sup&gt;[92-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de su dueño.

====IX====
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; quedó profundamente preocupado con la nueva

     lectura de este documento, no por las máximas morales y por
     las espantosas maldiciones que contenía, pues el pícaro había
     perdido la fe en Alah y en Mahoma de resultas de[[#p93n5|&lt;sup&gt;[93-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] su frecuente
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; trato con los cristianos y judíos de Tetuán y Ceuta, que, naturalmente,
     se reían del Corán,[[#p93n6|&lt;sup&gt;[93-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sino por creer que su cara, su

     acento y algún otro signo musulmán de su persona le impedían
     trasladarse a España, donde se vería expuesto a muerte segura
     tan luego como cualquier cristiano o cristiana descubriese en él
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; a un enemigo de la Virgen María.
            &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p94&quot; id=&quot;p94&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p94)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Además, ¿qué apoyo (a juicio de &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;) podría hallar

     en las leyes ni en las autoridades de España un extranjero,
     un mahometano, un semi-salvaje, para adquirir la &lt;i&gt;Torre de Zoraya&lt;/i&gt;,
     para hacer excavaciones en ella, para entrar en posesión
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; del tesoro o para no perderlo inmediatamente con la vida?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No hay remedio!&amp;mdash;díjose por remate de largas reflexiones.&amp;mdash;¡Tengo

     que confiarme al &lt;i&gt;renegado&lt;/i&gt; ben-Munuza! Él es
     español, y su compaña[[#p94n1|&lt;sup&gt;[94-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] me librará de todo peligro en aquella
     tierra. Pero como no existe bajo la capa del cielo un hombre
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; de peor alma que el tal renegado, no me estará de más[[#p94n2|&lt;sup&gt;[94-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] tomar

     algunas precauciones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y en virtud de esta cavilación sacó del bolsillo avíos de escribir,
     redactó una carta, púsole el sobre, pególo con un poco de
     pan mascado, y echóse a reír de una manera diabólica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; En seguida fijó los ojos en su mujer, que continuaba haciendo

     la policía de todo un año a costa de la limpieza física y...
     moral del malaventurado arroyuelo, y, llamándola por medio de
     un silbido, dignóse hablarle de este modo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Cara de higo chumbo, siéntate a mi lado y óyeme....
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Luego[[#p94n3|&lt;sup&gt;[94-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] acabarás de lavarte, que bien lo necesitas, y puede que[[#p94n4|&lt;sup&gt;[94-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     entonces te juzgue merecedora de algo mejor que la paliza diaria
     con que te demuestro mi cariño. Por de pronto,[[#p94n5|&lt;sup&gt;[94-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sinvergüenzona,[[#p94n6|&lt;sup&gt;[94-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     déjate de monadas y entérate bien de lo que voy a
     decirte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; La mora, que, lavada y peinada, resultaba más joven y artística,
     aunque no menos fea que antes, se relamió como una gata,
     clavó en &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; los dos carbunclos que le servían de ojos,
     y díjole, mostrando sus blanquísimos y anchos dientes, que nada
     tenían de humanos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Habla, mi señor; que tu esclava sólo desea servirte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; continuó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Si desde este momento en adelante llega a ocurrirme alguna
     desgracia, o desaparezco del mundo sin haberme despedido de

     ti, o, habiéndome despedido, no tienes noticias mías en seis&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p95&quot; id=&quot;p95&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p95)&lt;/span --&gt;
     semanas, procura volver a entrar en Ceuta y echa esta carta al
     correo. ¿Te has enterado bien, cara de mona?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Zama rompió a llorar, y exclamó:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Admet! ¿Piensas dejarme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No rebuznes, mujer!&amp;mdash;contestó el moro.&amp;mdash;¿Quién habla
     ahora de eso? ¡Demasiado sabes que me gustas y que me
     sirves! Pero de lo que[[#p95n1|&lt;sup&gt;[95-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ahora se trata es de que te hayas enterado
     bien de mi encargo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Trae!&amp;mdash;dijo la mora, apoderándose de la carta, abriéndose
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; el justillo y colocándola entre él y su gordo y pardo seno,
     al lado del corazón.&amp;mdash;Si algo malo llega a sucederte, esta carta
     caerá en el correo de Ceuta, aunque después caiga yo en la
     sepultura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Aben-Carime sonrió humanamente al oír aquellas palabras, y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; dignóse mirar a su mujer como a una persona.&lt;/p&gt;

====X====
&lt;p&gt; Mucho y muy regaladamente debió de dormir aquella noche

     el matrimonio agareno[[#p95n2|&lt;sup&gt;[95-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] entre los matorrales del camino, pues
     no serían menos de las nueve de la siguiente mañana cuando
     llegó al pie de Cabo-Negro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Hay allí un &lt;i&gt;aduar&lt;/i&gt; de pastores y labriegos árabes, llamado

     «Medik», compuesto de algunas chozas, de un morabito o ermita
     mahometana, y de un pozo de agua potable, con su brocal de
     piedra y su acetre de cobre, como los que figuran en algunas
     escenas bíblicas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; El &lt;i&gt;aduar&lt;/i&gt; se hallaba completamente solo en aquel momento.

     Todos sus habitantes habían salido ya con el ganado o con los
     aperos de labor a los vecinos montes y cañadas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Espérame aquí...&amp;mdash;dijo &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; a su mujer.&amp;mdash;Yo
     voy á buscar a ben-Munuza, que debe de hallarse al otro

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; lado de aquel cerro arando los pobres secanos que allí posee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ben-Munuza!&amp;mdash;exclamó Zama con terror.&amp;mdash;¡El renegado
     de quien me has dicho....&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p96&quot; id=&quot;p96&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p96)&lt;/span --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Descuida....&amp;mdash;interrumpió &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;mdash; ¡Hoy

     puedo yo más que él! Dentro de un par de horas estaré de
     vuelta, y verás cómo se viene[[#p96n1|&lt;sup&gt;[96-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] detrás de mí con la humildad de
     un perro. Esta es su choza.... Aguárdanos en ella, y haznos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; una buena ración de alcuzcuz[[#p96n2|&lt;sup&gt;[96-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con el maíz y la manteca

     que hallarás a mano. ¡Ya sabes que me gusta muy recocido![[#p96n3|&lt;sup&gt;[96-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     ¡Ah! Se me olvidaba[[#i190|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii190&quot;&gt;(190)&lt;/sup&gt;]].... Si ves que anochece y no he bajado,

====XI====
&lt;p&gt; Pasada la cumbre, no tardó en descubrir en la cañada próxima
     a un corpulento moro vestido de blanco, el cual araba patriarcalmente

     la negruzca tierra con auxilio de una hermosa
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; yunta de bueyes. Parecía aquel hombre la estatua de la Paz
     tallada en mármol. Y, sin embargo, era el triste y temido &lt;i&gt;renegado&lt;/i&gt;
     ben-Munuza, cuya historia os causará espanto cuando la
     conozcáis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Contentaos por lo pronto[[#i192|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii192&quot;&gt;(192)&lt;/sup&gt;]] con saber que tendría cuarenta años,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; y que era rudo, fuerte, ágil y de muy lúgubre fisonomía, bien
     que sus ojos fuesen azules como el cielo y rubias sus barbas
     como aquel sol de África que había dorado a fuego[[#p96n5|&lt;sup&gt;[96-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la primitiva

     blancura europea de su semblante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Buenos días, &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;mdash;gritó en castellano el antiguo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; español, tan luego como divisó al marroquí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y su voz expresó la alegría melancólica propia del extranjero

     que halla ocasión de hablar la lengua patria.
              &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p97&quot; id=&quot;p97&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p97)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡Buenos días, Juan Falgueira!&amp;mdash;respondió sarcásticamente
     ben-Carime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El renegado tembló de pies a cabeza al oír semejante saludo,

     y sacó del arado la reja de hierro como para defender su vida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué nombre acabas de pronunciar?&amp;mdash;añadió luego,
     avanzando hacia &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Éste lo aguardaba riéndose, y le respondió en árabe, con un

     valor de que nadie le hubiera creído capaz:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;He pronunciado... tu verdadero nombre: el nombre
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; que llevabas en España cuando eras cristiano, y que yo conozco
     desde que estuve en Orán[[#p97n1|&lt;sup&gt;[97-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] hace tres años....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿En Orán?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡En Orán, sí, señor!... ¿Qué tiene eso de extraordinario?
     De allí habías venido tú a Marruecos,[[#p97n2|&lt;sup&gt;[97-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y allí fuí yo a comprar
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; gallinas. Allí pregunté tu historia, dando tus señas, y allí

     me la contaron varios españoles. Supe,[[#p97n3|&lt;sup&gt;[97-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por tanto, que eras
     gallego, que te llamabas Juan Falgueira, y que te habías escapado
     de la Cárcel Alta de Granada, donde estabas ya en
     capilla para ir a la horca por resultas de[[#p97n4|&lt;sup&gt;[97-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] haber robado y dado

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; muerte, hace quince años, a unos señores a quienes servías en
     clase de mulero.... ¿Dudarás ahora de que te conozco
     perfectamente?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dime, alma mía...&amp;mdash;respondió el renegado con voz
     sorda y mirando a su alrededor&amp;mdash;¿y has contado eso a algún

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; marroquí? ¿Lo sabe alguien más que tú en esta condenada
     tierra? Porque es el caso que yo quiero vivir en paz, sin que
     nadie ni nada me recuerde aquella mala hora, que harto he
     purgado. Soy pobre; no tengo familia, ni patria, ni lengua, ni
     el Dios que me crió. Vivo entre enemigos, sin más capital
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; que estos bueyes y que esos secanos, comprados a fuerza de[[#p97n5|&lt;sup&gt;[97-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     diez años de sudores.... Por consiguiente, haces muy mal
     en venir a decirme....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Espera!&amp;mdash;respondióle muy alarmado &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;No
     me eches esas miradas de lobo, que vengo a hacerte un&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p98&quot; id=&quot;p98&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p98)&lt;/span --&gt;

     gran favor, y no a ofenderte por mero capricho. ¡A nadie he
     contado tu desgraciada historia! ¿Para qué? ¡Todo secreto
     puede ser un tesoro, y quien lo cuenta se queda sin él! Hay,
     empero, ocasiones en que se hacen &lt;i&gt;cambios de secretos&lt;/i&gt; sumamente
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; útiles. Por ejemplo: yo te voy a contar un importante

     secreto mío, que te servirá como de fianza del tuyo, y que nos
     obligará a ser amigos toda la vida....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Te oigo. Concluye....&amp;mdash;respondió calmosamente el
     renegado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Aben-Carime leyóle entonces el pergamino árabe, que Juan

     Falgueira oyó sin pestañear y como enojado; visto lo cual[[#p98n1|&lt;sup&gt;[98-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     por el moro, y a fin de acabar de atraerse su confianza, le
     reveló también que había robado aquel documento a un cristiano
     de Ceuta....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; El español se sonrió ligeramente al pensar en el mucho

     miedo que debía de tenerle[[#i193|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii193&quot;&gt;(193)&lt;/sup&gt;]] el mercader de huevos y de
     gallinas cuando le contaba sin necesidad aquel robo, y, animado
     el pobre &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; con la sonrisa de ben-Munuza,
     entró al fin en el fondo del asunto, hablando de la siguiente
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; manera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Supongo que te has hecho cargo[[#p98n2|&lt;sup&gt;[98-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de la importancia de
     este documento y de la razón por qué te lo he leído. Yo no
     sé dónde está la &lt;i&gt;Torre de Zoraya&lt;/i&gt;, ni &lt;i&gt;Aldeire&lt;/i&gt;, ni el &lt;i&gt;Cenet&lt;/i&gt;: yo

     no sabría ir a España, ni caminar por ella; y, además, allí me
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; matarían por no ser cristiano, o, cuando menos,[[#p98n3|&lt;sup&gt;[98-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] me robarían
     el tesoro antes o después de descubierto.[[#p98n4|&lt;sup&gt;[98-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Por todas estas
     razones necesito que me acompañe un español fiel y leal, de

     cuya vida sea yo dueño y a quien pueda hacer ahorcar con
     media palabra; un español, en fin, como tú, Juan Falgueira, que,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; después de todo, nada adelantaste con robar ni matar, pues
     trabajas aquí como un asno, cuando con los millones que voy a
     proporcionarte podrás irte a América, a Francia, a la India, y
     gozar, y triunfar, y subir tal vez hasta rey.[[#p98n5|&lt;sup&gt;[98-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¿Qué te parece

     mi proyecto?[[#p98n6|&lt;sup&gt;[98-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
              &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p99&quot; id=&quot;p99&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p99)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Que está bien hilado, como obra de un moro....&amp;mdash;respondió
     ben-Munuza, de cuyas recias manos, cruzadas sobre
     la rabadilla, pendía, balanceándose, la barra de hierro a la

     manera de la cola de un tigre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt; se sonrió ufanamente, creyendo aceptada su
     proposición.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sin embargo....&amp;mdash;añadió después el sombrío gallego.&amp;mdash;Tú

     no has caído en una cuenta[[#p99n1|&lt;sup&gt;[99-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿En cuál?&amp;mdash;preguntó cómicamente ben-Carime, alzando
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; mucho la cara y no mirando a parte alguna, como quien se
     dispone a oír sandeces y majaderías.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Tú no has caído en que yo sería tonto de capirote[[#p99n2|&lt;sup&gt;[99-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] si
     me marchase contigo a España a ponerte en posesión de...
     medio tesoro, contando con que tú me pondrías a mí en posesión
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; del otro medio! Lo digo porque no tendrías más que

     pronunciar media palabra el día que llegásemos a Aldeire y te
     creyeses libre de peligros, para zafarte de mi compañía y de
     darme la mitad de las halladas riquezas.... ¡En verdad que
     no eres tan listo como te figuras, sino un pobre hombre, digno
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de lástima, que te has metido en un callejón sin salida al descubrirme
     las señas de ese gran tesoro y decirme al mismo tiempo

     que conoces mi historia, y que, si yo fuera contigo a España,
     serías dueño absoluto de mi vida!... Pues ¿para qué te
     necesito yo a ti? ¿Qué falta me hace tu ayuda para ir a apoderarme
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt;  del tesoro entero? ¿Ni[[#p99n3|&lt;sup&gt;[99-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] qué falta me haces en el
     mundo? ¿Quién eres tú, desde el momento en que me has

     leído ese pergamino, desde el momento en que puedo quitártelo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Qué dices?&amp;mdash;gritó &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;, sintiendo de pronto
     circular por todos sus huesos el frío de la muerte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;No digo nada....  ¡Toma!&amp;mdash;respondió Juan Falgueira,

     asestando un terrible golpe con la barra de hierro sobre
     la cabeza de ben-Carime, el cual rodó en tierra, echando sangre
     por ojos, narices y boca, y sin poder articular palabra....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El desgraciado estaba muerto.&lt;/p&gt;

====XII====&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p100&quot; id=&quot;p100&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p100)&lt;/span --&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Tres o cuatro semanas después de la muerte de &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas,&lt;/i&gt;
     el veintitantos[[#p100n1|&lt;sup&gt;[100-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de Febrero de 1821, nevaba si había
     que nevar[[#p100n2|&lt;sup&gt;[100-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la villa de Aldeire y en toda la elegantísima

     sierra andaluza,[[#p100n3|&lt;sup&gt;[100-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a que la propia nieve da vida y nombre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Era domingo de Carnaval, y la campana de la iglesia llamaba
     por cuarta vez a misa, con su voz delgada y pura como la de un
     niño, a los ateridos cristianos de aquella feligresía demasiado

     próxima al cielo, los cuales no se resignaban fácilmente, en día
     tan crudo y desapacible, a dejar la cama o a separarse de los
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; tizones, alegando acaso, como pretexto, que «los días de Carnestolendas
     no se debe rendir culto a Dios, sino al diablo.»&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Algo semejante decía por lo menos el tío Juan Gómez a su

     piadosa mujer, la seña[[#p100n4|&lt;sup&gt;[100-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Torcuata, defendiéndose, en el rincón
     del fuego, de los argumentos con que nuestra amiga le rogaba
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; que no bebiera más aguardiente ni comiese más roscos, sino
     que la acompañase a misa, a fuer de buen cristiano, sin miedo
     alguno a las críticas del maestro de escuela y demás electores

     liberales; y muy enredada estaba la disputa cuando cata aquí[[#p100n5|&lt;sup&gt;[100-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     que entró en la cocina el tío Jenaro, mayoral de los pastores
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de su merced, y dijo, quitándose el sombrero y rascándose la
     cabeza, todo de un solo golpe:[[#p100n6|&lt;sup&gt;[100-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Buenos días nos dé Dios, señor Juan y señá Torcuata!

     Ya se harán ustedes cargo[[#p100n7|&lt;sup&gt;[100-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de que algo habrá sucedido por
     allá arriba para que yo baje por aquí con tan mal tiempo, no
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; tocándome oír misa este domingo. ¿Cómo va de salud?[[#i194|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii194&quot;&gt;(194)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vaya! ¡vaya! ¡no espero más!&amp;mdash;exclamó la mujer del

     alcalde, cruzándose la mantilla[[#p100n8|&lt;sup&gt;[100-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con violencia.&amp;mdash;¡Estaría de
     Dios[[#p100n9|&lt;sup&gt;[100-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que hoy echases la misa en el puchero![[#p100n10|&lt;sup&gt;[100-10]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ¡Ya tienes
     ahí conversación y copas para todo el día, sobre si[[#p100n11|&lt;sup&gt;[100-11]&lt;/sup&gt;]] las

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; cabras están preñadas o sobre si los borregos han echado
     cuernos!
           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p101&quot; id=&quot;p101&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p101)&lt;/span --&gt;
     ¡Te condenarás, Juan; te condenarás si no haces pronto las
     paces con la Iglesia dejando la maldita alcaldía!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Marchado que se hubo[[#p101n1|&lt;sup&gt;[101-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la seña Torcuata, el Alcalde alargó
     un rosco y una copa al mayoral, y le dijo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Simplezas de mujeres, tío Jenaro! Arrímese usted a la
     lumbre y hable. ¿Qué ocurre por allá arriba?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pues nada! que ayer tarde el cabrero Francisco vió que
     un hombre, vestido a la[[#i195|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii195&quot;&gt;(195)&lt;/sup&gt;]] malagueña, con pantalón largo y chaquetilla
     de lienzo, y liado en una manta de muestra,[[#p101n2|&lt;sup&gt;[101-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se había
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; metido en el &lt;i&gt;corral nuevo&lt;/i&gt; por la parte que todavía no tiene

     tapia, y rondaba la &lt;i&gt;Torre del Moro&lt;/i&gt;, estudiándola y midiéndola
     come si fuese un maestro de obras.[[#p101n3|&lt;sup&gt;[101-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Preguntóle Francisco qué
     significaba aquello, y el forastero le interrogó a su vez[[#i196|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii196&quot;&gt;(196)&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;quién era el
     dueño de la Torre&lt;/i&gt;; y como Francisco le dijese que &lt;i&gt;nada menos

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; que el Alcalde del pueblo&lt;/i&gt;, repuso que él hablaría a la noche con
     su merced y le explicaría sus planes. Llegó presto la noche,
     y el hombre hizo como que se marchaba,[[#p101n4|&lt;sup&gt;[101-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con lo que el cabrero
     se encerró en su choza, que, como sabe usted, dista[[#i197|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii197&quot;&gt;(197)&lt;/sup&gt;]] poco de

     allí. Dos horas después de obscurecer enteramente notó el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; mismo Francisco que en la Torre sonaban ruidos muy raros y
     se veía luz, lo cual le llenó de tal miedo que ni tan siquiera[[#p101n5|&lt;sup&gt;[101-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se
     atrevió a ir a mi choza a avisarme; cosa que hizo en cuanto
     fué de día,[[#p101n6|&lt;sup&gt;[101-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] refiriéndome el lance de ayer tarde, y advirtiéndome

     que los tales ruidos[[#p101n7|&lt;sup&gt;[101-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] habían durado toda la noche.
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Como yo soy viejo, y he servido al Rey, y me asusto de pocas
     cosas, me plantifiqué en seguida en la &lt;i&gt;Torre del Moro&lt;/i&gt; acompañado
     de Francisco, que iba temblando, y encontramos al forastero

     liado en su manta y durmiendo en un cuartucho[[#p101n8|&lt;sup&gt;[101-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del piso
     bajo, que tiene todavía su bóveda de hormigón. Desperté al
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; sospechoso personaje, y le reconvine por haber pasado la noche
     en la casa ajena sin la voluntad de su dueño; a lo que me
     respondió que aquello no era casa, sino un montón de escombros,

     donde bien podía haberse albergado un pobre caminante
     en noche de nieves, y que estaba dispuesto a presentarse a&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p102&quot; id=&quot;p102&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p102)&lt;/span --&gt;
     usted y a explicarle quién era y todas sus operaciones y pensamientos.
     Le he hecho, pues, venir conmigo, y en la puerta del
     corral aguarda, acompañado del cabrero, a que usted le dé

     licencia para entrar....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Que entre!&amp;mdash;respondió el tío Hormiga, levantándose
     muy alterado por habérsele ocurrido, desde las primeras palabras
     del mayoral, que todo aquello tenía bastante que ver con
     el célebre &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt;, a cuyo hallazgo por sus solos esfuerzos había

     renunciado su merced hacía una semana, después de arrancar
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; antes inútilmente muchas y muy pesadas piedras de sillería.&lt;/p&gt;

====XIII====
&lt;p&gt; Tenemos ya cara a cara y solos al tío Juan Gómez y al

     forastero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Cómo se llama usted?&amp;mdash;interrogó el primero al segundo
     con todo el imperio de un Alcalde de monterilla[[#p102n1|&lt;sup&gt;[102-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y sin invitarle
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; a que se sentara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Llámome Jaime Olot&amp;mdash;respondió el hombre misterioso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Su habla de usted no me parece de esta tierra!...&amp;mdash;¿Es
     usted inglés?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Soy catalán.[[#p102n2|&lt;sup&gt;[102-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Hombre! ¡Catalán!... Me parece bien. Y...
     ¿qué le trae a usted por aquí? Sobre todo, ¿qué diablos de
     medidas tomaba usted ayer en mi &lt;i&gt;Torre&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Le diré a usted. Yo soy minero de oficio, y he venido a

     buscar trabajo a esta tierra, famosa por sus minas de cobre y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; plata. Ayer tarde, al pasar por la &lt;i&gt;Torre del Moro&lt;/i&gt;, vi que con
     las piedras de ella extraídas estaban construyendo una tapia, y
     que aun sería necesario derribar o arrancar otras muchas para
     terminar el cercado.... Yo me pinto solo[[#p102n3|&lt;sup&gt;[102-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en esto de demoler,

     ya sea dando barrenos, ya por medio de mis propios
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; puños, pues tengo más fuerza que un buey, y ocurrióseme la
     idea de tomar a mi cargo, por contrata, la total destrucción de&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p103&quot; id=&quot;p103&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p103)&lt;/span --&gt;
     la &lt;i&gt;Torre&lt;/i&gt; y el arranque de sus cimientos, suponiendo que llegase

     a entenderme con el propietario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El tío Hormiga guiñó sus ojillos grises, y respondió con
     mucha sorna:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues, señor; no me conviene la contrata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Es que[[#p103n1|&lt;sup&gt;[103-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] haré todo ese trabajo por muy poco precio, casi

     de balde....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Ahora me conviene mucho menos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El llamado Jaime Olot paró mientes[[#p103n2|&lt;sup&gt;[103-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la soflama del tío
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Juan Gómez, y miróle &lt;i&gt;a fondo&lt;/i&gt; como para adivinar el sentido

     de aquella rara contestación; pero, no logrando leer nada en
     la fisonomía zorruna de su merced, parecióle oportuno añadir
     con fingida naturalidad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Tampoco dejaría de agradarme[[#p103n3|&lt;sup&gt;[103-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] recomponer parte de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; aquel antiguo edificio y vivir en él cultivando el terreno que

     destina usted a corral de ganado. ¡Le compro a[[#i198|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii198&quot;&gt;(198)&lt;/sup&gt;]] usted, pues,
     la &lt;i&gt;Torre del Moro&lt;/i&gt; y el secano que la circunda!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No me conviene vender&amp;mdash;respondió el tío Hormiga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Es que le pagaré a usted el doble de lo que aquello

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; valga!&amp;mdash;observó enfáticamente el que se decía catalán.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Por esa razón me conviene menos!&amp;mdash;repitió el andaluz
     con tan insultante socarronería, que su interlocutor dió un paso
     atrás, como quien conoce que pisa terreno falso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reflexionó, pues, un momento, pasado el cual alzó la cabeza
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; con entera resolución, echó los brazos a la espalda[[#p103n4|&lt;sup&gt;[103-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y dijo, riéndose
     cínicamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Luego sabe usted que en aquel terreno hay un &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El tío Juan Gómez se agachó, sentado como estaba; y,
     mirando al catalán de abajo arriba, exclamó donosísimamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Lo que me choca es que lo sepa usted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pues mucho más le chocaría si le dijese que soy yo el
     único que lo sabe de cierto![[#i199|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii199&quot;&gt;(199)&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Es decir que conoce usted el punto fijo en que se halla
     sepultado el tesoro?
                 &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p104&quot; id=&quot;p104&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p104)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;Conozco el punto fijo, y no tardaría veinticuatro horas en
     desenterrar tanta riqueza como allí duerme a la sombra....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Según eso, ¿tiene usted cierto documento?...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Sí, señor; tengo un pergamino del tiempo de los moros,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; de media vara en cuadro..., en que todo eso se explica....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dígame usted; ¿y ese pergamino?...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No lo llevo sobre mi persona, ni hay para qué, supuesto

     que me lo sé[[#p104n1|&lt;sup&gt;[104-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de memoria al pie de la letra[[#p104n2|&lt;sup&gt;[104-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en español y en
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; árabe.... ¡Oh! ¡no soy yo tan bobo que me entregue
     nunca con armas y bagajes! Así es que antes de presentarme
     en estas tierras escondí el pergamino... donde nadie más

     que yo podrá dar con él.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pues entonces no hay más que hablar! Señor Jaime
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Olot, entendámonos como dos buenos amigos...&amp;mdash;exclamó
     el Alcalde, echando al forastero una copa de aguardiente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Entendámonos!&amp;mdash;repitió el forastero, sentándose sin

     más permiso y bebiéndose la copa en toda regla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dígame usted&amp;mdash;continuó el tío Hormiga,&amp;mdash;y dígamelo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; sin mentir, para que yo me acostumbre a creer en su formalidad....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Vaya usted preguntando, que yo me callaré cuando me

     convenga ocultar alguna cosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Viene usted de Madrid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;No, señor. Hace veinticinco años que estuve en la corte
     por primera y última vez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Viene usted de Tierra Santa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, señor. No me da por ahí.[[#p104n3|&lt;sup&gt;[104-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿Conoce usted a un abogado de Ugíjar llamado D. Matías
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; de Quesada?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;No, señor; yo detesto a los abogados y a toda la gente

     de pluma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Pues, entonces, ¿cómo ha llegado a poder de usted ese
     pergamino?
             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p105&quot; id=&quot;p105&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p105)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Jaime Olot guardó silencio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Eso me gusta! ¡veo que no quiere usted mentir!&amp;mdash;exclamó
     el Alcalde.&amp;mdash;Pero también es cierto que D. Matías de
     Quesada me engañó como a un chino,[[#p105n1|&lt;sup&gt;[105-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] robándome dos onzas
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; de oro, y vendiendo luego aquel documento a alguna persona

     de Melilla[[#p105n2|&lt;sup&gt;[105-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] o de Ceuta.... ¡Por cierto que, aunque usted
     no es moro, tiene facha de haber estado por allá!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No se fatigue usted ni pierda el tiempo! Yo le sacaré
     a usted de dudas. Ese abogado debió de enviar el manuscrito
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; a un español de Ceuta, al cual se lo robó hace tres semanas el

     moro que me lo ha traspasado a mí....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Toma! ¡ya caigo![[#i200|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii200&quot;&gt;(200)&lt;/sup&gt;]] Se lo enviaría a un sobrino que
     tiene de músico[[#p105n3|&lt;sup&gt;[105-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en aquella catedral..., a un tal Bonifacio
     de Tudela....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Puede ser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Pícaro D. Matías! ¡Estafar de ese modo a su compadre![[#p105n4|&lt;sup&gt;[105-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     ¡Pero véase cómo la casualidad ha vuelto a traer el
     pergamino a mis manos!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Dirá usted a las mías...&amp;mdash;observó el forastero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡A las nuestras!&amp;mdash;replicó el Alcalde, echando más
     aguardiente.&amp;mdash;¡Pues, señor! ¡somos millonarios! Partiremos
     el tesoro mitad por mitad, dado que[[#p105n5|&lt;sup&gt;[105-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ni usted puede excavar
     en aquel terreno sin mi licencia, ni yo puedo hallar el

     tesoro sin auxilio del pergamino que ha llegado a ser de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; usted.  Es decir, que la suerte nos ha hecho hermanos.
     ¡Desde hoy vivirá usted en mi casa!  ¡Vaya otra copa!
     Y, en seguidita que almorcemos,[[#p105n6|&lt;sup&gt;[105-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] daremos principio[[#i201|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii201&quot;&gt;(201)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a las
     excavaciones....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Por aquí iba la conferencia cuando la señá Torcuata volvió
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; de misa. Su marido le refirió todo lo que pasaba y le hizo la
     presentación del señor Jaime Olot. La buena mujer oyó con
     tanto miedo como alegría la noticia de que el &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt; estaba a

     punto de parecer; santiguóse repetidas veces[[#i202|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii202&quot;&gt;(202)&lt;/sup&gt;]] al enterarse de la
     traición y vileza de su compadre D. Matías de Quesada, y miró&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p106&quot; id=&quot;p106&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p106)&lt;/span --&gt;
     con susto al forastero, cuya fisonomía le hizo presentir grandes
     infortunios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sabedora, en fin, de que tenía que dar de almorzar a aquel

     hombre, entró en la despensa a sacar de lo más precioso y
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; reservado que contenía, o sea lomo en adobo y longaniza
     de la reciente matanza, no sin decirse mientras destapaba las
     respectivas orzas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Tiempo es de que parezca el &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt;; pues, entre si

     parece o no parece,[[#p106n1|&lt;sup&gt;[106-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] nos lleva de coste los treinta y dos duros
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; de la famosa jícara de chocolate, la antigua amistad del compadre
     D. Matías, estas hermosas tajadas, que tan ricas habrían
     estado con pimientos y tomates en el mes de Agosto, y el tener
     de huésped a un forastero de tan mala cara. ¡Malditos sean

     los tesoros, y las minas, y los diablos, y todo lo que está debajo
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; de tierra, menos el agua y los fieles difuntos!&lt;/p&gt;

====XIV====
&lt;p&gt; Pensando estaba así la señá Torcuata, y ya se dirigía a las

     hornillas con una sartén en cada mano, cuando se oyeron sonar
     en la calle gritos y silbidos de viejas y chicuelos, y voces de
     gente más formal que decía:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Señor Alcalde! ¡Abra usted la puerta! ¡La Justicia
     de la ciudad está entrando en el pueblo con mucha tropa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jaime Olot se puso más amarillo que la cera al oír aquellas
     palabras, y dijo, cruzando las manos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Escóndame usted, señor Alcalde! ¡De lo contrario,[[#p106n2|&lt;sup&gt;[106-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; tendremos tesoro! ¡La justicia viene en mi busca!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¿En busca de usted? ¿Por qué razón? ¿Es usted algún
     criminal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bien lo decía yo!&amp;mdash;gritó la tía Torcuata.&amp;mdash;¡De esa
     cara triste no podía venir nada bueno! ¡Todo esto es cosa
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; de Lucifer!

          &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p107&quot; id=&quot;p107&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p107)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡Pronto! ¡pronto!&amp;mdash;añadió el forastero.&amp;mdash;¡Sáqueme
     usted por la puerta del corral!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Bien! Pero déme usted antes las señas del tesoro....&amp;mdash;expuso
     el tío Hormiga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;Señor Alcalde....&amp;mdash;seguían diciendo los que llamaban[[#i203|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii203&quot;&gt;(203)&lt;/sup&gt;]] a
     la puerta. &amp;mdash;¡Abra usted! ¡El pueblo está cercado! ¡Parece
     que buscan a ese hombre que habla con usted hace una
     hora!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Abrid al Juzgado de primera instancia![[#p107n1|&lt;sup&gt;[107-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;gritó por
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; último una voz imperiosa, acompañada de fuertes golpes
     dados a la puerta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡No hay remedio!&amp;mdash;dijo el Alcalde, yendo a abrir, mientras

     que el forastero se encaminaba por la otra puerta en busca
     del corral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Pero el mayoral y el cabrero, advertidos de todo, le cerraron
     el paso, y entre ellos y los soldados, que ya penetraban también
     por aquella puerta, lo cogieron y ataron sin contratiempo

     alguno, aunque aquel diablo de hombre desplegó en la lucha
     las fuerzas y la agilidad de un tigre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; El alguacil del Juzgado, a cuyas órdenes iban un escribano y
     veinte soldados de infantería, contaba entre tanto al despavorido
     Alcalde las causas y fundamentos de aquella prisión tan

     aparatosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;Ese hombre&amp;mdash;decía&amp;mdash;con quien usted estaba encerrado...
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; no sé por qué, hablando de... no sé qué asunto, es el
     célebre gallego Juan Falgueira, que degolló y robó hace quince
     años a unos señores, de quienes era mulero, en cierta casería

     de la vega de Granada, y que se escapó de la capilla la víspera
     de la ejecución vestido con el hábito del fraile que lo auxiliaba,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; a quien dejó allí medio estrangulado. El mismísimo Rey
     (q.D.g.[[#p107n2|&lt;sup&gt;[107-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] recibió hace quince días una carta de Ceuta,
     firmada por un moro llamado &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;, en que le decía

     que Juan Falgueira, después de haber residido largo tiempo en&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p108&quot; id=&quot;p108&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p108)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Orán y otros puntos de África, iba a embarcarse para España,
     y que sería fácil echarle mano[[#p108n1|&lt;sup&gt;[108-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en Aldeire del Cenet,
     pensaba comprar una torre de moros y dedicarse a la minería....
     Al propio tiempo el Cónsul español en Tetuán escribía a

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; nuestro Gobierno participándole que una mora llamada Zama
     se le había presentado quejándose de que el renegado español
     ben-Munuza, antes Juan Falgueira, acababa de embarcarse
     para España después de asesinar al moro &lt;i&gt;Manos-gordas&lt;/i&gt;, marido
     de la querellante, y de haberle robado cierto precioso pergamino....

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Por todo ello, y muy principalmente por el atentado
     contra el fraile en la capilla, S.M. el Rey ha recomendado
     con particular encarecimiento a la Chancillería[[#p108n2|&lt;sup&gt;[108-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] de Granada la
     captura del tal facineroso y su inmediata ejecución en aquella
     misma capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Imagínese el que leyere el espanto y asombro de todos los
     que oyeron esta relación, así como la angustia del tío Hormiga,
     a quien no podía caber ya duda de que el pergamino estaba en
     poder de aquel hombre ¡sentenciado a muerte!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Atrevióse, pues, el codicioso Alcalde, aun a riesgo de comprometerse

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; más de lo que[[#i204|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii204&quot;&gt;(204)&lt;/sup&gt;]] ya estaba, a llamar a un lado a Juan
     Falgueira y a hablarle al oído,[[#i205|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii205&quot;&gt;(205)&lt;/sup&gt;]] bien que anunciando antes al
     concurso que iba a ver si lograba que confesase a Dios y a los
     hombres sus delitos. Pero lo que hablaron en realidad ambos
     &lt;i&gt;socios&lt;/i&gt; fué lo siguiente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Compadre![[#p108n3|&lt;sup&gt;[108-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;dijo el tío Hormiga.&amp;mdash;¡Ni la Caridad[[#p108n4|&lt;sup&gt;[108-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     lo salva[[#p108n5|&lt;sup&gt;[108-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a usted! Pero ya conoce que será lástima que ese
     pergamino se pierda.... ¡Dígame dónde lo ha escondido!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Compadre!&amp;mdash;respondió el gallego.&amp;mdash;Con ese pergamino,
     o sea[[#p108n6|&lt;sup&gt;[108-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con el tesoro que representa, pienso yo negociar
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; mi indulto. Proporcióneme usted la Real gracia, y le entregaré
     el documento; pero, por lo pronto,[[#p108n7|&lt;sup&gt;[108-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se lo ofreceré a los

     jueces para que declaren que mi crimen ha prescrito[[#p108n8|&lt;sup&gt;[108-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en estos
     quince años de expatriación....
             &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p109&quot; id=&quot;p109&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p109)&lt;/span --&gt;
     &amp;mdash;¡Compadre!&amp;mdash;replicó el tío Hormiga&amp;mdash;es usted un

     sabio, y celebraré que le salgan bien todos sus planes. Pero,
     si fracasan, ¡por Dios le pido que no se lleve a la tumba un
     secreto que no aprovechará a nadie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vaya si me lo llevaré![[#p109n1|&lt;sup&gt;[109-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;contestó Juan Falgueira
&amp;mdash;¡De algún modo me he de vengar[[#p109n2|&lt;sup&gt;[109-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del mundo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Vamos andando![[#p109n3|&lt;sup&gt;[109-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&amp;mdash;gritó en esto el alguacil, poniendo
     término a aquella curiosa conferencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, cargado que fué de grillos y esposas el condenado a
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; muerte, salieron con él los curiales y los soldados en dirección

     a la ciudad de Guadix, de donde habían de conducirlo a la de
     Granada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡El demonio! ¡El demonio!&amp;mdash;seguía diciendo la mujer
     del tío Juan Gómez una hora después, al colocar de nuevo el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; lomo y la longaniza en sus respectivas orzas.&amp;mdash;¡Malditos sean

     todos los tesoros habidos y por haber![[#p109n4|&lt;sup&gt;[109-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

====XV====
&lt;p&gt; Excusado es decir que ni el tío Hormiga halló medio de
     negociar el indulto de Juan Falgueira, ni los jueces se rebajaron

     a oír seriamente los ofrecimientos que éste les hizo de un
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; &lt;i&gt;tesoro&lt;/i&gt; porque sobreseyesen su causa, ni el terrible gallego accedió
     a revelar el paradero del pergamino ni el sitio del tesoro
     al impertérrito Alcalde de Aldeire, quien, con tal pretensión,
     tuvo todavía estómago para ir a visitarlo a la capilla en la Cárcel

     Alta de Granada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Ahorcaron, pues, a Juan Falgueira el Viernes de Dolores[[#p109n5|&lt;sup&gt;[109-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en
     el paseo del Triunfo, y regresado que hubo[[#p109n6|&lt;sup&gt;[109-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a Aldeire el tío

     Hormiga el Domingo de Ramos,[[#p109n7|&lt;sup&gt;[109-7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] cayó enfermo con calentura
     tifoidea, agravándose de tal modo en pocos días que el Miércoles
     Santo[[#p109n8|&lt;sup&gt;[109-8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] se confesó e hizo testamento, y expiró el Sábado
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; de Gloria[[#p109n9|&lt;sup&gt;[109-9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] por la mañana.

            &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p110&quot; id=&quot;p110&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p110)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Pero antes de morir mandó poner una carta[[#p110n1|&lt;sup&gt;[110-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] a D. Matías
     de Quesada, reconviniéndole por su traición y latrocinio (que
     habían dado lugar a que tres hombres perdiesen la vida) y perdonándole
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt;cristianamente, a condición de que devolviese a la

     seña Torcuata los treinta y dos duros de la jícara de chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Llegó esta formidable carta a Ugíjar al mismo tiempo que la
     noticia de la muerte del tío Juan Gómez; todo lo cual afectó
     por tal extremo al viejo abogado que no volvió a echar más
     luz,[[#p110n2|&lt;sup&gt;[110-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] y murió de allí a poco, no sin escribir a última hora una

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; terrible epístola, llena de insultos y maldiciones, a su sobrino
     el maestro de la capilla de la catedral de Ceuta, acusándole de
     haberle engañado y robado, y de ser causa de su muerte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; De la lectura de tan justificada y tremenda acusación dicen
     que se originó la apoplejía fulminante que llevó al sepulcro a

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; D. Bonifacio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Por manera que[[#p110n3|&lt;sup&gt;[110-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] solamente los barruntos de la existencia de
     un tesoro fueron causa de cinco muertes y de otras desventuras,
     quedando a la postre las cosas tan ignoradas y ocultas como

     estaban al principio, puesto que la señá Torcuata, única persona
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; que ya sabía en el mundo la historia del fatal pergamino,
     guardóse muy bien de volver a mentarlo en toda su vida, por
     juzgar que todo aquello había sido obra del diablo y consecuencia
     necesaria del trato de su marido con los enemigos del Altar
     y del Trono.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Preguntará el lector: ¿cómo es que nosotros, sabedores de
     que el tesoro está allí escondido, no hemos ido a desenterrarlo
     y apoderarnos de él? Y a esto le responderemos que la curiosísima
     historia del hallazgo y empleo de aquellas riquezas, con
     posterioridad a[[#p110n4|&lt;sup&gt;[110-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la muerte de la señá Torcuata, nos es también

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; perfectamente conocida, y que tal vez la refiramos, andando el
     tiempo,[[#p110n5|&lt;sup&gt;[110-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] si llega a nuestra noticia que el público tiene interés en
     leerla.&lt;/p&gt;

===Text===

====I====
&lt;p&gt; Estoy viendo desaparecer hacia el Mediodía el buque ballenero

     que me deja abandonado en esta isla desierta, sobre la
     arena de una playa sin nombre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Heme aquí solo; solo en un ámbito de mil leguas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Yo amaba a una mujer.... El demonio de los celos me
     mordió el corazón, y he matado a mi rival en desafio....

     ¡Era un príncipe!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y el Gobierno ruso me ha condenado a pasar aquí &lt;i&gt;un
     año&lt;/i&gt;...; es decir, me ha condenado a muerte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Ah! ¿Por qué no me entregó al hacha[[#p111n2|&lt;sup&gt;[111-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] del verdugo?

     ¿Por qué hacerme expirar de frío, de hambre, de tristeza, de
     desesperación, o disputando mi cuerpo al terrible &lt;i&gt;oso blanco&lt;/i&gt;, si
     mi delito no era más que uno?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡&lt;i&gt;Spitzberg&lt;/i&gt;!... ¡Estoy en el terrible archipiélago que

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; ninguna raza ha podido habitar! ¡Me hallo a los 77 grados
     latitud Norte, a doscientas sesenta leguas del &lt;i&gt;Polo&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Creo haber oído decir a mis asesinos que esta isla es la del
     &lt;i&gt;Nordeste&lt;/i&gt;, la más meridional del horroroso grupo, la más &lt;i&gt;templada&lt;/i&gt;

     de todas.... ¡Cruel compasión..., que prolongará
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; algunas horas mi agonía!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ignoro en cuál de estos témpanos de hielo eterno tiene la
     Rusia una colonia para la peletería y la pesca de la ballena;
     pero lo que sí sé[[#p111n3|&lt;sup&gt;[111-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] es que los colonos emigrarían[[#p111n4|&lt;sup&gt;[111-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p112&quot; id=&quot;p112&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p112)&lt;/span --&gt;

     a la Laponia a fines de Agosto,[[#p112n1|&lt;sup&gt;[112-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] hace dos meses, y no volverán
     hasta la primavera...; ¡dentro de doscientos cuarenta días!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Estoy, pues, solo, sin hogar, sin amparo, sin víveres, sin
     consuelos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Morir! He aquí mi inevitable y próxima suerte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hoy es 17 de Octubre.... El frío avanza por el Norte....
     Dentro de pocos días me helaré sin remedio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entretanto me alimentaré con la caza. ¡Siquiera[[#p112n2|&lt;sup&gt;[112-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] esos crueles

     me han dejado una escopeta... «&lt;i&gt;por si quería&lt;/i&gt;[[#p112n3|&lt;sup&gt;[112-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;i&gt;suicidarme
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; de este modo&lt;/i&gt;»! Mataré rengíferos, chuparé hielo y me procuraré
     un abrigo entre esas rocas. El inglés Parry[[#p112n4|&lt;sup&gt;[112-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] habitó cabañas

     de nieve en el Norte de América a los 73 grados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ah! Sí...; ¡pero yo estoy cuatro grados más cerca del
     Polo, y no tengo fuego para calentarme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Morir! ¡Morir! ¡He aquí mi infalible destino!&lt;/p&gt;

====II====
&lt;p&gt; Han transcurrido seis días.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una ráfaga de esperanza brilla ante mis ojos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Me he procurado fuego como Robinsón,[[#p112n5|&lt;sup&gt;[112-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] rozando dos pedazos

     de cedro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Ayer encontré en el centro de inmensa roca una profunda
     cavidad muy reservada del frío.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todos los días mato cinco o seis rengíferos, los despedazo y
     conservo la carne entre los témpanos de hielo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así se conservará incorrupta hasta el año que viene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; También hago provisión de combustibles. No tengo hacha;
     pero el frío me sirve de leñador. Todas las noches crujen algunos
     árboles y saltan hechos astillas por el rigor de la helada,
     y yo traslado a mi gruta cada mañana miles de estos fragmentos,

     que alimentarán mi hogar hasta que me muera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Voy, pues, a entablar una insensata lucha con el invierno.&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p113&quot; id=&quot;p113&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p113)&lt;/span --&gt;
     ¡Porque deseo vivir y volver al lado de los hombres! ¡Porque
     la soledad me ha vuelto cobarde!... ¡Porque adoro la
     vida!...&lt;/p&gt;

====III====
&lt;p&gt; El frío es ya irresistible....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Ha llegado el momento de encerrarme en las entrañas de esa
     peña; de incrustarme en su centro como un marisco en su

     concha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Antes de sepultarme en la que acaso será efectivamente mi
     tumba; antes de vestirme esa mortaja de piedra, quiero despedirme
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; del mundo, de la Naturaleza, de la luz, de la vida....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Camina el sol tan poco elevado en el horizonte, que desde

     que sale hasta que se pone[[#i206|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii206&quot;&gt;(206)&lt;/sup&gt;]] no hace más que &lt;i&gt;recorrer su ocaso&lt;/i&gt;[[#p113n1|&lt;sup&gt;[113-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     como luminoso fantasma que da vueltas alrededor de su
     sepulcro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Sus rayos pálidos y horizontales reverberan tristemente sobre
     el mar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Las aguas empiezan a rizarse.... Pronto quedarán encadenadas
     por el hielo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La bóveda celeste ostenta un azul cárdeno y sombrío, que la
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; hace aparecer como más distante de la Tierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El soplo del aquilón quema y marchita las tristes flores que

     osaron desplegar aquí sus encantos, y ata con lazos de cristal el
     curso de los torrentes.... ¡Helos ya mudos, inmóviles, petrificados
     en sus enérgicas actitudes, como trágicos héroes esculpidos[[#p113n2|&lt;sup&gt;[113-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; en mármol!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reina un silencio sepulcral, un silencio absoluto. No se oye

     ni canto de ave, ni rumor de corriente, ni suspiro de brisa, ni
     columpio de planta....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ni movimiento ni ruido!... ¡Nada! El mutismo del
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; &lt;i&gt;no ser&lt;/i&gt;: he aquí todo. La eternidad y lo infinito deben de parecerse
     a estas monótonas soledades, a estos páramos de inacción

     y muerte.
               &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p114&quot; id=&quot;p114&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p114)&lt;/span --&gt;
     El calor de mi sangre, los latidos de mi corazón, el soplo de
     mi aliento, el eco de mis pasos, son los únicos síntomas de vida
     que ofrece la Naturaleza. Me creo, pues, solo en un mundo
     cadáver, en un planeta posterior a su Apocalipsis;[[#p114n1|&lt;sup&gt;[114-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en la Tierra

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; misma, pasado el Juicio final....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hoy tiene el &lt;i&gt;día&lt;/i&gt; diez y seis minutos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mañana &lt;i&gt;no saldrá&lt;/i&gt; el sol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mañana me ocultaré yo por seis meses; él por tres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh, sol! ¿ Volveremos a vernos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Qué frío tan[[#i207|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii207&quot;&gt;(207)&lt;/sup&gt;]] espantoso!...
     La humedad del aire se convierte en agujas de hielo que

     punzan mi semblante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mi aliento me rodea de una especie de niebla que no puede
     elevarse a la condensada atmósfera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; El humo de mi escopeta se dilata también horizontalmente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ayer toqué el gatillo sin mis gruesos guantes, y mis dedos

     quedaron tan fuertemente unidos al acero que, para separarlos,
     hube de dejarme allí la piel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La sábana blanca que se extiende indefinidamente alrededor
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de mí, y las irradiaciones de la luz en ella, hanme producido en
     la vista una terrible inflamación....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pronto vendrá el escorbuto....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh! ¡Qué espantosa es esta lucha de mi vida con la
     muerte de todo lo creado!&lt;/p&gt;

====IV====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; En efecto: ayer apareció el sol; no por el Oriente, sino por
     el Sur. Trazó en lontananza un ligero semicírculo, y se hundió
     al cabo de un cuarto de hora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hoy es el 7 de Noviembre, el tremendo día del &lt;i&gt;Spitzberg&lt;/i&gt;, el

     último en que ve el sol....
           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p115&quot; id=&quot;p115&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p115)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Son las once y media de la mañana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hace tres horas que un esplendoroso crepúsculo luce en el
     remotísimo confín de los cielos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mas el sol no aparece....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Ah!... ¡Sí!... ¡Helo pálido y entristecido, pugnando
     por asomar su frente!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero el disco no se eleva....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El limbo solamente pasa rozando por el límite del cielo y de

     las olas....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Un momento más, y ha desaparecido!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Adiós para siempre, padre de la luz, corona de los cielos,
     alma del mundo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Adiós, mi último amigo! ¡Adiós, y vuelve!&lt;/p&gt;

====V====
&lt;p&gt; ¿Cuánto tiempo ha transcurrido?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; No lo sé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mi reloj anduvo una semana: el frío lo paró después, o,
     mejor dicho, lo mató.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El frío lo mata todo.[[#p115n1|&lt;sup&gt;[115-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ignoro, pues, qué día es hoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Pero ¿qué significa la palabra &lt;i&gt;hoy&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El &lt;i&gt;hoy&lt;/i&gt; no existe para mí.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mi vida carece de horas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lo pasado, lo presente y el porvenir forman horrible grupo
     en mi imaginación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Un momento &lt;i&gt;continuo&lt;/i&gt;: tal es el tiempo dentro de este
     sepulcro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Si los muertos pensaran en el panteón, padecerían lo que yo
     padezco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los siglos caminan más de prisa[[#i208|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii208&quot;&gt;(208)&lt;/sup&gt;]] que aquí los instantes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; Un invierno en Spitzberg da una idea de la eternidad en el
     infierno.
          &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p116&quot; id=&quot;p116&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p116)&lt;/span --&gt;
     ¡Y qué abismo sin fondo el de mi tenaz meditación!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mis ideas, indefinidamente desbordadas, explayadas, extendidas
     por el páramo de mi &lt;i&gt;no ser&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p116n1|&lt;sup&gt;[116-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] concluirán por escapárseme...,
     y no me volveré loco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Vivo náufrago y sin tabla en un océano de negaciones.

     Paréceme un sueño la idea de que existe el mundo. Dudo
     hasta de mi propia existencia. Mi desesperación es más
     cruel que la de los ateos: ellos niegan el porvenir; yo niego
     lo presente. Yo no he perdido la esperanza, sino la realidad.&lt;/p&gt;

====VI====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Qué lejos estoy de los hombres! ¡Qué olvidado sobre la tierra!
     Hacia cualquier parte que dirijo el pensamiento, disto de la
     humanidad centenares de leguas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mil quinientas millas al Occidente se halla la Groenlandia,[[#p116n2|&lt;sup&gt;[116-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

     continente de hielo que enlaza dos mundos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Al Norte... ¡no hay más que el &lt;i&gt;Polo&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El Océano Atlántico se dilata por el Sur.... Allá está el
     continente europeo, con su perdurable primavera.... Luego

     el África, ¡la patria del sol!... Después las zonas antárticas,
     gozando ahora de los favores del estío....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Al Oriente, a dos mil cuatrocientas millas de este archipiélago,
     sólo se halla la Nueva Zembla.[[#p116n3|&lt;sup&gt;[116-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh! ¡Qué pesadilla descorrió[[#p116n4|&lt;sup&gt;[116-4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en mente humana ilusión

     tan negra como la realidad de mi desventura!&lt;/p&gt;

====VII====
&lt;p&gt; El &lt;i&gt;upas&lt;/i&gt;, árbol venenoso de la Oceanía,[[#p116n5|&lt;sup&gt;[116-5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] no deja brotar ni una

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; planta en el ámbito que cobija su ramaje.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Donde el caballo de Atila[[#p116n6|&lt;sup&gt;[116-6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sentaba el pie no volvía a nacer
     la hierba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El envidioso no ve más que la sombra del bien ajeno.

          &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p117&quot; id=&quot;p117&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p117)&lt;/span --&gt;
     El egoísta está siempre asfixiado por falta de otro mundo
     que absorber....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El escéptico vive negativamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Y yo? ¿Qué soy? ¿Qué hago? ¿Cómo vivo?&lt;/p&gt;

====VIII====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Cuántos brillantes salones se abrirán en este momento a una
     multitud alegre y bulliciosa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El baile... el amor... la música....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Condenación para mí!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Allá imagino un perfumado gabinete, una chispeante chimenea,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; alfombras, butacas, pieles, café, ron, tabaco...; una
     plática tierna, descanso del placer, incentivo de más placeres...;
     una alcoba tibiamente alumbrada, un lecho mullido y el

     sueño de la felicidad....&amp;mdash;¡Ay, mi Alejandra!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero no.... Estoy en San Petersburgo. Es una tarde de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Mayo. Tomamos el sol en embalsamados jardines. La gente
     ríe, habla acá y allá, me saluda....&amp;mdash;¡Alejandra! ¡Alejandra
     mía!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Tampoco!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ah! ¡qué perdurable noche!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Cuándo llegará &lt;i&gt;mañana&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

====IX====
&lt;p&gt; Nuevas eternidades han rodado sobre mi cabeza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Duermo mucho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿En qué hora, en qué día, en qué mes me encuentro?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Ha pasado ya un año, o una semana solamente?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Abulto yo el tiempo con la imaginación, o no lo siento pasar
     y lo achico?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿De qué pecan[[#p117n1|&lt;sup&gt;[117-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mis cálculos? ¿de exagerados[[#p117n2|&lt;sup&gt;[117-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] o de cobardes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p118&quot; id=&quot;p118&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p118)&lt;/span --&gt;
     ¡Oh! ¿Qué es este &lt;i&gt;tiempo&lt;/i&gt; sin medida, &lt;i&gt;pro indiviso&lt;/i&gt;,[[#p118n1|&lt;sup&gt;[118-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] sin cronómetro,
     sin día ni noche, sin sol, luna ni estrellas? ¡Es el

     caos; es la nada con un solo &lt;i&gt;sér&lt;/i&gt;, como mi pobre espíritu, abismada
     en el eterno vacío!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Me he puesto a veces las manos sobre el corazón; he sumado
     luego los latidos que he contado en distintas ocasiones, y ha
     pasado de un millón la suma total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Un millón de latidos!... ¡Un millón de segundos!...
     ¡Once días y medio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Y luego se deslizan los años de nuestra ventura como pájaros
     por el aire, sin dejar rastro en la memoria!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Cuántas veces me vió el crepúsculo de la tarde al lado de

     mi adorada, y llegó la noche, y pasó, y rayó el día..., y toda
     esta cantidad de tiempo no fué otra cosa que una larga
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; mirada!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh! ¡cuántas inmensidades contiene un minuto de dolor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y ¡cuan pasajera es una inmensidad de dicha!&lt;/p&gt;

====X====
&lt;p&gt; Las rocas crujen sobre mi cabeza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Parece que la isla va a partirse en mil pedazos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Este debe de ser el vendaval del equinoccio....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Es decir, que Marzo habrá[[#p118n2|&lt;sup&gt;[118-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] mediado ya y que el sol lucirá
     en el horizonte....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Voy a salir! ¡Quiero ver el cielo! ¡Quiero ver el sol!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero ¿qué oigo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Los osos blancos rugen terriblemente.... ¡Mejor!
     ¡Lucharemos!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡También yo tengo hambre de sangre caliente, de carne que
     palpite entre mis uñas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p119&quot; id=&quot;p119&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p119)&lt;/span --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cojo la escopeta; rompo el hielo que obstruye la entrada de
     esta gruta, y salgo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Extraña debe ser mi aparición entre las nieves! ¡Pareceré
     una fiera que deja su cubil, un monstruo que sale del infierno,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Lázaro[[#p119n1|&lt;sup&gt;[119-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que se levanta de la tumba!&lt;/p&gt;

===Text===

====XI====
&lt;p&gt; ¡Me he engañado miserablemente!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Creía hallarme en la primavera; esperaba ver el sol; contaba
     con que habrían transcurrido cuatro o cinco meses...,

     ¡y me hallo con el invierno, y es de noche, y estamos en Enero,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; a juzgar por la disposición de las estrellas!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Aun no ha mediado mi sufrimiento, cuando yo no podía
     sufrir ya más!...&amp;mdash;¿Qué va a ser de mí?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; He allí la luna en el cénit obscuro del firmamento....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Parece una blanca paloma venida de otros horizontes a visitar
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; un mundo olvidado por el Criador....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Doloroso espectáculo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Por donde quiera[[#i209|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii209&quot;&gt;(209)&lt;/sup&gt;]] que miro, veo sólo un interminable páramo,
     una soledad sin límites....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El mar helado, y cubierto además de nieve, no se diferencia
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; de la tierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los elementos se confunden aquí como las horas de mi ocio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todo ha mudado de sitio, de forma, de color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El valle está repleto de nieve y nivelado con el monte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El árbol se asemeja a una campana de cristal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; La superficie del Océano no es lisa: fantásticas breñas de
     hielo la cubren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y todo está mudo, blanco, frió, inmóvil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Qué monotonía tan desesperadora!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El cielo aparece negro al lado de la reverberante claridad
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; de la luna y de la nieve.
           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p120&quot; id=&quot;p120&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p120)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Las estrellas se ven tan lejos y tan atenuadas que parecen,

     pertenecer a otros mundos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mas ¿por qué se extiende de pronto una obscuridad densísima?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Por qué las estrellas fulguran en la sombra con un brillo
     desusado?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Qué es esto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Desbórdase de la luna un océano de claridad; la blanca
     sábana que envuelve la creación refleja una luz intensa; la lontananza
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; del horizonte se rasga y se prolonga....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En seguida las tinieblas se tornaron espesísimas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Qué misterio se obra en la Naturaleza?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh! ¡La &lt;i&gt;aurora boreal&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; El Septentrión se inflama con mil luces y colores; una
     llamarada de oro y fuego inunda el espacio ilimitado; las soledades

     se incendian; los monolitos de hielo brillan con todos
     los matices del arco iris. Cada carámbano es una columna de
     topacio; cada estalagmita una lluvia de zafiros.  Rásgase la
     penumbra, y descúbrense océanos de claridad.... ¡Allá
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; adivino el &lt;i&gt;Polo&lt;/i&gt; alumbrado intensamente, erial solitario que

     ningún pie humano llegará a hollar nunca! Y en aquella
     región de continuo espanto creo divisar el eje misterioso de
     la Tierra....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; Único espectador de este sublime drama, caigo instintivamente
     de rodillas....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡He aquí los confines del Globo trocados en esplendoroso
     templo, en una &lt;i&gt;capella ardente&lt;/i&gt;[[#p120n1|&lt;sup&gt;[120-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] en un sagrario de purísimo oro
     derretido!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dominando tan vasta iluminación álzanse columnas de llama
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; aérea, arcos de divina lumbre, bóvedas de flámulas desatadas....
     Así se conciben la cuna del rayo, el manantial de la luz,
     el lecho del sol en la fulgente tarde....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Cuánta vida, cuánto ardor, cuánta belleza en el universo!&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p121&quot; id=&quot;p121&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p121)&lt;/span --&gt;

     ¡Qué lujo de fuego y de colores, después de tanto tiempo en
     que mis ojos sólo vieron la atonía del color y de la existencia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pronto se concentran en un punto tantos ríos de ebulliciente
     claridad, y fórmanse mil soles de fuegos fatuos, que se apagan
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; sucesivamente, como la iluminación de terminada fiesta. Los

     prismas se decoloran: la escarlata amarillea: la púrpura toma
     un tinte violado....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Otra vez desolación y tinieblas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El meteoro ha desaparecido.&lt;/p&gt;

==== XII====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Heme de nuevo en mi sepulcro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El ocio y el frío combaten otra vez mi cuerpo y mi alma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡El ocio! Acurrucado frente a[[#p121n1|&lt;sup&gt;[121-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] la hoguera paso unas horas

     sin medida....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mis ojos se nutren de la llama: mi corazón respira olas de
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; fuego. Sin este fuego no fluiría mi sangre.... El ocio y el
     frío son una misma cosa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y pasa el tiempo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ya[[#p121n2|&lt;sup&gt;[121-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] pienso en nimiedades, en frívolas relaciones de un
     átomo de ceniza con un átomo de lumbre: ya se desentumecen
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; mis ideas, y recorro el mundo de una ojeada.
     Mi niñez y mis amores; toda la historia de mi vida pasa

     ante mi imaginación....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cuando salga de aquí, si lo consigo, habré nacido de nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El frío y el ocio han cristalizado otro sér con los despojos
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de mi sér pasado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Cuánto profundo y asolador pensamiento, cuánta negativa

     ciencia adivinada sacaré de esta prisión!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La soledad me ha engrandecido de un modo horrible,
     espantoso....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; He visto el mundo y la sociedad tan a lo lejos, en tan&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p122&quot; id=&quot;p122&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p122)&lt;/span --&gt;
     graduada perspectiva, que he adquirido el conocimiento exacto de

     todas las cosas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Cuánta pequeñez he dejado de apreciar!... ¡Pequeñeces
     que allá juzgaba de alta transcendencia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Oh! ¡Si vuelvo al mundo viviré soberanamente, sin que
     el velo de la preocupación me oculte la felicidad, sin que la

     costumbre me aprisione entre sus redes! ¡Qué invulnerable
     me hizo la desesperación!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Entre mi corazón y el mundo no hay ya ningún lazo: el
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; hielo nos separó para siempre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Yo soy yo! Todos los hombres son una &lt;i&gt;unidad&lt;/i&gt;, y yo soy

     &lt;i&gt;otra&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Yo soy, pues, un mundo! ¡Un mundo rival de aquél!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Yo lo aplastaré mañana bajo mi egoísmo, como él me arrojó
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; ayer de su seno!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo era humilde: yo quería mi puesto en aquella familia de
     hermanos; yo abdicaba mi individualidad por conseguir solidaridad
     en un poco de amor.... Hoy me han endurecido
     mi pensamiento y su crueldad. ¡Guerra a muerte! ¡Me
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; basto contra todos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Tengo frío en el alma como en el cuerpo!&lt;/p&gt;

====XIII====
&lt;p&gt; Después de otra eternidad de inacción, que así puede haber
     sido un día como un año (pues no tengo conciencia de mi propia

     vida), abandono de nuevo esta caverna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; El frío material es insoportable....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh!... ¡qué duda tan espantosa llevo en el cerebro!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Acabo de pensar que acaso habrá transcurrido ya el verano;
     que bien puedo encontrarme con nuevas nieves; que quizás

     ha empezado otra noche de dos mil doscientas horas!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Ah!... Este pensamiento me hiela el corazón y el alma.
           &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p123&quot; id=&quot;p123&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p123)&lt;/span --&gt;
     He salido de la gruta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Aún es de noche!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Tremendo problema!... ¿Qué noche es ésta que estoy
     mirando?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¿Es que[[#i210|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii210&quot;&gt;(210)&lt;/sup&gt;]] no ha concluido el invierno de mi condena?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Es que ha empezado &lt;i&gt;otro&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿En &lt;i&gt;qué año&lt;/i&gt; me encuentro?&lt;/p&gt;

====XIV====
&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh ventura! ¡El horizonte se tiñe de color de rosa hacia

     el Mediodía!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; Dijérase que la aurora boreal brilla en el punto opuesto de
     la bóveda celeste....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pero no es la fatua &lt;i&gt;aurora boreal&lt;/i&gt;.... ¡Es la verdadera

     &lt;i&gt;aurora&lt;/i&gt;, la aurora del día!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El aliento del Ecuador enrojece las brumas del Océano....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Los hielos sonríen por todas partes al recibir las caricias de
     la &lt;i&gt;primera alborada&lt;/i&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Las estrellas se borran en el cárdeno firmamento....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La luna se oculta por el Septentrión....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Está amaneciendo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Salve, primera luz del alba!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Salve, rayo perdido del astro deseado, que vienes a alegrar
     estos desiertos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Salve, cabello luminoso, desprendido de la dorada frente
     del sol!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Ya es de día!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así despertaría el mundo el día de la creación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así saldría la creación de las tinieblas del caos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Así renacería la especie humana cuando volvió la paloma al
     arca de Noé[[#p123n1|&lt;sup&gt;[123-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] con el ramo de oliva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; En cuanto a mí, hoy despierto de la nada del &lt;i&gt;no ser&lt;/i&gt;, de esa
     negación sin nombre en que he vivido tantos meses.
                &lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p124&quot; id=&quot;p124&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p124)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Hoy sacuden mis sentidos su letargo, y la luz turba la monotonía
     de la noche y de la nieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hoy renazco a la vida, y ese rayo matinal que colora el
     Oriente viene a ser el iris que me presagia mejores días.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Hoy, en fin, se reanuda mi dulce consorcio con la esperanza
     de vivir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Una hora ha durado la alborada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hubo un momento en que me pareció que el sol iba a
     salir....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; La cerrazón de niebla que entolda el horizonte amenazaba
     romperse....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todo ha desaparecido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; He contemplado, pues, sin intervalo alguno el crepúsculo de
     la mañana y el de la tarde. ¡Espectáculo grandioso! Mi
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; corazón rebosa de entusiasmo y de alegría.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hoy debe ser el 4 de Febrero.&lt;/p&gt;

====XV====
&lt;p&gt; Día 5.[[#p124n1|&lt;sup&gt;[124-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los resplandores del sol han durado hora y media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La cúspide de una montaña elevadísima ha reflejado por un

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; momento los rayos del sol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Yo lo veré mañana!&lt;/p&gt;

====XVI====
&lt;p&gt; ¡El sol! ¡El sol!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Al fin has brillado ante mis ojos, astro divino, manantial de
luz, foco de la vida!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Cómo me alegra el alma esta corta visita que hoy haces al
     Spitzberg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Bendito seas mil veces, rey de la Naturaleza, coronado de&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p125&quot; id=&quot;p125&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p125)&lt;/span --&gt;

     rayos y vestido de oro, que te anuncias al mundo con la risueña
     aurora y te despides con el melancólico suspiro de la tarde!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Qué son las estrellas sino tu brillante séquito, tu numerosa
     corte, que tarda una noche entera en desfilar por los cielos?&lt;/p&gt;

====XVII====
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Han transcurrido tres meses más, abreviados por la
     esperanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡La primavera! La diosa de los perfumes y de la armonía
     sonríe ya en el cielo, en la tierra, en el mar y en el ambiente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Todo vive; todo se agita; todo se alegra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; El sol acaba de ocultarse por el Norte: ¡dentro de una hora
     volverá a salir!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pasado mañana, que deberá ser el 5 de Mayo, empezará el
     día de tres meses, durante el cual vendrá algún buque &lt;i&gt;groenlandero&lt;/i&gt;

     a este archipiélago, y me volverá al mundo habitado
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; por los hombres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; En este instante iluminan la tierra cinco distintos resplandores:
     el crepúsculo de la tarde, la claridad del amanecer, un
     perdido destello de la agonizante &lt;i&gt;aurora boreal&lt;/i&gt;, el moribundo

     resplandor que desde el Sur envía la menguada luna, y la vacilante
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; luz de las remotísimas estrellas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El &lt;i&gt;blinc&lt;/i&gt;, o sea la refracción de la nieve, mezcla su fulgor a
     tantos fulgores, dando a la Naturaleza cierto vislumbre
     fantástico.&lt;/p&gt;

====XVIII====
&lt;p&gt; He aquí a la Creación[[#p125n1|&lt;sup&gt;[125-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] revestida de todos los encantos que
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; se atreve a desplegar en esta latitud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El mar ha roto sus cadenas de hielo y mece en lontananza
     sus verdes olas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El viento ha recobrado elasticidad.... ¡Siquiera el ruido
     es ya una distracción en esta ociosidad perdurable!&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p126&quot; id=&quot;p126&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p126)&lt;/span --&gt;
     Óyense hacia el Norte estruendos misteriosos....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Es que se hunden los alcázares de cristal que edificó la mano
     del invierno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Incesantemente se deslizan por el Océano, viniendo del &lt;i&gt;Polo&lt;/i&gt;,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; mil flotantes islas, que pasan ante mis ojos como fantasmas, hijos

     del espanto de estas regiones, o como ambulante cordillera....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Son témpanos de hielo que desharán mañana las brisas del
     &lt;i&gt;Círculo polar&lt;/i&gt;.[[#p126n1|&lt;sup&gt;[126-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Esto sucede en el Océano. En la tierra todo sonríe, murmura,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; canta y se desenvuelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Las campiñas se cubren de cierta verdura, algunos vegetales
     cuelgan por los laderos de las montañas, y hasta en la nieve
     brotan amarillos fresales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mil cascadas y torrentes, formados por el deshielo, corren,
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; saltan y se derrumban con alegre estrépito, comunicando al aire

     estremecido placidísimos rumores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Las adormideras blancas y las doradas siemprevivas inclinan
     sus lánguidas cabezas sobre la espuma de las aguas como náyades
     voluptuosas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; Los cedros seculares y los desgajados abetos se cubren de

     obscuras hojas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El liquen festonea los zócalos de las montañas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Donde quiera hay variedad, colores, vida, movimiento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; La isla canta, el mar se lamenta, la atmósfera murmura....
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Magnífico concierto!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El &lt;i&gt;burgomaestre&lt;/i&gt;, el buitre polar, arroja su prolongado grito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los &lt;i&gt;mallemaks&lt;/i&gt;[[#p126n2|&lt;sup&gt;[126-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] trinan con blanda melodía.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Los &lt;i&gt;rotger&lt;/i&gt; modulan su patético gorjeo, semejante al arrullo

     de la tórtola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; El &lt;i&gt;apura-nieves&lt;/i&gt;, el pájaro de oro, revolotea de acá para allá,
     como una estrella sin destino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Qué transformación, qué resurrección tan admirable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y, sin embargo, esta primavera sería aterradora comparada
     con el más rudo invierno de Escocia.[[#p126n3|&lt;sup&gt;[126-3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

====XIX====&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p127&quot; id=&quot;p127&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p127)&lt;/span --&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ¡Ah! ¿Qué es aquel punto negro que se destaca sobre los
     confines del Océano, bajo la cúpula azul del firmamento?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mi corazón late con una violencia irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Me habré engañado?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Gracias, Dios mío! ¡Es un buque ballenero!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Viene hacia aquí....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Irá al estrecho de Henlopen, y pasará a un cuarto de milla
     de esta isla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mi escopeta le avisará....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Me he salvado!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Desesperación!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El frío ha destruido el organismo de mi escopeta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡No podré hacer señal a ese buque!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lo estoy viendo.... Dista de aquí una milla.... Es un

&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; &lt;i&gt;groenlandero&lt;/i&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Socorro! ¡Socorro! ¡Socorro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ah! No puedo más:[[#i211|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii211&quot;&gt;(211)&lt;/sup&gt;]] mi voz enronquece.... ¡Estoy
     tan extenuado!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash;¡Socorro!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; ¡No me oyen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Oh, estar tan cerca de los hombres y no salvarme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ver el puerto después del naufragio, y morir sin tocar la
     orilla!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Morir, como Prometeo,[[#p127n1|&lt;sup&gt;[127-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] encadenado en una roca!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Morir después de un año de martirio; después de haber
     comprado la vida con diez meses de sepultura!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Y no hay remedio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Ya doblan el cabo de Henlopen!...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Desaparecieron!... ¡Ay!... ¡Desaparecieron!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span --&gt; ¡Tremenda ironía de mi destino!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Necio de mi,[[#p127n2|&lt;sup&gt;[127-2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] que me reconcilié con la esperanza!&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p128&quot; id=&quot;p128&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p128)&lt;/span --&gt;

     ¡Necio de mí...que!... ¡Ah! No huyas de esa manera ante
     mis ojos, Dios mió!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿Y qué?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¿He de confiarme de nuevo a una suerte cruel que se burla
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; de mis lágrimas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Estoy decidido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yo mismo me daré la muerte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Esto es mejor que pasar otro invierno enterrado vivo en un
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span --&gt; sepulcro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ¡Los sepulcros se han hecho para los muertos!&lt;/p&gt;

====XX====
&lt;p&gt; A bordo del &lt;i&gt;Grande Esberrer&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Día 8 de Agosto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Camino hacia los lares patrios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span --&gt; Acabo de perder de vista[[#i212|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii212&quot;&gt;(212)&lt;/sup&gt;]] la última montaña del &lt;i&gt;Spitzberg&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El buque que me ha recogido es el mismo que ví alejarse

     hacia el estrecho de Henlopen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cuando me desangraba por cuatro cisuras que me hice en
     pies y manos, la tripulación del &lt;i&gt;Grande Esberrer&lt;/i&gt;, que había
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span --&gt; desembarcado en otra rada de la isla del Nordeste, me encontró
     tendido en tierra y me salvó la vida....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Llegué al Spitzberg a la edad de diez y nueve años, y he permanecido
     allí diez meses. Sin embargo, los marineros que me
     acompañan, al ver encanecidos mis cabellos, mi frente surcada
&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span --&gt; de arrugas y mis ojos tétricos y apagados, me creen llegado a
     la edad de treinta y cinco o cuarenta años....&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Guadix, 1852.&lt;/p&gt;


===EPÍLOGO.&amp;mdash;DEDICATORIA===&lt;!-- span class=&quot;rig&quot;&gt;&lt;span name=&quot;p129&quot; id=&quot;p129&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(p129)&lt;/span --&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A MI BUEN AMIGO EL SR. D. JOSÉ J. VILLANUEVA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Te remito un puñado de canas de mi cabeza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; El papel en que van envueltas es mi fe de bautismo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Por ella verás que tengo veintiún años: de consiguiente,[[#p129n1|&lt;sup&gt;[129-1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
     tenía diez y nueve cuando escribi el anterior monólogo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- span class=&quot;side&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span --&gt; Dice un refrán que &lt;i&gt;por todas partes[[#i213|&lt;sup id=&quot;ii213&quot;&gt;(213)&lt;/sup&gt;]] se va a Roma&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y yo añado que &lt;i&gt;por cualquier parte se va a Spitzberg&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Este epílogo es también la dedicatoria de la presente obrilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Recíbelo todo con indulgencia, y devuélveme la fe de bautismo.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Madrid, 1854.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Cervical Cancer Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Current staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
:Is based on revised FIGO staging (2009)
:'''FIGO 2009''' PMID 19342051 -- &quot;Revised FIGO staging for carcinoma of the cervix.&quot;

:''see also:'' [http://www.bgcs.org.uk/media/7f4b5fd0dd26474db0ae97073639d15b.pdf Revised FIGO Staging (2009)(PDF)]

*Clinical stage should be determined prior to start of definitive therapy; it must not be changed once therapy started
*Results of CT, MRI, PET, lymphangiography, arteriography, and venography may not be used to determined clinical staging, but they may be used to develop a clinical plan
*Pathologic staging does not change clinical staging, but should be recorded
*Hysterectomy performed in case of unsuspected invasive cervical carcinoma cannot be clinically staged, and should be reported separately

''Primary Tumor:'' (FIGO stage in parentheses)
*Tis - Carcinoma in situ
*T1 (FIGO I) - Confined to uterus (extension to corpus should be disregarded)
**T1a (IA) - Invasive carcinoma visible only by microscopy
***T1a1 (IA1) - Stromal invasion 3.0 mm or less in depth and 7.0 mm or less in horizontal spread
***T1a2 (IA2) - Stromal invasion &gt;3.0-5.0 mm in depth and 7.0 mm or less in horizontal spread
**T1b (IB) - Clinically visible lesion, or microscopic lesion &gt; IA2
**:''Note:'' all macroscopically visible lesions, even with superficial invasion, are T1b
***T1b1 (IB1) - Clinically visible lesion 4.0 cm or less
***T1b2 (IB2) - Clinically visible lesion more than 4.0 cm
*T2 (II) - Invades beyond uterus but not to pelvic wall or lower 1/3 of vagina
**T2a (IIA) - Without parametrial invasion (i.e. involves upper 2/3 of vagina)
***T2a1 (IIA1) - Clinically visible lesion 4.0 cm or less
***T2a2 (IIA2) - Clinically visible lesion more than 4.0 cm
**T2b (IIB) - With parametrial invasion
*T3 (III) - Extends to pelvic wall, lower 1/3 of vagina, or causes hydronephrosis
**T3a (IIIA) - Involves lower 1/3 of vagina, no extension to pelvic wall
**T3b (IIIB) - Extends to pelvic wall or causes hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney
*T4 (IVA) - Invades mucosa of bladder or rectum or extends beyond true pelvis (bullous edema not sufficient)


''Regional Lymph Nodes:'' - parametrial, paracervical, obturator, internal iliac, external iliac, common iliac, sacral, presacral. (Paraaortic lymph nodes are M1 disease.)
*N0 - No regional LN metastasis
*N1 - Regional LN metastasis (lymph node involvement not listed in FIGO update 2009)

''Distant metastasis:'' - including peritoneal spread, involvement of supraclavicular, mediastinal, or paraaortic LN, lung, liver, or bone
*M0 - No distant metastasis
*M1 (FIGO IVB) - Distant metastasis

''Stage Grouping:'' &lt;br&gt;
*Corresponds with FIGO Stage (noted above in parentheses)

&lt;br&gt;''Changes from 6th Edition:'' &lt;br&gt;
*Subdivided T2a into T2a1 and T2a2 based on size (similar to IB1 and IB2)

&lt;br&gt;'''Allowed procedures in FIGO staging:'''

The FIGO stage is a ''clinical'' stage.  The below procedures may be used in determining the clinical stage. 

Allowed procedures: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, X-rays of lungs and skeleton. Suspected involvement of bladder or rectal mucosa must be confirmed by biopsy. FNA of palpable nodes or masses is allowed; however, laparoscopic or radiologically-guided biopsy is not allowed for clinical staging.

Not allowed for staging: CT, MRI, PET, lymphangiogram, arteriogram, venogram.

Many physiological and behavioral actions of angiotensin II (AngII) are mediated by the AngII Type 1 (AT1) receptor. Specifically, mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids regulate rennin-angiotensin system components, which include the AT1 receptor. Corticosterone and dexamethasone have been proven to increase AT1 receptor levels via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. This activation results in increased AngII-induced inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation. Aldosterone – an endogenous mineralocorticoid – and deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA) – a synthetic mineralocorticoid – have been proven to stimulate AT1 binding at high levels but not at physiological levels. AT1 binding increases via GR activation, and without activating a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Although, high doses of mineralocorticoids do not significantly affect AngII-induced IP3 formation. Researchers have theorized that this is possibly a result of insufficient coupling of the AT1 receptor to its post-receptor signaling factors.

[[Image:Cortisol.png‎|right|thumb|200px|'''Cortisol''', otherwise known as glucocorticoids, structure is shown here. This important hormone is secreted by the adrenal gland during periods of stress.]]

Glucocorticoids have been proven to increase mineralocorticoid-induced actions. It has been discovered that physiological levels of dexamethasone increase AT1 binding and IP3 formation, and that physiological levels of aldosterone are primarily responsible for MR activation. However, low level combinations of each of these do not increase the effect of dexamethasone on AT1 binding. However, there has been no observed synergy between aldosterone and dexamethasone at the AT1 binding sites or in IP3 formation levels.

&lt;big&gt;'''Laryngeal Cancer Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*~10K cases/year in the U.S.
*~2% of all cancers; most common upper aerodigestive tract cancer
*Risk factors: tobacco, extensive use of voice
*40% locally advanced


==Pathology==
*95% squamous cell CA; usually well-moderately well differentiated
*1-2% verrucous CA; bulky, exophytic, heavily keratinized

==Anatomy==
*For clinical staging, larynx consists of three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis
*The external structure is formed by hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage
*Internal structure is formed by the epiglottis and the arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform cartilages
**The epiglottis is joined superiorly to the hyoid bone by the hyoepiglottic ligament and inferiorly to the thyroid cartilage by the thyroepiglottic ligament (just below the thyroid notch and above the anterior commissure)
**The vocal ligaments and muscles attach to the vocal process of the arytenoid posteriorly and the thyroid cartilage anteriorly. Beneath the epithelium of the free edge of the vocal cord is the lamina propria
**The intrinsic muscles of the larynx control the movement of the cords; the extrinsic muscles control primarily swallowing. The intrinsic muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, except for cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve
*Supraglottis:
**Sites: Suprahyoid epiglottis (suprahyoid and infrahyoid), aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, false cords
**Inferior border: horizontal plane passing through lateral margin of the ventricle
**Lymphatics: Rich network, pass through thyrohyoid membrane into subdigastric, midjugular, and lower jugular nodes
*Glottis
**Sites: true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures 
**Vocal cords are 3-5 mm thick
**Inferior border: 5 mm below free margin of vocal cords
**Horizontal plane 1 cm in thickness
**Lymphatics: True vocal cords don't have any; lymphatic spread via tumor extension to supraglottis or subglottis
*Subglottis
**Anatomy: 5mm below the free margin of true vocal cords to inferior margin of cricoid cartilage
*Lymphatics: 
**Larynx is formed from two embryologically defined regions, separate at laryngeal ventricle, with different lymphatic patterns
**Supraglottis forms from primitive buccopharyngeal anlage and as such has rich lymphatics that drain to upper internal jugular LNs. Supraglottic tumors have therefore much higher incidence of nodal mets at presentation
**Glottis and subglottis form from tracheobronchial buds and as such have sparse lymphatics that drain to internal jugular and paratracheal LNs. Channels unite to form one anterior and two posterolateral pedicles. Anterior drains through cricothyroid membrane into mid- and lower jugular nodes, or via prelaryngeal node into pretracheal and supraclavicular LNS. Posterior drain through cricotracheal membrane into paratracheal nodes

==Treatment Overview==
*Supraglottis
**LN+ 55% (commonly subdigastric and midjugular), 16% bilateral
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Larynx/Supraglottis|Supraglottis Page]]

*Glottis
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Larynx/Glottis|Glottis Page]]
**Most common laryngeal cancer in USA. Majority occur in anterior 2/3 of vocal cords
**Symptoms - persistent hoarseness, later dyspnea, chronic cough, hemoptysis, stridor
**LN+  &lt;2% in T1, 5% in T2, 15-20% in T3, 20-30% in T4
**Treatment:
***No randomized trials comparing surgery to RT to laser resection
***For T1-T2: local control, laryngeal preservation, and survival comparable after laser resection, RT, and partial laryngectomy. Voice quality comparable with laser resection and RT in smaller lesions, worse in larger lesions after partial laryngectomy. Therefore recommendation for T1 and T2 with normal cord mobility treated with RT or laser resection for superior voice preservation. Bulky T2 and impaired cord mobility treated with RT or partial laryngectomy
***Neck dissection in T1-T2 is controversial
**RT fields: 
***T1 and early T2 - two small opposing lateral fields centering on vocal cords, parallel to trachea. From upper thyroid notch to lower border of the cricoid (at C6). Anterior border 1 cm anterior to the skin surface at the level of vocal cords. Posterior border  to include anterior portion of posterior pharyngeal wall. 5 x 5 cm2 field usually good.

*Subglottis
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Larynx/Subglottis|Subglottis Page]]
**Primary lesions are rare (&lt;3%); usually extension from glottis. 50-70% are SCC
**Symptoms - usually asymptomatic, but can present with horseness, dyspnea, stridor
**Disease often advanced at presentation; thorcacic cavity involved in T3-T4(~50%)
**LN+ in 20-50%
**Treatment - no consensus due to small numbers, but Toronto reports good experience with primary RT
***Stage I-II: RT (include lower neck and mediastinum)
***Stage III-IV: surgery (include larynx, thyroid, parastomal LNs), post-op RT if LN+ (include lower neck and mediastinum)
**RT fields - lateral opposed fields inferiorly 2cm below primary tumor, superiorly encompassing upper jugular nodes. Also an anterior low neck and upper mediastinum T-field

==Surgery, or post-op RT==
*Overall survival for advanced (Stage III-IV) cancer treated with laryngectomy or laryngectomy + post-op RT was 0-50% at 5-years. 
*Results in functional morbidity: loss of voice, swallowing, permanent tracheostomy.
*Partial laryngectomy that spares the voice for selected T3N0 pts
*Indications for post-op RT:
**NCCN (2010)
***pT4
***N2-N3
***PNI+
***LVI+
**Perez (5th ed, p982)
***Close or positive margins
***Significant subglottic extension (1 cm or more)
***Cartilage invasion
***Perineural invasion 
***Endothelial-lined space invasion
***Extension of the primary tumor into the soft tissues of the neck
***Multiple positive neck nodes
***Extracapsular extension
***Control of subclinical disease in the opposite neck

==Larynx preservation==
*Historically, total laryngectomy was the standard of care for advanced cancers of the larynx and hypopharynx
*A landmark VA Larynx Trial showed that induction chemotherapy + RT had equivalent survival rate as total laryngectomy + postop RT. This concept was confirmed in hypopharynx by EORTC 24891, though a small GETTEC trial that closed early showed survival benefit for laryngectomy + postop RT. Larynx preservation rate was superior with RTCT (Veterans 91)
*Concurrent chemo-RT was shown to be superior to induction chemotherapy + RT or RT alone in RTOG 91-11
*T4 larynx management continues to be based on VA larynx trial. Odds ratio of responding to induction chemotherapy was 5.6 for T1-3 vs T4 (p=0.01), and in the subset of patients who then underwent RT, salvage laryngectomy was required in 56% vs. in 28% of T3 tumors. However, the absolute number of these patients was very small. In clinical practice, patients with T4 larynx are not typically considered candidates for larynx preservation


===Prognostic factors===
'''Size:'''
*'''University of Florida''', 1997 (1966-94) - PMID 9196155 &amp;mdash; &quot;Definitive radiotherapy for T3 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx.&quot; Mendenhall WM et al. J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2394-402. 
**Volume measured by CT scan correlated with LC. 87% LC for &lt; 3.5 cm3 vs 29% for &gt; 3.5 cm3.

===Radiation alone===
*In selected patients (T3N0) results in 40-70% larynx preservation rate and survival similar to that with surgery
*In advanced cases, radiation alone (with surgical salvage) results in worse survival

===Laryngectomy + postop RT vs. Chemo-RT===
*'''Singapore''' (1996-2000) -- Surgery + postop RT vs. concurrent chemo-RT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 119 patients, resectable Stage III/IV SCHNC excluding NPC and salivary glands (larynx 32% (supraglottis 23%), oral cavity 27%, oropharynx 21%, hypopharynx 12%). T4 56%. Arm 1) surgery + adjuvant RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) RT 66/33 + concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. 90% received at least 1 cycle of chemo 
**'''2005''' PMID 16012523 -- &quot;Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III/IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer: a randomised comparison.&quot; (Soo KC, Br J Cancer. 2005 Aug 8;93(3):279-86.) Median F/U 6 years 
***Outcome: 3-year DFS: S+RT 50% vs. chemo-RT 40% (NS). Organ preservation (larynx/hypopharynx 68%, oropharynx 55%, oral cavity 21%). Chemo-RT group had poor surgical salvage of 47%, with no long-term survivors (possibly due to larger proportion of T4 and oral cavity cancers) 
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT not superior to surgery+RT, but can be attempted for organ preservation in larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx 

*'''GETTEC''' (1986-1989) -- total laryngectomy + postop RT vs induction chemo + RT
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped prematurely because patients refused laryngectomy.'' 68 patients. Glottic larynx, T3N0-N2b, fixed vocal cords. Supraglottic larynx or resectable disease not eligible (different population than VA Larynx trial). Arm 1) Total laryngectomy, if N0 then modified neck dissection, if N+ then radical neck dissection followed by post-op RT. Postop RT 50 Gy if SM- and LN-; else 65-70 Gy vs. Arm 2) Induction chemo cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 Q3W x3 cycles, followed by RT 65-70 Gy (36%). If tumor progression on chemo, received total laryngectomy (55%)
**'''1998''' PMID 9692058 -- &quot;Randomized trial of induction chemotherapy in larynx carcinoma.&quot; (Richard JM, Oral Oncol. 1998 May;34(3):224-8.) Median F/U 8.3 years
***Outcome: Induction 55% progressed and required laryngectomy. 2-year OS induction 69% vs. laryngectomy 84% (SS)
***Conclusion: Larynx preservation cannot be considered a standard treatment at the present time

*'''VA Larynx Trial''' (1985-1989) - Total laryngectomy + postop RT vs. induction chemo + RT 
**Randomized. 332 patients. Stage III or IV (excluding T1N1) cancer of the glottic or supraglottic larynx (63% supraglottic). Arm 1) Classic wide-field total laryngectomy, regional LND + postop RT vs. Arm 2) Induction chemo (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 Q3W x3 cycles) + radical RT. If not at least a PR to chemo after 2nd cycle, underwent surgery and post-op RT. Primary RT 66-76 Gy and neck 50-75 Gy depending on nodal size. Assessed 12 weeks after RT and had salvage laryngectomy if residual disease in larynx or neck dissection for residual nodal disease. Postop RT 50 Gy to microscopic disease, 60 Gy to high risk areas, and 65-74 Gy to residual disease. 
**'''2-years; 1991''' PMID 2034244 &amp;mdash; &quot;Induction chemotherapy plus radiation compared with surgery plus radiation in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer.&quot;  (The Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group. N Engl J Med. 1991 Jun 13;324(24):1685-90.) Median F/U 2.7 years
***Outcome: 2-year OS chemo-RT 68% vs surgery+RT 68% (NS); DFS (NS) but but pattern of recurrence differed, with more recurrence at the primary site (12% vs 2%) in chemo/RT group vs more distant mets in surgery group (17% vs 11%). 
***Larynx preservation: Overall 64%. Laryngectomy 18% after induction alone, 11% after induction + RT for persistent tumor, 7% for recurrent tumor (majority within 1st year). Salvage laryngectomy T3 29% vs. T4 56% (SS), Stage III 29% vs. Stage IV 44% (SS)
***Conclusion: Induction chemotherapy and radiation can be effective in preserving larynx, without compromising survival
**'''3-years; 1993''' PMID 8221647 -- &quot;Recent advances in head and neck cancer--larynx preservation and cancer chemoprevention: the Seventeenth Annual Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award Lecture.&quot; (Hong WK, Cancer Res. 1993 Nov 1;53(21):5113-20.)
***Nice overview of larynx preservation history. 3-year outcome induction chemo 56% vs. surgery-RT 53% (NS). Survival for patients who failed induction chemo and underwent laryngectomy (18%) comparable. Larynx preservation 62%, improved swallowing.
**No difference in survival at 10 years of follow-up. (later paper)

===Chemo-RT vs. RT Alone===
*'''EORTC 24954''' (1996-2004) -- Sequential chemo-RT vs. alternating chemo-RT
**Randomized. 450 patients. Larynx T2-T4 N0-N2 (21% by AJCC staging) or Hypopharynx T2-T4 N0-N2 (79% by AJCC staging), surgical candidates for total laryngectomy not requiring flap closure. Excluded if candidates for partial laryngectomy. Arm 1) Sequential chemo-&gt;RT. Induction cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x4 cycles followed by RT 70 Gy; if stable/progression on chemo, total laryngectomy vs Arm 2) Alternating chemo-&gt;RT. Cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 200 mg/m2 x1 week -&gt; RT 20 Gy -&gt; cisplatin/5-FU x1 week -&gt; RT 20 Gy -&gt; cisplatin/5-FU x1 week (based on prior Italian randomized data)
**'''6-years; 2009''' PMID 19176454 -- &quot;Phase 3 Randomized Trial on Larynx Preservation Comparing Sequential vs Alternating Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy.&quot; (Lefebvre JL, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Jan 27. [Epub ahead of print]) Median F/U 6.5 years
***Outcome: Larynx preservation sequential 1.6 years vs. 2.3 years (NS); 5-year larynx preservation 30% vs. 36% (NS). Median OS sequential 4.4 years vs. alternating 5.1 years (NS); median PFS 3.0 vs 3.1 years (NS). DSS ~50%. Salvage surgery sequential 30% vs. alternating 22%. No difference in patterns of relapse
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 mucositis sequential 32% vs. alternating 21%; late fibrosis 16% vs. 11%
***Conclusion: Both strategies valid for larynx preservation
***Editorial (PMID 19176460): larynx preservation defined as survival with larynx without tumor, tracheotomy or use of feeding tube, which gives these states equal utility as death; other issues with endpoints used for larynx preservation. Need a common standardized endpoint

*'''RTOG 91-11 / Intergroup''' (1992-2000) -- Sequential chemo -&gt; RT vs. concurrent chemo-RT vs. RT alone
**Randomized, 3 arms. 518/547 patients. Stage III or IV cancers of the glottic or supraglottic larynx, which would require total laryngectomy. Excluded T1 and large volume T4 (penetrating through cartilage or &gt;1cm into BOT). Arm 1) Induction cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU C.I. 1000 mg/m2 Q3W x3 cycles, followed by RT (if CR or PR) or laryngectomy if poor response (this Arm based on results of the VA Larynx trial) vs. Arm 2) Concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W + RT vs. Arm 3) RT alone. RT dose was 70/35, elective neck and SCV 50/25. Patient in the first arm who had salvage surgery for poor response to chemo received adjuvant RT to 50-70 Gy depending on surgical margin status. Planned lymph node dissection was performed for LN &gt; 3cm or multiple lymph nodes at original staging. In induction group, 83% continued to RT and most of others received more chemotherapy or RT but not surgery. End point was preservation of larynx

***Larynx preservation: induction 72% (SS) vs. concurrent 84% vs. RT alone 67% (SS).  No benefit to induction chemo over RT alone. Laryngectomy-free survival at 2-years and 5-years was 59%/43% (induction), 66%/45% (concurrent), and 53%/38% (RT alone), with no S.S. difference between the two chemo groups  but a S.S. difference between concurrent and RT alone. There was no difference in LFS between the two chemo arms due to an increase in intercurrent deaths for the concomitant group.
***Speech &amp; swallow: 2-year moderate+ impediment induction 3% vs. concurrent 6% vs. RT alone 8% (NS)
***Outcome: 2-year OS induction 76% vs. concurrent 74% vs. RT alone 75% (NS). 5-year OS 55% vs. 54% vs. 56% (NS). LC 64% (SS) vs. 80% vs. 56% (SS), no benefit for induction over RT alone. DM induction 9% vs. chemo-RT 8% vs. RT alone 16% (SS)
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 induction chemo 24% vs. concurrent chemo 30% vs. RT alone 36% (NS); treatment-related deaths 3% vs. 5% vs. 3%
***Conclusion: Larynx preservation best with concurrent chemo; distant mets reduced by chemotherapy.

***Outcome: Total laryngectomy induction 28% vs. concurrent 16% vs. RT alone 31% (SS). Complication rate 52-59% (NS), pharyngocutaneous fistula 15-30%. LRC 74% vs. 74% vs. 90%. 2-year OS 69% vs. 71% vs. 76% (NS)
***Conclusion: Laryngectomy following organ preservation treatment has acceptable morbidity. Survival not influenced by initial organ preservation strategy

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Costs'''
== Introduction ==
Price, cost and investment issues in transportation garner intense interest. This is certainly to be expected from a sector that has been subject to continued public intervention since the ninteenth century. While arguments of market failure, where the private sector would not provide the socially optimal amount of transportation service, have previously been used to justify the economic regulations which characterized the airline, bus, trucking, and rail industries, it is now generally agreed, and supported by empirical evidence, that the move to a deregulated system, in which the structure and conduct of the different modes are a result of the interplay of market forces occurring within and between modes, will result in greater efficiency and service.

Many factors have led to a reexamination of where, and in which mode, transportation investments should take place. First, and perhaps most importantly, is the general move to place traditional government activities in a market setting. The privatization  and corporatization of roadways and parts of the aviation systems are good examples of this phenomenon. Second, there is now a continual and increasing  fiscal pressure exerted on all parts of the economy as the nation reduces the proportion of the economy’s resources which are appropriated by government. Third, there is increasing pressure to fully reflect the environmental, noise, congestion,  and safety costs in prices paid by transportation system users. Finally, there is an avid interest  in the prospect of new modes like high speed rail (HSR) to relieve airport congestion and improve in environmental quality. Such a major investment decision ought not be made without understanding the full cost implications of a technology or investment compared to alternatives. 

This chapter introduces cost concepts, and evidence on internal costs. The chapter on [[Transportation Economics/Negative externalities|Negative externalities]] reviews external costs.

== Supply ==
In imperfectly competitive markets, there is no one-to-one relation  between P and Q supplied, i.e., no supply curve.   Each firm makes supply quantity decision which maximises profit, taking into account the nature of competition (more on this in pricing section).

Supply function (curve).  specifies the relationship between price and output supplied in the market.  In a perfectly competitive market, the supply curve is well defined.
Much of the work in transportation supply does not estimate Supply-curve.  Instead, focus is on studying behaviour of the aggregate costs (in relation to outputs) and to devising the procedure for estimating costs for specific services (or traffic).  Transport economists normally call the former as aggregate costing and the latter as disaggregate costing.  For aggregate costing, all of the cost concepts developed in micro-economics can be directly applied.

== Types of Costs ==

There are many types of costs. Key terms and brief definitions are below.

* ''Fixed costs'' (&lt;math&gt;C_F&lt;/math&gt;): The costs which do not vary with output.
* ''Variable costs'' (&lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt;): The costs which change as output levels are changed. The classification of costs as variable or fixed is a function of both the length of the time horizon and the extent of indivisibility over the range of output considered.
* ''Total costs'' (&lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt;): Total expenditures required to achieve a given level of output (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;). 
** Total costs = fixed costs + variable costs. = a + bQ
* ''Average costs'': The total cost divided by the level of output.
** ''Average Cost  for a single product firm'': &lt;math&gt;C_A = C_T/Q&lt;/math&gt;, 
*** Average fixed cost = &lt;math&gt;a/Q&lt;/math&gt;
***  Average variable cost = &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
** ''Average Cost for a multi-product firm'' is not obvious (i.e. which output),  two methods 
*** ''Ray average cost'': Fix the output proportion and then examine how costs change as the scale of output is increased along the output 'ray'.  Like moving out along a ray in output space - thus 'ray' average cost; multiproduct scale economies exists if there is DRAC (declining ray average cost). (Fixity or Variability depends on the time horizon of the decision problem and is closely related to the indivisibility of production (costs).)
*** ''Incremental average cost'': Fix all other output except one, and then examine the incremental cost of producing more ith output - thus, incremental average cost;  product-specific scale economies exist if there is DAIC (declining average incremental cost).
* ''Marginal'' (or ''incremental'') ''cost'': The derivative (difference) of Total Cost with respect to a change in output.
** Marginal Cost MC = &lt;math&gt;dC_T/dQ&lt;/math&gt; 
** Incremental Cost IC = &lt;math&gt;\Delta C_T/ \Delta Q &lt;/math&gt;
* ''Opportunity costs'': The actual opportunities forgone as a consequence of doing one thing as opposed to another. Opportunity cost represents true economics costs, and thus, must be used in all cases.
* ''Social cost'': The cost the society incurs when its resources are used to produce a given commodity, taking into account the external costs and benefits.
* ''Private cost'': The cost a producer incurs in getting the resources used in production.

=== Shared costs ===
The production of transport services in most modes involves joint and common costs.  A joint cost occurs when the production of one good inevitably results in the production of another good in some fixed proportion.  For example, consider a rail line running only from point A to point B.  The movement of a train from A to B will result in a return movement from B to A.  Since the trip from A to B inevitably results in the costs of the return trip, joint costs arise.  Some of the costs are not traceable to the production of a specific trip, so it is not possible to fully allocate all costs nor to identify separate marginal costs for each of the joint products. For example, it is not possible to identify a marginal cost for an i to j trip and a separate marginal cost for a j to i trip. Only the marginal cost of the round trip, what is produced, is identifiable.  

Common costs arise when the facilities used to produce one transport service are also used to produce other transport services (e.g. when track or terminals used to produce freight services are also used for passenger services).  The production of a unit of freight transportation does not, however, automatically lead to the production of passenger services.  Thus, unlike joint costs, the use of transport facilities to produce one good does not inevitably lead to the production of some other transport service since output proportions can be varied.  The question arises whether or not the presence of joint and common costs will prevent the market mechanism from generating efficient prices. Substantial literature in transport economics (Mohring, 1976; Button, 1982; Kahn, 1970) has clearly shown that conditions of joint, common or non-allocable costs will not preclude economically efficient pricing.

* ''Traceable cost'' (''Untraceable cost''): A cost which can (cannot) be directly assigned to a particular output (service) on a cause-and-effect basis. Traceable (untraceable) costs may be fixed or variable (or indivisible variable). Traceability is associated with production of more than one output, while untraceable costs possess either (or both) common costs and joint costs. The ability to identify costs with an aggregate measure of output supplied (e.g. the costs of a round trip journey) does not imply that the costs are traceable to specific services provided.
* ''Joint cost'': A cost which is incurred simultaneously during the production for two or more products, where it is not possible to separate the contributions between beneficaries. These may be fixed or variable. (e.g. cow hides and cow steaks)
* ''Common cost'': A cost which is incurred simultaneously for a whole organization, where it cannot be allocated directly to any particular product. These may be fixed or variable. (e.g. the farm's driveway)


=== External and Internal Costs ===
''External costs are discussed more in [[Transportation Economics/Negative externalities|Negative externalities]]

Economics has a long tradition of distinguishing those costs which are fully internalized by economic agents (internal or private costs) and those which are not (external or social costs). The difference comes from the way that economics views the series of interrelated markets. Agents (individuals, households, firms and governments) in these markets interact by buying and selling goods are services, as inputs to and outputs from production.  A firm pays an individual for labor services performed and that individual pays the grocery store for the food purchased and the grocery store pays the utility for the electricity and heat it uses in the store. Through these market transactions, the cost of providing the good or service in each case is reflected in the price which one agent pays to another. As long as these prices reflect all costs, markets will provide the required, desirable, and economically efficient amount of the good or service in question. 

The interaction of economic agents, the costs and benefits they convey or impose on one another are fully reflected in the prices which are charged. However, when the actions of one economic agent alter the environment of another economic agent, there is an externality. An action by which one consumers purchase changes the prices paid by another is dubbed a ''pecuniary externality'' and is not analyzed here further; rather it is the non-pecuniary externalities with which we are concerned. More formally, &quot;an externality refers to a commodity bundle that is supplied by an economic agent to another economic agent in the absence of any related economic transaction between the agents&quot; (Spulber, 1989). &lt;ref&gt;Spulber, D. (1989), Regulation and Markets, The MIT Press Cambridge, 	Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this definition requires that there not be any transaction or negotiation between either of the two agents. The essential distinction which is made is harm committed between strangers which is an external cost and harm committed between parties in an economic transaction which is an internal cost. A factory which emits smoke forcing nearby residents to clean their clothes, cars and windows more often, and using real resources to do so, is generating an externality or, if we return to our example above, the grocery store is generating an externality if it generates a lot of garbage in the surrounding area, forcing nearby residents to spend time and money cleaning their yards and street.

There are alternative solutions proposed for the mitigation of these externalities. One is to use pricing to internalize the externalities; that is, including the cost which the externalities impose in the price of the product/service which generate them. If in fact the store charged its customers a fee and this fee was used to pay for the cleanup we can say the externality of ‘unsightly garbage’ has been internalized. Closer to our research focus, an automobile user inflicts a pollution externality on others when the car emits smoke and noxious gases from its tailpipe, or a jet aircraft generates a noise externality as it flies its landing approach over communities near the airport.  However, without property rights to the commodities of clean air or quiet, it is difficult to imagine the formation of markets.  The individual demand for commodities is not clearly defined unless commodities are owned and have transferable property rights. It is generally argued that property rights will arise when it is economic for those affected by externalities to internalize the externalities. These two issues are important elements to this research since the implicit assumption is that pricing any of the externalities is desirable. Secondly, we assume that the property rights for clean air, safety and quiet rest with the community not auto, rail and air users. Finally, we are assuming that pricing, meaning the exchange of property rights, is possible. These issues are considered in greater detail in Chapter 3 where the broad range of estimates for the costs of the externalities are considered.

=== Other terms ===
* ''Sunk costs'': These are costs that were incurred in the past. Sunk costs are irrelevant for decisions, because they cannot be changed.
* ''Indivisible costs'': Do not vary continuously with different levels of output or must expenditures, but be made in discrete &quot;lumps&quot;. Indivisible costs are usually variable for larger but not for smaller changes in output
* ''Escapable costs'' (or ''Avoidable costs''): A cost which can be avoided by curtailing production. There are both escapable fixed costs and escapable variable costs. The escapability of costs depends on the time horizon and indivisibility of the costs, and on the opportunity costs of assets in question.

== Time Horizon ==

Once having established the cost function it must be developed in a way which makes it amenable to decision-making. First, it is important to consider the length of the planning horizon and how many degrees of freedom we have. For example, a trucking firm facing a new rail subsidy policy will operate on different variables in the ''short run'' or a period in which it cannot adjust all of its decision variables than it would over the ''long run'', the period over which it can adjust everything.

Long run costs, using the standard economic definition,  are all variable;  there are no fixed costs. However, in the short run, the ability to vary costs in response to changing output levels and mixes differs among the various modes of transportation.  Since some inputs are fixed, short run average cost is likely to continue to fall as more output is produced until full capacity utilization is reached.  Another potential source of cost economies in transportation are economies of traffic density; unit cost per passenger-kilometer decreases as traffic flows increase over a fixed network.  Density economies are a result of using a network more efficiently.  The potential for density economies will depend upon the configuration of the network.  Carriers in some modes, such as air, have reorganized their network, in part, to realize these economies.

In the long run, additional investment is needed to increase capacity and/or other fixed inputs.  The long run average cost curve, however, is formed by the envelope of the short run average cost curves.  For some industries, the long run average cost often decreases over a broad range of output as firm size (both output and capacity) expands.  This is called economies of scale.  The presence of economies at the relevant range of firm size means that the larger the size of the firm, the lower the per-unit cost of output. These economies of scale may potentially take a variety of forms in transportation services and may be thought to vary significantly according to the mode of transportation involved.



Time horizon in economic theory 
* ''Short run'': the period of time in which the input of one or more productive agents is fixed
* ''Long run'': the period of time in which all inputs are variable

actual length of the time horizon to use depends on
* the type of decision: when do the costs and benefits occur ?
* the expected life time of assets involved
* the time horizon for major transportation projects tends to be lengthy relative to that in other industries

The relationship between short and long run costs is explained by the ''envelope theorem''. That is, the short run cost functions represent the behavior of costs when at least one factor input is fixed. If one were to develop cost functions for each level of the fixed factor the envelope or lower bound of these costs would form the long run cost function. Thus, the long run cost is constructed from information on the short run cost curves. The firm in its decision-making wishes to first minimize costs for a given output given its plant size and then minimize costs over plant sizes.

In the diagram below the relationship between average and marginal costs for four different firm sizes is illustrated. Note that this set of cost curves was generated from a non-homogeneous production function. You will note that the long run average cost function (LAC) is U-shaped thereby exhibiting all dimensions of scale economies.

Mathematically

&lt;math&gt;C\left( Q \right)\equiv C_{s}\left( Q,K\left( Q \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C\left( Q \right)}{\partial Q}=\frac{\partial C_{s}\left( Q,K\left( Q \right) \right)}{\partial Q}+\frac{\partial C_{s}\left( Q,K\left( Q \right) \right)}{\partial K}\bullet \frac{\partial K\left( Q \right)}{\partial Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C_{s}\left( Q,K\left( Q \right) \right)}{\partial K}=0&lt;/math&gt;
provides the optimal plant size.

== Indicators of Aggregate Cost Behavior ==

Scale economies is the behavior of costs when the AMOUNT of an output increases while scope economies refers to the changes in costs when the NUMBER of outputs increases. 

=== Economies of Scale ===
Economies of scale refer to a long run average cost curve which slopes down as the size of the transport firm increases.  The presence of economies of scale means that as the size of the transport firm gets larger, the average or unit cost gets smaller.  Since most industries have variable returns to scale cost characteristics, whether or not a particular firm enjoys increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale depends on the overall market size and the organization of the industry.

The presence or absence of scale economies is important for the industrial structure of the mode.  If there were significant scale economies, it would imply fewer larger carriers would be more efficient and this, under competitive market circumstances, would naturally evolve over time.  Scale economies are important for pricing purposes since the greater are the scale economies, the more do average and marginal costs deviate.  It would, therefore, be impossible to avoid a deficit from long run marginal [social] cost pricing.

Another note of terminology should be mentioned.  Economics of scale is a cost concept, returns to scale is a related idea but refers to production, and the quantity of inputs needed.  If we double all inputs, and more than double outputs, we have increasing returns to scale.  If we have less than twice the number of outputs, we have decreasing returns to scale.  If we get exactly twice the output, then there are constant returns to scale. In this study, since we are referring to costs, we use economies of scale.  The presence of economies of scale does not imply the presence of returns to scale.

'''Scale''' measures long-run (fully adjusted) relationship between average cost and output.  Since a firm can change its size (network and capacity) in the long run, Economies of Scale (EoS) measures the relationship between average cost and firm size.  EoS can be measured from an estimated aggregate cost function by computing the elasticity of total cost with respect to output and firm size (network size for the case of a transport firm).

==== Returns to Scale (Output Measure) ====

Increasing Returns to Scale (RtS)
 
&lt;math&gt;f(tx_1, tx_2) &gt; t f(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Decreasing RtS 

&lt;math&gt;f(tx_1, tx_2) &lt; t f(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Economies of Scale (Cost Measure) ====

Economies of scale (EoS) represent the behavior of costs with a change in output when all factors are allowed to vary. Scale economies is clearly a long run concept. The production function equivalent is returns to scale. If cost increase less than proportionately with output, the cost function is said to exhibit economies of scale, if costs and output increase in the same proportion, there are said to be 'constant returns to scale' and if costs increase more than proportionately with output, there are diseconomies of scale.

* if cost elasticity &lt; 1, or &lt;math&gt;LRMC &lt; LRAC&lt;/math&gt; -&gt; increasing EoS  
* if cost elasticity = 1, or &lt;math&gt;LRMC = LRAC&lt;/math&gt; -&gt; constant EoS  
* if cost elasticity &gt; 1, or &lt;math&gt;LRMC &gt; LRAC&lt;/math&gt; -&gt; decreasing EoS

=== Economies of Density ===
There has been some confusion in the literature between economies of scale and economies of density.  These two distinct concepts have been erroneously used interchangeably in a number of studies where the purpose was to determine whether or not a particular mode of transportation (the railway mode has been the subject of considerable attention) is characterized by increasing economies or diseconomies of scale.  There is a distinction between density and scale economies.  Density economies are said to exist when a one percent increase in all outputs, holding network size, production technology, and input prices constant, increase the firm’s cost by less than one percent.  In contrast, scale economies exist when a one percent increase in output and size of network increases the cost by less than one percent, with production technology and input prices held constant.

Economies of density, although they have a different basis than scale economies, can also contribute to the shape of the modal industry structure.  It can affect the way a carrier will organize the delivery of its service spatially.  The presence of density economies can affect the introduction of efficient pricing in the short term, but generally not over the long term since at some point density economies will be exhausted. This, however, will depend upon the size of the market. In the air market, for example, deregulation has allowed carriers to respond to market forces and obtain the available density economies to varying degrees. 



Returns to Density similar to returns to a capacity utilization when capacity is fixed in the short run.  Since the plant size (network size for the case of transportation firms) is largely fixed in the short run, RTD measures the behavior of cost when increasing traffic level (output) given the plant size (network size).  It is measured by the cost elasticity with respect to output. 

* if cost elasticity &lt; 1, or &lt;math&gt;SRMC &lt; SRAC&lt;/math&gt;  -&gt; increasing EoD 	
* if cost elasticity = 1, or &lt;math&gt;SRMC = SRAC&lt;/math&gt; -&gt; constant EoD 	
* if cost elasticity &gt; 1, or &lt;math&gt;SRMC &gt; SRAC&lt;/math&gt; -&gt; decreasing EoD 	

Because of the presence of high fixed costs and cost of operating terminals (airports, stations, depots, etc), most transportation firms have increasing RTD.

=== Economies of Capacity Utilization ===

A subtle distinction exists between economies of density, which is a spatial concept, and economies of capacity utilization, which may be aspatial.  As a fixed capacity is used more intensively, the fixed cost can be spread over more units or output, and we have declining average cost, economies of scale.  However, as the capacity is approached, costs may rise as delays occur.  This gives a u-shaped cost curve.

While economies of scale refer to declining average costs, for whatever reason, when output increases; and economies of density refer to declining costs when output increases and the network mileage is held constant; economies of capacity utilization refers to declining costs as the percentage of capacity which is used increases, where capacity may be spatial or aspatial.

While density refers to how much space is occupied, capacity refers to how much a capacitated server (e.g. a bottleneck, the number of seats on a plane) is occupied, and may incorporate economies of density if the link is capacitated, such as a congesting roadway.  However if a link has unlimited (or virtually unlimited) capacity, such as intercity passenger trains on a dedicated right-of-way at low levels of traffic, then economy of density is a more appropriate concept.  Another way of viewing the difference is that economies of density refers to linear miles, while economies of utilization refer to lane miles.

=== Economies of Scope ===
[[Image:TE-Costs-EconomiesOfScope.png|thumb|right|400px|Economies of Scope]]

Typically, the transport firm produces a large number of conceptually distinct products from a common production facility.  In addition, the products of most transportation carriers are differentiated by time, space and quality.  Because a number of distinct non-homogeneous outputs are being produced from a common production facility, joint and common costs arise.  The presence of joint and common costs give rise to economies of scope.  There has been some confusion in the multi-product literature among the concepts of sub-additivity of the cost function, trans-ray convexity, inter-product complementarity and economies of scope.  Sub additivity is the most general concept and refers to a cost function which exhibits the characteristic that it is less costly to produce different amounts of any number of goods in one plant or firm than to sub divide the products or service in any proportion among two or more plants.  Trans-ray convexity is a somewhat narrower concept.  It refers to a cost function which exhibits the characteristic that for any given set of output vectors, the costs of producing a weighted average of the given output vectors is no greater than the weighted average of producing them on a stand alone basis.  Economies of scope refers to the cost characteristic that a single firm multi-product technology is less costly than a single product multi-firm technology.  It, therefore, is addressing the issue of the cost of adding another product to the product line.  Inter-product complementarity is a weak test of scope economies.  It refers to the effect on the marginal cost of one product when the output of some other product changes.  It, therefore, is changing the amount of output of two or more products and not the number of products.  Whether scope economies exist and the extent to which they exist depend upon both the number of products and the level of each output.  There have not been definitive empirical estimates of economies of scope for transportation modes which are based on reliable data and undertaken in a theoretically consistently fashion.

Thought Question: Most firms produce multiple products.  Why do multiple product firms exist ?   

It must be cheaper to have one firm to produce multiple products than have separate firms produce each type of product.  
&lt;/div&gt;

Economies of scope arise from shared or jointly utilised inputs, e.g., imperfectly divisible plant which if used to produce only one product would have excess capacity (freight and passenger services using same airplane, forward-back haul production using a truck or rail car, etc.).

This can be represented graphically as in the diagram on the right. In production space an isoquant would link two outputs and would have the interpretation of an isoinput line, that is, it would be the combination of outputs which are possible with a given amount of inputs. If there were economies of scope, the line would be concave to the origin, if there were economies of specialization it would be convex and if there were no scope economies it would be a straight line at 45 degrees.

Let &lt;math&gt;q = (q_1,...,q_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = number of different outputs.

Economies of scope exists if

&lt;math&gt;  c(q_1) + ... + c(q_n) &gt; c(q_1,...,q_n).  &lt;/math&gt;

That is, it is cheaper to have one firm produce all outputs than to have n separate firms produce each output &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c(q)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost for a firm to produce output &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.  


Scope economies are a weak form of 'transray convexity' and are said to exist if it is cheaper to produce two products in the same firm rather than have them produced by two different firms. Economies of scope are generally assessed by examining the cross-partial derivative between two outputs, how does the marginal cost of output one change when output two is added to the production process.



=== Changes in Cost ===
Costs can change for any number of different reasons. It is important that one is able to identify the source of any cost increase or decreases over time and with changes in the amount and composition of output. The sources of cost fluctuations include:

* density and capacity utilization; movements along the short run cost function
* scale economies; movements along the long run cost function
* scope economies; shifts of the marginal cost function for one good with changes in product mix
* technical change which may alter the level and shape of the cost function

== Characterizing Transportation Costs ==

All modes of transport experience:
* economies of vehicle size up to a point
* increasing returns in provision of way and track capacity
* economies of longer distance travelled
* rapidly rising  average cost with increased speed;
* exponentially increasing energy consumption  with speed
* difficultly in identifying the costs associated with particular traffic because of indivisibilities in production and heterogeneity of output 
* declining unit costs over a range of output because of indivisibilities,
** e.g. the backhaul problem, increase in traffic on the backhaul will reduce the average costs of the round trip operation
** indivisibilities in production give rise to &quot;kinked&quot; average cost curves and discontinuous marginal costs

== Costing ==

Costing is the method or process of ascertaining the relationship between costs and outputs in a way which is useful for making decisions (managerial, strategic, regulatory policy etc.).  There are numerous examples where detailed cost information is necessary for carriers' management decisions and government's regulatory decisions.  Also there are many carrier and government decisions requiring information about the behaviour of aggregate costs of a firm.

=== Carrier Management Decisions ===

Requiring disaggregate cost info:
* rates and rate structure decisions;
** rate setting
** shipper-carrier negotiations
* financial viability of specific services; e.g.,
** rail passenger operations,

== Aggregate Cost Analysis ==

Econometric cost functions are estimated to study the behaviour of aggregate costs in relation to the aggregate output level (economies of scale) and output mix (economies of scope).  
The aggregate cost function also allows one to estimate the changes in productive efficiency over time. 
This allows inference about the effect of regulation on productivity of an industry

=== Which Costs ===

Economic theory suggests that costs are a function of at least factor prices and outputs. In practice, calculating costs, prices, or outputs can be tricky. For example, how should capital costs be determined ? 

Capital costs may occur over one year but it is likely to be used over a long period of time.  So we should use the opportunity costs which includes depreciation and interest costs. The capital stock of a firm will vary year to year. 

Accountants tend to use historical costs which do not account for inflation. The point is that in the real world get all sorts of complications.

=== Prices and Outputs ===
For prices and outputs, a firm may use many inputs and provide many different outputs. Transportation outputs are produced over a spatial network. 
An appropriate definition of outputs is the movement of a commodity/passenger from an origin to a destination - a commodity/passenger trip. A trip from A to B is different from a trip from C to D (or B to A) even if the same distance. Ideally, a transport cost model should account for this multiproduct nature. 
But cannot specify thousands of outputs -some aggregate is necessary. Often. lack of data requires aggregation to a single output measure like ton-kilometres or passenger-kilometres.

=== Attribute Variables ===

To account for the multidimensional heterogeneous nature of outputs, one can use attribute variables such as average length of haul or average stage length. They will vary by firms. Operating characteristics such as average shipment size, average load factor, etc., also affect costs. For example, if plane or truck is not full, there is unused capacity; adding a commodity trip may incur little marginal cost; longer distances can lower AC by spreading terminal costs or takeoff fuel costs.

=== Estimation ===
Cost function Estimation requires decisions on: 
* short run vs. long run cost function
** short run cost functions from time series data;
** long run cost functions from cross-section data;
* variable vs. total cost function;
** variable cost functions are estimated by fixing some inputs such as physical plants (rail roadbed and track;  aircraft fleet, etc)
* the choice of functional form
* the choice of output measure; 
** single vs. multiple output measures
** revenue output vs. available output
* the choice of the level of aggregation of cost accounts
* the choice of attribute variables to account for heterogeneous nature of outputs being produced over time or across different firms in the sample data.

=== Difficulties with Costing ===

* multi-dimensionality and heterogeneous nature of outputs
* indivisibilities in production
* costs may not occur at the same time as the outputs being produced. eg. capital costs may over one year but it is likely to be used over several years,  and some expenses occur some time after the increases in outputs (expenses occur less frequently than changes in (train) trips), etc
* ambiguity in cost standards
* difficulty of relating past to future
** input price changes
** changes in production technology
** changes in operating conditions

== Disaggregate Costing ==

Disaggregate costing can be used to estimate the variable cost of a block of traffic, or traffic on a particular line,etc. it is useful for setting rates, investment decisions, subsidy determinations, etc. by companies themselves or government

Deductive (economic) vs inductive (engineering) approaches are used in transportation modeling, and analysis. The deductive approach uses modeling and prior relationships to specify a functional relationship which is then examined statistically. An inductive approach is based on a detailed understanding of physical processes.

Inductive Approaches
* Use of Engineering Relationships

Economic Approaches
* Average Cost Calculation using Accounting Info
* Statistical Costing

=== Engineering Costing ===

Engineering costing focuses on the amount of each input required to produce a unit of output, or the technical coefficients of production. combining such coefficients with the costs of the inputs yields the cost function for the particular output.

There are two approaches to engineering costing:
* to derive the technical coefficients from physical laws or precise engineering relationships.
* to empirically establish the technical relationship by controlled experiment.
 
* advantage
** Accuracy ? Precision?
* shortcomings:
** data- and time-intensive   costly 
** nonstochastic
** must have well defined production processes

=== Accounting Costing ===
* compiles the cost accounts categories relevant to the output or service in question, and use that information to estimate the costs associated with a specific movement.
* advantages:
** relatively cheap
** convenient
* shortcomings:
** data/information must exist
** the recorded values of assets may not be a reliable indicator of the actual opportunity costs of those assets
** the cost accounts may not distinguish fixed vs. variable costs Y over estimation of the marginal cost.
** the accounts are classified by the types of expenses, not by output type, it is difficult to uncover the true relations between cost and outputs
** the aggregation in the accounts may prevent identifying the costs which can be related to the production of particular outputs


=== Statistical Costing ===

Statistical costing employes statistical techniques (usually multiple regression analysis) to infer cost-output relationships from a sample of actual operating experiences. It makes use of accounting information.

Basic steps in statistical costing are:

(1) Decompose and identify the intermediate work units associated with the specific traffic. For example, costing 500 tons of coal from point a to b, intermediate work units may consist of line haul, switching, terminal activities, administration, etc. Explanatory variables for these activities would include ton-miles, car-miles, yard-switching miles, train-hours, gallons of fuel, etc.

(2) Establish relationship between factor inputs and the intermediate process. This can be done by direct assignment of an expense category to the work unit, if causal relation is clear. Often, expenses are common to several types of traffic, so estimate statistical relationship with regression analysis. 

For example, regression of track and roadway maintenance (TRM)

&lt;math&gt;TRM = f(\text{ton-miles, yard-switching minutes, train switching minutes, road miles})&lt;/math&gt;

(3) Apply the marginal/unit costs of the intermediate work units estimated in step (2) to the work units identified in step (1).

(4) Sum all expenses in step (3) to calculate the total avoidable cost of a block of traffic.


== Evidence on Carrier Costs ==

How do the long run concepts of economies of scale and economies of scope and the short run concepts of economies of density and economies of capacity utilization influence costs?  Why are they important to our discussion of transport infrastructure pricing?  These questions will be addressed in the following section.

=== Air Carriers ===
A considerable number of studies, Douglas and Miller (1974) &lt;ref&gt;Douglas, G. and J. Miller (1974), Economic Regulation of Domestic Air Transport: Theory and Policy, Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;, Keeler (1974) &lt;ref&gt;Keeler, T. (1974), “Railroad Costs: Returns to Scale and Excess Capacity”, Review of Economics and Statistics, 56, 201-208.&lt;/ref&gt;, Caves, Christensen and Tretheway (1984) &lt;ref&gt;Caves, D., L. R. Christensen, and M. W. Tretheway (1984), “Economies of Density versus Economies of Scale: Why Trunk and Local Service Airline Costs Differ”, Rand Journal of Economics, 15 (4), Winter, 471-489.&lt;/ref&gt;, Caves, Christensen, Tretheway and Windle (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Caves, D., L. R. Christensen, M. W. Tretheway, and R. Windle (1985), “Network Effects and the Measurement of Returns to Scale and Density for U.S. Railroads”, in Analytical Studies in Transport Economics, Daughety (ed).&lt;/ref&gt;, McShan and Windle (1989)&lt;ref&gt;McShan, S. and R. Windle (1989), “The Implications of Hub-and-Spoke Routing for Airline Costs and Competitiveness”, Logistics and Transportation Review, 35 (3), September, 209-230.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Gillen, Oum, and Tretheway (1985, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;Gillen, D.W., T.H. Oum, and M.W. Tretheway (1985), Airline Cost and Performance: Implications for Public and Industry Policies, Centre for Transportation Studies, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillen, D.W., T.H. Oum, and M.W. Tretheway (1990), “Airline Cost Structure and Policy Implications: A Multi-Product Approach for Canadian Airlines”, Journal of Transport Economics and Policy, Jan, 9-33.&lt;/ref&gt;, have been directed at determining the functional relationship between total per-unit operating costs and firm size in airlines.  All studies have shown that economies to scale are roughly constant; thus, size does not generate lower per-unit costs.  However,  generally, the measures of economies of density illustrate that unit cost would decrease for all carriers if they carried more traffic within their given network.  In other words, the industry experienced increasing returns to density.  The results also indicated that the unexploited economies of density are larger for low density carriers.
Caves, Christensen, and Tretheway (1984) have shown that it is important when measuring costs to include a network size variable in the cost function, along with output, which would allow for the distinction between economies of scale and economies of density.  McShan and Windle (1989) utilize the same data set as that used by Caves et al., and explicitly account for the hub and spoke configuration that has developed in the US since deregulation in 1978.  They estimate a long run cost function which employs all the variables included in Caves et. al., and found economies to density of about 1.35.  The hubbing variable indicates that, ceteris paribus, a carrier with 1% more of its traffic handled at hub airports expects to enjoy 0.11% lower cost than other similar carriers.

=== Intercity Buses ===
Gillen and Oum (1984)&lt;ref&gt;Gillen, D.W. and T.H. Oum (1984), “A Study of Cost Structures of The Canadian Intercity Motor Coach Industry”, Canadian Journal of Economics, 17(2), May, 369-385.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the hypothesis of no economies of scale can be rejected for the intercity bus industry in Canada; there are diseconomies of scale at the mean of the sample (0.91).  Large firms were found to exhibit strong diseconomies of scale, and small and medium sized firms exhibit slight departures from constant returns. No cost complementarities are found to exist between the three outputs, namely, number of scheduled passengers, revenue vehicle miles of charter, tour and contract services, and real revenue from freight. These results, however, may be biased since no network measure was included in the estimating equations. The scale economy measure will, therefore, contain some of the influence of available density economies.

Since deregulation of the intercity bus industries in the US and the UK., the number of firms has been significantly reduced.  In the absence of scale economies, the forces leading to this industry structure would include density economies.  We have, for example, observed route reorganization to approximate hub-and-spoke systems and the use of smaller feeder buses on some rural routes.
The industry reorganization is similar to what occurred in the airline industry.  The consolidation of firms was driven by density and not scale economies.  One significant difference between these two industries, however, is airline demand has been growing while intercity bus demand is declining.

=== Railway Services ===
The structure of railway costs is generally characterized by high fixed costs and low variable costs per unit of output.  The essential production facilities in the railway industry exhibit a significant degree of indivisibility. As with other modes, the production of railway services give rise to economies of scope over some output ranges.  For example, track and terminals used to produce freight services are also used to produce passenger services.  

Caves, Christensen and Tretheway (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Caves, D., L. R. Christensen, and M. W. Tretheway (1980), “Flexible Cost Functions for Multi-product Firm”, Review of Economics and Statistics, August, 477-481.&lt;/ref&gt; have found that the US railway industry is characterized by no economies of scale over the relevant range of outputs. However, their sample does not include relatively small railroads, firms with less than 500 miles of track.  Griliches (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Griliches, Z. (1972), “Cost Allocation in Railroad Regulation”, Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science, 3, 26-41.&lt;/ref&gt; and Charney, Sidhu and Due (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Charney, A., N. Sidhu, and J.Due (1977), “Short Run Cost Functions for Class II Railroads”, Logistics and Transportation Review, 17, 345-359.&lt;/ref&gt; have found economies scale for such small US railroads.  Friedlaender and Spady (1981) &lt;ref&gt;Friedlaender, A. F. and R. H. Spady (1981), Freight Transport Regulation: Equity, Efficiency and Competition in the Rail and Trucking Industries, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there may be very small economies of scale with respect to firm size. Keeler (1974)&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, T. (1974), “Railroad Costs: Returns to Scale and Excess Capacity”, Review of Economics and Statistics, 56, 201-208.&lt;/ref&gt;, Harris (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. (1977), “Economics of Traffic Density in the Rail Freight Industry”, Bell Journal of Economics, 8, 556-564.&lt;/ref&gt;, Friedlaender and Spady (1981) and Levin (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Levin, R. (1981), “Railroad Rates: Profitability and Welfare Under Regulation”, Bell Journal of Economics, 11, 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; have all shown that there are large economies of traffic density in the US railroad industry.  They show that, allowing all factors of production except route mileage to vary, a railway producing 10 million revenue ton-miles per mile of road, for example, will have substantially lower average costs than will a railway producing only 5 million revenue ton-miles per mile of road.  Harris (1977) estimated that approximately one-third of density economies were due to declining average capital costs, and two-thirds due to declining fixed operating costs, such as  maintenance, and administration.  Friedlaender and Spady (1981) estimate a short run cost function with five variable inputs, one quasi-fixed factor (structures) and two outputs which take the form of hedonic functions, accounting for factors such as low density route miles and traffic mixes.  The study found no economies of scale.  Caves, Christensen, Tretheway and Windle (1985) have examined economies of scale and density in the US railroads.  Their basic result demonstrates that there are substantial economies of density in the US railway operations.  

== Evidence on Infrastructure  Costs ==
As early as 1962, Mohring and Harwitz&lt;ref&gt;Mohring, Herbert D. and I. Harwitz (1962), Highway Benefits: An Analytical Framework, Northwestern University Press, Evanston, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the financial viability of an infrastructure facility, under optimal pricing and investment, will depend largely upon the characteristics of its cost function.  To quote Winston (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Winston, C. (1991), “Efficient Transportation Infrastructure Policy”, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 5 (1), Winter, 113-127.  &lt;/ref&gt;: “ If capacity and durability costs are jointly characterized by constant returns to scale, then the facility’s revenue from marginal cost pricing will fully cover its capital and operating costs.  If costs are characterized by increasing returns to scale, then marginal cost pricing will not cover costs; conversely, if costs are characterized by decreasing returns to scale, marginal cost pricing will provide excess revenue.”     

The objective of this section is to provide a summary of the theoretical and empirical literature on the cost characteristics of modal infrastructure.  The discussion will deal with the following types of infrastructure: airports, highways, and railways.

In developing a set of socially efficient prices for modes of intercity transport, it is not just the carrier’s cost structure which is important. Airports, roadways and harbors all represent public capital which is used by the carriers in the different modes to produce and deliver their modal services. This capital must also be priced in an efficient way to achieve the economic welfare gains available from economically efficient pricing. As with the carriers, the ability to apply first best pricing principles to infrastructure and still satisfy cost recovery constraints will depend upon the cost characteristics of building and maintaining the infrastructure.

As with carriers, the cost characteristics for infrastructure providers include scale economies, scope economies, density economies and utilization economies. Scale economies refer to the size of a facility; for example, is it cheaper to build three runways than it is to provide two runways? If so, there are economies of scale in the provision of runways. Scope economies encompass similar concepts as with carriers. Small, Winston and Evans (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Small, K., C. Winston, and C. Evans (1989), Road Work: A New Highway Pricing and Investment Policy, Brookings Institute, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to scope economies in highways when both capacity and durability are supplied. Capacity refers to the number of lanes while durability refers to the ability to carry heavier vehicles. A similar concept would apply to airports:  small and large aircraft, VFR and IFR traffic, and to harbors: large ships and small ships. Although rail infrastructure is currently supplied by the same firms operating the trains, there have been moves to separate infrastructure and carrier services. This separation will mean the track and terminals will have to be priced separately from carrier services. 

Density economies should also, in principle,  be evident in the provision of infrastructure. It is, for example, possible to expand outputs and all inputs for highways while holding the size of the network fixed.

Utilization economies refer to the short run cost function. They describe how quickly average and marginal costs will fall as capacity utilization approaches capacity. Although not of direct interest, they are important to consider in any cost estimation since failure to consider capacity utilization can bias upward the measures of both long run average and marginal costs.

=== Airports ===

Economists have typically assumed that capacity expansion is divisible.  Morrison (1983)&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, S. (1983), “Estimating the Long Run Prices and Investment Levels for Airport Runways”, in T. Keeler (ed), Research in Transportation Economics. Vol.1, 103-131. &lt;/ref&gt;, in his analysis of the optimal pricing and investment in airport runways, has shown that airport capacity construction is characterized by no economies of scale, and, therefore, under perfect divisibility of capacity expansion, the revenue from tolls will be exactly equal to the capital cost of capacity investment (Mohring and Harwitz, 1962).  Morrison’s results, however, were based on a sample of 22 of the busiest airports in the US and did not include any small airports.  In the literature, there is no empirical evidence on the cost characteristics of capacity construction of new small airports or capacity expansion of existing small airports (e.g. one runway).  

=== Highways ===

In general, highways produce two outputs: traffic volume which requires capacity in terms of the number of lanes, and standard axle loading which require durability in terms of the thickness of the pavement.  Prior to determining economies of scale in this multi-product case, the measure of economies of scale for each output, or the product specific economies of scale, must be examined.  Small, Winston, and Evans (1989) reported the existence of significant economies of scale associated with the durability output of roads, the ability to handle axle loads.  This is because the pavement’s ability to sustain traffic increases proportionally more than its thickness.  They also found evidence that there are slight economies of scale in the provision of road capacity; i.e. the capacity to handle traffic volume.  However, they reported diseconomies of scope from the joint production of durability and capacity because as the road is made wider to accommodate more traffic, the cost of any additional thickness rises since all the lanes must be built to the same standard of thickness.  They conclude that these three factors together result in highway production having approximately constant returns to scale.  In other words, the output-specific scale economies are offset by the diseconomies of scope in producing them jointly.  

=== Railways ===

An important difference between rail and other modes of transportation is that most railroads provide the infrastructure themselves and the pricing is undertaken jointly for carrier services and infrastructure.  However, in a few cases, ownership and/or management of the trackage has been separated from carriers.  Sweden is a good example but even in the US there have been joint running rights on tracks.  This creates a situation whereby one firm may be responsible for the provision of trackage and another for carrier services.  It is, therefore, legitimate to ask if there are any scale economies in the provision of railway infrastructure.  There are no empirical estimates but it may be possible to use some of the Small, Winston and Evans (1988) work for roads to shed some light on the issue.

Small et al. argue road infrastructure produces two outputs, durability and capacity.  The former refers to the thickness of roads and the latter to their width.  They found economies with respect to durability, but this is less likely to occur with a rail line since there would be a relatively broad range of rail car axle loading for a given level of durability of rail, ballast and ties.  Thus, there may be some minor economies.  The authors found diseconomies of scope from the joint production of durability and capacity for highways.  These diseconomies are less likely to be evident in rail due to the broad range of durability noted above and the ability to restrict usage to specific tracks.  On balance, it may be there are generally constant or minor economies in the provision of rail line infrastructure.  The output specific scale economies seem to be minor as do the diseconomies of producing them jointly.

== Factors affecting Transportation Costs== 

Transportation costs seem to be rising, There are many factors which might explain this. These are listed below. This list is no doubt incomplete, but may serve as a point of discussion.

#Standards
## Standards have risen -  Society now demands safety, features, environmental protection, access for the disabled, and quality that drive up the cost. Engineering design is often 20% of project costs.  Does the firetruck really need to do a 360 degree turn on the cul-de-sac, or can it back out?
## Smith's Man of System -  ''The man of system . . . is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse to impress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder.'' -- Adam Smith, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', 1759
## Gold-plating - Adding needless or useless features to projects. The costs of gold plating are several. Money spent on project X cannot be spent on project Y. This is the monetary opportunity cost of misallocation. Land devoted to project X cannot be devoted to project Y. More land also means greater distances to traverse. This is a spatial opportunity cost.  There is a tension between the risk of gold plating (focus on benefits to the exclusion of cost) and of corner cutting (focusing on costs to the exclusion of benefits). But there is available to us a balance, building something which maximizes the difference between benefits and costs, not just looking at benefits or costs. Insufficient attention is placed on the trade-off, too much on the ends by advocates of one side or the other.
## Design for forecast.
## The State Aid system and associated standards - Funds are collected at the state and federal levels for transportation and then a portion of that money is transferred back to local governments for transportation. Along with the money comes requirements that dictate how that money is to be used. These include engineering requirements for things such as lane width, degree of road curvature and design speed and planning requirements for things like maintaining a hierarchical road network. 
## Doing construction on facilities still in operation. - Aside from the rare bridge, it is unnecessary to keep facilities opening and operating while doing construction. This reduces construction space, reducing time, increases set-up/break-down costs, and otherwise adds to total costs. Construction is much faster (and thus cheaper) if rebuilding could be done on a closed facility. See the [[w: Tube Lines]] as the classic example of the high cost of doing construction only at night and weekends, but keeping the line in operation. The system as a whole must be reliable, meaning I can get from here to there, but that does not mean every segment must be open 24/7/365. One reason the reconstruction of the I-35W bridge was so fast as that they contractors did not need to worry about existing traffic, (and it was design/build).
## Environmental Impact Statements (Reports) lead to &quot;lock-in&quot;
## Open government/costs of democracy - The planning process is required by law to bring in as many stakeholders as possible. This has (potentially) led to transportation investment being sought and justified for non-transportation concerns. Transportation investment is now used for social, moral and economic goals that are not directly related to mobility.
## Climate change adaptation is increasing the costs of projects.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
#Scale economies
## There are in-sufficient economies of scale - When everything is bespoke, there is no opportunity for standardization and economies of scale. While many rail against cookie-cutter design, it is only with cookie-cutters that we get lots of cookies. 
## Thin markets - There is no online department store for public works. I cannot go online and buy a transit bus or an interchange. The internet has not driven down prices in this field the way it has in so many others. As a result a few vendors can collude or orchestrate higher prices than would be faced in a more competitive market.
## Peaking - Transportation agencies attempt to provide high levels of peak capacity to accommodate the demand that results from un-priced roads and highways. This is very costly capacity to provide. If tolls were charged that reflected true costs people would drive less, especially during peak hours. It would therefore cost much less to provide the economically optimal amount of peak system capacity.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
# Change of scope
## Projects are scoped wrong - We have investments that don't match actual demands. And this is not just for megaprojects. We have big buses serving few passengers. We have overgrown highways. We have a fear of building too small and having congestion or crowding so we build too big.
## Project creep - Side-payments in project development: noise walls hither and thither, etc. Side-payments are a required part of the politics of getting something built.
## &quot;Starchitecture&quot;,
## Fragmented governance leads to large and meandering projects rather than centralized projects. Politicians have to &quot;share the wealth&quot; of projects. This is perhaps a cause of &quot;project creep.&quot;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
#Principal-agent problems
## Other people's money -  Public works agencies are spending Other People's Money, and so are less motivated to get value for dollar than an individual consumer on their own. This principal-agent problem prevails in lots of organizations, but especially so in public works where the bias is not to have a failure. There was an old saying in business, no one ever got fired for buying IBM. The same holds in public works, where rocking the boat with new or innovative technologies is not sufficiently rewarded.
## Benefits are concentrated, costs are diffuse -  As a result, the known beneficiaries lobby hard for projects, but not just to build it, but to build it in a way that is expensive. Costs are diffuse, it is seldom worth the taxpayer's time to oppose a project just because of its costs, which are spread among millions of other taxpayers.  See: [[w:The Logic of Collective Action]].
## Decision-makers are remote - Remote actors cannot have precise information about local conditions, and in the absence of a free market in transportation (there is generally one buyer, who is generally a government agency), prices are not clear. As a result these remote actors misallocate because they are misinformed. This notion derives from the [[w: Economic calculation problem]]  See [[w:The Fatal Conceit]].
## Benefit cost analysis is only as good as the integrity of the data and the analysts.
## B/C analysis is not used to affect project outcomes.
## Planners and engineers are paid as percentage of total project cost.
## Formula spending reduces the incentive or need to worry much about costs. This is obviously related to many of the other hypotheses already considered but I think deserves it's own number.
## Lack of user fee funding - projects funded out of user fees are more likely to be efficient, partly because the agencies or private parties receiving those fees know the fees are limited and partly because they want to spend them in ways that will generate more fees (which means in ways that benefit users enough that the users are willing to pay for them).
## Federal funds favor capital-heavy technologies and investments. - Federal funding programs create perverse incentives that lead to very costly capital projects. Almost any project looks good if somebody else is paying for most of it. For example every year billions of dollars are spent on passenger rail projects that would never be funded were it not for generous Federal grants. Just look at the high speed rail program or the FTA New Starts program. There are examples on the highway side too, such as bridges to nowhere and freeways in rural areas with little traffic. These Federal programs, no matter how well intentioned, tip the local decision making process in favor of expensive capital projects and discourage consideration of lower cost options and policy reforms.
## Public ownership - Most of the transportation system is owned, planned, and managed by public agencies. These entities have many objectives but efficiency and cost-effectiveness are rarely a high priority. The public sector does some things well but it doesn't usually do them very efficiently. As a result transportation revenues are not always efficiently converted to transportation user benefits.
## Multi-jurisdiction -  Because transportation involves a large number of public agencies with overlapping or intertwined responsibilities planning is complex and inefficient. Projects end up with all the bells and whistles needed to satisfy the agencies and constituencies that could block a proposal. Local elected officials often load up regional plans with pet projects that do little to improve transportation system performance. There is a whole science to how public agencies bargain with each other and interact, unfortunately the results are rarely optimal from a cost-effectiveness perspective. The principal/agent problem is part of the reason for this, but only a part. In nearly every metropolitan area in the United States institutional structure results in transportation plans and policies that fall far short of the cost-effectiveness that could be achieved.
## Graft.
## Poor commissioning - Contracts determining who does what on a project are poorly written, and affect outsourced projects.
## Separation of design and build - Different firms are responsible for engineering and construction, creating high communication costs.
## Union work rules (not wages) that inhibit productivity gains through new technologies.
## Public-private partnerships trade additional up front costs for faster construction.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
# Project Duration
## Paralysis by analysis - The bureaucratic requirement to do analysis delays projects and adds costs
## Lack of upfront funds - Delays projects adds to ultimate costs.
## Lack of consensus - Political requirements for consensus add delays.
## Mismanagement and graft add to delays.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
# Other
## The highest demand areas for maintenance and new stock occur in places that are expensive.
## Envy - is a much bigger problem in public works than in personal life. - I pay taxes for those things, why does Jurisdiction X get an LRT when my neighborhood/district doesn’t? It’s a recipe for political hostages at budget time, as few political leaders have any reason to say &quot;You know, the benefit cost on a project in my district just shows the project makes no sense.&quot; It’s leads to two problems: projects that make no sense to serve some notion of geo-political equity, and project creep because if Jurisdiction X’s light rail stations had public art and golden knobs and a fountain, then my district’s light rail should have those and more. Combined with the Other People’s Money problem, this type of envy is a recipe for project creep.
## Materials are scarcer (and thus more expensive).
## Stop/start investment.
##  [[w:Ratchet effect]] - Interest groups are attracted to a particular public issue and pressure the legislative body to increase spending on that issue, but make it impossible to decrease spending on the issue.
## [[w:Baumol's cost disease]] - The rise of wages in jobs without productivity gains is caused by the necessity to compete for employees with jobs that did experience gains and hence can naturally pay higher salaries.
## Transit investment isn't realizing any productivity gains from labor. - Every dollar spent on public transportation yields 70% more jobs than a dollar spent on highways. This is used to bolster the argument that we should spend more on transit, but instead suggests we are much better at building roads than at building transit. As labor is a large proportion of total cost, transit investment has not realized productivity gains that have occurred in road building. This could be explained in part by lack of competition, low levels of total investment haven't brought new producers into the market, or a number of other reasons. I don't think the relatively high number of jobs per dollar spent necessarily means that transit investment is more virtuous. It may just be more inefficient. This is a problem with treating transport investment as industrial policy.
## Utility works are uncharged.
## Experience and Competence -  The US has no experience with high-speed rail, so there is no domestic expertise. 
## Ethos, training and prestige - Transportation engineering is more prestigious in other countries.
## Government power - Governments have more power to implement in other countries.
## Legal system - Legal systems are more amenable to infrastructure construction, including liability, bonds, and insurance.

== Introduction ==

[[Image:TransportationInputsOutputs.png|thumb|500px|Transportation inputs and outputs]]
Transportation moves people and goods from one place to another using a variety of vehicles across different infrastructure systems. It does this using not only technology (namely vehicles, energy, and infrastructure), but also people’s time and eﬀort; producing not only the desired outputs of passenger trips and freight shipments, but also adverse outcomes such as air pollution, noise, congestion, crashes, injuries, and fatalities. 

Figure 1 illustrates the inputs, outputs, and outcomes of transportation. In the upper left are traditional inputs (infrastructure (including pavements, bridges, etc.), labor required to produce transportation, land consumed by infrastructure, energy inputs, and vehicles). Infrastructure is the traditional preserve of civil engineering, while vehicles are anchored in mechanical engineering. Energy, to the extent it is powering existing vehicles is a mechanical engineering question, but the design of systems to reduce or minimize energy consumption require thinking beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. 

On the top of the ﬁgure are Information, Operations, and Management, and Travelers’ Time and Eﬀort. Transportation systems serve people, and are created by people, both the system owners and operators, who run, manage, and maintain the system and travelers who use it. Travelers’ time depends both on freeﬂow time, which is a product of the infrastructure design and on delay due to congestion, which is an interaction of system capacity and its use. On the upper right side of the ﬁgure are the adverse outcomes of transportation, in particular its negative externalities: 
* by polluting, systems consume health and increase morbidity and mortality; 
* by being dangerous, they consume safety and produce injuries and fatalities; 
* by being loud they consume quiet and produce noise (decreasing quality of life and property values); and 
* by emitting carbon and other pollutants, they harm the environment. 

All of these factors are increasingly being recognized as costs of transportation, but the most notable are the environmental eﬀects, particularly with concerns about global climate change. The bottom of the ﬁgure shows the outputs of transportation. Transportation is central to economic activity and to people’s lives, it enables them to engage in work, attend school, shop for food and other goods, and participate in all of the activities that comprise human existence. More transportation, by increasing accessibility to more destinations, enables people to better meet their personal objectives, but entails higher costs both individually and socially. While the “transportation problem” is often posed in terms of congestion, that delay is but one cost of a system that has many costs and even more benefits. Further, by changing accessibility, transportation gives shape to the development of land.

== Transportation and Production ==
Transportation is a process of production as well as being a factor input in the production function of firms, cities, states and the country. Transportation is produced from various services and is used in conjunction with other inputs to produce goods and services in the economy. Transportation is an intermediate good and as such has a &quot;derived demand&quot;. Production theory can guide our thinking concerning how to produce transportation efficiently and how to use transportation efficiently to produce other goods.


More broadly, one has ''transportation as an input'' into a production process. For example, the Gross National Product (GNP) of the economy is a measure of output and is produced with capital, labor, energy, materials and transportation as inputs. 
GNP = f(K, L, E, M, T)

Alternatively we can view ''transportation as an output'': e.g. passenger-miles of air service, ton-miles of freight service or bus-miles of transit service. These outputs are produced with inputs including transportation.

T = g(K, L, E, M,)

We will focus on the latter view in this chapter.

Production processes involve very large numbers of inputs and outputs. It is usually necessary to aggregate these in order to keep the analysis manageable; examples would include types of labor and types of transportation.

Measuring inputs and outputs 
* material inputs -- volume/mass
* human inputs--labor and users (time)
* service inputs - navigation, terminal operations
* capital inputs - physical units, monetary units (stocks &amp; flows)
* design inputs - dimensions, weight, power
* transportation - cargo trips, vehicle trips, vehicle miles, capacity miles, miles


== Characterizing Transportation Production ==

[[Image:TE-Production-DesignParameters.png|thumb|right|300px|Design Parameters in Transportation]]


In transportation, ''output'' is a &quot;service&quot; rather than product. It is not storable (capacity unused now cannot be sold later, this leads to the economics of peak/off-peak) and users participate in the production (passengers are key elements in producing the output).

''Inputs'' are supplied by carriers, users, and public:
* carriers: terminal activities, line haul activities, etc.
* users: the value of time, etc.
* public: infrastructure

Production is characterized by multidimensional (heterogeneous)  outputs. 
* quantity:  most common measures of outputs;
**  tonne-kilometres
** passenger-kilometres 
* spatial dimension - origin-destination and direction
* time dimension - transit time, peaking and seasonality
* quality of service - speed, reliability, etc.

Examples of the use of the production approach for system design considering both inputs and outputs are illustrated in the following table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Inputs
! Outputs
|- 
| dimensions
| surface area/volume carrying capacity
|-
| size, speed
| transport capacity (e.g. vehicles per hour)
|-
| system capacity, infrastructure quality
| traffic flow
|-
| capacity, vehicle movements
| O-D trips
|-
| runways, terminals
| passenger and aircraft movements
|}


''Lumpy investments'' refer to indivisibility of investments leads to complex costing and pricing. E.g you cannot build half a lane or half a runway and have it be useful.

''Sunk investments'' can constitute an entry barrier.

''Joint production'' occurs when it is  unavoidable to produce multiple outputs in fixed proportions, e.g. fronthaul-backhaul problem; there is a joint cost allocation problem. Joint costs are where the multiple products are in fixed invariant proportions.

In ''common production'', multiple outputs of varying proportions are produced using same equipment or facility - cost saving benefits, e.g. freight and passenger services using a same airplane, or using a same train. Common costs are where multiple services can be produced in variable proportions for the same cost outlay

Carriers have a structure that can be decomposed into two primary activities (Terminal and Linehaul) 

''Terminal activities'' include loading, unloading and sorting of goods (and, perhaps, pick up and delivery). The concept of speed can be important for terminals, while distance to be travelled is only of limited relevance. Terminal activities may differ depending upon the type of cargo., e.g. we see increasing returns to scale for bulk loading facilities, while it is not clear whether or not there are increasing returns to scale for facilities handing diverse product types.

''Linehaul activities'' exhibit indivisibility of output unit on the supply side due to:
* lumps of capacity and nonstorability of output (mismatch between demand and production quantity)
* joint production of backhaul capacity 
* common production; e.g., short haul markets served in conjunction with a longer haul market.

== Production Theory ==

[[Image:TE-Costs-ProductionFunction.png|thumb|right|200px|Production function]]
[[Image:TE-Costs-Isoquant.png|thumb|right|200px|Isoquants]]

Theory of production analyzes how a firm, given the given technology, transform its inputs (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) into outputs (&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) in an economically efficient manner.  A production function, &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is used to describe the relationship between outputs and inputs.

== Efficiency ==

''X-Efficiency'' is the effectiveness with which a given set of inputs are used to produce outputs. If a firm is producing the maximum output it can given the resources it employs, it is X-efficient.

''Allocative efficiency'' is the market condition whereby resources are allocated in a way that maximizes the net benefit attained through their use. In a market under this condition it is impossible for an individual to be made better off without making another individual worse off.

''Technical efficiency''  refers to the ability to produce a given output with the least amount of inputs or equivalently, to operate on the production frontier rather than interior to it.

== Production Possibilities Set ==
[[Image:TE-Production-PPS.png|right|thumb|200 px | Production possibilities set ]]

The Production Possibilities Set is the set  of feasible combinations of inputs and outputs. To produce a given number of passenger trips, for example, planes can refuel often and thus carry less fuel or refuel less often ands carry more fuel. Output is vehicle trips, inputs are fuel and labor.

If the production possibilities set (PPS) is convex, it is possible to identify an optimal input combination based on a single condition. However, if the PPS is not convex the criteria becomes ambiguous. We need to see the entire isoquant to find the optimum  but without convexity we can be 'myopic', as illustrated on the right.


linear homogeneous in input prices

&lt;math&gt;C\left( Q,2P_{1},2P_{2} \right)=2C\left( Q,P_{1},P_{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

marginal cost is positive for all outputs

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C}{\partial Q_{j}}&gt;0  \forall j&lt;/math&gt;. 

The derivative of the cost function with respect to the price of an input yields the input demand function.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C}{\partial P_{j}}=X\left( \bullet  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

As input prices rise we always substitute away from the relatively more expensive input.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^{2}C}{\partial P_{i}^{2}}\le 0\forall i&lt;/math&gt;

== Functional Forms ==
Production functions are relationships between inputs and outputs given some technology. A change in technology can affect the production function in two ways. First, it can alter the level of output because it affects all inputs and, second, it can increase output by changing the mix of inputs. Most production functions are estimated with an assumption of technology held constant. This is akin to the assumption of constant or unchanging consumer preferences in the estimation of demand relationships.

The functional form represents  the inputs are combined. These can range from a simple linear or log-linear (Cobb-Douglas) relationship to a the second order approximation represented by the 'translog' function. 

=== Linear ===

A linear production function is the simplest:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = A+ \alpha L+ \beta K &lt;/math&gt;

=== Quadratic ===

A quadratic production function adds squares and interaction terms.

:&lt;math&gt;Y = A+ \alpha L+\beta K + \gamma L^2 + \phi K^2 + \rho K L&lt;/math&gt;



=== Cobb-Douglas ===
''(adapted from [[w: Cobb-Douglas |Wikipedia article on the Cobb Douglas function ]] )''
&lt;!-- A utility function can take on a number of different forms. One of the more popular forms is called the Cobb-Douglas form  which is a log-linear function. It is represented as:

&lt;math&gt;U\left( x_{1}^{{}},x_{2}^{{}} \right)=x_{1}^{c}x_{2}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

For production, the Cobb-Douglas function is 

:&lt;math&gt; Y = AL^\alpha K^\beta, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Y'' = total production (the monetary value of all goods produced in a year)
* ''L'' = [[w:labour (economics)|labor]] input
* ''K'' = [[w:capital (economics)|capital]] input
* ''A'' = [[w:total factor productivity|total factor productivity]]
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the [[w:Output elasticity|output elasticities]] of labor and capital, respectively. These values are constants determined by available technology. 

Output elasticity measures the responsiveness of output to a change in levels of either labor or capital used in production, ceteris paribus. For example if &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0.15 &lt;/math&gt;, a 1% increase in labor would lead to approximately a 0.15% increase in output. 

Further, if:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta =1&lt;/math&gt; 

the production function has [[w:constant returns to scale|constant returns to scale]]. That is, if L and K are each increased by 20%, Y increases by 20%. If 

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta  &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; 

returns to scale are decreasing, and if 

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta  &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;


returns to scale are increasing. Assuming [[w:perfect competition|perfect competition]] and&lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta =1&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be labor and capital's share of output.

=== Translog ===

The translog production function is a generalization of the [[w:Cobb–Douglas|Cobb–Douglas]] production function. The name translog stands for 'transcendental logarithmic'.

The two-factor translog production function is: 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\ln(Y) &amp; = \ln(A) + a_L\ln(L) + a_K\ln(K) + b_{LL}\ln(L)\ln(L) \\
&amp; {} \qquad {} +b_{KK}\ln(K)\ln(K) + b_{LK}\ln(L)\ln(K) \\
&amp;  = f(L,K).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' = labor, ''K'' = capital, and ''Y'' = product.

=== CES (constant elasticity of substitution) ===

[[w:Constant elasticity of substitution|Constant elasticity of substitution]] (CES) function: &lt;math&gt; Y = A[\alpha K^\gamma + (1-\alpha) L^\gamma]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a Cobb–Douglas function, &lt;math&gt;Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--
This function describes production, usually at a macroeconomic level, with two inputs which are usually capital and labor. As defined by Arrow, Chenery, Minhas, and Solow, 1961 (p. 230), it is written as 

&lt;math&gt; V = (\beta*K-\rho + \alpha*L-\rho) -(1-\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
 
where 
* V = value-added, (though y for output is more common), 
* K is a measure of capital input, 
* L is a measure of labor input, and 
* the Greek letters are constants. &lt;ref&gt;http://economics.about.com/cs/economicsglossary/g/ces_p.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

=== Leontief ===
The [[w:Leontief production function|Leontief production function]] applies to situations in which inputs must be used in fixed proportions; starting from those proportions, if usage of one input is increased without another being increased, output will not change.  This production function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Y = \min (aK, \ \ bL, \ \ ...).&lt;/math&gt;

== Characteristics of a Production Function ==
[[Image:TE-Production-ProductionFunction.png|right|thumb|400px|Production Function]]

The examination of production relationships requires an understanding of the properties of production functions. Consider  the general production function which relates output to two inputs (two inputs are used only for exposition and the conclusions do not change if more inputs or outputs are  considered, it is simply messier)

&lt;math&gt;Q = f(K, L)&lt;/math&gt;



Consider fixing the amount of capital at some level and examine the change in output when additional amounts of labor (variable factor) is added. We are interested in the &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q/ \Delta L&lt;/math&gt; which is defined as the marginal product of labor and the &lt;math&gt;Q/L&lt;/math&gt; the average product  of labor. One can define these for any input and labor is simply being used as an example. 

This is a representation of a 'garden variety' production function. This depicts a short run relationship. It is short run  because at least one input is held fixed. The investigation of the behavior of output as one input is varied is instructive.

Note that average product (AP) rises and reaches a maximum where the slope of the ray, &lt;math&gt;Q/L&lt;/math&gt; is at a maximum and then diminishes asymptotically.

Marginal product (MP) rises (area of rising marginal productivity), above AP, and reaches a maximum. It decreases ( area of decreasing marginal productivity) and intersects AP at AP's maximum . MP reaches zero when total product (TP) reaches a maximum. It should be clear why the use of AP as a measure of productivity (a measure used very frequently by government, industry, engineers etc.) is highly suspect. For example, beyond &lt;math&gt;MP=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;AP&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; yet TP is decreasing. 

The principle of &quot;diminishing marginal productivity  &quot; is well illustrated here. This principle states that as you add units of a variable factor to a fixed factor initially output will rise, and most likely at an increasing rate but not necessarily) but at some point adding more of the variable input will contribute less and less to  total output and may eventually cause total output to decline (again not necessarily).

Any shifts in the fixed factor (or technology) will result in an upward shift in TP, AP and MP functions. This raises the interesting and important issue of what it is that generates output changes; changes in variable factors, technology and/or changes in technology.

== Isoquants ==

[[Image:TE-Production-Isoquant.png|right|thumb|300px|Isoquants]]
[[Image:TE-Production-TwoIsoquants.png|right|thumb|300px|Two Isoquants (Corner and Interior Solutions)]]

The isoquant reveals a great deal about technology and substitutability. Like indifference curves, the curvature of the isoquants indicate the degree of substitutability between two factors. The more 'right-angled' they are the less substitution. Furthermore, diminishing marginal product plays a role in the slope of the isoquant since as the proportions of a factor change the relative  Marginal Product's change. Therefore, substitutability is simply not a matter of the technology of production but also the relative proportions of the inputs.

Rather than consider one factor variable, consider two (or all) factors variable.

&lt;math&gt;Q=f(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Taking the total derivative and setting equal to zero

&lt;math&gt;dQ=\frac{\partial f}{\partial K}dK+\frac{\partial f}{\partial L}dL=0&lt;/math&gt;

rearranging one can see that the ratio of the marginal productivities (&lt;math&gt;\frac{MP_K} {MP_L} &lt;/math&gt;) equals &lt;math&gt;\frac{dk}{dL}&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, the isoquant is the locus of combinations of ''K'' and ''L'' which will yield the same level of output and the slope (&lt;math&gt;\frac{dk}{dL}&lt;/math&gt;) of the isoquant is equal to the ratio of marginal products.

The ratio of MP's is also termed the &quot;marginal rate of technical substitution &quot; MRTS.

As one moves outward from the origin the level of output rises but unlike indifference curves, the isoquants are cardinally measurable. The distance between them will reflect the characteristics of the production technology.

The isoquant model can be used to illustrate the solution of finding the least cost way of producing a given output or, equivalently, the most output from a given budget. The innermost budget line corresponds to the input prices which intersect with the budget line and the optimal quantities are the coordinates of the point of intersection of optimal cost with the budget line. The solution can be an interior or corner solution as illustrated in the diagrams below.

== Constrained Optimization ==
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
An example of this constrained optimization problem just illustrated is:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \text{Min cost }=\text{ }p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} \\ 
 &amp; \text{s}\text{.t}\text{. }F(x_{1},x_{2})=Q \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* f() is the production function
* Objective function (Min cost): 	desire
* Constraint (subject to):		necessity
* &lt;math&gt;x_{1},x_{2}&lt;/math&gt;: 			decision variables
&lt;/div&gt;
The method of Lagrange Multipliers is a method of turning a constrained problem into an unconstrained problem by introducing additional decision variables. These 'new' decision variables have an interesting economic interpretation.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \text{Max }g\left( {\bar{x}} \right) \\ 
 &amp; \text{s}\text{.t}\text{. }h_{j}\left( {\bar{x}} \right)=b_{j} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Lagrangian:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Max} \Lambda\left( \bar{x},\bar{\lambda } \right)=g\left( {\bar{x}} \right)-\sum{\bar{\lambda }_{j}\left( h_{j}\left( {\bar{x}} \right)-b_{j} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the maximum, take the first  derivative and set equal to zero

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial x_{i}}=\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_{i}}-\sum\limits_{j}{\lambda _{j}}\frac{\partial h_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial \lambda _{j}}=-h_{j}\left( x \right)+b_{j}=0&lt;/math&gt;

# Lagrangian is maximized (minimized)
# Lagrangian equals the original objective function
# constraints are satisfied

Lagrange multipliers represent the amount by which the objective function would change if there were a change in the constraint. Thus, for example, when used with a production function, the Lagrangian would have the interpretation of the 'shadow price' of the budget constraint, or the amount by which output could be increased if the budget were increased by one unit, or equivalently, the marginal cost of increasing the output by a unit.

=== Example ===
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \text{Min cost }=\text{ }p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} \\ 
 &amp; \text{s}\text{.t}\text{. }F(x_{1},x_{2})=Q \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;  \Lambda = p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} - \lambda ( F(x_{1},x_{2})-Q ) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial x_{1}}=-p_{\text{1}}-\lambda \frac{\partial F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)}{\partial x_{\text{1}}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial x_{2}}=-p_{\text{2}}-\lambda \frac{\partial F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)}{\partial x_{\text{2}}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial \lambda _{j}}=Q-F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{\text{1}}}{\frac{\partial F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)}{\partial x_{\text{1}}}}=\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{2}}{\frac{\partial F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)}{\partial x_{2}}}=\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{\text{1}}}{p_{2}}=\frac{\frac{\partial F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)}{\partial x_{\text{1}}}}{\frac{\partial F\left( x_{\text{1}},x_{\text{2}} \right)}{\partial x_{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

so


&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial Q}&lt;/math&gt;

is equal to the marginal cost of output.

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Conditions ===

First order conditions (FOC) are not sufficient to define a minimum or maximum. 

The second order conditions are required as well. If, however, the production set is convex and the input cost function is linear, the FOC are sufficient to define the maximum output or the minimum cost.

== Optimization ==
[[Image:TE-Production-ExpansionPath.png|thumb|right|400px|Production expansion path]]
A profit maximizing firm will hire factors up to that point at which their contribution to revenue is equal to their contribution to costs. The isoquant is useful to illustrate this point.

Consider a profit maximizing firm and its decision to select the optimal mix of factors.

&lt;math&gt;\Pi =Pf\left( K,L \right)-\left( wL+rK \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial K}=P\frac{\partial f}{\partial K}-r=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi }{\partial L}=P\frac{\partial f}{\partial L}-w=0&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates that a profit maximizing firm will hire factors until the amount they add to revenue [marginal revenue product] or the price of the product times the MP of the factor is equal to the cost which they add to the firm. This solution can be illustrated with the use of the isoquant diagram.

The equilibrium point, the optimal mix of inputs,  is that point at which the rate at which the firm can trade one input for another which is dictated by the technology, is just equal to the rate at which the market allows you to trade one factor for another which is given by the relative wage rates. This equilibrium point, should be anticipated as equivalent to a point on the cost function. Note that this is, in principle, the same as utility pace and output space in demand. It also sets out an important factor which can influence costs; that is, whether you are on the expansion path or not.



In order to move from production to cost functions we need to find the input cost minimizing combinations of inputs to produce a given output. This we have seen is the expansion path. Therefore, to move from production to cost requires three relationships:

# The production function
# The budget constraint
# The expansion path

The 'production cost function' is the lowest cost at which it is possible to produce a given output.

== Duality ==

There is a duality between the production function and cost function. This means that all the information contained in the production function is also contained in the cost function and vice-versa. Therefore, just as it was possible to recover the preference mapping from the information on consumer expenditures it is possible to recover the production function from the cost function.

Suppose we know the cost function C(Q,P') where P&quot; is the vector of input prices. If we let the output and input prices take the values C˚, P˚1 and P˚2, we can derive the production function.

1. Knowing specific values for output level and input prices means that we know the optimal input combinations since the slope of the isoquant is equal to the ratio of relative prices.

2. Knowing the slope of the isoquant we know the slope of the budget line

3. We know the output level.

We can therefore generate statements like this for any values of Q and P's that we want and can therefore draw the complete map of isoquants except at input combinations which are not optimal.

== Factor Demand Functions ==

[[Image:TE-Production-FactorDemand.png|thumb|right|400px|Factor Demand Function]]

One important concept which comes out of the production analysis is that the demand for a factor is a derived demand; that is, it is not wanted for itself but rather for what it will produce. The demand function for a factor is developed from its marginal product curve, in fact, the factor demand curve is that portion of the marginal product curve lying below the AP curve. As more of a factor is used the MP will decline and hence move one down the factor demand function. If the price of the product which the factor is used to produce the factor demand function will shift. Similarly technological change will cause the MP curve to shift.

== Input Cost Functions ==
[[Image:TE-Production-InputCostFunction.png|thumb|right|400px|Input Cost Function]]

Recall that our production function Q = f(x1, x2) can be translated into a cost function so we move from input space to dollar space. the production function is a technical relationship whereas the cost function includes not only technology but also optimizing behavior. 

The translation requires a budget constraint or prices for inputs. There will be feasible non-optimal combinations of inputs which yield a given output and a feasible-optimal combination of inputs which yield an optimal solution.

== Technical Change ==

[[Image:TE-Production-TechnicalChange.png|thumb|right|400px|Technical Change]]

Technical change can enter the production function in essentially three forms; secular, innovation and facility or infrastructure. 

Technical change can affect all factors in the production function  and thus be 'factor neutral' or it may affect factors differentially in which case it would be 'factor biased'. 

The consequence of technical change is to shift the production function up (or equivalently, as we shall see, the cost function down), it can also change the shape of the production function because it may alter the factor mix. 

This can be represented in an isoquant diagram as indicated on the right.

If relative factor prices do not change, the technical change may not result in a new expansion path, if the technical change is factor neutral, and hence it simply shifts the production function up parallel. If the technical change is not factor neutral, the isoquant will change shape, since the marginal products of factors will have changed, and hence a new expansion path will emerge.	

Types of Technical Change:
* ''secular'' - include time in production function		
* ''innovation'' -	include presence of innovation in production function
* ''facility'' - include availability of facility in production function

=== Conditions ===

First order conditions (FOC) are not sufficient to define a minimum or maximum. 

The second order conditions are required as well. If, however, the production set is convex and the input cost function is linear, the FOC are sufficient to define the maximum output or the minimum cost.

{{fsharpTitle|Pattern Matching Basics}}

'''Pattern matching''' is used for control flow; it allows programmers to look at a value, test it against a series of conditions, and perform certain computations depending on whether that condition is met. While pattern matching is conceptually similar to a series of &lt;code&gt;if ... then&lt;/code&gt; statements in other languages, F#'s pattern matching is much more flexible and powerful.

=== Pattern Matching Syntax ===

In high level terms, pattern matching resembles this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
match expr with
| pat1 -&gt; result1
| pat2 -&gt; result2
| pat3 when expr2 -&gt; result3
| _ -&gt; defaultResult
&lt;/source&gt;

Each &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; defines a condition, the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;if the condition is true, return this value...&quot;. The &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is the ''default pattern'', meaning that it matches anything, sort of like a wildcard.

Using a real example, it's easy to calculate the '''nth''' Fibonacci number using pattern matching syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec fib n =
    match n with
    | 0 -&gt; 0
    | 1 -&gt; 1
    | _ -&gt; fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)&lt;/source&gt;

We can experiment with this function in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt; fib 1;;
val it : int = 1
&gt; fib 2;;
val it : int = 1
&gt; fib 5;;
val it : int = 5
&gt; fib 10;;
val it : int = 55&lt;/source&gt;

It's possible to chain together multiple conditions which return the same value. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let greeting name =
    match name with
    | &quot;Steve&quot; | &quot;Kristina&quot; | &quot;Matt&quot; -&gt; &quot;Hello!&quot;
    | &quot;Carlos&quot; | &quot;Maria&quot; -&gt; &quot;Hola!&quot;
    | &quot;Worf&quot; -&gt; &quot;nuqneH!&quot;
    | &quot;Pierre&quot; | &quot;Monique&quot; -&gt; &quot;Bonjour!&quot;
    | _ -&gt; &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE!&quot;;;

val greeting : string -&gt; string

&gt; greeting &quot;Monique&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;Bonjour!&quot;
&gt; greeting &quot;Pierre&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;Bonjour!&quot;
&gt; greeting &quot;Kristina&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;Hello!&quot;
&gt; greeting &quot;Sakura&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alternative Pattern Matching Syntax ===
Pattern matching is such a fundamental feature that F# has a shorthand syntax for writing pattern matching functions using the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let something = function
    | test1 -&gt; value1
    | test2 -&gt; value2
    | test3 -&gt; value3&lt;/source&gt;
It may not be obvious, but a function defined in this way actually takes a single input. Here's a trivial example of the alternative syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let getPrice = function
    | &quot;banana&quot; -&gt; 0.79
    | &quot;watermelon&quot; -&gt; 3.49
    | &quot;tofu&quot; -&gt; 1.09
    | _ -&gt; nan (* nan is a special value meaning &quot;not a number&quot; *)&lt;/source&gt;

Although it doesn't appear as if the function takes any parameters, it actually has the type &lt;code&gt;string -&gt; float&lt;/code&gt;, so it takes a single &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; parameter and returns a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;. You call this function in exactly the same way that you'd call any other function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; getPrice &quot;tofu&quot;;;
val it : float = 1.09

&gt; getPrice &quot;banana&quot;;;
val it : float = 0.79

&gt; getPrice &quot;apple&quot;;;
val it : float = nan&lt;/source&gt;

==== Comparison To Other Languages ====
F#'s pattern matching syntax is subtly different from &quot;switch statement&quot; structures in imperative languages, because each case in a pattern has a return value. For example, the &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to the following C#:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
int fib(int n)
{
    switch(n)
    {
        case 0: return 0;
        case 1: return 1;
        default: return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

Like all functions, pattern matches can only have one return type.

=== Binding Variables with Pattern Matching ===
Pattern matching is not a fancy syntax for a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; structure found in other languages, because it does not necessarily match against ''values'', it matches against the ''shape'' of data.

F# can automatically bind values to identifiers if they match certain patterns. This can be especially useful when using the alternative pattern matching syntax, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec factorial = function
    | 0 | 1 -&gt; 1
    | n -&gt; n * factorial (n - 1)&lt;/source&gt;

The variable &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is a ''pattern''. If the &lt;code&gt;factorial&lt;/code&gt; function is called with a &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; patterns will fail, but the last pattern will match and bind the value to the identifier &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.

: ''Note to beginners:'' variable binding in pattern matching often looks strange to beginners, however it is probably the most powerful and useful feature of F#. Variable binding is used to decompose data structures into component parts and allow programmers to examine each part; however, data structure decomposition is too advanced for most F# beginners, and the concept is difficult to express using simple types like &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s. This book will discuss how to decompose data structures using pattern matching in later chapters.


==== Using Guards within Patterns ====
Occasionally, it's not enough to match an input against a particular value; we can add filters, or guards, to patterns using the &lt;code&gt;when&lt;/code&gt; keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let sign = function
    | 0 -&gt; 0
    | x when x &lt; 0 -&gt; -1
    | x when x &gt; 0 -&gt; 1&lt;/source&gt;

The function above returns the sign of a number: -1 for negative numbers, +1 for positive numbers, and '0' for 0:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; sign -55;;
val it : int = -1

&gt; sign 108;;
val it : int = 1

&gt; sign 0;;
val it : int = 0&lt;/source&gt;

Variable binding is useful because it's often required to implement guards.

=== Pay Attention to F# Warnings ===
Note that F#'s pattern matching works from top to bottom: it tests a value against each pattern, and returns the value of the first pattern which matches. It is possible for programmers to make mistakes, such as placing a general case above a specific (which would prevent the specific case from ever being matched), or writing a pattern which doesn't match all possible inputs. F# is smart enough to notify the programmer of these types of errors.

'''Example With Incomplete Pattern Matches'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let getCityFromZipcode zip =
    match zip with
    | 68528 -&gt; &quot;Lincoln, Nebraska&quot;
    | 90210 -&gt; &quot;Beverly Hills, California&quot;;;

      match zip with
  ----------^^^^

stdin(12,11): warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression.
For example, the value '0' will not be matched

val getCityFromZipcode : int -&gt; string&lt;/source&gt;

While this code is valid, F# informs the programmer of the possible error. F# warns us for a reason:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; getCityFromZipcode 68528;;
val it : string = &quot;Lincoln, Nebraska&quot;
&gt; getCityFromZipcode 32566;;
Microsoft.FSharp.Core.MatchFailureException:
Exception of type 'Microsoft.FSharp.Core.MatchFailureException' was thrown.
   at FSI_0018.getCityFromZipcode(Int32 zip)
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0020&gt;.$FSI_0020._main()
stopped due to error&lt;/source&gt;
F# will throw an exception if a pattern isn't matched. The obvious solution to this problem is to write patterns which are complete.

On occasions when a function genuinely has a limited range of inputs, its best to adopt this style:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let apartmentPrices numberOfRooms =
    match numberOfRooms with
    | 1 -&gt; 500.0
    | 2 -&gt; 650.0
    | 3 -&gt; 700.0
    | _ -&gt; failwith &quot;Only 1-, 2-, and 3- bedroom apartments available at this complex&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
This function now matches any possible input, and will fail with an explanatory informative error message on invalid inputs (this makes sense, because who would rent a negative 42 bedroom apartment?).

'''Example With Unmatched Patterns'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let greeting name = 
    match name with
    | &quot;Steve&quot; -&gt; &quot;Hello!&quot;
    | &quot;Carlos&quot; -&gt; &quot;Hola!&quot;
    | _ -&gt; &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE!&quot;
    | &quot;Pierre&quot; -&gt; &quot;Bonjour&quot;;;

      | &quot;Pierre&quot; -&gt; &quot;Bonjour&quot;;;
  ------^^^^^^^^^

stdin(22,7): warning FS0026: This rule will never be matched.

val greeting : string -&gt; string&lt;/source&gt;
Since the pattern &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; matches anything, and since F# evaluates patterns from top to bottom, its not possible for the code to ever reach the pattern &lt;code&gt;&quot;Pierre&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

Here is a demonstration of this code in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; greeting &quot;Steve&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;Hello!&quot;
&gt; greeting &quot;Ino&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE!&quot;
&gt; greeting &quot;Pierre&quot;;;
val it : string = &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE!&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
The first two lines return the correct output, because we've defined a pattern for &lt;code&gt;&quot;Steve&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and nothing for &lt;code&gt;&quot;Ino&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

However, the third line is wrong. We have an entry for &lt;code&gt;&quot;Pierre&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, but F# never reaches it. The best solution to this problem is to deliberately arrange the order of conditions from most specific to most general.

: ''Note to beginners:'' The code above contains an error, but it will not throw an exception. These are the worst kinds of errors to have, much worse than an error which throws an exception and crashes an app, because this error puts our program in an invalid state and silently continues on its way. An error like this might occur early in a program's life cycle, but may not show its effects for a long time (it could take minutes, days, or weeks before someone notices the buggy behavior). Ideally, we want buggy behavior to be as &quot;close&quot; to its source as possible, so if a program enters an invalid state, it ''should'' throw an exception immediately.

{{fsharpTitle|Recursion and Recursive Functions}}

A recursive function is a function which calls itself. Interestingly, in contrast to many other languages, functions in F# are not recursive by default. A programmer needs to explicitly mark a function as recursive using the &lt;code&gt;rec&lt;/code&gt; keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec someFunction = ...&lt;/source&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Factorial in F# ===
The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.

In mathematics, the factorial is defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; fact(n) =
 \begin{cases}
 1 &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
 n \times fact(n-1) &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Naturally, we'd calculate a factorial by hand using the following:
 fact(6) =
         = 6 * fact(6 - 1)
         = 6 * 5 * fact(5 - 1)
         = 6 * 5 * 4 * fact(4 - 1)
         = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * fact(3 - 1)
         = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * fact(2 - 1)
         = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * fact(1 - 1)
         = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1
         = 720

In F#, the factorial function can be written concisely as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec fact x =
    if x &lt; 1 then 1
    else x * fact (x - 1)&lt;/source&gt;

Here's a complete program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System
 
let rec fact x =
    if x &lt; 1 then 1
    else x * fact (x - 1)
 
(* // can also be written using pattern matching syntax:
let rec fact = function
    | n when n &lt; 1 -&gt; 1
    | n -&gt; n * fact (n - 1) *)
 
Console.WriteLine(fact 6)&lt;/source&gt;

=== Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) ===
The greatest common divisor, or GCD function, calculates the largest integer number which evenly divides two other integers. For example, largest number that evenly divides 259 and 111 is 37, denoted GCD(259, 111) = 37.

Euclid discovered a remarkably simple recursive algorithm for calculating the GCD of two numbers:

&lt;math&gt; gcd(x,y) =
 \begin{cases}
 x &amp; \mbox{if } y = 0 \\
 gcd(y, remainder(x,y)) &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt;= y \mbox{ and } y &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate this by hand, we'd write:
 gcd(259, 111)   = gcd(111, 259 % 111)
                 = gcd(111, 37)
                 = gcd(37, 111 % 37)
                 = gcd(37, 0)
                 = 37

In F#, we can use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; (modulus) operator to calculate the remainder of two numbers, so naturally we can define the GCD function in F# as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let rec gcd x y =
    if y = 0 then x
    else gcd y (x % y)
    
Console.WriteLine(gcd 259 111) // prints 37&lt;/source&gt;

== Tail Recursion ==
Let's say we have a function &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; which, at some point, calls function &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. When &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; finishes executing, the CPU must continue executing &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; from the point where it left off. To &quot;remember&quot; where to return, the function &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; passes a ''return address'' as an extra argument to &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; on the stack; &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; jumps back to the return address when it finishes executing. This means calling a function, even one that doesn't take any parameters, consumes stack space, and its extremely easy for a recursive function to consume all of the available memory on the stack.

A ''tail recursive'' function is a special case of recursion in which the last instruction executed in the method is the recursive call. F# and many other functional languages can optimize tail recursive functions; since no extra work is performed after the recursive call, there is no need for the function to remember where it came from, and hence no reason to allocate additional memory on the stack.

F# optimizes tail-recursive functions by telling the CLR to drop the current stack frame before executing the target function. As a result, tail-recursive functions can recurse indefinitely without consuming stack space.

Here's non-tail recursive function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let rec count n =
    if n = 1000000 then
        printfn &quot;done&quot;
    else
        if n % 1000 = 0 then
            printfn &quot;n: %i&quot; n
        
        count (n + 1) (* recursive call *)
        () (* &lt;-- This function is not tail recursive
              because it performs extra work (by
              returning unit) after
              the recursive call is invoked. *);;

val count : int -&gt; unit

&gt; count 0;;
n: 0
n: 1000
n: 2000
n: 3000
...
n: 58000
n: 59000
Session termination detected. Press Enter to restart.
Process is terminated due to StackOverflowException.&lt;/source&gt;

Let's see what happens if we make the function properly tail-recursive:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let rec count n =
    if n = 1000000 then
        printfn &quot;done&quot;
    else
        if n % 1000 = 0 then
            printfn &quot;n: %i&quot; n
        
        count (n + 1) (* recursive call *);;

val count : int -&gt; unit

&gt; count 0;;
n: 0
n: 1000
n: 2000
n: 3000
n: 4000
...
n: 995000
n: 996000
n: 997000
n: 998000
n: 999000
done&lt;/source&gt;
If there was no check for &lt;code&gt;n = 1000000&lt;/code&gt;, the function would run indefinitely. Its important to ensure that all recursive function have a ''base case'' to ensure they terminate eventually.

=== How to Write Tail-Recursive Functions ===
Let's imagine that, for our own amusement, we wanted to implement a multiplication function in terms of the more fundamental function of addition. For example, we know that &lt;code&gt;6 * 4&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;6 + 6 + 6 + 6&lt;/code&gt;, or more generally we can define multiplication recursively as &lt;code&gt;M(a, b) = a + M(a, b - 1), b &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;. In F#, we'd write this function as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let rec slowMultiply a b =
    if b &gt; 1 then
        a + slowMultiply a (b - 1)
    else
        a&lt;/source&gt;

It may not be immediately obvious, but this function is not tail recursive. It might be more obvious if we rewrote the function as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let rec slowMultiply a b =
    if b &gt; 1 then
        let intermediate = slowMultiply a (b - 1) (* recursion *)
        let result = a + intermediate (* &lt;-- additional operations *)
        result                   
    else a&lt;/source&gt;

The reason it is not tail recursive is because after the recursive call to &lt;code&gt;slowMultiply&lt;/code&gt;, the result of the recursion has to added to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Remember tail recursion needs the last operation to be the recursion.

Since the &lt;code&gt;slowMultiply&lt;/code&gt; function isn't tail recursive, it throws a &lt;code&gt;StackOverFlowException&lt;/code&gt; for inputs which result in very deep recursion:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let rec slowMultiply a b =
    if b &gt; 1 then
        a + slowMultiply a (b - 1)
    else
        a;;

val slowMultiply : int -&gt; int -&gt; int

&gt; slowMultiply 3 9;;
val it : int = 27

&gt; slowMultiply 2 14;;
val it : int = 28

&gt; slowMultiply 1 100000;;

Process is terminated due to StackOverflowException.
Session termination detected. Press Enter to restart.&lt;/source&gt;

Its possible to re-write most recursive functions into their tail-recursive forms using an accumulating parameter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let slowMultiply a b =
    let rec loop acc counter =
        if counter &gt; 1 then
            loop (acc + a) (counter - 1) (* tail recursive *)
        else
            acc
    loop a b;;

val slowMultiply : int -&gt; int -&gt; int

&gt; slowMultiply 3 9;;
val it : int = 27

&gt; slowMultiply 2 14;;
val it : int = 28

&gt; slowMultiply 1 100000;;
val it : int = 100000&lt;/source&gt;

The accumulator parameter in the inner loop holds the state our function throughout each recursive iteration.

=== Faster Fib Function ===

The following function calculates the ''nth'' number in the Fibonacci sequence:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let rec fib = function
    | n when n=0I -&gt; 0I
    | n when n=1I -&gt; 1I
    | n -&gt; fib(n - 1I) + fib(n - 2I)
&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note''': The function above has the type &lt;code&gt;val fib : bigint -&gt; bigint&lt;/code&gt;. Previously, we've been using the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;System.Int32&lt;/code&gt; type to represent numbers, but this type has a maximum value of &lt;code&gt;2,147,483,647&lt;/code&gt;. The type &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt; is used for ''arbitrary size integers'' such as integers with billions of digits. The maximum value of &lt;code&gt;bigint&lt;/code&gt; is constrained only by the available memory on a users machine, but for most practical computing purposes we can say this type is boundless.

The function above is neither tail-recursive nor particularly efficient with a computational complexity ''O(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)''. The tail-recursive form of this function has a computational complexity of ''O(n)''. Re-write the function above so that it's tail recursive.

You can verify the correctness of your function using the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
fib(0I) = 0
fib(1I) = 1
fib(2I) = 1
fib(3I) = 2
fib(4I) = 3
fib(5I) = 5
fib(10I) = 55
fib(100I) = 354224848179261915075
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Great User Page ==

Simply love it. Philip Singer is a great author who manages to discuss taboo issues with ease (I think it was ''How Are We To Live'' where he discussed the moral rights of healthy cows vs those of severely handicapped humans).

I haven't read all of your vegan books but I don't think any of them discuss the economic and ecological impact non-veganism has upon our society and planet. Maybe Philip Singer discusses this. Even if you don't care about animal rights (eg: you like to hunt to deer), the economic and ecological cost of eating meat is simply staggering and reason enough to cause any person to reduce or give up animal products.

I was also entertained by your list of programming languages. It made me think that I must be double your age, maybe more. I had my first paying programming job when I was a junior in high school in 1981 (I volunteered at the school computer lab a year before that). I think it would take me days to recall all of the programming languages that I am now or at one time was fluent in. There is simply no chance I could recall half the ones I've dabbled in. 

Without taking the time to think about it, I would guess that I've been fluent in 35-50 languages. Some of those I've just been fluent enough to write reasonable programs in. Others I've written compilers or debuggers for (I consider that very fluent). 

Just thought I'd say hi and thanks for the great page.

{{fsharpTitle|Higher Order Functions}}

A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as a parameter, or a function that returns another function as a value, or a function which does both.

=== Familiar Higher Order Functions ===

To put higher order functions in perspective, if you've ever taken a first-semester course on calculus, you're undoubtedly familiar with two functions: the limit function and the derivative function.

The limit function is defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to p}f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;

The limit function, &lt;code&gt;lim&lt;/code&gt;, takes another function &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter, and it returns a value &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; to represent the limit.

Similarly, the derivative function is defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;deriv(f(x))=\lim_{h\to 0}{f(a+h)-f(a)\over h}=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative function, &lt;code&gt;deriv&lt;/code&gt;, takes a function &lt;code&gt;f(x)&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter, and it returns a completely different function &lt;code&gt;f'(x)&lt;/code&gt; as a result.

In this respect, we can correctly assume the limit and derivative functions are higher-order functions. 
If we have a good understanding of higher-order functions in mathematics, then we can apply the same principles in F# code.

In F#, we can pass a function to another function just as if it was a literal value, and we call it just like we call any other function. For example, here's a very trivial function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let passFive f = (f 5)&lt;/source&gt;
In F# notation, &lt;code&gt;passFive&lt;/code&gt; has the following type:
: &lt;code&gt;val passFive : (int -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a&lt;/code&gt;

In other words, &lt;code&gt;passFive&lt;/code&gt; takes a function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; must take an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and return any generic type &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt;. Our function &lt;code&gt;passFive&lt;/code&gt; has the return type &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; because we don't know the return type of &lt;code&gt;f 5&lt;/code&gt; in advance.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

let square x = x * x    

let cube x = x * x * x

let sign x =
    if x &gt; 0 then &quot;positive&quot;
    else if x &lt; 0 then &quot;negative&quot;
    else &quot;zero&quot;

let passFive f = (f 5)

printfn &quot;%A&quot; (passFive square)  // 25
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (passFive cube)    // 125
printfn &quot;%A&quot; (passFive sign)    // &quot;positive&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

These functions have the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
val square : int -&gt; int
val cube : int -&gt; int
val sign : int -&gt; string
val passFive : (int -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike many other languages, F# makes no distinction between functions and values. We pass functions to other functions in the exact same way that we pass ints, strings, and other values.

==== Creating a Map Function ====
A map function converts one type of data to another type of data. A simple map function in F# looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let map item converter = converter item&lt;/source&gt;
This has the type &lt;code&gt;val map : 'a -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; takes a two parameters: an item 'a, and a function that takes an &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and returns a &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt;; map returns a &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt;.

Let's examine the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

let map x f = f x

let square x = x * x

let cubeAndConvertToString x =
    let temp = x * x * x
    temp.ToString()
    
let answer x =
    if x = true then &quot;yes&quot;
    else &quot;no&quot;

let first = map 5 square
let second = map 5 cubeAndConvertToString
let third = map true answer&lt;/source&gt;

These functions have the following signatures:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val map : 'a -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b

val square : int -&gt; int
val cubeAndConvertToString : int -&gt; string
val answer : bool -&gt; string

val first : int
val second : string
val third : string&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; function passes a datatype &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and a function with the signature &lt;code&gt;(int -&gt; int)&lt;/code&gt;; this means the placeholders &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt; in the map function both become &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s.

The &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; function passes a datatype &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and a function &lt;code&gt;(int -&gt; string)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; predictably returns a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;third&lt;/code&gt; function passes a datatype &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; and a function &lt;code&gt;(bool -&gt; string)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; just as we expect.

Since our generic code is typesafe, we would get an error if we wrote:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let fourth = map true square&lt;/source&gt;
Because the &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; constrains our function to a type &lt;code&gt;(bool -&gt; 'b)&lt;/code&gt;, but the &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; function has the type &lt;code&gt;(int -&gt; int)&lt;/code&gt;, so it's obviously incorrect.

==== The Composition Function (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; operator) ====
In algebra, the composition function is defined as &lt;code&gt;compose(f, g, x) = f(g(x))&lt;/code&gt;, denoted ''f &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; g''. In F#, the composition function is defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let inline (&lt;&lt;) f g x = f (g x)&lt;/source&gt;
Which has the somewhat cumbersome signature &lt;code&gt;val &lt;&lt; : ('b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'c&lt;/code&gt;.

If I had two functions:
: f(x) = x^2
: g(x) = -x/2 + 5

And I wanted to model ''f &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; g'', I could write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

let f x = x*x
let g x = -x/2.0 + 5.0

let fog = f &lt;&lt; g

Console.WriteLine(fog 0.0) // 25
Console.WriteLine(fog 1.0) // 20.25
Console.WriteLine(fog 2.0) // 16
Console.WriteLine(fog 3.0) // 12.25
Console.WriteLine(fog 4.0) // 9
Console.WriteLine(fog 5.0) // 6.25&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &lt;code&gt;fog&lt;/code&gt; doesn't return a value, it returns another function whose signature is &lt;code&gt;(float -&gt; float)&lt;/code&gt;.

Of course, there's no reason why the compose function needs to be limited to numbers; since it's generic, it can work with any datatype, such as &lt;code&gt;int array&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s, and so on.

There also exists the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator, which similarly performs function composition, but in reverse order. It is defined as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let inline (&gt;&gt;) f g x = g (f x)&lt;/source&gt;
This operator's signature is as follows: &lt;code&gt;val &gt;&gt; : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; ('b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'c&lt;/code&gt;.

The advantage of doing composition using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is that the functions in the composition are listed in the order in which they are called.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let gof = f &gt;&gt; g&lt;/source&gt;

This will first apply &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and then apply &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; on the result.

=== The &lt;code&gt;|&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Operator ===
The pipeline operator, &lt;code&gt;|&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is one of the most important operators in F#. The definition of the pipeline operator is remarkably simple:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let inline (|&gt;) x f = f x&lt;/source&gt;

Let's take 3 functions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let square x = x * x
let add x y = x + y
let toString x = x.ToString()&lt;/source&gt;

Let's also say we had a complicated function which squared a number, added five to it, and converted it to a string? Normally, we'd write this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let complexFunction x =
    toString (add 5 (square x))&lt;/source&gt;
We can improve the readability of this function somewhat using the pipeline operator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let complexFunction x =
    x |&gt; square |&gt; add 5 |&gt; toString&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is piped to the &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; function, which is piped to &lt;code&gt;add 5&lt;/code&gt; method, and finally to the &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method.

=== Anonymous Functions ===
Until now, all functions shown in this book have been named. For example, the function above is named &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;. F# allows programmers to declare nameless, or anonymous functions using the &lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let complexFunction =
    2                            (* 2 *)
    |&gt; ( fun x -&gt; x + 5)         (* 2 + 5 = 7 *)
    |&gt; ( fun x -&gt; x * x)         (* 7 * 7 = 49 *)
    |&gt; ( fun x -&gt; x.ToString() ) (* 49.ToString = &quot;49&quot; *)&lt;/source&gt;

Anonymous functions are convenient and find a use in a surprising number of places.

==== A Timer Function ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

let duration f = 
    let timer = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch()
    timer.Start()
    let returnValue = f()
    printfn &quot;Elapsed Time: %i&quot; timer.ElapsedMilliseconds
    returnValue
    
let rec fib = function
    | 0 -&gt; 0
    | 1 -&gt; 1
    | n -&gt; fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

let main() =
    printfn &quot;fib 5: %i&quot; (duration ( fun() -&gt; fib 5 ))
    printfn &quot;fib 30: %i&quot; (duration ( fun() -&gt; fib 30 ))

main()&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt; function has the type &lt;code&gt;val duration : (unit -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a&lt;/code&gt;. This program prints:
&lt;pre&gt;Elapsed Time: 1
fib 5: 5
Elapsed Time: 5
fib 30: 832040&lt;/pre&gt;
: ''Note'': the actual duration to execute these functions will vary from machine to machine.

=== Currying and Partial Functions ===
A fascinating feature in F# is called &quot;currying&quot;, which means that F# does not require programmers to provide all of the arguments when calling a function. For example, lets say we have a function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let add x y = x + y&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; takes two integers and returns another integer. In F# notation, this is written as &lt;code&gt;val add : int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;

We can define another function as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let addFive = add 5&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;addFive&lt;/code&gt; calls the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function with one its parameters, so what is the return value of this function? That's easy: &lt;code&gt;addFive&lt;/code&gt; returns another function which is waiting for the rest of its arguments. In this case, addFive returns a function that takes an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and returns another &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, denoted in F# notation as &lt;code&gt;val addFive : (int -&gt; int)&lt;/code&gt;.

You call &lt;code&gt;addFive&lt;/code&gt; just in the same way that you call other functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

let add x y = x + y

let addFive = add 5

Console.WriteLine(addFive 12) // prints 17&lt;/source&gt;

==== How Currying Works ====
The function &lt;code&gt;let add x y = x + y&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;val add : int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;. F# use the slightly unconventional arrow notation to denote function signatures for a reason: arrows notation is intrinsically connected to currying and anonymous functions. Currying works because, behind the scenes, F# converts function parameters to a style that looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let add = (fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; x + y) )&lt;/source&gt;

The type &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt; is semantically equivalent to &lt;code&gt;(int -&gt; (int -&gt; int))&lt;/code&gt;.

When you call &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; with no arguments, it returns &lt;code&gt;fun x -&gt; fun y -&gt; x + y&lt;/code&gt; (or equivalently &lt;code&gt;fun x y -&gt; x + y&lt;/code&gt;), another function waiting for the rest of its arguments. Likewise, when you supply one argument to the function above, say 5, it returns &lt;code&gt;fun y -&gt; 5 + y&lt;/code&gt;, another function waiting for the rest of its arguments, with all occurrences of x being replaced by the argument 5.

Currying is built on the principle that each argument actually returns a separate function, which is why calling a function with only part of its parameters returns another function. The familiar F# syntax that we've seen so far, &lt;code&gt;let add x y = x + y&lt;/code&gt;, is actually a kind of syntatic sugar for the explicit currying style shown above.

==== Two Pattern Matching Syntaxes ====
You may have wondered why there are two pattern matching syntaxes:

{|
|-
! Traditional Syntax
! Shortcut Syntax
|-
| width=&quot;50%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let getPrice food =
    match food with
    | &quot;banana&quot; -&gt; 0.79
    | &quot;watermelon&quot; -&gt; 3.49
    | &quot;tofu&quot; -&gt; 1.09
    | _ -&gt; nan
&lt;/source&gt;

| width=&quot;50%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let getPrice2 = function
    | &quot;banana&quot; -&gt; 0.79
    | &quot;watermelon&quot; -&gt; 3.49
    | &quot;tofu&quot; -&gt; 1.09
    | _ -&gt; nan
&lt;/source&gt;

|}

Both snippets of code are identical, but why does the shortcut syntax allow programmers to omit the &lt;code&gt;food&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the function definition? The answer is related to currying: behind the scenes, the F# compiler converts the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword into the following construct:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let getPrice2 =
    (fun x -&gt;
        match x with
        | &quot;banana&quot; -&gt; 0.79
        | &quot;watermelon&quot; -&gt; 3.49
        | &quot;tofu&quot; -&gt; 1.09
        | _ -&gt; nan)&lt;/source&gt;
In other words, F# treats the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword as an anonymous function that takes one parameter and returns one value. The &lt;code&gt;getPrice2&lt;/code&gt; function actually returns an anonymous function; arguments passed to &lt;code&gt;getPrice2&lt;/code&gt; are actually applied and evaluated by the anonymous function instead.

      <comment>/* Legal Issues and Communication */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Legal Issues and Communication=
In business, image is everything. Public opinion of a company affects a consumer's views on that company's products This, in turn, affects the company's public profit, and essentially its standing. When a company is involved in a lawsuit or a recall, the company has to consider the consequences that these issues will have on their business and needs to consider the costs of repairing the company's reputation. These are among the reasons certain documents are carefully reviewed before being sent to their intended readers. To write ethically, you must also identify another group of people: the individuals who will gain or lose because of your message. Collectively, these people are called ''stakeholders'' because they have a stake in what you are writing. Only by learning who these stakeholders are can you assure that you are treating them in accordance with your own ethical values. When crafting your communication think about who will be affected by what you say and how you say it. You have to be sensitive to the following language in a professional document:

•Race and gender roles

•Political correctness

•Generalizations

•Cultural awareness

•Religious symbols

Under the law, most documents written by employees represent the position and commitments of the organization itself. There are always legal issues to consider when writing a professional document and they reflect in writing style. Professional documents can serve as evidence in disputes over contracts and in product liability lawsuits. A lawsuit is a civil action brought in court. Today, the average company is involved in 400 lawsuits at any given time.  While most companies win their lawsuits, being caught in a lawsuit has many consequences. Lawsuits cost companies time and money. The money spent on lawyers and the time spent in court takes away resources a company could use for improving business and products. Lawsuits also have ramifications for a company's reputation. Recalls can be another legal problem for companies. A recall is when a product is removed from the market or a correction is made to the product because it is either defective or potentially harmful. In most cases, a recall results from an unintentional mistake by a company rather than from an intentional disregard for the law. Sometimes a company discovers a problem and recalls a product on its own. Other times a company recalls the product after concerns are made. 

There are a number of reasons why a company may face a lawsuit or a recall. One of the main reasons a company gets involved in a lawsuit is because the directions to the company's product were not clear to the consumer. For this reason, the general guideline is that instructions should be understandable, clear and concise at the fourth to sixth grade reading level. Also, when in a lawsuit, a company has to remember that all documents may be subpoenaed. This means that any document from memos and emails to proposals and studies can be subject to revision by a court of law. Another reason a company gets into a lawsuit may be over a recall. An aspect of recalls are those dealing with safety concerns. Many products are recalled for potential safety concerns, even if no one was actually hurt. To avoid safety recalls, companies need to make sure they consider every possible danger involved with a product. Some dangers may seem to be common knowledge, but companies should be aware of those and label the product accordingly, regardless of assumptions about common knowledge.

== Communication Constraints ==
Constraints are limits for documents set by the company or industry.As you gather the information that will form the basis for the way you craft your communication, you should also learn about any expectations, regulations, or other factors that may constrain what you can say and how you can say it. In the working world, expectations and regulations can affect any aspect of a communication. Aspects that affect communication are as follows: 

•Tone of voice

•Use of abbreviations

•Tables

•Margins

•Length of document (as a maximum)

It is important to find out about these constraints and take them into account as you create your communication. Some of these constraints come directly from the employer. Your employer and your readers probably have expectations about the way you write a professional document. There are often, unspoken expectations about how the required elements will be prepared. You are cultivating a company's desire for a particular corporate image, to protect its legal interests, and to preserve its competitive edge. A toy company like LEGO, would not want to be associated with a technical document that includes slang or words that could damage their reputation. They are legally protecting their business. Since all documents can be used against individuals and companies in court, all written documents with the company name should include only professional content that properly represents the company. 

Other times, constraints are set by government regulations that determine how certain reports need to be written. Regulations are laws made by the government that affect what is in a document or how a document is written. Writing constraints can originate from outside the company. For example, from government regulations that specify how patent applications, environmental impact report, and many other types of documents are to be prepared. Similarly, scientific, technical, or other professional journals have strict rules about many aspects of the articles they publish. These regulations act as standards for crafting your communication effectively.

== Style Constraints == 
 
Constraints may be set by style issues as well. There should be no clichés and idioms in documents because they may pose a problem with translating documents from one language to another. A cliché is a worn-out or overused expression that tends to sound trite and often doesn't express what you truly mean to say. Examples include: the bottom line is, head over heels, or take it or leave it. Idioms are words or expressions that are specialized vocabulary used by a group of people also known as jargon. Look at the phrases that you use when you write and see if they make sense when translated literally. If they don't, replace them with language that is clear and direct, and will not be misunderstood. Don't use &quot;compound&quot; sentences (and, or, nor, but, however, yet).Opinions and jokes should also be avoided in business documents. Communicate, argue or persuade your readers through facts and data instead of opinions. 

Many companies also like to form a &quot;custom&quot; way of writing. Companies like Microsoft want all their documents to be written in the same style and format. The only way to do this is to teach the writers the &quot;correct&quot; way to write in order to portray Microsoft. What many people may not know is that Microsoft does this to cover themselves in a legal trial.  If every single document is written using the same format, they can make sure that the customers understand the entire document and do not run into trouble with inconsistencies.

How do you know if you are following the correct constraints? The easiest way to understand how to write in your specific field is to look at documents written by your company and other companies in the industry within the past few months. This will allow you to see their style and how they make their argument. Some companies even publish style guides for writing.  By seeing your company's regulations, you can begin to draft your argument. Make sure to follow your company's guidebook (if they have one) to be sure that your style is correct with their recommendations.

Remember that in professional writing you are trying to persuade the reader using an ethical style. This means to avoiding content that will not stand up in court, especially since people file lawsuits for everything these days. Make sure that the documents you write for your company are persuasive while also preserving your company's competitive edge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Protein Structure and Function==
A protein is a functional biological molecule that is made up of one or more polypeptides that are folded/coiled into a specific structure &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;Biology, Eight Edition,Pearson, Benjamin Cummings, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;. Proteins are important macromolecules that serve as structural elements, transportation channels, signal receptors and transmitters, and enzymes.  Proteins are linear polymer that are built up of the monomer units called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acid and they are connected by a peptide bond between the carboxyl group and the amino group in a linear chain called a polypeptide. Each protein has different side chains or the &quot;R&quot; groups. Proteins have many different active functional groups attached to them to help define their properties and functions. Proteins cover a wide range of functions, ranging from very rigid structural elements to transmitting information between cells. Each person has several hundred thousands of different proteins in their body. Proteins fold into secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures based on intra-molecular bonding between functional groups or intermolecular bonding (quaternary only) and can obtain on a variety of three-dimensional shapes depending on the amino acid sequence. All proteins have primary, secondary and tertiary structures but quaternary structures only arise when a protein is made up of two or more polypeptide chains &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The folding of proteins is also driven and reinforced by the formation of many bonds between different parts of the chain. The formation of these bonds depends on the amino acid sequence. The study of their structures is important because proteins are essential for every activity in the human body as well as they are the key components of biological materials. Primary structure is when amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains. Secondary structure is when the polypeptide chains fold into regular structures like the beta sheets, alpha helix, turns, or loops. A functional protein is much more than just a polypeptide, it is one or more polypeptides that have been precisely folded into a molecule with a very specific, unique shape which is critical to its function &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. 


Proteins are usually portrayed in 3D structures and categorized into four different characteristics and levels:

[[File:Protein-primary-structure.png|right|thumb|A picture of primary structure of protein.]]

'''Primary''': The primary structure of a protein is the level of protein structure which refers to the specific sequence of amino acids &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. When two amino acids are in such a position that the carboxyl groups of each amino acid are adjacent to each other, they can be combined by undergoing a dehydration reaction which results in the formation of a peptide bond &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Amino acids in a polypeptide (protein) are linked by peptide bonds that begin with the N-terminal with a free amino group and ends at C-terminal with a free carboxyl group. rts . The peptide bond is planar and cannot rotate freely due to a partial double bond character.  While there is a restricted rotation about peptide bond, there are two free rotations on (N-C) bond and (C-C) bond, which are called torsion angles, or more specifically the phi and psi angles. The freedoms of rotation of these two bonds are also limited due to steric hindrance. Genes carry the information to make polypeptides with a defined amino acid sequence. An average polypeptide is about 300 amino acids in length, and some genes encode polypeptides that are a few thousand amino acids long. It's important to know the primary structure of the protein because the primary structure encodes motifs that are of functional importance in their biological function; structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological organization &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. 

'''Secondary''':  
The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide, together with the laws of chemistry and physics, cause a polypeptide to fold into a more compact structure. Amino acids can rotate around bonds within a protein. This is the reason proteins are flexible and can fold into a variety of shapes. Folding can be irregular or certain regions can have a repeating folding pattern. The coils and folds that result from the hydrogen bonds between the repeating segments of the polypeptide backbone are called secondary structures &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Although the individual hydrogen bonds are weak, they are able to support a specific shape for that part of the protein due to the fact that they are repeated many times over a long part of the chain &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Secondary structures of a protein are proposed by Pauling and Corey. Its structures are formed by amino acids that are located within short distances of each other. Because of the planar nature of the peptide bonds, only certain types of secondary structure exist. The three important secondary structures are α-helix, β-sheets, and β-turns. Also, the beta sheets can be parallel, antiparallel, or mixed. Antiparallel beta sheets are more stable because the hydrogen bonds are at a nighty degree angles. The a-helix is a coiled structure stabilized by intrachain hydrogen bonds. 
[[File:AlphaHelixProtein.jpg|left|thumb|One type of secondary structure, an alpha helix.]]
[[File:Betasheet.png|right|thumb|Another type of secondary structure, a beta sheet.]]



'''Characteristics of the Secondary Structures''':

1.	'''α-helix''': In an α-helix, the polypeptide backbone forms a repeating helical structure that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between a carbonyl oxygen and an amine hydrogen. These hydrogen bonds occur at regular intervals  of one hydrogen bond every fourth amino acid and cause the polypeptide backbone to form a helix &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The most common helical structure is a right-handed helix with its hydrogen bonds parallel to its axis. The hydrogen bonds are formed between carbonyl oxygen and amine hydrogen groups of four amino acid residues away. Each amino acid advances the helix, along its axis, by 1.5 Å. Each turn of the helix is composed of 3.6 amino acids; therefore the pitch of the helix is 5.4 Å. There is an average of ten amino acid residues per helix with its side chains orientated outside of the helix. Different amino acids have different propensities for forming x-helix, however proline is a helix breaker because proline does not have a free amino group. Amino acids that prefer to adopt helical conformations in proteins include methionine, alanine, leucine, glutamate and lysine (malek).

2.	'''β-sheet''': ß-sheets are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between peptide strands. In a β-sheet, regions of the polypeptide backbone come to lie parallel to each other and are connected by hydrogen bonds &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl oxygen and the amine hydrogen of amino acid in adjacent strands in a polypeptide, which means that the hydrogen bonds are inter-stand. β-sheet regions are more extended than an α-helix, and the distance between adjacent amino acids is 3.5 Å. Hydrogen bonding in β-strand can occur as parallel, anti- parallel, or a mixture. Amino acid residues in β- parallel configuration runs in the same orientation. Pleated sheets makes up the core of many globular proteins and also are dominant in some fibrous proteins such as a spiders web &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;.  The large aromatics such as: tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, and beta-branched amino acids like: isoleucine, valine, and threonine prefer to adopt β-strand conformations.This orientation is energetically less favorable because of its slanted, non-vertical hydrogen bonds. Trytophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine are hydrophobics while the other amino acids are hydrophilics. 

3.	'''β-turns''': Poly peptide chains can change direction by making reverse turns and loops. Loop regions that connect two anti-parallel β-strands are known as reverse turns or β-turns. These loop regions have irregular lengths and shapes and are usually found on the surface of the protein. The turn is stabilized by hydrogen bond between the backbone of carbonyl oxygen and amine hydrogen. The CO group of the residue, in many reverse turns, which is bonded to the NH group of residue i + 3 &lt;!-- This line and as a matter of fact this paragraph requires reference. I haven't read the entire thing it requires validation{{{(~~~~Reference required)}}} --&gt;. The interaction stabilizes abrupt changes in direction of the polypeptide chain. Unlike the alpha-helices and ß-strands, loops do not have regular periodic structures. However, they are usually rigid and well defined. Since they loops lie on the surface of the proteins, they are able to participate in interactions between proteins and other molecules. Ramachandran plot is a plot that shows the available torsion angles of where proteins can be found. However, in the plot, if there are many dots that locate all over the place, it means that there exists a loop.

'''Tertiary''': 
As the secondary structure becomes established due to the primary structure, a polypeptide folds and refolds upon itself to assume a complex three-dimensional shape called the protein tertiary structure. Tertiary structure is the overall shape of a polypeptide &lt;ref name &quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Tertiary structure results from the interactions between the side chains (R groups) of the various amino acids &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. This three dimensional structure is due to intramolecular interactions (covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and Van Der Waals interactions) between the side groups along the polypeptide chain. Its domain typically contains 300 – 400 amino acids, and it adopts a stable tertiary structure when it is isolated from their parent protein. As a polypeptide folds into its functional shape, amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains tend to end up clustered at the core of the protein so that they are out of contact with water &lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;&gt;Hector Viadiu, Protein Composition and Structure, UCSD, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;. Covalent bonds called disulfide bridges can also affect the shape of a protein &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Disulfide Bridges form where two amino acids containing sulfhydryl groups on their side chains are brought close together by how the protein is folding &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. For some proteins, such as ribonuclease, the tertiary structure is the final structure of a functional protein. Other proteins are composed of two or more polypeptides and adopt a quaternary structure. 


'''Quaternary''': 
While all proteins contain primary, secondary and tertiary structures, quaternary structures are reserved for proteins composed of two or more polypeptide chains &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Proteins that have quaternary structures contain more than one polypeptide and each adopt a tertiary structure and then assemble with each other via intermolecular interactions. The quaternary structure of a protein is the overall structure that is the result of the addition of these polypeptide subunits &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The individual polypeptides are called protein subunits, which means different polypeptides folded separately. Subunits may be identical polypeptides or they may be different. When proteins consist of more than one polypeptide chain, they are said to have quaternary structure and are also known as multimeric proteins, meaning proteins consisting of many parts. Quaternary structures can also defined as when more than one protein come together to create either a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc... &lt;ref name=Viadiu&quot;&gt;Hector Viadiu. Hemoglobin is an example of a quaternary structure that is composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits.
[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|right|thumb|A picture of Hemoglobin, one of the most well-known quaternary structure of protein.]]

== Globular and Fibrous Proteins: ==
'''Fibrous proteins''': Fibrous proteins also known as Schleroprotein are long protein chains shaped liked rodwires. Unlike Globular Protein, they do not denature as easily, and contain many repeats of secondary structures. They are mostly structural proteins that are responsible for organisms in support and protection such as forming connective tissue, muscle fibers, bones, and tendons . The two examples of fibrous proteins are:

1.	'''α –keratin''': α –keratin (essential in hair, hooves, horn, fingernails, and etc.) is a coiled-coil protein composed of two intertwining α-helices. Coiled-coil structures are found in other structural proteins, for example, the myosin of skeletal muscle; it has heptads repeats correspond to 3.5 amino acids per turn. Residues in the position of a, d, a’ and d’ in the helices of these proteins are usually hydrophobic. The two strands in a coiled-coil are held together by hydrophobic interaction as well as ionic interactions and disulfide bonds.

2.	'''Collagen''': Collagen (of tendon, cartilage, blood vessel walls) is the most abundant protein in human’s body. Collagen is a triple helix that is unlike α-helix, it has 3.3 amino acids and 10 Å per turn. Collagen is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, which is formed between the carbonyl oxygen and the amine hydrogen of amino acids situated on neighboring chains and is perpendicular to the fiber axis. It is abundant in proline, and contains hydroxyproline and hydroxlysine. However, due to the abundance of proline, there are no intrachain of hydrogen bonds, and the hydroxylation of proline and lysine requires Vitamin C. Vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy. One third of amino acids of collagen are glycine because of overcrowding; only glycines are found in the center of the collagen molecules. Collagen molecules can be cross-linked by covalent bonds to from larger fibers and sheets.

'''Globular Protein''': Globular proteins are fold to bury the hydrophobic side chains. All globular proteins have an inside where the hydrophobic core is arranged. It has an outside toward which the hydrophilic groups are directed. The uncharged polar amino acid residues are usually found on the protein surfaces but it can also occur in the interior. In the latter case, it will hydrogen bonded to other groups, i.e. ser, thr, tyr are all polar, uncharged.

== Factors that influence protein structure: ==
Several factors determine the way that polypeptides adopt their secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. The amino acid sequences of polypeptides are the defining features that distinguish the structure of one protein from another. As polypeptides are synthesized in a cell, they fold into secondary and tertiary structures, which assemble into quaternary structures for most proteins. As mentioned, the laws of chemistry and physics, together with amino acid sequence, govern this process. Five factors are critical for [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Folding|protein folding]] and stability:    

1.	'''Hydrogen bonds''': Hydrogen bonds are formed between a hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor. For amino acids, hydrogen bonding would occur between the backbone of the amine group and the oxygen of the carbonyl group.

2.	'''Ionic bonds''': Electrostatic interactions occur between two oppositely charged molecules. Ionic interactions are weaker in water than in vacuum, this is due to a different dielectric constant faced in water between opposing charges within the protein's structure.

3.	'''Hydrophobic effect''': The hydrophobic interaction originates from the tendency of non-polar molecules to minimize their interactions with water. When non-polar molecules interact with water, these molecules tend to cluster together in the center to form a micelle.

4.	'''Van der waals forces''': Van der waals forces exist between non-polar molecules at close range. Of the three van der waals interactions, interactions between permanent dipoles is the strongest, dipole-induced dipole interactions are weaker than permanent dipole and the London dispersion forces are the weakest. While van der waals forces between individual atoms are weak, the sum of van der waals forces resulting from interactions between many atoms in large macromolecules can be substantial. The strength of van der waals interactions varies with the distance between the atoms and is maximal at the van der waals contact distance. 

5.	'''Disulfide bridges''': A disulfide bond can be form between two cysteines through oxidation. These are also the strongest covalent bonds within a protein's tertiary structure.

== Protein denaturation: ==

'''Protein denaturation''': is the loss of native conformations of tertiary structure. Denaturing proteins experience either the destruction of disruption of internal tertiary or secondary structure. Denaturation however, does not break the peptide bond between adjacent amino acids, thus not affecting the primary structure of the protein. Denaturation however, will interfere the normal alpha-helix and beta sheets in a protein which ultimately distort its 3D shape.

Denaturation causes the disruption of hydrogen bonding between close proximity amino acids, thus interfering a protein's secondary and tertiary structure. In tertiary structure there are four types of bonding interactions between &quot;side chains&quot; including: hydrogen bonding, ionic bridges, disulfide bonds, and hydrophobic intermolecular interactions. In other words, there are several different conditions to denature the conformation of a protein.

'''Conditions that denature proteins''':

1.	 '''Extreme pH''' (pH &lt; 4 or pH &gt; 9) : alters H-bonding

2.	 '''Heat''' (temp &gt;70oC): thermal effect, disrupts weak forces of non-covalent bonds
	
3.	 '''Detergents or organic solvents''' : disrupts hydrophobic interaction 

4.	 '''Chaotropic agents''' (high concentrations) : e.g., urea and guanidinium chloride

==Activation of specific proteins require positioning at their specific sites==
As scientists started discovering more aspects of chemistry, they've actually found the magnitude of complexity in cell chemistry/biology. Although scientists found out that protein had an imperative role in the body, they've also discovered that the proteins assemble themselves at a specific site in the cell, being activated only when necessary. Using the GFP- tagged proteins (fluorescence) in animate cells, the positioning and repositioning of proteins were observed in response to the specific signals. When extracellular signal molecules bind to the receptor proteins, it reels in different proteins towards the inner area of the plasma membrane to create protein apparatus that will pass on the signal. 

[[Image:PDB_1cd3_EBI.jpg|The proximity created by the scaffold proteins speed up the reactions in a cell. Photo credit to &quot;Molecular Biology of the Cell.&quot; Alberts. 5th Ed|thumbnail]]

Humans have 10 PKC enzymes that differ both in their regulation and in their functions. When the PKC gets activated it will move from the cytoplasm to various intracellular locations and will eventually form specific complexes with other proteins thus allowing them to phosphorylate different protein substrates. Various ligases express this kind of behavior such as SCF ubiquitin ligases. These mechanisms involve the collaboration between protein phosphorylation and scaffold proteins that link specific activating, inhibiting, adaptor, and substrate proteins to a discrete part of a cell. 

[[Image:PDB_2bm3_EBI.jpg|scaffold proteins|left|thumbnail]]

This occurrence is called induced proximity, which describes the reason why minute different forms of the enzymes with the same reaction sites can have different functions. This can be done by covalently modifying the protein’s location in various ways. These alterations construct binding sites on the proteins so that it would bind to scaffold proteins, making them cluster together so that different reactions can take place within a specific location of a cell. Scaffolds therefore allow the cells to group reactions without the need of membranes. 

Scaffold proteins were thought to hold the proteins in specific locations relative to each other but in reality, unstructured regions of polypeptide chains connect the proteins that are interacting. This allows the proteins to frequently clash with each other in random orientations, some leading to successful reactions. The tethering of the proteins allows faster reaction rates to occur. Scaffold proteins therefore provide flexible methods of controlling the Cell Chemistry.

&lt;br&gt;

==DEAD Box Proteins==
[[Image:PDB_1vec_EBI.jpg|thumb|DEAD box RNA helicase]]

DEAD box proteins consist of RNA helicases, they are involved in RNA metabolism processes, and they are conserved in nine domains found in bacteria and viruses to humans. They are 350 amino acids in length. DEAD box proteins are involved in pre-mRNA processing, splicesosome formation, and rearranging of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. DEAD box proteins are required in the pre-mRNA splicing and the in vivo splicing process. During the pre-mRNA processing, the DEAD box proteins unwind to provide energy to rearrange the five snRNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) required in pre-mRNA splicing. In the in vivo splicing, three DEAD box proteins, Sub2, Prp28, and Prp5, are needed. Prp5 helps rearrange the conformation of U2, which allows the U2 sequence bind to the branch point sequence. Prp28 helps the recognition of the 5’ splicing location. 

The first DEAD box protein, the ElF4A translation initiation factor, are dependent on RNA ATPase activity. This protein helps unwind the secondary structure, which stops the scanning

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea: '''Add so much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the capacitor''&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;


=== Current-to-voltage C integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step1_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A humble capacitor can act as an ideal current-to-voltage integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What is the most elementary electrical integrator? Of course, this is the humble capacitor. So, if we drive a capacitor C by a constant current source I, it acts as an ideal current-to-voltage integrator with a current input I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and a voltage output V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that the output voltage changes linearly through the time.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Voltage-to-voltage RC integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step2_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;V-to-I converter + I-to-V integrator = V-to-V integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, we need usually an integrator with voltage input and voltage output (voltage-to-voltage integrator). For this purpose, we can build a compound voltage integrator just connecting a voltage-to-current converter (a resistor) before the integrator:

''V-to-I converter + I-to-V integrator = V-to-V integrator''


Only, a problem arises here - the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; across the capacitor C &quot;enervates&quot; the input voltage thus decreasing the input current. As a result, the output voltage changes exponentially through the time.

=== Active RC integrator ===

[[Image:Integrator_step3_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A remedy: connect an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage source that adds as much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the capacitor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Remember what we do in real life when an obstacle stands in our way - we remove it by an equivalent useful &quot;antidisturbance&quot;. Following this recipe, we may remove the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; by an &quot;antivoltage&quot; -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. That means to connect an additional varying voltage source and to make its voltage equal to -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; disappears and the upper point becomes a virtual ground! The compound current source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;,R is &quot;fooled&quot;: it doesn't &quot;understand&quot; that there is a capacitor connected; it &quot;thinks&quot; that its output is shorted.

[[Image:Integrator_step3a_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Only, where to take an output from?&lt;/center&gt;]]

But where to take an output from? We have three possibilities.

First, we might use the old output; but we have already destroyed this voltage!

Second, we may use the &quot;original&quot; voltage as an output. It is possible but bad solution to connect the load across the capacitor for two reasons: the load has to have a differential output; the load will shunt the capacitor thus affecting the current.

Finally, we can use the &quot;copy&quot; voltage as an output! What a great idea! First, the load will be connected to the common ground; second, it will consume energy from the supplementary source instead from the input one!

[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/build_integrator.html Building an op-amp inverting integrator] - go to step 3

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Op-amp inverting RC integrator ===

Finally, we have only to replace the varying voltage source with a real one. Now the op-amp doses the voltage of the power supply thus producing a compensating voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, the combination of an op-amp and a steady battery acts as a varying voltage source.

[[Image:Integrator_step4_whiteboard_1000.jpg|center|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;In the circuit of an op-amp inverting integrator the op-amp adds compensating voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; to the input voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The op-amp &quot;observes&quot; the potential of the virtual ground (the difference between the two voltages) and changes instantly its output voltage so that this point to stay always at zero volts. Doing that, the op-amp compensates the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage drop across the capacitor by copying and adding it to the voltage of the input source; doing that, the op-amp &quot;helps&quot; the input source.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== How to make an infinite large capacitance ==

[[Image:Ideal_capacitor_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The &quot;imperfect&quot; capacitor has become an ideal infinite one.&lt;/center&gt;]]

It's time to make conclusions. What have we actually done here? How does it operate? What is the final result?

The answer is amazing: we have made a &quot;botomless&quot; capacitor having infinite capacitance. Looking from the side of the input source this &quot;ideal&quot; capacitor acts just... as a piece of wire...?!? What do you think about this speculation? Is it always right?

We are already true magicians as we can transform any imperfect component into an almost ideal one! In this lab, we have transmuted the &quot;imperfect&quot; capacitor into a perfect infinite one  having no any voltage drop across it although a current flows continuously through it! But with the same success we can make an ideal diode, zero resistance, etc... For this purpose, we just incorporate a varying battery to the imperfect component that compensate the losses inside the component. Remember: all the op-amp inverting circuits exploit this clever trick.

{{fsharpTitle|Tuples and Records}}

=== Defining Tuples ===
A tuple is defined as a comma separated collection of values. For example, &lt;code&gt;(10, &quot;hello&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; is a 2-tuple with the type &lt;code&gt;(int * string)&lt;/code&gt;. Tuples are extremely useful for creating ad hoc data structures which group together related values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let average (a, b) =
    (a + b) / 2.0&lt;/source&gt;
This function has the type &lt;code&gt;float * float -&gt; float&lt;/code&gt;, it takes a &lt;code&gt;float * float&lt;/code&gt; tuple and returns another &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let average (a, b) =
    let sum = a + b
    sum / 2.0;;

val average : float * float -&gt; float

&gt; average (10.0, 20.0);;
val it : float = 15.0&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that a tuple is considered a single argument. As a result, tuples can be used to return multiple values:

'''Example 1''' - a function which multiples a 3-tuple by a scalar value to return another 3-tuple.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let scalarMultiply (s : float) (a, b, c) = (a * s, b * s, c * s);;

val scalarMultiply : float -&gt; float * float * float -&gt; float * float * float

&gt; scalarMultiply 5.0 (6.0, 10.0, 20.0);;
val it : float * float * float = (30.0, 50.0, 100.0)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Example 2''' - a function which reverses the input of whatever is passed into the function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let swap (a, b) = (b, a);;
val swap : 'a * 'b -&gt; 'b * 'a

&gt; swap (&quot;Web&quot;, 2.0);;
val it : float * string = (2.0, &quot;Web&quot;)

&gt; swap (20, 30);;
val it : int * int = (30, 20)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Example 3''' - a function which divides two numbers and returns the remainder simultaneously.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let divrem x y =
    match y with
    | 0 -&gt; None
    | _ -&gt; Some(x / y, x % y);;

val divrem : int -&gt; int -&gt; (int * int) option

&gt; divrem 100 20;; (* 100 / 20 = 5 remainder 0 *)
val it : (int * int) option = Some (5, 0)

&gt; divrem 6 4;; (* 6 / 4 = 1 remainder 2 *)
val it : (int * int) option = Some (1, 2)

&gt; divrem 7 0;; (* 7 / 0 throws a DivisionByZero exception *)
val it : (int * int) option = None&lt;/source&gt;

Every tuple has a property called '''arity''', which is the number of arguments used to define a tuple. For example, an &lt;code&gt;int * string&lt;/code&gt; tuple is made up of two parts, so it has an arity of 2, a &lt;code&gt;string * string * float&lt;/code&gt; has an arity of 3, and so on.

==== Pattern Matching Tuples ====
Pattern matching on tuples is easy, because the same syntax used to declare tuple types is also used to match tuples.

'''Example 1'''

Let's say that we have a function &lt;code&gt;greeting&lt;/code&gt; that prints out a custom greeting based on the specified name and/or language.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let greeting (name, language) =
    match (name, language) with
    | (&quot;Steve&quot;, _) -&gt; &quot;Howdy, Steve&quot;
    | (name, &quot;English&quot;) -&gt; &quot;Hello, &quot; + name
    | (name, _) when language.StartsWith(&quot;Span&quot;) -&gt; &quot;Hola, &quot; + name
    | (_, &quot;French&quot;) -&gt; &quot;Bonjour!&quot;
    | _ -&gt; &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
This function has type &lt;code&gt;string * string -&gt; string&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that it takes a 2-tuple and returns a string. We can test this function in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; greeting (&quot;Steve&quot;, &quot;English&quot;);;
val it : string = &quot;Howdy, Steve&quot;
&gt; greeting (&quot;Pierre&quot;, &quot;French&quot;);;
val it : string = &quot;Bonjour!&quot;
&gt; greeting (&quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot;);;
val it : string = &quot;Hola, Maria&quot;
&gt; greeting (&quot;Rocko&quot;, &quot;Esperanto&quot;);;
val it : string = &quot;DOES NOT COMPUTE&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

'''Example 2'''

We can conveniently match against the ''shape'' of a tuple using the alternative pattern matching syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let getLocation = function
    | (0, 0) -&gt; &quot;origin&quot;
    | (0, y) -&gt; &quot;on the y-axis at y=&quot; + y.ToString()
    | (x, 0) -&gt; &quot;on the x-axis at x=&quot; + x.ToString()
    | (x, y) -&gt; &quot;at x=&quot; + x.ToString() + &quot;, y=&quot; + y.ToString() ;;

val getLocation : int * int -&gt; string

&gt; getLocation (0, 0);;
val it : string = &quot;origin&quot;
&gt; getLocation (0, -1);;
val it : string = &quot;on the y-axis at y=-1&quot;
&gt; getLocation (5, -10);;
val it : string = &quot;at x=5, y=-10&quot;
&gt; getLocation (7, 0);;
val it : string = &quot;on the x-axis at x=7&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

==== &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;snd&lt;/code&gt; ====
F# has two built-in functions, &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;snd&lt;/code&gt;, which return the first and second items in a 2-tuple. These functions are defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let fst (a, b) = a
let snd (a, b) = b&lt;/source&gt;

They have the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val fst : 'a * 'b -&gt; 'a
val snd : 'a * 'b -&gt; 'b&lt;/source&gt;

Here are a few examples in FSI:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; fst (1, 10);;
val it : int = 1
&gt; snd (1, 10);;
val it : int = 10
&gt; fst (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;);;
val it : string = &quot;hello&quot;
&gt; snd (&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;);;
val it : string = &quot;world&quot;
&gt; fst (&quot;Web&quot;, 2.0);;
val it : string = &quot;Web&quot;
&gt; snd (50, 100);;
val it : int = 100&lt;/source&gt;

==== Assigning Multiple Variables Simultaneously ====
Tuples can be used to assign multiple values simultaneously. The syntax for doing so is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let val1, val2, ... valN = (expr1, expr2, ... exprN)&lt;/source&gt;

In other words, you assign a comma-separated list of ''N'' values to an ''N''-tuple. Here's an example in FSI:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x, y = (1, 2);;

val y : int
val x : int

&gt; x;;
val it : int = 1

&gt; y;;
val it : int = 2&lt;/source&gt;

The number of values being assigned must match the arity of tuple returned from the function, otherwise F# will raise an exception:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x, y = (1, 2, 3);;

  let x, y = (1, 2, 3);;
  ------------^^^^^^^^

stdin(18,13): error FS0001: Type mismatch. Expecting a
	'a * 'b
but given a
	'a * 'b * 'c.
The tuples have differing lengths of 2 and 3.&lt;/source&gt;

==== Tuples and the .NET Framework ====
From a point of view F#, all methods in the .NET Base Class Library take a single argument, which is a tuple of varying types and arity. For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! width=&quot;20%&quot; | Class
! width=&quot;40%&quot; | C# Function Signature
! width=&quot;40%&quot; | F# Function Signature
|-
| &lt;code&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;String Join(String separator, String[] value)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;val Join : (string * string array) -&gt; string&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;System.Net.WebClient&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;void DownloadFile(String uri, String fileName)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;val DownloadFile : (string * string) -&gt; unit&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;System.Convert&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;String ToString(int value, int toBase)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;val ToString : (int * int) -&gt; string&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;System.Math&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;int DivRem(int a, int b, out int remainder)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;val DivRem : (int * int * int byref) -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;
|- 
| &lt;code&gt;System.Int32&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;bool TryParse(String value, out int result)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;val TryParse : string -&gt; (bool * int)&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Some methods, such as the &lt;code&gt;System.Math.DivRem&lt;/code&gt; shown above, and others such as &lt;code&gt;System.Int32.TryParse&lt;/code&gt; return multiple through ''output variables''. F# allows programmers to omit an output variable; using this calling convention, F# will return results of a function as a tuple, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; System.Int32.TryParse(&quot;3&quot;);;
val it : bool * int = (true, 3)

&gt; System.Math.DivRem(10, 7);;
val it : int * int = (1, 3)&lt;/source&gt;

=== Defining Records ===
A record is similar to a tuple, except it contains named fields. A record is defined using the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type recordName =
    { [ fieldName : dataType ] + }
&lt;/source&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; means the element must occur one or more times.

Here's a simple record:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type website =
    { Title : string;
        Url : string }&lt;/source&gt;
Unlike a tuple, a record is explicitly defined as its own type using the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and record fields are defined as a semicolon-separated list. (In many ways, a record can be thought of as a simple [[F Sharp Programming/Classes|class]].)

A &lt;code&gt;website&lt;/code&gt; record is created by specifying the record's fields as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let homepage = { Title = &quot;Google&quot;; Url = &quot;http://www.google.com&quot; };;
val homepage : website&lt;/source&gt;

Note that F# determines a records type by the name and type of its fields, not the order that fields are used. For example, while the record above is defined with &lt;code&gt;Title&lt;/code&gt; first and &lt;code&gt;Url&lt;/code&gt; second, it's perfectly legitimate to write:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; { Url = &quot;http://www.microsoft.com/&quot;; Title = &quot;Microsoft Corporation&quot; };;
val it : website = {Title = &quot;Microsoft Corporation&quot;;
                    Url = &quot;http://www.microsoft.com/&quot;;}&lt;/source&gt;

It's easy to access a record's properties using dot notation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let homepage = { Title = &quot;Wikibooks&quot;; Url = &quot;http://www.wikibooks.org/&quot; };;

val homepage : website

&gt; homepage.Title;;
val it : string = &quot;Wikibooks&quot;

&gt; homepage.Url;;
val it : string = &quot;http://www.wikibooks.org/&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

==== Cloning Records ====
Records are immutable types, which means that instances of records cannot be modified. However, records can be cloned conveniently using the clone syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type coords = { X : float; Y : float }

let setX item newX =
    { item with X = newX }&lt;/source&gt;
The method &lt;code&gt;setX&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;coords -&gt; float -&gt; coords&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; keyword creates a clone of &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; and set its &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code&gt;newX&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let start = { X = 1.0; Y = 2.0 };;
val start : coords

&gt; let finish = setX start 15.5;;
val finish : coords

&gt; start;;
val it : coords = {X = 1.0;
                   Y = 2.0;}
&gt; finish;;
val it : coords = {X = 15.5;
                   Y = 2.0;}&lt;/source&gt;
Notice that the &lt;code&gt;setX&lt;/code&gt; creates a copy of the record, it doesn't actually mutate the original record instance.


Here's a more complete program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type TransactionItem =
    { Name : string;
        ID : int;
        ProcessedText : string;
        IsProcessed : bool }

let getItem name id =
    { Name = name; ID = id; ProcessedText = null; IsProcessed = false }

let processItem item =
    { item with
        ProcessedText = &quot;Done&quot;;
        IsProcessed = true }
    
let printItem msg item =
    printfn &quot;%s: %A&quot; msg item   

let main() =
    let preProcessedItem = getItem &quot;Steve&quot; 5
    let postProcessedItem = processItem preProcessedItem

    printItem &quot;preProcessed&quot; preProcessedItem
    printItem &quot;postProcessed&quot; postProcessedItem
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program processes an instance of the &lt;code&gt;TransactionItem&lt;/code&gt; class and prints the results. This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;preProcessed: {Name = &quot;Steve&quot;;
 ID = 5;
 ProcessedText = null;
 IsProcessed = false;}
postProcessed: {Name = &quot;Steve&quot;;
 ID = 5;
 ProcessedText = &quot;Done&quot;;
 IsProcessed = true;}&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Pattern Matching Records ====
We can pattern match on records just as easily as tuples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

type coords = { X : float; Y : float }
 
let getQuadrant = function
    | { X = 0.0; Y = 0.0 } -&gt; &quot;Origin&quot;
    | item when item.X &gt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; item.Y &gt;= 0.0 -&gt; &quot;I&quot;
    | item when item.X &lt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; item.Y &gt;= 0.0 -&gt; &quot;II&quot;
    | item when item.X &lt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; item.Y &lt;= 0.0 -&gt; &quot;III&quot;
    | item when item.X &gt;= 0.0 &amp;&amp; item.Y &lt;= 0.0 -&gt; &quot;IV&quot;
 
let testCoords (x, y) =
    let item = { X = x; Y = y }
    printfn &quot;(%f, %f) is in quadrant %s&quot; x y (getQuadrant item)
 
let main() =
    testCoords(0.0, 0.0)
    testCoords(1.0, 1.0)
    testCoords(-1.0, 1.0)
    testCoords(-1.0, -1.0)
    testCoords(1.0, -1.0)
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;
Note that pattern cases are defined with the same syntax used to create a record (as shown in the first case), or using guards (as shown in the remaining cases). Unfortunately, programmers cannot use the clone syntax in pattern cases, so a case such as &lt;code&gt;| { item with X = 0 } -&gt; &quot;y-axis&quot;&lt;/code&gt; will not compile.

The program above outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;(0.000000, 0.000000) is in quadrant Origin
(1.000000, 1.000000) is in quadrant I
(-1.000000, 1.000000) is in quadrant II
(-1.000000, -1.000000) is in quadrant III
(1.000000, -1.000000) is in quadrant IV&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
==Rhetorical Framework: Author-Subject-Audience==
Any communication starts with a sender or &quot;author&quot; who sends a message. This message is then received by the receiver or &quot;audience&quot;. This relationship forms one part of the &quot;author-subject-audience&quot; rhetorical triangle. The difference between the triangle and linear model is that with the triangle, the audience interacts with the author either verbally or non-verbally in response to the subject of the message. The audience of a message will respond in some way to that message. This response will be either a negative or positive. The audience can choose to either follow the content of the message or to disregard it for any number of reasons and provide this feedback to the author of the message. Usually the receiver will send you something back just to let you know that they received it.

==Appeals to the Audience==
A key to effective communication is being aware of how the subject of a communication is being conveyed to the audience. The author must be aware of the complexity of the subject, the knowledge base of the audience, the actions they desire the audience to take as well as their likely response, and lastly the most effective appeals to use with that audience. Greek philosopher and rhetorician Aristotle named four important appeals which are useful to consider when trying to convey information to an audience: '''ethos''' (appeal to the character and credibility of the speaker or author), '''pathos''' (appeal to the emotion of the audience), '''logos''' (appeal to the logic of the subject or message) and '''kairos''' (appeal to timeliness or relevance).

==Appeals in Technical Writing==
In technical communication, logos are the most important. This is because technical communication is inherently logical. In order for a technical document to be well received, the content and organization must be logical. Appeals to ethos, establishing the credibility of the author is also important. If the document is otherwise logical but not worded properly or if the credibility of the author is not clearly established, it is likely that the audience will not receive the document well because they will not believe what the author has to say. This is true whether or not the information is correct. It is much more convincing to establish why you are writing that document or to write in a way that makes sense to the reader. Kairos is also an important element in technical communication because attention to time-sensitive details can effect whether or not your document is even read or well received. For example, if a computer manual references hardware that is several years old or uses examples from archaic software, the audience may assume that the author has not kept up with recent technological developments. Kairos involves knowing how much your audience knows and what society as a whole understands. In technical writing, it is highly unlikely that your writing will appeal to emotions.

Ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos can all help you convey your message. If you do not consider what your audience’s knowledge base is, then your appeal to logic will be ineffective. Likewise, if you try to include emotionally loaded words in an instruction manual, your audience will most likely turn away from the product because it appears unprofessional or unreadable.

==Purpose and Appeals==
As an author, it is important to consider the information that you want to convey. The way you go about conveying this information will depend on the purpose of your document. You could communicate information to persuade or inform. Once you have determined what your goal for a communication is, look to your different options for appeals. Typically, your communication will be in the form of technical writing. Therefore, an appeal to logos is most appropriate. If you were trying to persuade, an appeal to pathos might be more effective. You also have to know what you audience is expecting from you. If you are writing instructions for building a dresser, your reader is going to expect short sentences accompanied by pictures without wordy or excessive language. However, if you are trying to instruct someone on how to paint, you may use emotional language if your purpose is to spark that emotion while still instructing. Know your audience’s knowledge base, what they expect, and the best way to communicate to them using the various forms of appeal.

==Audience Feedback==
It is much easier to feel out feedback while giving a speech than while writing a technical document. Most likely, you will not be around to see the reaction from the audience. However, you can employ surveys or usability studies to help gauge what your audiences’ response will be. This process is a great way to get a feel for what the audience may or may not respond to and gives the author an opportunity to change the document to reflect audience feedback before it is finalized.

==Regulatory Influences==

[[Image:Glycogen Synthesis.jpg‎|right|thumb|250px|Glycogen synthesis is regulated by the activation of Protein kinase A (PKA) bound to cAMP]]
[[Image:Glycogen Degradation.jpg‎|right|thumb|250px|Glycogen degradation is regulated by the activation of phosphorylase kinase which is dictated by activated PKA]]

Glycogen metabolism is prone to a number of regulatory influences, all of which impact glycogen synthase (GS) and/or phosphorylase. GS is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, and phosphorylase is the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorolysis of α-1,4-glycosidic linkages. Gene PPP1R3C (PTG) is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and a regulator of GS and phosphorylase. PTG is expressed in every tissue, and is most abundant in the skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. PTG binds glycogen, the primary enzymes involved glycogen metabolism regulation, GS and phosphorylase. Disruption of the PTG gene has been proven to substantially decrease glycogen stores in tissue culture cells. 

PTG has also been proven to interact with laforin. The over expression of PTG was proven to accumulate glycogen in tissue culture cells and ex vivo organ models. When determining whether or not malin and laforin inhibit PTG activity, it was discovered that the cells transfected with PTG, malin, and laforin contained a similar amount of glycogen as cells transfected with a vector control. It has been concluded that malin and laforin independently decrease PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation, but cumulatively eliminated PTG-stimulated glycogen accumulation.

PTG and gene PPPIR3D (R6) are expressed in a wide range of human tissues, whereas the other three PP1 targeting subunits, such as G&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (gene PPPIR3B), display tissue specific expression patterns in skeletal muscle, heart and/or liver tissue. PTG, R6 and G&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; were all proven to increase glycogen accumulation. Malin and laforin were proven to inhibit R6-stimulated glycogen accumulation without inhibiting GL-stimulated glycogen accumulation. In conclusion, malin and laforin were proven to inhibit PP1 regulatory subunit-stimulated glycogen accumulation of some, but not all PP1 regulatory subunits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fields can be described for PilRC like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
FORM ID MainForm AT (2 2 156 156)
BEGIN
  FIELD ID ArtistField  AT (4 14      160-8 14) NONEDITABLE
  FIELD ID ServerField  AT (4 PREVTOP 160-8 14) UNDERLINED
END
&lt;/pre&gt;

If text fields can receive focus but not accept any input, maybe the application is accidentally handling &lt;tt&gt;keyDown&lt;/tt&gt; events so that they never make it to &lt;tt&gt;FrmDispatchEvent&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of the chain of command in the event loop.

Although having a field edit a &lt;tt&gt;MemHandle&lt;/tt&gt; (such as a database record) is easy (with &lt;tt&gt;FldSetTextHandle&lt;/tt&gt;), changing the text in a text field is rather more involved:

&lt;pre&gt;
void FldChangeText( FieldType *field, char *format, ...)
{
  MemHandle  fieldChunk;
  char       *fieldStore;
  UInt32     roomNeeded;
  Err        e; 
  char       text[ 99];
  va_list    args; 
  
  // format the text
  va_start( args, format);
  StrVPrintF( text, format, args);
  va_end( args);
  
  roomNeeded = StrLen(text) + sizeof(NUL);
  
  // get the handle for the string and unlock it by removing it from the field
  fieldChunk = FldGetTextHandle( field);
  FldSetTextHandle( field, NULL);
  if ( NULL == fieldChunk)
  {
    fieldChunk = MemHandleNew( roomNeeded);
    if ( NULL == fieldChunk) goto tidyUp;
  }
  else {
    // resize the chunk if necessary
    if ( MemHandleSize( fieldChunk) &lt; roomNeeded)
    {
      e = MemHandleResize( fieldChunk, roomNeeded);
      if ( e != errNone) goto tidyUp;
    }
  }
  // lock the chunk, write to it and unlock it
  fieldStore = MemHandleLock( fieldChunk);
  StrCopy( fieldStore, text);
  MemHandleUnlock( fieldChunk);

 tidyUp:
  // update the text in the field
  FldSetTextHandle( field, fieldChunk);
  FldDrawField( field);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Entropy is in fact a state-function, just as energy. It just is and not something that sets in, as you put it. What you mean is probably that entropy increases when systems deteriorate.

      <comment>[[Combinatorics/Ramsey's theorem]] moved to [[Combinatorics/Ramsey's Theorem]]:&amp;#32;consistency with other names</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Ramsey's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by F. P. Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory, now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. The theorem states that 

{{box|In any colouring of the edges of a sufficiently large complete graph (that is, a simple graph in which an edge connects every pair of vertices), one will find monochromatic complete subgraphs. For 2 colours, Ramsey's theorem states that for any pair of positive integers (''r'',''s''), there exists a least positive integer ''R''(''r'',''s'') such that for any complete graph on ''R''(''r'',''s'') vertices, whose edges are coloured ''red'' or ''blue'', there exists either a complete subgraph on ''r'' vertices which is entirely red, or a complete subgraph on ''s'' vertices which is entirely blue. Here ''R(r,s)'' signifies an integer that depends on both ''r'' and ''s''. It is understood to represent the smallest integer for which the theorem holds.}}


An extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours c, and any given integers n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a number, R(n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order R(n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) are coloured with c different colours, then for some i between 1 and c, it must contain a complete subgraph of order n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; whose edges are all color i. The special case above has c = 2 (and n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = r and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = s).


==Example: ''R''(3,3)=6==
[[Image:RamseyTheory K5 no mono K3.svg|frame|A 2-colouring of K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with no monochromatic K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex ''v''. There are 5 edges incident to ''v'' and so (by the pigeonhole principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. Without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting to vertices ''r'', ''s'' and ''t'', are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges (''r'', ''s''), (''r'', ''t''), (''s'', ''t'') are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red and we have an entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, ''any'' ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; contains a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore that ''R''(3,3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called ''the theorem on friends and strangers''.

An alternate proof works by double counting. It goes as follows: Count the number of ordered triples of vertices ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' such that the edge (''xy'') is red and the edge (''yz'') is blue. Firstly, any given vertex will be the middle of either 0×5=0, 1×4=4 or 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 = 6 such triples. Therefore there are at most 6×6=36 such triples. Secondly, for any non-monochromatic triangle ('''xyz'''), there exist precisely two such triples. Therefore there are at most 18 non-monochromatic triangles. Therefore at least 2 of the 20 triangles in the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are monochromatic.

Conversely, it is possible to 2-colour a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; without creating any monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, showing that ''R''(3,3) &amp;gt; 5. The unique colouring is shown to the right. Thus ''R''(3,3) = 6.

==Proof of the theorem==

First we prove the theorem for the 2-colour case, by induction on ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''.
It is clear from the definition that for all ''n'', ''R''(''n'', 1) = ''R''(1, ''n'') = ''1''. This starts the induction.
We prove that ''R''(''r'', ''s'') exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') and ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) exist.

&lt;u&gt;Claim: ''R''(''r'', ''s'') ≤ ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1):&lt;/u&gt;
Consider a complete graph on ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) vertices.
Pick a vertex ''v'' from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets ''M'' and ''N'', such that for every vertex ''w'', ''w'' is in ''M'' if (''v'', ''w'') is blue, and ''w'' is in ''N'' if (''v'', ''w'') is red.

Because the graph has ''R''(''r'' - 1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s'' - 1) = |''M''| + |''N''| + 1 vertices, it follows that either |''M''| ≥ ''R''(''r'' − 1, ''s'') or |''N''| ≥ ''R''(''r'', ''s'' − 1).  In the former case, if ''M'' has a red ''K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise ''M'' has a blue ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''−1&lt;/sub&gt; and so &lt;math&gt; M \cup \{v\} &lt;/math&gt; has blue ''K&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' by definition of ''M''. The latter case is analogous.

Thus the claim is true and we have completed the proof for 2 colours. We now prove the result for the general case of ''c'' colours. The proof is again by induction, this time on the number of colours ''c''. We have the result for ''c'' = 1 (trivially) and for ''c'' = 2 (above). Now let ''c'' &amp;gt; 2.

&lt;u&gt;Claim: &lt;/u&gt;''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;))

Note, that the right hand side only contains Ramsey numbers for ''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 colours and 2 colours, and therefore exists and is the finite number ''t'', by the inductive hypothesis. Thus, proving the claim will prove the theorem. 

'''Proof of claim''': Consider a graph on ''t'' vertices and colour its edges with ''c'' colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that ''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and ''c'' are the same colour. Thus the graph is now (''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a ''K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' monochromatically coloured with colour ''i'' for some 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ (''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2) or a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''R''(''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c−1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) we must have either a (''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-monochrome ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''c''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; or a ''c''-monochrome ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. In either case the proof is complete.

==Extensions of the theorem==

The theorem can also be extended to hypergraphs. An ''m''-hypergraph is a graph whose &quot;edges&quot; are sets of ''m'' vertices - in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices. The full statement of Ramsey's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers ''m'' and ''c'',
and any integers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;,
there is an integer ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;;''c'',''m'') such that if the hyperedges of a complete ''m''-hypergraph of order ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;;''c'',''m'') are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-''m''-hypergraph of order ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; whose hyperedges are all colour ''i''. This theorem is usually proved by induction on ''m'', the 'hyper-ness' of the graph. The base case for the proof is ''m''=2, which is exactly the theorem above.

      <comment>/* Lower bound */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The numbers ''R''(''r'',''s'') in Ramsey's theorem (and their extensions to more than two colours) are known as '''Ramsey numbers'''. A major research problem in Ramsey theory is to find out Ramsey numbers for various values of ''r'' and ''s''. We will derive the classical bounds here for any general Ramsey number ''R''(''r'',''s''). This will just mean the exact value of that ''R''(''r'',''s'') lies between the two professed bounds, the lower bound and the upper bound. 

==Upper bound==

The upper bound is actually weaned off from the proof of Ramsey's theorem itself. Since ''R''(''r'', ''s'') ≤ ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) so this automatically gives an upper bound, although not in the closed form that we expect. The closed form expression is &lt;math&gt;R(r,s)\le \binom{r+s-2}{r-1}&lt;/math&gt;. To derive this use double induction on r and s. The base case ''r'' = ''s'' = 2 is easily established as &lt;math&gt;R(2,2) = 2 \le  \binom{2+2-2}{2-1}=2&lt;/math&gt;. Now assume the expression holds for ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') and ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1). Then &lt;math&gt;R(r,s)\le R(r-1,s)+R(r,s-1)\le \binom{r+s-3}{r-2} + \binom{r+s-3}{r-1} = \binom{r+s-2}{r-1}&lt;/math&gt; gives us our upper bound. Note that we have used [[Combinatorics/Subsets_of_a_set-The_Binomial_Coefficient|Pascal's relation]] in the last equivalence.

A slight improvement is possible if both ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are even numbers. In that case the inequality is strict. 

'''Result:''' If both ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are even numbers then ''R''(''r'', ''s'') &lt; ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

'''Proof:''' Suppose ''R''(''r'', ''s'') = ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) where both ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') and ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are even numbers. Let ''n'' = ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. Now by our choice of ''n'' there exists a complete graph on ''n'' vertices, i.e. a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, with neither a red ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; nor a blue ''K''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Fix this ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in the discussion. Also fix a vertex ''v'' in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.
 
Now clearly if the number of red edges from ''v'' is less then ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and the number of blue edges is less then ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 then the total edges from ''v'' would be less then ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2, a contradiction as ''v'' is connected with exactly ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 vertices. So either the number of red edges from ''v'' is at least ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 or the number of blue edges from ''v'' is at least ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. WLOG assume the first. Now we shall show that the number of red edges from ''v'' cannot exceed ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. Suppose they do. Now, pick any ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') of the vertices adjoined to ''v'' by red edges and consider the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&lt;/sub&gt; formed by these vertices. By Ramsey's theorem it should contain either a red ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r-1&lt;/sub&gt; or a blue ''K''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. It cannot contain the latter by our choice of ''n''. Hence it contains a red ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r-1&lt;/sub&gt;. But adjoining the vertices of this red ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r-1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''v'' gives us a red ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also not possible. Hence, the number of red edges cannot exceed ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. So they must be precisely ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. Then the remaining number of blue edges are ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. In summary we can say that each vertex in our ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is connected to the other ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 vertices by precisely ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 red edges and ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 blue edges.

The total number of red edges in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;\frac{n(R(r-1,s)-1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; which must be an integer. However as both ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are even numbers this is impossible. Hence the initial equality was impossible. So ''R''(''r'', ''s'') &lt; ''R''(''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

==Lower bound==

The classical lower bound, by an argument given essentially by [[w:Paul Erdős|Paul Erdős]] is developed below. The argument is referred to as the probabilistic method. It provides a lower bound for ''R''(''r'',''r''), which is abbreviated to ''R''(''r'').

To begin note that if we are given a set of ''r'' vertices in any ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; whose edges are randomly colored, red or blue, then the probability that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is monochromatic is &lt;math&gt;2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. To see this that there are 2 ways to color each of the &lt;math&gt;\binom{r}{2}&lt;/math&gt; edges and so the total possibilities for the colorings are &lt;math&gt;2^{\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Out of these only 2 are favorable: a red ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; or a blue ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence the probability that our given ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is monochromatic is &lt;math&gt;2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now what is the probability that there will be a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; if a set of ''r'' vertices is not fixed in the begining? There are &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{r}&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose ''r'' vertices out of ''n''. By the [[Probability#Mathematical_treatment|addition law of probability]] we could just take any r-vertex set, get its probability as above to be &lt;math&gt;2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, then move to another r-set, get its probability as &lt;math&gt;2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and so on; then we could add up all the probabilities to get the probability of getting a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.
But it may happen that two of the chosen batches of r-sets both give monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'s. This is another way of saying that the events are not necessarily mutually exclusive. So the addition theorem doesn't apply and the total probability is definitely not guaranteed to be &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{r}2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. However by the [[w:Boole's inequality|Boole's inequality]] we can at least conclude that the probability that there is a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; can't exceed &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{r}2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now if &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{r}2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; then this tells us that the probability of a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is less then 1 and so a monochromatic ''K''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is not guaranteed. This is just another way of saying that &lt;math&gt;R(r) &gt; n&lt;/math&gt;.

Now fix ''r'' and let ''N'' be the minimum value of ''n'' satisfying &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{r}2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. Since the collection of numbers satisfying this inequality is non-empty; ''R''(''r'') itself is an example, and is bounded below; ''r'' and any number less then ''r'' are lower bounds not belonging to this collection, so the minimum value is guaranteed to exist.

Also note that &lt;math&gt;R(r)\ge N&lt;/math&gt; as if &lt;math&gt;R(r) &lt; N&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;R(r)\le N-1&lt;/math&gt;. But this contradicts &lt;math&gt;R(r)&gt; N-1&lt;/math&gt; which is true as &lt;math&gt;\binom{N-1}{r}2^{1-\binom{r}{2}}&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;R(r)\ge N&lt;/math&gt;.   

So,
:&lt;math&gt;R(r)\ge N=(N^r)^{\frac{1}{r}}&gt;\left(\binom{N}{r}r!\right)^{\frac{1}{r}}\ge (2^{\binom{r}{2}-1}r!)^{\frac{1}{r}}=2^{\frac{r}{2}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{r}}(r!)^{\frac{1}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now use [[w:Stirlings approximation|Stirlings approximation]] for the factorial, valid for large values of r; that is &lt;math&gt;r! \approx \sqrt{2\pi r}\, \left(\frac{r}{e}\right)^{r}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence for large r, on simplification we get,
:&lt;math&gt;R(r)&gt;\frac{r2^{\frac{r}{2}}}{e\sqrt{2}}(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2r}}r^{\frac{1}{2r}})&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the terms in the brackets on the right hand side always exceed 1 so we can conclude by saying that for large r, &lt;math&gt;R(r)&gt;\frac{r2^{\frac{r}{2}}}{e\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Known Ramsey numbers==

''R''(''r'',''s'') for values of ''r'' and ''s'' up to 10 are shown in the table below.  Where the exact value is unknown, the table lists the best known bounds.  ''R''(''r'',''s'') for values of ''r'' and ''s'' less than 3 are given by ''R''(1,''s'') = 1 and ''R''(2,''s'') = ''s'' for all values of ''s''.  The standard survey on the development of Ramsey number research has been written by Stanisław Radziszowski, who also found the exact value of R(4,5) (with Brendan McKay).

==A Multicolour Example: ''R''(3,3,3) = 17==
[[Image:Sixteens.gif|right|thumb|The only two 3-colourings of K&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; with no monochromatic K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.]] 

A multicolour Ramsey number is a Ramsey number using 3 or more colours. There is only one nontrivial multicolour Ramsey number for which the exact value is known, namely ''R''(3,3,3) = 17. 

Suppose that you have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours, red, yellow and green. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex ''v''. Consider the set of vertices which have a green edge to the vertex ''v''. This is called the green neighborhood of ''v''. The green neighborhood of ''v'' cannot contain any green edges, since otherwise there would be a green triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that green edge and the vertex ''v''. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the green neighborhood of ''v'' has edges coloured with only two colours, namely yellow and red. Since ''R''(3,3) = 6, the green neighborhood of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the red and yellow neighborhoods of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for ''v'' itself, is in one of the green, red or yellow neighborhoods of ''v'', the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have ''R''(3,3,3) ≤ 17. 

To see that ''R''(3,3,3) ≥ 17, it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours, which avoids monochromatic triangles. It turns out that there are exactly two such colourings on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, the so-called untwisted and twisted colourings. Both colourings are shown in the figure to the right, with the untwisted colouring on the top, and the twisted colouring on the bottom. In both colourings in the figure, note that the vertices are labeled, and that the vertices ''v''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; through ''v''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; are drawn twice, on both the left and the right, in order to simplify the drawings.    

Thus, ''R''(3,3,3) = 17.

It is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; which avoid monochromatic triangles, which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

It is also known that there are exactly 115 edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; which avoid monochromatic triangles, provided that we consider edge colourings which differ by a permutation of the colours as being the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Problems are listed in the increasing order of difficulty. When a problem is simply a mathematical statement, the readers are supposed to supply a proof. Answers are given (or will be given) to all of problems. This is mostly for the quality control; the answers allow contributors other than the initial writer of the problem to check the validity of the problems. In other words, the readers are strongly discouraged to see the answers before they successfully solved the problems themselves.

==Commutative algebra==
'''Problem:''' A finite integral domain is a ﬁeld.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be an element in the finite integral domain A. Then the map
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto ax: A \to A&lt;/math&gt;
is injective (since A is an integral domain) and is surjective by finiteness.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' A polynomial has integer values for sufficiently large integer arguments if and only if it is a linear combination (over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) of binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Since &lt;math&gt;\deg \binom{t}{n} = n&lt;/math&gt;, for dimensional reason, if &lt;math&gt;f \in R[t]&lt;/math&gt;, then we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = a_0 + a_1 \binom{t}{1} + ... + a_d \binom{t}{d}, a_n \in \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
Applying finite differential operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta g(t) = g(t + 1) - g(t)&lt;/math&gt;  to both sides d times, one finds that &lt;math&gt;a_d&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. By induction, &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; are all integers then.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' An integral domain is a PID if its prime ideals are principal. (Hint: apply Zorn's lemma to the set ''S'' of all non-principal prime ideals.)
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Suppose, on the contrary, that ''S'' is nonempty. Then there is a  a maximal element &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i} \in S&lt;/math&gt;. We will reach a contradiction once we show &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i} \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. For that end, let &lt;math&gt;xy \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x \not\in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, then, by maximality, &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{i}, x) \not\in S&lt;/math&gt;. That is, it is principal; say,
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{i}, x) = (d)&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt; be an ideal consisting of &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ax \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out that 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{j}d = \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{j}d = (\mathfrak{ji}, \mathfrak{j}x) \subset \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z = z' d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z'x \in z'(d) \subset \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathfrak{j}d&lt;/math&gt;.
We now conclude that &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, for, otherwise, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{j}d&lt;/math&gt; is principal. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' A ring is noetherian if and only if its prime ideals are finitely generated. (Hint: Zorn's lemma.)
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=The direction (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) is obvious. For the converse, let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all proper ideals of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that are not finitely generated. We want to show &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is empty then. Suppose not. Then, by Zorn's lemma, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; contains a maximal element &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i&lt;/math&gt; is prime. To see that, let &lt;math&gt;xy \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x \not\in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, then, by maximality, &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{i}, x) \not\in S&lt;/math&gt;. That is, it is finitely generated; say,
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{i}, x) = (i_1 + a_1 x, ..., i_n + a_n x)&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt; be an ideal consisting of &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ax \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out that 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i} = (i_1, ..., i_n, \mathfrak{j}x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In fact, if &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;z = b_1 (i_1 + a_1 x) + ... + b_n (i_n + a_n x)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;b_1 a_1 + ... + b_n a_n \in J&lt;/math&gt;. We conclude that &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, for, otherwise, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt; are finitely generated.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' ''Every nonempty set of prime ideals has a minimal element with respect to inclusion.''

'''Problem:''' If an integral domain ''A'' is algebraic over a field ''F'', then ''A'' is a field.''
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Since ''A'' is an integral domain, it is a subring of some field. Let &lt;math&gt;u \in A&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''u'' is invertible in &lt;math&gt;F(u) \subset A&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' Every two elements in a UFD have a gcd.

'''Problem:''' If &lt;math&gt;f \in A[X]&lt;/math&gt; is a unit, then &lt;math&gt;f - a_0&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent, where &lt;math&gt;a_0 = f(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the constant term of ''f''.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;g = b_0 + b_1x + ... + b_m x^m&lt;/math&gt; be the inverse of ''f''. Then &lt;math&gt;a_n b_m = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a_n b_{m-1} + a_{n-1} b_m = 0&lt;/math&gt;, it follows &lt;math&gt;{a_n}^2 b_{m-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. By obvious induction, for some ''r'', we see &lt;math&gt;{a_n}^r&lt;/math&gt; kills every coefficient of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;; hence, ''g''. Thus, &lt;math&gt;{a_n}^r = {a_n}^r f g = 0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent. Recall that the sum of a unit and a nilpotent element is a unit. Since &lt;math&gt;a_n x^n - f&lt;/math&gt; is a unit, by applying the above argument, we see that &lt;math&gt;a_{n-1} x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent. In the end, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;a_0 - f&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of nilpotent elements; thus, nilpotent.}}

'''Problem:''' The nilradical and the Jacobson radical of &lt;math&gt;A[X]&lt;/math&gt; coincide.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=We only have to prove: if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in the Jacobson radical, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent, since the converse is true for any ring. Recall that &lt;math&gt;1 - fg&lt;/math&gt; is a unit for every &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;1 - xf&lt;/math&gt; is unit.  Now use the previous problem to conclude &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent.}}

'''Problem:''' Let ''A'' be a ring such that every ideal not contained in its nilradical contains an element ''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;e^2 = e \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the nilradical and the Jacobson radical of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; coincide.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=In general, the nilradical is contained in the Jacobson radical. Suppose this inclusion is strict. Then by hypothesis there is a nonzero ''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;e(1-e) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;1-e&lt;/math&gt; is a unit, &lt;math&gt;e = 0&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.}}

'''Problem:''' &lt;math&gt;f \in A[[X]]&lt;/math&gt; is a unit if and only if the constant term of ''f'' is a unit.

== Real analysis ==
'''Problem:''' &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} + 2^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{3} + 2^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;. Then
&lt;math&gt;2 = (x - \sqrt{3})^3&lt;/math&gt;. The equation can then be solved for &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' Is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; irrational?

'''Problem:''' Compute &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty {\sin x \over x}&lt;/math&gt; 

'''Problem:''' If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} f(x) + f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} f'(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Apply L'Hospital's rule to &lt;math&gt;e^x f(x) \over e^x&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''': Let &lt;math&gt;f:\R \to [0,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt; nonvanishing and such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)f''(x)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)^2dx=+\infty&lt;/math&gt;

{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Derive twice &lt;math&gt;g(x)=f(x)^2&lt;/math&gt;, look at the asymptotic behaviour of &lt;math&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.}}

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a complete metric space, and &lt;math&gt;f:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; be a function such that &lt;math&gt;f \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; admits a fixed point.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=By Banach's fixed point theorem, &lt;math&gt;f \circ f&lt;/math&gt; has a unique fixed point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., &lt;math&gt;x_0 = (f \circ f)(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. But then
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_0) = (f \circ f)(f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is also a fixed point of &lt;math&gt;f \circ f&lt;/math&gt;. By uniqueness, &lt;math&gt;x_0 = f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a compact metric space, and &lt;math&gt;f:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; be such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y)) &lt; d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x \ne y \in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; admits a unique fixed point. (Do not use Banach's fixed point theorem.)
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;c = \inf \{ d(x, f(x)) | x \in X \}&lt;/math&gt;. By compactness, there is &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c = d(x_0, f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x_0 \ne f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, then, by hypothesis, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;d(x_0, f(x_0)) \le d(f(x_0), f \circ f(x_0)) &lt; d(x_0, f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt;,
which is absurd. Thus, &lt;math&gt;d(x_0, f(x_0)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. For uniqueness, suppose &lt;math&gt;y_0 = f(y_0)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x_0 \ne y_0&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;d(x_0, y_0) \le d(x_0, f(x_0)) + d(f(x_0), f(y_0)) + d(f(y_0), y_0) = d(f(x_0), f(y_0)) &lt; d(x_0, y_0)&lt;/math&gt;,
which is absurd. Hence, &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the unique fixed point. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;f:\R^2 \to \R^2&lt;/math&gt; be such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y)) \geq A d(x, y), \qquad A&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; admits a unique fixed point.

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a compact metric space, and &lt;math&gt;f:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; be a contraction. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_n^\infty f^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;
consists of exactly one point.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Since ''f'' is a contraction, it admits a fixed point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \cap f^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;y \in \cap f^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;y = f(x_1) = f^2(x_2) = f^3(x_3) = ...&lt;/math&gt;
for some sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ...&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''c'' be the Lipschitz constant of ''f''. Now,
:&lt;math&gt;d(x_0, y) = d(x_0, f^n(x_n)) \le d(x_0, f^n(x_1)) + d(f^n(x_1), f^n(x_n)) \le d(x_0, f^n(x_1)) + c^n d(f(x_1), f(x_n))&lt;/math&gt;
which goes to 0 as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt; d(f(x_1), f(x_n))&lt;/math&gt; is bounded and &lt;math&gt;c &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and since  for any &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f^n(y) \to x_0&lt;/math&gt; by Banach's fixed point theorem. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' Every closed subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is separable.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; be a countable dense subset of &lt;math&gt;A \cap \overline{B}(0, k)&lt;/math&gt;, and let
:&lt;math&gt;E = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;A = \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, since &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E \subset A&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\overline{E} \subset \overline{A} = A&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt;, then for some &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;x \in A \cap \overline{B}(0, k) = \overline{E_k} \subset \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' Any connected nonempty subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; either consists of a single point or contains an irrational number.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a connected nonempty subset of   &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is an interval with end-points a, b. If &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; has more than one point, then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; contains a nonempty interval (a, b), which contains an irrational. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded function. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has closed graph.

'''Problem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a homeomorphism, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is monotone.

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1]^2 \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous function. Then
:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \sup \{ f(x, y) | y \in [0, 1] \} \quad (x \in [0, 1]) &lt;/math&gt;
is continuous.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous, there is &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x', y') - f(x, y)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;|(x', y') - (x, y)| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that &lt;math&gt;g(x) &lt; \epsilon + g(x')&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;g(x') &lt; \epsilon + g(x)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;|x' - x| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;. Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;|g(x') - g(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;f, g: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be continuous functions such that: &lt;math&gt;f(g(x)) = g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The equation &lt;math&gt;f(f(x)) = g(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; has a solution if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x)&lt;/math&gt; has one.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) is trivial. For (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;), suppose we have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;f(f(x)) = g(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;h(y) = f(y) - g(y)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) = f(f(x)) - g(f(x)) = g(g(x)) - f(g(x)) = -h(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) + h(g(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then we are done. If &lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then, since &lt;math&gt;h(g(x)) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, by the intermediate value theorem, &lt;math&gt;h(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The same argument works for the case when &lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' Suppose &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous. Then there are constants &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; such that:

Here, &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 1 + {1 \over \delta} |x|&lt;/math&gt;. The estimate for &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is analogous. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' Let ''X'' be a compact metric space, and &lt;math&gt;f: X \to X&lt;/math&gt; be an isometry: i.e., &lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y)) = d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''f'' is a bijection.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=''f'' is clearly injective. To show ''f'' surjective, let &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''X'' is compact, &lt;math&gt;f^n(x)&lt;/math&gt; contains a convergent subsequence, say, &lt;math&gt;f^{n_j}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, f^{n_j}(x)) = d(f^{n_k}(x), f^{n_{j+k}}(x)) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in the closure of &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the image of a closed set under an isometry is closed, we conclude: &lt;math&gt;x \in f(X)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of polynomials with degree ≤ some fixed ''D''. If &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges pointwise to 0 on [0, 1], then &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on [0, 1].
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=We first prove a weaker statement:
:If &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges pointwise on all but finitely many points in [0,1], then &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on all but finitely many points in [0,1].
We proceed by inducting on ''D''. If ''D'' = 1, then the claim is obvious. Suppose it is true for D - 1. We write:
:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x) = p_n(x_0) + (x - x_0) q_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a point such that &lt;math&gt;p_n(x_0) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the degree of &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; is strictly less than that of &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt;, by inductive hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on the complement of some finite subset ''F'' of [0, 1]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges on the complement of &lt;math&gt;F \cup \{x_0\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This completes the proof of the claim. By the claim, &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly except at some finitely many points. But since &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; converges pointwise everywhere, it converges uniformly everywhere. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' On a closed interval a monotone function has at most countably many discontinuous points.

'''Problem''' Prove that in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; the relation &lt;math&gt;B_r(x)\supset B_s(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies ''r'' &gt; ''s'' and find a metric space when the implication doesn't hold.

Since &lt;math&gt;f''(0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum of ''f''. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Problem''' If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}(AB) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all square matrices &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\{ \lambda_1^k + \lambda_2^k + ... + \lambda_n^k = 0 \}_{1 \le k \le n}&lt;/math&gt;
Computing the determinant, we see the system has no nonzero solution, a contradiction.}}

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;S, T&lt;/math&gt; be square matrices of the same size. Then &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;TS&lt;/math&gt; have the same eigenvalues.''

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;STx = \lambda x&lt;/math&gt; for some nonzero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;(TS)Tx = \lambda Tx&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;Tx = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\lambda x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction, &lt;math&gt;Tx&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvector. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue of &lt;math&gt;TS&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Problem''' Let &lt;math&gt;S, T&lt;/math&gt; be square matrices of the same size. Then &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;TS&lt;/math&gt; have the same eigenvalues with same ''multiplicity''.

If ''S'' is not invertible, then &lt;math&gt;S + tI&lt;/math&gt; is invertible when &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{det}(T(S + tI) - \lambda I) = \operatorname{det}((S + tI)T - \lambda I)&lt;/math&gt;
and letting &lt;math&gt;t \to 0&lt;/math&gt; gives the same identity. In any case, ''TS'' and ''ST'' share the same eigenvalues with same multiplicity.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Annunaki.jpg||right]]

== What is the Genitive Case? ==

The &quot;genitive case&quot; is nothing more than a way for a language to describe an &quot;of&quot; relationship. For instance, &quot;the king of Ur&quot; is a genitive construction. So is &quot;the father of Sargon&quot;. No need to be scared of the terminology - linguists just like using fancy words to describe other types of fancy words.

== The genitive in Sumerian ==

The genitive case is used heavily in Sumerian, and has several different forms. The simplest form is to suffix a two noun compound with the '''.ak''' particle. (Remember particles? They're the little things we tack on to words or phrases to modify the meaning of that phrase.)

Let's look at a couple examples. Consider the phrase '''lugal Urim.ak'''. First things first, we figure out our vocabulary. We remember that '''lugal''' means ''king'', and '''Urim''' is the city we call Ur. So we have two nouns, and we also notice our new friend, the '''.ak''' particle. This tells us right away that we're looking at a'' genitive construction''. So put it all together, and we get:

* '''lugal Urim.ak''' = ''the king of Ur''

Pretty simple, right? It really is that easy! Just remember to be on the lookout for that little '''.ak''' particle, and you'll be able to spot a genitive a mile away.

Here's another example: '''dumu nin Lagas.ak.ak'''. As usual, we find our vocabulary first. Of course, '''dumu''' means ''child'', and '''nin''' means ''lady'' or ''queen''. '''Lagas''' is just the city we call Lagash. Now at the end of this little phrase, we see something interesting: ''two'' little '''.ak''' particles! What could this mean? Well, just like in English, where you can say ''the son of the neighbor of the chairman of the board of the company'', in Sumerian we can string multiple genitives together as well. In Sumerian, though, we unravel multiple genitive constructions from inside out, so we might read this example as:

* '''dumu nin Lagas.ak.ak''' = '''dumu [nin [Lagas.ak].ak]''' = ''[the child of [the queen of Lagash]]'' = ''the child of the queen of Lagash''

Nothing really new, we just put two genitive constructions back to back. You should probably have the idea by now, so we'll see if you can follow along with a little quick quiz.

=== Quick Quiz ===

Make sure you understand what the following little phrases mean. If you're having trouble, you can hover over the text to get a translation.

* '''{{H:title|child|dumu}} {{H:title|queen|nin}}.{{H:title|his/her|ani}}.{{H:title|genitive marker|ak}}'''

== Dropping the final 'k' ==

This is all well and good, and on paper everything looks good. But what about on clay tablets? Well, it turns out that an often seen feature of spoken Sumerian was dropping phrase-final sounds off of case particles. Don't be scared by how technical that sounds - it happens in English, too! At least in America, we have a tendency to drop the final 'g' from the '-ing' suffix, so we might pronounce 'going' as 'goin', or 'digging' as 'diggin'. Simple, right? Just drop a final sound from a particle.

In this case, the Sumerian genitive, our particle is '''.ak''', and hence ends in a &lt;tt&gt;/k/&lt;/tt&gt; sound. In real written Sumerian, we often see phrases like '''lugal Urim.ak''' actually written as '''lu-gal Urim-ma''', with no written acknowledgment of the final &lt;tt&gt;/k/&lt;/tt&gt; sound from the genitive particle.

But don't worry! It turns out that much of the time you'll find another case particle tacked on to the end of a genitive phrase, in which case the &lt;tt&gt;/k/&lt;/tt&gt; sound is in fact pronounced. For instance, if our phrase above were in the ergative case (which is kind of like the subject of a transitive sentence, more later), then we would add the particle '''.e''' to the end of the phrase, so we would have '''lugal Urim.ak.e''', which would be written '''lu-gal Urim-ma-ke''', with a pronounced &lt;tt&gt;/k/&lt;/tt&gt;.

Even if you don't have other clues like this, you'll quickly see that context will normally erase any ambiguity in translation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The 2nd baseman is an infielder who typically plays halfway to two-thirds of the way between first base and second base.  The position is abbreviated as &quot;2B&quot; and is referenced as &quot;4&quot; for the purposes of official scoring.  The second baseman, along with the shortstop, is expected to have the best hands and cover the most range of any of the infielders, although the second baseman is not expected to have as strong an arm as the shortstop, as his throw to first is shorter.  Responsibilities for the second baseman typically include:

* Fielding ground balls between the first and second base bags
* Acting as the pivot man for double plays started by the shortstop or third baseman
* Providing a cutoff for balls hit to the outfield on his side of the field
* Covering first base on balls that the first baseman fields
* Covering second base on a steal attempt

{{fsharpTitle|Lists}}

A '''list''' is an ordered collection of related values, and is roughly equivalent to a linked list data structure used in many other languages. F# provides a module, &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.List&lt;/code&gt;, for common operations on lists; this module is imported automatically by F#, so the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; module is already accessible from every F# application.

== Creating Lists ==
=== Using List Literals ===
There are a variety of ways to create lists in F#, the most straightforward method being a semicolon-delimited sequence of values. Here's a list of numbers in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10];;
val numbers : int list

&gt; numbers;;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that all values in a list must have the same type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [1; 2; 3; 4; &quot;cat&quot;; 6; 7];;

  -------------^^^^^^

stdin(120,14): error FS0001: This expression has type
        string
but is here used with type
        int.&lt;/source&gt;

=== Using the &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;cons&quot;) Operator ===
It is very common to build lists up by prepending or consing a value to an existing list using the &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; operator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3]&lt;/source&gt;

: ''Note'': the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is an empty list. By itself, it has the type &lt;code&gt;'T list&lt;/code&gt;; since its used with &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, it has the type &lt;code&gt;int list&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; operator prepends items to a list, returning a new list. It is a right-associative operator with the following type:
: &lt;code&gt;val inline (::) : 'T -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'T list&lt;/code&gt;

This operator does not actually mutate lists, it creates an entirely new list with the prepended element in the front. Here's an example in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: [];;
val x : int list

&gt; let y = 12 :: x;;
val y : int list

&gt; x;;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4]

&gt; y;;
val it : int list = [12; 1; 2; 3; 4]&lt;/source&gt;

Consing creates a new list, but it reuses nodes from the old list, so consing a list is an extremely efficient O(1) operation.

=== Using List.init ===
The &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; module contains a useful method, &lt;code&gt;List.init&lt;/code&gt;, which has the type
: &lt;code&gt;val init : int -&gt; (int -&gt; 'T) -&gt; 'T list&lt;/code&gt;

The first argument is the desired length of the new list, and the second argument is an initializer function which generates items in the list. &lt;code&gt;List.init&lt;/code&gt; is used as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; List.init 5 (fun index -&gt; index * 3);;
val it : int list = [0; 3; 6; 9; 12]

&gt; List.init 5 (fun index -&gt; (index, index * index, index * index * index));;
val it : (int * int * int) list
= [(0, 0, 0); (1, 1, 1); (2, 4, 8); (3, 9, 27); (4, 16, 64)]&lt;/source&gt;

F# calls the initializer function &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; times with the index of each item in the list, starting at index &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Using List Comprehensions ===
List comprehensions refers to special syntactic constructs in some languages used for generating lists.
F# has an expressive list comprehension syntax, which comes in two forms, ranges and generators.

Ranges have the constructs &lt;code&gt;[start .. end]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[start .. step .. end]&lt;/code&gt;. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [1 .. 10];;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]

&gt; [1 .. 2 .. 10];;
val it : int list = [1; 3; 5; 7; 9]

&gt; ['a' .. 's'];;
val it : char list
= ['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd'; 'e'; 'f'; 'g'; 'h'; 'i'; 'j'; 'k'; 'l'; 'm'; 'n'; 'o';
   'p'; 'q'; 'r'; 's']&lt;/source&gt;

Generators have the construct &lt;code&gt;[for x in collection do ... yield expr]&lt;/code&gt;, and they are much more flexible than ranges. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; [ for a in 1 .. 10 do
        yield (a * a) ];;
val it : int list = [1; 4; 9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81; 100]

&gt; [ for a in 1 .. 3 do
    for b in 3 .. 7 do
        yield (a, b) ];;
val it : (int * int) list
= [(1, 3); (1, 4); (1, 5); (1, 6); (1, 7); (2, 3); (2, 4); (2, 5); (2, 6);
   (2, 7); (3, 3); (3, 4); (3, 5); (3, 6); (3, 7)]

&gt; [ for a in 1 .. 100 do
    if a % 3 = 0 &amp;&amp; a % 5 = 0 then yield a];;
val it : int list = [15; 30; 45; 60; 75; 90]&lt;/source&gt;

Its possible to loop over any collection, not just numbers. This example loops over a &lt;code&gt;char list&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x = [ 'a' .. 'f' ];;

val x : char list

&gt; [for a in x do yield [a; a; a] ];;
val it : char list list
= [['a'; 'a'; 'a']; ['b'; 'b'; 'b']; ['c'; 'c'; 'c']; ['d'; 'd'; 'd'];
   ['e'; 'e'; 'e']; ['f'; 'f'; 'f']]&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword pushes a single value into a list. Another keyword, &lt;code&gt;yield!&lt;/code&gt;, pushes a collection of values into the list. The &lt;code&gt;yield!&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [for a in 1 .. 5 do
    yield! [ a .. a + 3 ] ];;
val it : int list
= [1; 2; 3; 4; 2; 3; 4; 5; 3; 4; 5; 6; 4; 5; 6; 7; 5; 6; 7; 8]&lt;/source&gt;

Its possible to mix the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yield!&lt;/code&gt; keywords:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [for a in 1 .. 5 do
    match a with
    | 3 -&gt; yield! [&quot;hello&quot;; &quot;world&quot;]
    | _ -&gt; yield a.ToString() ];;
val it : string list = [&quot;1&quot;; &quot;2&quot;; &quot;hello&quot;; &quot;world&quot;; &quot;4&quot;; &quot;5&quot;]&lt;/source&gt;

==== Alternative List Comprehension Syntax ====
The samples above use the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword explicitly, however F# provides a slightly different arrow-based syntax for list comprehensions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [ for a in 1 .. 5 -&gt; a * a];;
val it : int list = [1; 4; 9; 16; 25]

&gt; [ for a in 1 .. 5 do
    for b in 1 .. 3 -&gt; a, b];;
val it : (int * int) list
= [(1, 1); (1, 2); (1, 3); (2, 1); (2, 2); (2, 3); (3, 1); (3, 2); (3, 3);
   (4, 1); (4, 2); (4, 3); (5, 1); (5, 2); (5, 3)]

&gt; [ for a in 1 .. 5 -&gt;&gt; [1 .. 3] ];;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3; 1; 2; 3; 1; 2; 3; 1; 2; 3; 1; 2; 3]&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yield!&lt;/code&gt; operators respectively. While its still common to see list comprehensions expressed using &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, those constructs will not be emphasized in this book since they have been deprecated in favor of &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yield!&lt;/code&gt;.

== Pattern Matching Lists ==
You use the same syntax to match against lists that you use to create lists. Here's a simple program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let rec sum total = function
    | [] -&gt; total
    | hd :: tl -&gt; sum (hd + total) tl

let main() =
    let numbers = [ 1 .. 5 ]
    let sumOfNumbers = sum 0 numbers
    printfn &quot;sumOfNumbers: %i&quot; sumOfNumbers
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; method has the type &lt;code&gt;val sum : int -&gt; int list -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;. It recursively enumerates through the list, adding each item in the list to the value &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;. Step by step, the function works as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! total
! input
! hd :: tl
! sum (hd + total) tl
|-
| 0
| [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
| 1 :: [2; 3; 4; 5]
| sum (1 + 0 = 1) [2; 3; 4; 5]
|-
| 1
| [2; 3; 4; 5]
| 2 :: [3; 4; 5]
| sum (2 + 1 = 3) [3; 4; 5]
|-
| 3
| [3; 4; 5]
| 3 :: [4; 5]
| sum (3 + 3 = 6) [4; 5]
|-
| 6
| [4; 5]
| 4 :: [5]
| sum (4 + 6 = 10) [5]
|-
| 10
| [5]
| 5 :: []
| sum (5 + 10 = 15) []
|-
| 15
| []
| n/a
| returns total
|}

=== Reverse A List ===
Frequently, we use recursion and pattern matching to generate new lists from existing lists. A simple example is reversing a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let reverse l =
    let rec loop acc = function
        | [] -&gt; acc
        | hd :: tl -&gt; loop (hd :: acc) tl
    loop [] l&lt;/source&gt;

: ''Note to beginners:'' the pattern seen above is very common. Often, when we iterate through lists, we want to build up a new list. To do this recursively, we use an ''accumulating parameter'' (which is called &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; above) which holds our new list as we generate it. Its also very common to use a nested function, usually named &lt;code&gt;innerXXXXX&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;, to hide the implementation details of the function from clients (in other words, clients should not have to pass in their own accumulating parameter).

&lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;val reverse : 'a list -&gt; 'a list&lt;/code&gt;. You'd use this function as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; reverse [1 .. 5];;
val it : int list = [5; 4; 3; 2; 1]&lt;/source&gt;

This simple function works because items are always prepended to the accumulating parameter &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in series of recursive calls as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! acc
! input
! loop (hd :: acc) tl
|-
| []
| [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
| loop (1 :: []) [2; 3; 4; 5]
|-
| [1]
| [2; 3; 4; 5]
| loop (2 :: [1]) [3; 4; 5]
|-
| [2; 1]
| [3; 4; 5]
| loop (3 :: [2; 1]) [4; 5]
|-
| [3; 2; 1]
| [4; 5]
| loop (4 :: [3; 2; 1]) [5]
|-
| [4; 3; 2; 1]
| [5]
| loop (5 :: [4; 3; 2; 1]) []
|-
| [5; 4; 3; 2; 1]
| []
| returns acc
|}

&lt;code&gt;List.rev&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in function for reversing a list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; List.rev [1 .. 5];;
val it : int list = [5; 4; 3; 2; 1]&lt;/source&gt;

=== Filter A List ===
Oftentimes, we want to filter a list for certain values. We can write a filter function as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let rec filter predicate = function
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd :: tl -&gt;
        match predicate hd with
        | true -&gt; hd::filter predicate tl
        | false -&gt; filter predicate tl

let main() =
    let filteredNumbers = [1 .. 10] |&gt; filter (fun x -&gt; x % 2 = 0)
    printfn &quot;filteredNumbers: %A&quot; filteredNumbers
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; method has the type &lt;code&gt;val filter : ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list&lt;/code&gt;. The program above outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;filteredNumbers: [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]&lt;/pre&gt;

We can make the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; above tail-recursive with a slight modification: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let filter predicate l =
    let rec loop acc = function
        | [] -&gt; acc
        | hd :: tl -&gt;
            match predicate hd with
            | true -&gt; loop (hd :: acc) tl
            | false -&gt; loop (acc) tl
    List.rev (loop [] l)
&lt;/source&gt;

: ''Note:'' Since accumulating parameters often build up lists in reverse order, its very common to see &lt;code&gt;List.rev&lt;/code&gt; called immediately before returning a list from a function to put it in correct order.

=== Mapping Lists ===
We can write a function which maps a list to another list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let rec map converter = function
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd :: tl -&gt; converter hd::map converter tl

let main() =
    let mappedNumbers = [1 .. 10] |&gt; map ( fun x -&gt; (x * x).ToString() )
    printfn &quot;mappedNumbers: %A&quot; mappedNumbers
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;val map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list&lt;/code&gt;. The program above outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;mappedNumbers: [&quot;1&quot;; &quot;4&quot;; &quot;9&quot;; &quot;16&quot;; &quot;25&quot;; &quot;36&quot;; &quot;49&quot;; &quot;64&quot;; &quot;81&quot;; &quot;100&quot;]&lt;/pre&gt;

A tail-recursive map function can be written as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let map converter l =
    let rec loop acc = function
        | [] -&gt; acc
        | hd :: tl -&gt; loop (converter hd :: acc) tl
    List.rev (loop [] l)
&lt;/source&gt;

Like the example above, we use the accumulating-param-and-reverse pattern to make the function tail recursive.
    
== Using the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; Module ==
Although a reverse, filter, and map method were implemented above, its much more convenient to use F#'s built-in functions:

'''&lt;code&gt;List.rev&lt;/code&gt;''' reverses a list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; List.rev [1 .. 5];;
val it : int list = [5; 4; 3; 2; 1]&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;List.filter&lt;/code&gt;''' filters a list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [1 .. 10] |&gt; List.filter (fun x -&gt; x % 2 = 0);;
val it : int list = [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;List.map&lt;/code&gt;''' maps a list from one type to another:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [1 .. 10] |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; (x * x).ToString());;
val it : string list
= [&quot;1&quot;; &quot;4&quot;; &quot;9&quot;; &quot;16&quot;; &quot;25&quot;; &quot;36&quot;; &quot;49&quot;; &quot;64&quot;; &quot;81&quot;; &quot;100&quot;]&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;List.append&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; Operator ===
&lt;code&gt;List.append&lt;/code&gt; has the type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val append : 'T list -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'T list&lt;/source&gt;

As you can imagine, the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; functions appends one list to another. The &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator is an infix operator which performs the same function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let first      = [1; 2; 3;]
let second     = [4; 5; 6;]
let combined1  = first @ second           (* returns [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6] *)
let combined2  = List.append first second (* returns [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6] *)&lt;/source&gt;

Since lists are immutable, appending two lists together requires copying all of the elements of the lists to create a brand new list. However, since lists are immutable, its only necessary to copy the elements of the first list; the second list does not need to be copied. Represented in memory, appending two lists can be diagrammed as follows:

We start with the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
   first = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []

   second = 4 :: 5 :: 6 :: []&lt;/pre&gt;

Appending the two lists, &lt;code&gt;first @ second&lt;/code&gt;, results in the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
      first = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []
              \______  ______/
                     \/     
   combined = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: second
                  (copied)&lt;/pre&gt;

In other words, F# prepends a copy of &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; to create the &lt;code&gt;combined&lt;/code&gt; list. This hypothesis can be verified using the following in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let first = [1; 2; 3;]
let second = [4; 5; 6;]
let combined = first @ second
let secondHalf = List.tail (List.tail (List.tail combined));;

val first : int list
val second : int list
val combined : int list
val secondHalf : int list

&gt; System.Object.ReferenceEquals(second, secondHalf);;
val it : bool = true&lt;/source&gt;
The two lists &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;secondHalf&lt;/code&gt; are literally the same object in memory, meaning F# reused the nodes from &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; when constructing the new list &lt;code&gt;combined&lt;/code&gt;.

Appending two lists, &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list2&lt;/code&gt; has a space and time complexity of O(list1.Length).

=== &lt;code&gt;List.choose&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;List.choose&lt;/code&gt; has the following definition:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val choose : ('T -&gt; 'U option) -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'U list&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;choose&lt;/code&gt; method is clever because it filters and maps a list simultaneously:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; [1 .. 10] |&gt; List.choose (fun x -&gt;
    match x % 2 with
    | 0 -&gt; Some(x, x*x, x*x*x)
    | _ -&gt; None);;
val it : (int * int * int) list
= [(2, 4, 8); (4, 16, 64); (6, 36, 216); (8, 64, 512); (10, 100, 1000)]&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;choose&lt;/code&gt; filters for items that return &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt; and maps them to another value in a single step.

=== &lt;code&gt;List.fold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List.foldBack&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;List.fold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List.foldBack&lt;/code&gt; have the following definitions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val fold : ('State -&gt; 'T -&gt; 'State) -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'State
val foldBack : ('T -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'State) -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'State&lt;/source&gt;

A &quot;fold&quot; operation applies a function to each element in a list, aggregates the result of the function in an accumulator variable, and returns the accumulator as the result of the fold operation. This description makes fold operations sound more complicated, but the implementation is actually very simple:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* List.fold implementation *)
let rec fold (f : 'State -&gt; 'T -&gt; 'State) (seed : 'State) = function
    | [] -&gt; seed
    | hd :: tl -&gt; fold f (f seed hd) tl
    
(* List.foldBack implementation *)
let rec foldBack (f : 'T -&gt; 'State -&gt; 'State) (items : 'T list) (seed : 'State) =
    match items with
    | [] -&gt; seed
    | hd :: tl -&gt; f hd (foldBack f tl seed)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; applies a function to each element in the from left to right, while &lt;code&gt;foldBack&lt;/code&gt; applies a function to each element from right to left. Let's examine the fold functions in more technical detail using the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let input = [ 2; 4; 6; 8; 10 ]
let f accumulator input = accumulator * input
let seed = 1
let output = List.fold f seed input&lt;/source&gt;
The value of &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3840&lt;/code&gt;. This table demonstrates how &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; was calculated:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! accumulator
! input
! f accumulator input = accumulator * input 
|-
| 1 (seed)
| 2
| 1 * 2 = &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
| 4
| 2 * 4 = &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
| 6
| 8 * 6 = &lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
| 8
| 48 * 8 = &lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;
| 10
| 384 * 10 = 3840 (return value)
|}
&lt;code&gt;List.fold&lt;/code&gt; passes an accumulator with an item from the list into a function. The output of the function is passed as the accumulator for the next item.

As shown above, the &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; function processes the list from the first item to the last item in the list, or left to right. As you can imagine, &lt;code&gt;List.foldBack&lt;/code&gt; works the same way, but it operates on lists from right to left. Given a fold function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and a list &lt;code&gt;[1; 2; 3; 4; 5]&lt;/code&gt;, the fold methods transform our lists in the following ways:
: &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;f (f (f (f (f (f seed 1) 2) 3) 4) 5&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;foldBack&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;f 1 (f 2 (f 3(f 4(f 5 seed))))&lt;/code&gt;

There are several other functions in the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; module related to folding:
* &lt;code&gt;fold2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldBack2&lt;/code&gt;: folds two lists together simultaneously.
* &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reduceBack&lt;/code&gt;: same as &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldBack&lt;/code&gt;, except it uses the first (or last) element in the list as the seed value.
* &lt;code&gt;scan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanBack&lt;/code&gt;: similar to &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldBack&lt;/code&gt;, except it returns all of the intermediate values as a list rather than the final accumulated value.

Fold functions can be surprisingly useful:

'''Summing the numbers 1 - 100'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let x = [ 1 .. 100 ] |&gt; List.fold ( + ) 0 (* returns 5050 *)&lt;/source&gt;

In F#, mathematical operators are no different from functions. As shown above, we can actually pass the addition operator to the &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; function, because the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator has the definition &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Computing a factorial'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let factorial n = [ 1I .. n ] |&gt; List.fold ( * ) 1I
let x = factorial 13I (* returns 6227020800I *)&lt;/source&gt;

'''Computing population standard deviation'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let stddev (input : float list) =
    let sampleSize = float input.Length
    let mean = (input |&gt; List.fold ( + ) 0.0) / sampleSize
    let differenceOfSquares =
        input |&gt; List.fold
            ( fun sum item -&gt; sum + Math.Pow(item - mean, 2.0) ) 0.0
    let variance = differenceOfSquares / sampleSize
    Math.Sqrt(variance)

let x = stddev [ 5.0; 6.0; 8.0; 9.0 ] (* returns 1.58113883 *)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;List.find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List.tryFind&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;List.find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List.tryfind&lt;/code&gt; have the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
val find : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'T
val tryFind : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'T list -&gt; 'T option
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tryFind&lt;/code&gt; methods return the first item in the list for which the search function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. They only differ as follows: if no items are found that meet the search function, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; throws a &lt;code&gt;KeyNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;tryfind&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;.

The two functions are used as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let cities = [&quot;Bellevue&quot;; &quot;Omaha&quot;; &quot;Lincoln&quot;; &quot;Papillion&quot;; &quot;Fremont&quot;];;

val cities : string list =
  [&quot;Bellevue&quot;; &quot;Omaha&quot;; &quot;Lincoln&quot;; &quot;Papillion&quot;; &quot;Fremont&quot;]

&gt; let findStringContaining text (items : string list) =
    items |&gt; List.find(fun item -&gt; item.Contains(text));;

val findStringContaining : string -&gt; string list -&gt; string

&gt; let findStringContaining2 text (items : string list) =
    items |&gt; List.tryFind(fun item -&gt; item.Contains(text));;

val findStringContaining2 : string -&gt; string list -&gt; string option

&gt; findStringContaining &quot;Papi&quot; cities;;
val it : string = &quot;Papillion&quot;

&gt; findStringContaining &quot;Hastings&quot; cities;;
System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.

== Exercises ==
[[F Sharp Programming/Solutions/Lists|Solutions]].

=== Pair and Unpair ===
Write two functions with the following definitions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val pair : 'a list -&gt; ('a * 'a) list
val unpair : ('a * 'a) list -&gt; 'a list&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt; function should convert a list into a list of pairs as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
pair [ 1 .. 10 ] = [(1, 2); (3, 4); (5, 6); (7, 8); (9, 10)]
pair [ &quot;one&quot;; &quot;two&quot;; &quot;three&quot;; &quot;four&quot;; &quot;five&quot; ] = [(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;); (&quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;)]
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;unpair&lt;/code&gt; function should convert a list of pairs back into a traditional list as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
unpair [(1, 2); (3, 4); (5, 6)] =  [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
unpair [(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;); (&quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;)] = [&quot;one&quot;; &quot;two&quot;; &quot;three&quot;; &quot;four&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Expand a List ===
Write a function with the following type definition:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;val expand : 'a list -&gt; 'a list list&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;expand&lt;/code&gt; function should expand a list as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
expand [ 1 .. 5 ] = [ [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]; [2; 3; 4; 5]; [3; 4; 5]; [4; 5]; [5] ]
expand [ &quot;monkey&quot;; &quot;kitty&quot;; &quot;bunny&quot;; &quot;rat&quot; ] =
    [ [&quot;monkey&quot;; &quot;kitty&quot;; &quot;bunny&quot;; &quot;rat&quot;];
      [&quot;kitty&quot;; &quot;bunny&quot;; &quot;rat&quot;];
      [&quot;bunny&quot;; &quot;rat&quot;];
      [&quot;rat&quot;] ]
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Biochemical Structure in Genetics}}
Genetics is a subdivision of biology which focuses its study on heredity as well as the mutations and variations that exist in living organisms. Genetics attempts to describe these variations through study of the molecules involved in the processes of transcription, translation, gene expression, and hereditary patterns. The most prominent molecular structures studied are [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]], and the numerous helper proteins involved in nearly every process including genetics.

Biochemical structure and function is necessary for understanding the workings of genetic molecules.

==Structure of DNA==

There are a total of four different deoxyribonucleotdies: deoxyguanylate (G), deoxyadenylate (A), deoxycytidylate (C), and deoxythymidylate (T).  The three groups that compose a nucleotide are a nitrogenous base (2 carbon-ringed purines for A &amp; G or 1 carbon-ringed pyrimidines for C &amp; T), a pentose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group.  In double stranded DNA, deoxyadenylate (A) and deoxythymidylate (T) are found complementary to each other, forming two hydrogen bonds, and deoxyguanylate (G) is paired with deoxycytidylate (C) forming three hydrogen bonds. 
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DNA Nitrogenous bases.jpg|thumb|left|The nucleotide bases of RNA and DNA. Note that DNA contains Thymine to bind to Adenine while RNA binds to Adenine with Uracil.]]

[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|Chemical model of a double-stranded DNA molecule.]]

DNA molecules are made up of two complementary strands, which are linear polymers of the four different nucleotide bases mentioned above. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonding between the base pairs, forming a double helix with the sugar-phosphate group on the outside and the bases on the inside. This 3D structural arrangement of the DNA molecule, proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, is crucial to its role as the storage of hereditary information in two ways. Since the base pairs take about the same shape, they are able to fit very well into the double helix structure regardless of their sequence. This lack of constraint allows the sequence of bases within a DNA strand to be an efficient method of information storage. Furthermore, the base-pairing enables each DNA strand to act as a template for its counterpart strand, allowing the stored information to be passed on an duplicated.

It's important to note that the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs are weaker than the covalent bonds found within the bases themselves. This feature of DNA enables the bonds between the base pairs to be reversibly broken, which is necessary for biochemical processes, such as transcription of DNA to mRNA in protein synthesis. Nevertheless, the hydrogen bonds are strong enough to allow for the stable formation of the double helix structure.

==DNA, RNA, and their differences==

Deoxyribonucleic acids combine to form a double-stranded macromolecule of deoxyribonicleotides that stores genetic information encoded through the specific patterning of nitrogenous base pairings. The double-stranded structure of DNA is well preserved unlike RNA which may take many forms. This is because DNA nucleotides possess a negatively charged phosphate group which creates electrostatic repulsion between other negatively-charged phosphate groups in the structure. 

RNA also contains the same negatively charged phosphate groups, yet the single-stranded nature of RNA allows it to hydrogen bond with itself via base pair bonding, with the repelling phosphate groups pointed away from each other. This allows for diverse structures of RNA that achieve different functions based on the specific structure, similar to proteins.

The information contained in DNA is used in the production of proteins.  The genetic code in DNA can be transcribed into RNA which can then be translated into proteins. The main difference between DNA and RNA is that RNA has the nitrogenous base Uracil (U) and the sugar ribose whereas DNA has the nitrogenous base thymine (T) and the sugar deoxyribose. However, it is important to note that while DNA is usually double stranded, there are exceptions to this rule. Likewise, RNA can at times be double stranded. Another interesting contrast between DNA and RNA is that while DNA is normally coiled linearly into neatly arranged chromosomes that are contained within the nucleus, RNA is drifts freely through the cytoplasm in an unorganized manner.

==Evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts==

Eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes. This occurred when an aerobic bacteria infected the cell of an anaerobic eukaryote to become what we now know as the mitochondrion. Mitochondria have a double cell membrane and contain its own DNA. This suggests that the evolution of mitochondria stems from the idea that the combination or ingestion of two bacterial sources created the mitochondria. A similar evolutionary path has been theorized for the creation of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are similar to mitochondria in that it also has a double membrane and its own DNA. However it originated from cyanobacteria. The chloroplast has its own DNA which codes for redox proteins involved in electron transport in photosynthesis. 

Mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced and confirm that mitochondria originated from a eubacterial source, specifically known as the α-proteobacterial ancestor and not from an archaebacterial source. The closest known relative to mitochondria are α-proteobacteria. This was determined by phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mitcochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA in proteins and fungi have been thoroughly studied. These studies indicate that ATP production, coupled with electron transport and translation of mitochondrial proteins are common to all mitochondrial genomes and can be directly traced back to the α-proteobacterial ancestor. 

[[File:chloroplastsfigure1.jpg|thumbnail|The chloroplast has a double membrane with its own DNA. ]]

A multidisciplinary approach has been used to analyze the mechanism and specific timeline of chloroplast evolution. Several sources of evidence demonstrate that all chloroplasts are derived from a single endosymbiotic cyanobacterium. Consequently, they differentiated into various eukaryotic taxa by the means of several secondary endosymbioses. A Comparative genomics approach has been used to study the evolution of chloroplasts. The genome of chloroplasts is significantly reduced when comparing to the genome of free cyanobacteria. However, the high similarities between the existing parts support the theory of evolution from cyanobacterial sources.

==Genetics in Biochemistry==

The DNA sequence determines the protein composition through codons, which are a set of three nucleotide bases. The linear sequence of deoxyribonlueotides has a complementary strand held together by [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bond]], forming a double helix. Before the cell divides, the strands separate to form another complementary strand, thus creating two identical DNA strands. 

Although this process is very efficient, occasionally a '''mutation''' will occur. A mutation is a mistake in the replication process and may lead to changes in the function, expression, or structure of the protein it encodes for.  The mutation may result in a change of an [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] residue, which affects the folding of the protein and therefore its function. Somatic mutation occurs in non-reproductive cells and only occurs in that certain organism. This type of mutation does not get passed down to their offspring by their genes. Mutations that occur in the reproductive cells will be replicated and passed down on to progeny.

Mutations occur at random and can either be harmful or beneficial to an organism.  The factor of it being beneficial or harmful depends on their environment and how it affects their survival. Most mutations are harmful and may cause malfunctioning of important biological processes and decrease the overall fitness of the organism. Such a mutation is generally selected against and will disappear as quickly as it had appeared. A beneficial mutation, on the other hand, increases the fitness of the organism. If passed on to the progeny, these mutations will most likely be selected for and gradually grow within the population.

Occasionally, a DNA stand is duplicated twice, resulting in double the amount of chromosomes in a particular cell. This duplication can be passed on to the next generation and is generally not harmful.  As different mutations appear in the two sets of chromosomes, new functions distinct functions are taken up by each pair.

Mutations can be classified as point mutations, in which a single amino acid is changed, or frameshift mutations, which affect the sequence of all amino acids following the mutation. The range of effect varies as well. There may be no change, small change, or a huge change in their phenotype depending on the mutation. 

Point mutations, also known as single base substitution, can be categorized by the type of substitution that occurs. Transitions involve either the substitution of a purine base to another purine base or the substitution of a pyrimidine base to another pyrimidine base. Transversion involves the substitution of a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Purines|purine]] with a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine with a purine. Point mutation may be harmless but it could also be harmful. It may reduce or lessen the function of a gene resulting in lethality. A life example of result of point mutation is sickle-cell anemia. The glutamic acid in amino acid chain is swapped with valine in beta globin chain of haemoglobin. Valine is less polar than glutamic acid and causes problems in the proper function of the cell. 

Frameshift mutations include insertions, deletions, and duplication of nucleotides by a number that is not divisible by three. Essentially, any mutation that results in completely different sequence of amino acid after the point of mutation is considered to be a frameshift mutation because it shifts the triplet framework and thereby disrupts all subsequent amino acid sequence.  The resulting protein may be nonfunctional. Insertion is the addition of one or more nucleotide base-pairs into the sequence, and deletion is the disappearance of one or more nucleotide base-pairs from the sequence. Duplication occurs when one or more nucleotide base-pairs is repeated in the sequence. Not all insertion, deletion, and duplication result in a frameshift mutation.

Additionally, mutations can be classified by their functional effects. There are four such categories: nonsense, missense, silent, and neutral mutations. A nonsense mutation results in the formation of a stop codon, which may truncate the protein. A missense mutation is one that results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. A silent mutation does not produce a change in amino acid sequence. A neutral mutation is one that results in a codon that codes for an amino acid that is different, but similar to the original amino acid such that the original function is preserved.

Another type of mutation is back mutation, or reversion. It involves a nucleotide change back to its original sequence where a point mutation had occurred. Consequently, the original function is restored.

One of the major themes in biology and chemistry is that the form fits function and vice versa. DNA is a prime example of that ideology. The structure of DNA not only allows for its near-perfect replication and repair, but its specific sequence determines the specific protein that will be made. 

Information in DNA is encoded by its linear sequence. The process in which the information stored in this 1-dimensional form turns into a 3-dimensional protein form is completed via an intermediary RNA. First, the linear sequence of DNA is transcribed into its complementary RNA strand called the messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is then translated on a ribosome into a polypeptide chain. This polypeptide chain folds via noncovalent interactions and with the help of “molecular chaperones”. Ultimately, the structure of the protein is determined by the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain. The structure of the protein is crucial to its function. 

In somewhat recent years, DNA sequencing has become quite popular. DNA sequencing refers to any biochemical method to determine order of the nucleotide bases, guanine, thymine, adenine, and thymine. DNA sequencing has allowed for scientific advancements and through it, many scientists have been able to recreate genomes of various plants and animals including humans (The Human Genome Project).

One important purpose in sequencing DNA is to compare the different DNA sequences of different animals. In a project led by David H. Haussler, scientists compared the DNA sequences of 19 different mammals to reconstruct a significant portion of a genome of what could possibly be a common ancestor. This ability to reconstruct ancestral genome is more reliable than trying to extract DNA from a fossil. By reconstructing the ancestral genome, the researchers were able to see how DNA changed in each evolutionary lineage. They could see all the different mutations that occurred in each genome to lead to the current mammal form. They were also able to see which DNA sequences were necessary and which were not as well as which are necessary now and which are not. 

Sequence comparisons do not only pertain to DNA sequences; there are also RNA sequence comparisons and protein sequence comparisons. Sequence comparisons are usually carried out by sequence alignments. In sequence alignments, the two rows of residue are aligned so that similar nucleotide sequences are in successive columns. There are two main types of sequence alignment – global and local alignments. Global alignment is good for sets that are very similar and are of roughly equal size. The global alignment attempts to align the whole strands. Local alignments, on the other hand, are better for dissimilar sets. Local alignments attempt to align certain segments within the whole strands.  There is also a hybrid method called the semi-global method or &quot;glocal&quot; methods. These methods try to find the best possible alignment. As mentioned above, comparing DNA sequences and finding similarities reveals evolutionary relationships. However, more importantly finding similarities also reveals functional and structural relationships. It is through sequence comparisons that mutations are revealed as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The bellows are the engine for making the sound in an accordion. They are the lungs of the instrument - depending on how hard the bellows are pulled, the sound will be softer or louder. A well-maintained accordion can have a good dynamic range from ''pianissimo'' to around a ''forte''. When totally stationary, the instrument is silent. With accordions that also have inbuilt electronic synthesizers, the electronic sound will continue as long as keys are depressed (but this is beyond the scope of this book).

The bellows should be operated with your left hand. Bellows can be somewhat fragile, so don't pull them too hard or too far out. When pulling or pushing, avoid jerky motions and move them cleanly.

Eventually you'll need to change direction and move the bellows back in to keep playing. This can be a bit tricky to do correctly. When changing direction, try to move smoothly yet quickly so avoid a break in the melody or make the dynamics change suddenly. Resist the temptation to jerk the accordion. It's advisable not to pull the bellows out too far, because it's uncomfortable for the left hand to be extended like that and it affects accuracy.

If you're finding you have to move your bellows a lot, check to see if they aren't leaking by letting the bellows fall open on your lap without touching them or depressing any keys. If they move quickly (or you hear a &quot;whoosh&quot; noise), there's likely a leak, which means the instrument consumes more air than is necessary. (If they just creep out slowly, that's okay. Most accordions naturally let out very small amounts of air.) Find a reputable accordion repairman and have it fixed - you can't play properly with leaking bellows!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The accordion is a portable box-shaped musical instrument of the hand-held bellows-driven free-reed aerophone family, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist.

The instrument is played by compressing or expanding its bellows, while pressing buttons or keys, causing valves called pallets to open which allow air to flow across strips of metal called reeds that vibrate to produce sound inside the body, which then escapes through grilles.

There are three major types of accordion: the diatonic button accordion, the chromatic button accordion (sometimes called a bayan), and the unisoric chromatic piano accordion.

Although the accordion has a reputation in some circles of being cheap, wheezy instruments capable of playing only polkas and folk music, this is not always the case! A full-sized, properly-maintained accordion in the right hands can play almost any type of music, ranging from classical music like Bach and Chopin all the way to jazz and pop, and quite convincingly too. Indeed, many European conservatories and universities regard it as a serious concert instrument, and allow it to be studied at the same level as a piano or string instrument.

This book is currently only about playing the Piano Accordion, although there are many similarities in function to similar instruments, so playing skills such as Bellows, Stradella Bass and Register Switches will transfer to other instruments.

Not all parts will be introduced at first, only sufficient to get you started playing tunes.

This book is to help learners who have already learned the Chinese language for at least half a year. Before you use this book, you've got to know some basic words and expressions of Chinese. Of course, you must also know English.&lt;br&gt;
To help you develop your Chinese writing, reading and speaking skills, short passages and some audio will be necessary. 
This book provides proper passages chosen from Chinese magazines, newspapers and brochures to help you to improve your reading comprehension and writing ability.

== How does this book help me? ==
&lt;br&gt;
Without any notes on the texts, the articles may not be available for you to understand. What this book does is making some notes on the text and to tell you how to use the word which is annotated.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;Passage One：This is a humorous story between a husband and his wife.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lastT lan14b&quot;&gt;经典笑话：妻子的埋怨 &lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;lastC&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;
			  	   一对结婚四十年的老夫妻在谈话。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;妻子埋怨说：“你没有以前对我好了，以前你总是紧挨着我坐。”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;丈夫答：“这好办。”随即便移坐到她的身旁。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“可过去你总是紧搂着我。”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“这样好吗？”他搂住了妻子的脖子。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“你还记得以前怎样吻我的脖颈，咬我的耳朵吗？”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;他忙跳起身，走出房门。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;妻子忙问：“你去哪儿？”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;丈夫答：“我得去取我的假牙。”

      <text xml:space="preserve">Schur's theorem states that for every positive integer ''r'', there exists a positive integer ''S'', such that for every partition of the integers {1, ..., ''S''} into ''r'' parts, one of the parts contains integers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' with
:''x'' + ''y'' = ''z''. 

'''Proof:''' Let ''n'' = ''R''(3, ..., 3) where ''R''(3, ..., 3) denotes the Ramsey number on ''r'' colors. Now take ''S'' to be ''n'' and partition the integers {1, ..., ''n''} into ''r'' parts, which we denote by ''colors''. That is, the integers in the first part are said to be ''colored'' c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the integers in the second part are said to be colored c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and so on till color c&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. We also then say that {1, ..., ''S''} has been ''r-colored''. This terminology is common in Ramsey theory. 

Now color the edges of K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as follows: An edge ''xy'' (this denotes an edge which joins vertices ''x'' and ''y'') is given color ''c'' if |''x'' - ''y''| was colored ''c'' in the partitioning. Now K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; will definitely contain a monochromatic triangle, say built out of the vertices ''i'' &gt; ''j''&gt; ''k''. Suppose the triangle is colored c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. Now ''i'' - ''j'', ''i'' - ''k'' and ''j'' - ''k'' will also be colored c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. will belong to the same part in the partition. It only remains to take ''x'' = ''i'' - ''j'', ''y'' = ''j'' - ''k'' and ''z'' = ''i'' - ''k'' to complete the proof.

==Mathematics In Python==

There are two main additional modules that enable us to use Python as a very sophisticated environment for dealing with algebra and numerical problems, these are the built in 'math' module and an additional module 'sympy', which can be downloaded from the internet (see the 'Getting Additional Modules' section at the end).

Remember that to use a module we must first import it using the import command, for example:

    &lt;tt&gt;from sympy import *&lt;/tt&gt;

''This is a more thorough book that covers more detail, however it is written as a way of learning computer science using Python as a starting language and so may not directly relate to programming in engineering. Nevertheless if software design is closer to your interests/needs then this might be the book for you.''

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;After Oxford’s 1909-12 run in the Boat Race, Vanity Fair published just such a tale (April 3, 1912), though its author, “Cambriouleur,” was probably not Forster but B. Fletcher Robinson.&quot;

I find this comment extremely unlikely as Bertram Fletcher Robinson died on 21st January 1907.  However, it is interesting to note that he did write a short story about rowing that is entitled ''In Which a Hero of Henley Suffers Adversity'' (''Vanity Fair'', 4th July 1905, pp. 18-19).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is News? ==
News can be defined as &quot;anything timely that interests a number of persons.&quot;

News writers try to uphold three traditional journalistic values:
* Accuracy (factual, true)
* Clarity (clear, unambiguous)
* Objectivity (free of bias)

== Where does news come from? ==
Journalists gather news from various sources.

The assignment editor continuously monitors:
* wire services (like AP and Reuters)
* police and fire radio scanners
* National Weather Service broadcasts
* telephone beat check and phoners
* news releases that are faxed or mailed in
* stock and sports tickers
* cable news channels and other media

The assignment editor may decide that a story
* can be read as is by a newscaster
* should be rewritten by a copywriter
* needs an actuality (a.k.a. sound bite), a recorded quote from a news maker
* should be written as a wraparound, with a lead-in and lead-out around an actuality
* needs raw sound (a.k.a. natural sound), background sounds from the environment

Often the assignment editor will assign the story to a reporter to gather more details:
*A field reporter goes out into the field to cover on-the-scene breaking news.
* A beat reporter regularly covers a beat, like City Hall and the Police Department.	
*A feature reporter covers soft news‚ stories, like health, consumer and entertainment.
* A stringer is a free-lance reporter who works on an as-needed basis for many stations. 

== Journalists as Gatekeepers ==
Journalists are called gatekeepers because they decide what is and what isn't news.
Only some news gets through the gate.

=== News Factors ===
* Timeliness
* Prominence
* Proximity
* Significance
* Conflict
* Time of day
* The Medium
* Management
* Advertisers
* News sources
* Personal values

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Broadcast vs. Print News ==
Broadcast news is...
* meant to be heard
* limited by time
* shorter in length
* present tense
* simpler words
* conversational lead
* diamond style

While print news is
* meant to be read
* limited by space
* longer in length
* past tense
* broad vocabulary
* 5 Ws and an H
* inverted pyramid

Print news uses the inverted pyramid style...
	
Broadcast news uses the diamond style ...

Print News Lede
	(The Woods)  Red R. Hood, a young girl from The Woods, cleverly escaped serious injury yesterday afternoon when she was approached by a transvestite wolf while on her way to her grandmother‚Äôs house, according to sources close to the family.

Broadcast News Ledes
* Summary lead
&quot;A small girl cleverly escaped injury today when she met a wolf in the woods north of town.&quot;
* Teaser lead
&quot;It was a close call in the woods today.&quot;
* Question lead
&quot;Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?&quot;
* Staccato lead
&quot;A girl...a wolf...and a lucky escape.&quot;

== Writing for the ear ==

The KISS rule:  Keep it...
* Short
* Simple

The AAA rule: write news that is...
* Attention-getting
* Audience-centered
* Action-focused

Prefer active over passive voice
&quot;A wolf scares a little girl.&quot; (active)
&quot;The girl was scared by the wolf.&quot; (passive) 

Timeliness -- use the present tense

Says is our friend

Say titles before names

Practice strategic redundancy; repeat important facts without sounding dull

Make sure the meaning is clear:
&quot;Police found two pounds of heroin in a large woman's handbag.&quot;

Be careful of homonyms:
&quot;Ninety were killed by Ebola virus.&quot;
&quot;Ninety were killed by a bowl of iris.&quot;

Use round numbers when possible.

Don't overuse pronouns; repeat names.

== Fang's Easy Listening Formula ==
An easy to remember guideline for broadcast news writing is Fang's ELF:

Count all syllables over 1 per word in each sentence
 	
A good guideline for broadcast news writers is to keep the average Fang ELF below 10.  
Higher values are harder to read and harder to listen to.

Professor Thompsen hopes you get a good grade on the next quiz.
(Fang ELF value is 3.)

Professor Thompsen also sincerely wishes you achieve maximum success in a broadcasting career.
(Fang ELF value is 14.)

== Reading News Scripts ==
Anchors must read news scripts that typically contain abbreviations &amp; cues like:
* SLUG (brief story title)
* TRT (total running time)
* SOT (sound on tape)
* VO (voice over)
* CG (character generator)
* SUPER (superimposed)
* IN or INQ (in-cue, first words of a sound bite or package) 
* OUT or OUTQ (out-cue, or last words)
* LS (long shot)
* TS (tight shot)
* CU (close-up)
* XCU (extreme close-up)
* OS (over-the-shoulder)
* RS (reverse shot).

===Prescriptions===
Before you choose to do anything, ask me if your choice is in accord with mine. If you are sure that it is, there will be no fear.
----
Focus your mind only on this:
:''I am not alone, and I would not intrude the past upon my Guest.
:''I have invited Him, and He is here.
:''I need do nothing except not to interfere.
:16 - 1 - 3
----
You can do much on behalf of your own healing and that of others if, in a situation calling for help, you think of it this way:
:''I am here only to be truly helpful.
:''I am here to represent him who sent me.
:''I do not have to worry about what to say or what to do, because he who sent me will direct me.
:''I am content to be wherever he wishes, knowing he goes there with me.
:''I will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal. 
: C2S6
----
You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if you remember this:
:''Spirit is in a state of grace forever.
:''Your reality is only spirit.
:''Therefore you are in a state of grace forever.
:C1S3P5
----
In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds along these lines:
:''Perfect love casts out fear.
:''If fear exists,
:''Then there is not perfect love.
But:
:''Only perfect love exists.
:''If there is fear,
:''It produces a state that does not exist.
Believe this and you will be free. Only God can establish this solution, and this faith is his gift. C1S6P5
----
If you perceive injustice anywhere, you need but say: 
:''By this do I deny the Presence of the Father and the Son.
:''And I would rather know of Them than see injustice,
:''which Their Presence shines away.
: 26, 10, last
----

Whenever you are tempted to undertake a useless journey that would lead away from light, remember what you really want, and say:

:''The Holy Spirit leads me unto Christ, and where else would I go?
:''What need have I but to awake in him?
:13 - 8 - 4th to last...
----
In preparing for the holy instant, do not attempt to make yourself holy to be ready to receive it. That is but to confuse your role with God's. Atonement cannot come to those who think that they must first atone, but only to those who offer it nothing more than simple willingness to make way for it. Purification is of God alone, and therefore for you. Rather than seek to prepare yourself for him, try to think thus:

:''I who am host to God am worthy of him.
:''He who established His dwelling place in me
:''created it as he would have it be.
:''It is not needful that I make it ready for him,
:''but only that I do not interfere with his plan to restore to me my own awareness of my readiness, 
:''which is eternal.
:''I need add nothing to his plan.
:''But to receive it, I must be willing not to substitute my own in place of it. 
:18,4,4
----

This is the only thing that you need do for vision, happiness, release from pain and the complete escape from sin, all to be given you. Say only this, but mean it with no reservations, for here the power of salvation lies:

:''I am responsible for what I see.

I choose the feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked. Deceive yourself no longer that you are helpless in the face of what is done to you. Acknowledge but that you have been mistaken, and all effects of your mistakes will disappear. 21,3,2-3

===References to the bible===
====Chapter 4====
=====Section 1=====
The Bible says that you should go with a brother twice as far as he asks. It certainly does not suggest that you set him back on his journey. 4-1-...


====Chapter 6====
As I have said before, &quot;As you teach so shall you learn.&quot; If you react as if you are persecuted, you are teaching persecution. This is not a lesson a Son of God should want to teach if he is to realize his own salvation. Rather, teach your own perfect immunity, which is the truth in you, and realize that it cannot be assailed. 6-2-6

These are some of the examples of upside-down thinking in the New Testament, although its gospel is really only the message of love. If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could have quoted me as saying, &quot;I come not to bring peace but a sword. &quot;This is clearly the opposite of everything I taught. Nor could they have described my reactions to Judas as they did, if they had really understood me. I could not have said, &quot;Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? &quot; unless I believed in betrayal. The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did not. The &quot;punishment&quot; I was said to have called forth upon Judas was a similar mistake. Judas was my brother and a Son of God, as much a part of the Sonship as myself. Was it likely that I would condemn him when I was ready to demonstrate that condemnation is impossible? 6-2-~10

===Statements===
The greatest obstacle that peace must flow across has not yet gone. 29,1,3

===On multipe topics===
====Secret attack, beliefs, recognizing, will of peace, the nature of God====
Beliefs will never openly attack each other because conflicting outcomes are impossible. But an unrecognized belief is a decision to war in secret, where the results of conflict are kept unknown and never brought to reason, to be considered sensible or not. And many senseless outcomes have been reached, and meaningless decisions have been made and kept hidden, to become beliefs now given power to direct all subsequent decisions. Mistake you not the power of these hidden warriors to disrupt your peace. For it is at their mercy while you decide to leave it there. The secret enemies of peace, your least decision to choose attack instead of love, unrecognized and swift to challenge you to combat and to violence far more inclusive than you think, are there by your election. Do not deny their presence nor their terrible results. All that can be denied is their reality, but not their outcome.

All that is ever cherished as a hidden belief, to be defended though unrecognized, is faith in specialness. This takes many forms, but always clashes with the reality of God's creation and with the grandeur that He gave His Son. What else could justify attack? For who could hate someone whose Self is his, and Whom he knows? Only the special could have enemies, for they are different and not the same. And difference of any kind imposes orders of reality, and a need to judge that cannot be escaped.

What God created cannot be attacked, for there is nothing in the universe unlike itself. But what is different calls for judgment, and this must come from someone &quot;better,&quot; someone incapable of being like what he condemns, &quot;above&quot; it, sinless by comparison with it. And thus does specialness become a means and end at once. For specialness not only sets apart, but serves as grounds from which attack on those who seem &quot;beneath&quot; the special one is &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;just. &quot;The special ones feel weak and frail because of differences, for what would make them special is their enemy. Yet they protect its enmity and call it &quot;friend. &quot;On its behalf they fight against the universe, for nothing in the world they value more. 24,2,3-5</text>

{{fsharpTitle|Discriminated Unions}}

'''Discriminated unions''', also called '''tagged unions''', represent a finite, well-defined set of choices. Discriminated unions are often the tool of choice for building up more complicated data structures including linked lists and a wide range of trees.

== Creating Discriminated Unions ==

Discriminated unions are defined using the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type unionName =
    | Case1
    | Case2 of datatype
    | ...
&lt;/source&gt;
By convention, union names start with a lowercase character, and union cases are written in PascalCase.

== Union basics: an On/Off switch ==

Let's say we have a light switch. For most of us, a light switch has two possible states: the light switch can be ON, or it can be OFF. We can use an F# union to model our light switch's state as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type switchstate =
    | On
    | Off&lt;/source&gt;

We've defined a union called &lt;code&gt;switchstate&lt;/code&gt; which has two cases, &lt;code&gt;On&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt;. You can create and uses instances of &lt;code&gt;switchstate&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type switchstate =
    | On
    | Off
    
let x = On    (* creates an instance of switchstate *)
let y = Off   (* creates another instance of switchstate *)
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;x: %A&quot; x
    printfn &quot;y: %A&quot; y
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type switchstate = On | Off
val x : switchstate
val y : switchstate&lt;/source&gt;

It outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;x: On
y: Off&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that we create an instance of &lt;code&gt;switchstate&lt;/code&gt; simply by using the name of its cases; this is because, in a literal sense, the cases of a union are constructors. As you may have guessed, since we use the same syntax for constructing objects as for matching them, we can pattern match on unions in the following way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type switchstate =
    | On
    | Off
    
let toggle = function  (* pattern matching input *)
    | On -&gt; Off
    | Off -&gt; On
    
let main() =
    let x = On
    let y = Off
    let z = toggle y
    
    printfn &quot;x: %A&quot; x
    printfn &quot;y: %A&quot; y
    printfn &quot;z: %A&quot; z
    printfn &quot;toggle z: %A&quot; (toggle z)
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;
The function &lt;code&gt;toggle&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;val toggle : switchstate -&gt; switchstate&lt;/code&gt;.

This program has the following output:
&lt;pre&gt;x: On
y: Off
z: On
toggle z: Off&lt;/pre&gt;

== Holding Data In Unions: a dimmer switch ==
The example above is kept deliberately simple. In fact, in many ways, the discriminated union defined above doesn't appear much different from an enum value. However, let's say we wanted change our light switch model into a model of a dimmer switch, or in other words a light switch that allow users to adjust a lightbulb's power output from 0% to 100% power.

We can modify our union above to accommodate three possible states: On, Off, and an adjustable value between 0 and 100:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type switchstate =
    | On
    | Off
    | Adjustable of float&lt;/source&gt;
We've added a new case, &lt;code&gt;Adjustable of float&lt;/code&gt;. This case is fundamentally the same as the others, except it takes a single &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; value in its constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System

type switchstate =
    | On
    | Off
    | Adjustable of float
    
let toggle = function
    | On -&gt; Off
    | Off -&gt; On
    | Adjustable(brightness) -&gt;
        (* Matches any switchstate of type Adjustable. Binds
        the value passed into the constructor to the variable
        'brightness'. Toggles dimness around the halfway point. *)
        let pivot = 0.5
        if brightness &lt;= pivot then
            Adjustable(brightness + pivot)
        else
            Adjustable(brightness - pivot)

let main() =
    let x = On
    let y = Off
    let z = Adjustable(0.25) (* takes a float in constructor *)
    
    printfn &quot;x: %A&quot; x
    printfn &quot;y: %A&quot; y
    printfn &quot;z: %A&quot; z
    printfn &quot;toggle z: %A&quot; (toggle z)
    
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;x: On
y: Off
z: Adjustable 0.25
toggle z: Adjustable 0.75&lt;/pre&gt;

== Creating Trees ==
Discriminated unions can easily model a wide variety of trees and hierarchical data structures.

For example, let's consider the following binary tree:
&lt;pre&gt;
            /\
           /  \
          1   /\
             /  \
            2   /\
               /  \
              /\   3
             /  \
            4    5&lt;/pre&gt;
Each node of our tree contains exactly two branches, and each branch can either be a integer or another tree. We can represent this tree as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type tree =
    | Leaf of int
    | Node of tree * tree&lt;/source&gt;

We can create an instance of the tree above using the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type tree =
    | Leaf of int
    | Node of tree * tree
    
let simpleTree =
    Node(
        Leaf 1,
        Node(
            Leaf 2,
            Node(
                Node(
                    Leaf 4,
                    Leaf 5
                ),
                Leaf 3
            )
        )
    )
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;%A&quot; simpleTree
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;Node (Leaf 1,Node (Leaf 2,Node (Node (Leaf 4,Leaf 5),Leaf 3)))&lt;/pre&gt;

Very often, we want to recursively enumerate through all of the nodes in a tree structure. For example, if we wanted to count the total number of Leaf nodes in our tree, we can use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type tree =
    | Leaf of int
    | Node of tree * tree

let simpleTree =
    Node (Leaf 1, Node (Leaf 2, Node (Node (Leaf 4, Leaf 5), Leaf 3)))
    
let countLeaves tree =
    let rec loop sum = function
        | Leaf(_) -&gt; sum + 1
        | Node(tree1, tree2) -&gt;
            sum + (loop 0 tree1) + (loop 0 tree2)
    loop 0 tree
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;countLeaves simpleTree: %i&quot; (countLeaves simpleTree)
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;
This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;countLeaves simpleTree: 5&lt;/pre&gt;

== Generalizing Unions For All Datatypes ==
Note that our binary tree above only operates on integers. Its possible to construct unions which are generalized to operate on all possible data types. We can modify the definition of our union to the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a tree =
    | Leaf of 'a
    | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

(* The syntax above is &quot;OCaml&quot; style. It's common to see 
   unions defined using the &quot;.NET&quot; style as follows which
   surrounds the type parameter with &lt;'s and &gt;'s after the 
   type name:

type tree&lt;'a&gt; =
    | Leaf of 'a
    | Node of tree&lt;'a&gt; * tree&lt;'a&gt;
*)&lt;/source&gt;

We can use the union define above to define a binary tree of any data type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type 'a tree =
    | Leaf of 'a
    | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree  
    
let firstTree =
    Node(
        Leaf 1,
        Node(
            Leaf 2,
            Node(
                Node(
                    Leaf 4,
                    Leaf 5
                ),
                Leaf 3
            )
        )
    )
    
let secondTree = 
    Node(
        Node(
            Node(
                Leaf &quot;Red&quot;,
                Leaf &quot;Orange&quot;
            ),
            Node(
                Leaf &quot;Yellow&quot;,
                Leaf &quot;Green&quot;
            )
        ),
        Node(
            Leaf &quot;Blue&quot;,
            Leaf &quot;Violet&quot;
        )
    )
    
let prettyPrint tree =
    let rec loop depth tree =
        let spacer = new String(' ', depth)
        match tree with
        | Leaf(value) -&gt;        
            printfn &quot;%s |- %A&quot; spacer value
        | Node(tree1, tree2) -&gt;
            printfn &quot;%s |&quot; spacer
            loop (depth + 1) tree1
            loop (depth + 1) tree2
    loop 0 tree
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;firstTree:&quot;
    prettyPrint firstTree
    
    printfn &quot;secondTree:&quot;
    prettyPrint secondTree
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

The functions above have the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a tree =
    | Leaf of 'a
    | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

val firstTree : int tree
val secondTree : string tree
val prettyPrint : 'a tree -&gt; unit&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;
firstTree:
 |
  |- 1
  |
   |- 2
   |
    |
     |- 4
     |- 5
    |- 3
secondTree:
 |
  |
   |
    |- &quot;Red&quot;
    |- &quot;Orange&quot;
   |
    |- &quot;Yellow&quot;
    |- &quot;Green&quot;
  |
   |- &quot;Blue&quot;
   |- &quot;Violet&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Built-in Union Types ===
F# has several built-in types derived from discriminated unions, some of which have already been introduced in this tutorial. These types include:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a list = 
    | Cons of 'a * 'a list
    | Nil

type 'a option =
    | Some of 'a
    | None&lt;/source&gt;

=== Propositional Logic ===
The ML family of languages, which includes F# and its parent language OCaml, were originally designed for the development of automated theorem provers. Union types allow F# programmers to represent propositional logic remarkably concisely. To keep things simple, lets limit our propositions to four possible cases:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type proposition =
    | True
    | Not of proposition
    | And of proposition * proposition
    | Or of proposition * proposition&lt;/source&gt;


Let's say we had a series of propositions and wanted to determine whether they evaluate to true or false. We can easily write an eval function by recursively enumerating through a propositional statement as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec eval = function
    | True -&gt; true
    | Not(prop) -&gt; not (eval(prop))
    | And(prop1, prop2) -&gt; eval(prop1) &amp;&amp; eval(prop2)
    | Or(prop1, prop2) -&gt; eval(prop1) || eval(prop2)&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; function has the type &lt;code&gt;val eval : proposition -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;.

Here is a full program using the eval function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System
 
type proposition =
    | True
    | Not of proposition
    | And of proposition * proposition
    | Or of proposition * proposition
 
let prop1 =
    (* ~t || ~~t *)
    Or(
        Not True,
        Not (Not True)
    )
 
let prop2 =
    (* ~(t &amp;&amp; ~t) || ( (t || t) || ~t) *)
    Or(
        Not(
            And(
                True,
                Not True
            )
        ),
        Or(
            Or(
                True,
                True
            ),
            Not True
        )
    )
 
let prop3 = 
    (* ~~~~~~~t *)
    Not(Not(Not(Not(Not(Not(Not True))))))
 
let rec eval = function
    | True -&gt; true
    | Not(prop) -&gt; not (eval(prop))
    | And(prop1, prop2) -&gt; eval(prop1) &amp;&amp; eval(prop2)
    | Or(prop1, prop2) -&gt; eval(prop1) || eval(prop2)
 
let main() =
    let testProp name prop = printfn &quot;%s: %b&quot; name (eval prop)
    
    testProp &quot;prop1&quot; prop1
    testProp &quot;prop2&quot; prop2
    testProp &quot;prop3&quot; prop3
 
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
 
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;prop1: true
prop2: true
prop3: false&lt;/pre&gt;
